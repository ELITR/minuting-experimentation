abstract: the marketing expert is first to present , and he talks about making a pleasant-looking device , particularly one that favors current trends .
abstract: they then begin talking about using a fruit , vegetable , or natural object as the shape of the remote , the logo , or for the buttons .
abstract: eventually they decide to make the device the shape of a banana .
abstract: next , the user interface specialist presents .
abstract: he annouces that the technology division of their company has developed an integrated programmeable sample speaker unit , which would allow a person to have a conversation with the remote control .
abstract: they have the option of using that technology .
abstract: he shows them his plan what the remote control could look like and the features it might have .
abstract: he suggests putting two scroll wheels- one for changing the channel and another for the volume .
abstract: he also included a turbo button for speed , which he thinks every design should have .
abstract: since they can only charge twenty-five euro they decide to eliminate the lcd screen idea .
abstract: after that the interface specialist talks about having a base station for the purpose of finding the remote control when lost .
abstract: lastly , the industrial designer presents , discussing the power source of the remote control .
abstract: he suggests that they could have one of two kinds of power supplies- the usual batteries or rechargable ones if there is to be a base station and they could place solar cells on top for times when the lighting is good .
abstract: he talks about using plastic with elasticity so that the remote would not break into pieces if it fell , which relates to their earlier discussion about giving it a spongy design .
abstract: plastic is also less costly than other options of wood or titanum .
abstract: in addition , he talks about giving the control a double curve , curves on both the sides so that it is easy to hold and handle .
abstract: they do not yet seem set about the idea of making it a banana shape , and one group member feels that the shape is not handy .
abstract: the industrial desiger tells them they will use a regular chip rather than the advanced one since pricing is a factor .
abstract: they agree on having base station with the remote .
abstract: they go on to have discussion , with one member suggesting that they make the banana more stylized so that it looks less like a banana- for example , it could be silver .
abstract: after that the project manager has them discuss / reiterate the decisions made during the meeting: no lcd screen , the remote will have a base station , a rf for beeping , a button on the base station to press , possibly a stylish banana-shape for the control , 2 scroll wheels to control the volume and channels at the thumb level , a turbo button perhaps underneath the device , on / off button for the tv .
action: before the next meeting , the interface specialist and industrial designer have to work together on the user interface and the look / feel design .
action: the marketing expert has to look up product evaluation .
decisions: thus far , lcd and asr have been ruled out .
decisions: the remote will have a base station , a button on the base station to press , 2 scroll wheels for the channels and volume , a turbo button ( possibly underneath the device ) , and an on / off button for the tv .
problems: the group has not yet agreed on whether the remote should be banana-shaped .
problems: there is concern that the shape is not handy and might make the product less marketable- that would be a problem since they have to meet the fifty million euros profit goal .
abstract: the project manager goes through the minutes of the last meeting .
abstract: they have the prototype presentation and talk about the final design , features , and power source , type of chip and weight of the remote .
abstract: they go through the evaulations , using the a list of criteria made by the marketing expert .
abstract: they rate each criteria on a scale of 0 ( true ) to 7 ( false ) : how fancy it is , how handy it is , how functional , how cool it is , whether they would spend twenty five euro for it , and whether they would change their current remote for this one .
abstract: next they do a cost estimate for production .
abstract: in doing this , they decide against solar cells and go with the rechargable batteries .
abstract: they keep the regular chip , stick with plastic , put two scroll wheels and three push buttons , and make it a special shade of yellow .
abstract: they eliminate the turbo button and give the remote a single curve because of budget restrictions .
abstract: they briefly evaulate the project process and close the meeting .
decisions: it will be shaped like a banana , with an base station resembling a banana leaf for it to sit on .
decisions: the volume scroll wheel will be on the left , channel scroll on the right .
decisions: will contain a teletext button , when pressed teletext appears and channel selector can be used to navigate through the teletext .
decisions: infared port on top of banana as well as bottom front of base station .
decisions: weight of an actual banana but a special shade of yellow .
decisions: for pricing reasons eliminate solar cells - use rechargable batteries as power source , base station used for battery-charging which should last 8-10 hours depending on frequency of use .
decisions: for pricing reasons they will use a regular chip for the control rather than advanced one .
decisions: for pricing reasons the remote will have a single , not double curve .
problems: for pricing reasons they had to use a regular chip instead of advanced , single curve instead of double , rechargable batteries instead of solar cells , and eliminate the turbo button .

abstract: the project manager informed the group of the budget , before beginning the discussion of current remotes and initial ideas .
abstract: they considered taking the best of their competitors designs and making a multifunction remote .
abstract: it needs to be useable internationally , with few buttons .
abstract: the considered options for the shape of the remote control , imagining how it would fit in the hand .
abstract: the group ended the discussion by touching very briefly on some materials issues , and discussed remote covers .
action: individual must come up with their ideas for the next meeting .
action: the interface specialist will look at button and over all look .
decisions: specific ideas as to components and materials are to be left to the next meeting .
decisions: they will look further at the idea of covers in the mext meeting too .
abstract: there are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for tv only , they should ignore the teletext function , as it is dated , and , also , the remote should be recognisable as a real reaction product .
abstract: the target group will be people below 30 .
abstract: it transpires that customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes , especially if they include lcd screens and speech recognition .
abstract: functions like zapping are very prevalent , as well as complaints about remotes being difficult to learn and easy to lose .
abstract: the function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip , and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver ( the tv ) via infrared .
abstract: the team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons .
abstract: they plan to include an lcd screen to display relevant information .
abstract: other functions are served by push buttons: ok , menu , screen sizing , av , settings buttons , mute , digits 1-9 , power , volume control , channel up / down with the last three types being prominent on the device .
abstract: the exact design and placement of the components will be decided in the next meeting .
action: each member of the team will come for the next meeting with their views on function and design issues that they had not time to consolidate during this meeting .
decisions: the solution to complaints about remote controls being difficult to learn is to focus on an intuitive design instead of a thorough manual .
decisions: the idea of interchangeable fronts was mentioned again ; if it were adopted , the company should be recognisable in all the available fronts as well as the remote itself .
decisions: the team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons .
decisions: an lcd screen is going to be used to display information , but would not be interactive .
decisions: the buttons are going to include: ok , menu , screen sizing , av , settings buttons , mute , digits 1-9 , power , volume control , channel up / down .
decisions: there is no need for a special button to recognise two-digit numbers .
decisions: the less frequently used buttons will not be hidden under a flip , as it had been previously suggested , as there are not that many of them ; they will just be clearly separated from the more important ones .
problems: a discussion on ergonomic solutions like placing the main buttons ( power , channel selection , volume ) where they can be easily reached with the thumb ( as many users complain of rsi ) , did not reach a conclusion as to whether this would actually cause more repetitive movements .
problems: some advanced features , like lcd screen with program information or speech recognition , would be very important in order to attract their target group , but there are costing issues that have not been clarified yet .
problems: there was some disagreement as to whether the lcd screen should be placed at the top or the bottom of the remote .
problems: no consensus was reached regarding the positioning of the main buttons ( zapping , volume , power ) either: should they be placed close together or more scattered ( to avoid rsi complaints ) ?
problems: a special av button for direct access to the video channel , although its necessity was disputed , because there are alternative solutions that make it obsolete .
abstract: for the conceptual design , the marketing expert talked about the public 's preference for looks and texture over technological innovation ; however , they both seem to be more important than ease of use .
abstract: the current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote .
abstract: materials also need to be strong: the marketing expert suggested an iron-plate or titanium front .
abstract: the industrial designer suggested they use rubber push buttons ( and no scroll wheel ) , simple battery ( instead of solar cells or kinetic dynamo ) , and advanced chip .
abstract: speech recognition can be implemented , but it does not link speech commands to remote control actions .
abstract: he also advised that the users within the target group prefer primary colours , soft textures and curved shapes .
abstract: the team drew a provisional prototype .
abstract: they placed the lcd below the buttons .
abstract: if it is implemented , a recording button , microphone and speaker need to be included in the design .
abstract: finally , they decided to have a titanium case with plastic front and the company logo and slogan engraved .
abstract: packages with a variety of changeable fronts will be launched .
action: the industrial designer and the user interface designer will work on a drawing of a prototype , where they will also sort out the details about the buttons .
action: the marketing expert will carry out an evaluation of the product .
decisions: the push buttons are going to be made of rubber .
decisions: the chip needs to be an advanced one to be compatible with the lcd screen that is going to be incorporated in the design .
decisions: making changeable fascias can allow for the integration of this or future fashion trends in the device .
decisions: the team agreed to place the lcd at the bottom of the device , below the buttons .
decisions: tv settings will be included in menus there instead of having separate buttons for them .
decisions: they will implement speech recognition as well , because their target group like such gimmicks .
decisions: the case will be titanium with a plastic front with rounded buttons .
decisions: parts of the front ( like the bottom where the lcd is and the top corner where the logo is ) will also be titanium .
decisions: the chip is going to be a standard one .
decisions: they will launch the product with various fronts to choose from including a couple of basic colours or fruit and vegetable themes to go with the current fashion .
decisions: the logo will be both at the front and the back of the remote ; the company slogan will be engraved at the back .
problems: the team found a possible conflict between the need for strong materials and the customers ' preference for soft textures .
problems: plastic may be strong , but it does not necessarily look it .
problems: the version of speech recognition discussed does not link voice commands to actual device actions .
problems: changing the front colours may make the front clash with the titanium , but it was also thought neutral enough for it not to matter .
problems: they wondered whether to use both the logo and the slogan on the device and where it would be best for them to be placed .
abstract: it is rounded , with the front made of hard plastic in different colours .
abstract: the back , as well as the lower part of the front are made of titanium .
abstract: the back has the logo and slogan of the company engraved in its middle .
abstract: the buttons include oval digit buttons , arrow-shaped channel and volume controls in the middle ; below those , is the menu ( for the lcd ) and the video button .
abstract: the lcd can be found at the lower section of the device .
abstract: after the presentation , the product was evaluated .
abstract: this was done on a scale of 1 ( excellent ) -7 ( very bad ) on fancifulness , ease of use , finding the device when it is lost , hi-tech features , incorporation of fashion trends , and ergonomic design .
abstract: because it was over budget , titanium was replaced by plastic and the speech recognition was discarded .
abstract: finally , the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity ( generally satisfied ) , leadership ( the process was democratic , not happy with management ) , teamwork ( happy with it ) , and means ( smartboard was ' a disaster ' and the digital pens only good for drawings ) .
decisions: despite disagreement regarding the position of the lcd ( top or bottom ) , the screen was left at the bottom as it was in the prototype .
decisions: the sample speaker was taken out to bring the cost of the prototype down to the original budget of 12 . 50 euros .
decisions: they also decided to replace titanium with similar-looking plastic for the same reason .
problems: there was criticism for the shape of the remote ( thicker at the ends , thinner at the middle ) .
problems: the project manager still disagreed on the position of the lc he would prefer it to be at the top .
problems: the total cost of the prototype was 18 . 6 euros .
problems: the only way was to go to a regular chip , but that would mean losing the lcd screen , which was integral to the design .
problems: replacing the titanium with plastic would have a detrimental effect on the looks of the remote .
problems: the team discussed the possibility to leave the remaining cost at 14 . 10 .
problems: the smartboard was considered a disaster as they could not draw , and the digital pens can only be useful for drawings .
problems: some people thought that there was no advantage to using the smartboard instead of a normal blackboard and chalk , although you can save and reuse things with the former .
abstract: for the first meeting , the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings .
abstract: the group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform .
abstract: they discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls , including ease of use , multiple systems and power indicators .
abstract: they then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote .
abstract: they would like the remote to be durable , for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries .
abstract: the project manager opened the meeting by explaining how to locate his minutes from the previous meeting .
abstract: the industrial designer briefly explained the internal workings of the remote , and mentioned his preferences for power source and case material .
abstract: he also suggested mobile phone-like changeable covers , and the group discussed the profit in this .
abstract: the user interface designer very briefly mentioned some features a remote should have and suggested it should be multifunctional .
abstract: the marketing expert present the findings of the usability study .
abstract: the group then discussed their target group , and what features they might include to attract them .
abstract: the manager introduced new requirements to the project , insisting they were to be followed .
abstract: the group then discussed what buttons they might need , which included menu , numbers , channel and volume changing arrows and mute .
action: the design of the remote control is to be carried out at the next meeting .
action: individual actions for the next meeeting can be found in emails to be sent .
decisions: the buttons will consist of number , a menu button , arrows for changing channel and volume , but also navigating the menu , and a mute button .
abstract: the industrial designer gave a presentation on the interface concept , discussing which buttons will be needed and then looking at some examples of existing remote controls .
abstract: he suggested using a yellow case with rounded edges and the logo at the bottom , and large , clearly marked buttons .
abstract: the interface expert informed the group that young people like curved shapes , soft materials and primary colours , and suggested making a hand-shaped remote in plastic and rubber .
abstract: he talked about the possibility of using a scroll button , and the different chips which could be used .
abstract: the group discussed using an lcd screen , but did not have enough information about costs to make a decision .
abstract: the marketing expert talked about new trends , including the trends for spongy materials and fruit and vegetable themed products .
abstract: the group had a discussion and decided to create two designs , one with an lcd screen and one without , and the interface designer drew them on the board .
abstract: they put off making a final decision about using an lcd screen , scroll buttons and a menu button until they could find out about costs .
action: the interface designer will find out how much an lcd screen will cost .
action: the industrial designer and user interface designer will stay in the room to design the prototypes .
decisions: the remote will use a normal battery .
decisions: the case will be made of hard plastic and rubber .
problems: whether to use an lcd screen or not .
problems: there was a lack of information about the cost of an lcd screen .
problems: if they can use a menu on the tv screen if the remote does not have an lcd .
problems: whether to have a trigger-shaped power button .
problems: whether to use a joystick rather than a scroll button to navigate the menu .
abstract: the industrial designer and user interface designer presented their prototype design , made of yellow rubber and hard plastic , with large , mostly blue buttons , a joystick and lcd screen .
abstract: led by the marketing expert , the group evaluated the prototype on a scale of one to seven , based on a set of evaluation criteria .
abstract: the overall rating was two .
abstract: the project manager calculated the production costs , which were too high at fifteen euros .
abstract: the group discussed how to make the design cheaper , and decided to keep the lcd screen , but to remove the special colour and replace the joystick with regular push-buttons .
abstract: finally the project manager led an evaluation of the project process before closing the meeting .
abstract: overall , the group were satisfied with the creativity , teamwork and available equipment , although the marketing expert thought the smartboard and laptops were sometimes distracting and not that helpful .
decisions: the remote will have an lcd screen .
decisions: the remote will have regular push-buttons instead of a joystick .
decisions: the remote will be a normal colour rather than a special colour .
problems: there was some confusion about the agenda .
problems: the production costs of the initial design came to fifteen euros , so the design had to be changed .
problems: which features should be removed or changed .
problems: which chip would be needed for the revised design .
abstract: the project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project , describing what the project would involve , the role of each participant and the agenda for the first meeting .
abstract: he the demonstrated the equipment the group would be using , and the group practiced using the smartboard by drawing their favourite animals .
abstract: the project manager then went over the project budget .
abstract: the industrial designer gave a brief presentation about his role and his initial ideas for the project , suggesting that the remote should be used for multiple devices and that the group should consider using bluetooth rather than infrared .
abstract: the project manager then asked the others about their initial ideas .
abstract: the user interface designer agreed that the remote should control multiple devices .
abstract: they also discussed having glow in the dark buttons , using bluetooth instead of infrared and using a display and / or a joystick instead of conventional buttons .
abstract: however , they were unsure about what the budget would allow .
abstract: the project manager suggested that the remote should be rechargeable or not use much power , but this might be difficult if using bluetooth .
abstract: the project manager closed the meeting .
action: each member of the group will work on their individual tasks .
action: they will receive information from their personal coaches .
decisions: the group will design a trendy , original and user-friendly remote control .

decisions: the remote will be sold internationally .
decisions: the production costs should be no more than 12 . 50 euros .
decisions: the remote will control multiple devices .
decisions: the remote will be sold directly to individual consumers rather than companies .
problems: the group were unsure about whether they would be selling their product directly to consumers or to electronics manufacturers .
problems: it was felt that the low production costs would not allow them to create a trendy high-end product .
problems: whether using glow in the dark buttons and bluetooth would mean that the remote consumes too much energy .
abstract: there are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for tv only , they should ignore the teletext function , as it is dated , and , also , the remote should be recognisable as a real reaction product .
abstract: the target group will be people below 40 .
abstract: the ui preferred an easy-to-use remote to a multi-function one .
abstract: the function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip , and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver ( the tv ) via infrared .
abstract: the use of infrared , energy-efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested .
abstract: the remote could light up via led 's placed inside .
abstract: functions like zapping are very prevalent , as well as complaints about remotes being easy to lose .
abstract: it also transpires that customers like innovative technology like speech recognition .
abstract: the functions of the remote will include a back button to switch between two channels , volume , program selection , and speech recognition , with a focus on simplicity of design .
action: the industrial designer will look into what would be an appropriate technology to help users find their remote , when it is lost .
action: the project manager will add the minutes into the project folder .
action: the id will present the components concept .
action: the ui will present the user interface concept .
action: the marketing expert will need to find information on current trends .
decisions: led 's can be used to light up the remote .
decisions: using them sparsely , as in mobile phones , could bring down the cost .
decisions: it would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control , when the user loses it .
decisions: the latter would be preferable to implementing a backlight into the remote .
decisions: a single , large , round button can be used for both volume and channel selection by using the four separate quadrants .
decisions: the remote will also include volume and program selection , and speech recognition .
decisions: a recharging cradle can be added to compensate for the extra energy consumption .
problems: led 's would signify extra energy consumption .
problems: power-saving led 's are available , but these could be more expensive .
problems: it 's difficult to choose a technique to find a lost remote .
problems: they can not install a special button on a tv , and using a special signal , like clapping , is tricky , because it needs to be differentiated from normal sounds .
problems: similarly , using an extra base station would probably be too costly .
problems: adding such features may complicate the design and escalate costs .
problems: there was a challenge regarding the need of the digit channels , based on the fact that they are not often used , and they also look dull .
problems: despite that , customers may want them to be on a remote ; furthermore , they can be designed in a more attractive way .
problems: the discussion also focused on their replacement with speech recognition , as the latter helps with locating the remote as well .
problems: however , this solution may prove too expensive .
problems: an expanded target group may have to be taken into account in order to achieve the projected sales and profits .
abstract: for the conceptual design , the marketing expert talked about the public 's preference for looks over technological innovation ; however , they both seem to be more important than ease of use .
abstract: the current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes and spongy materials: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote , and could also provide themes for other target groups .
abstract: they could also add some rubber to provide easy grip of the device .
abstract: cases can be flat , single- or double-curved .
abstract: they can be made of plastic , rubber , wood or titanium .
abstract: hand or kinetic dynamos , batteries , and solar cells can be used as energy sources .
abstract: possible interfaces are push buttons , scroll wheels , and lcds . a way to make this device different would be to use a scroll-wheel on the side with integrated button for volume control and mute .
abstract: speech recognition can be implemented by adding a sample sensor and speaker on the remote .
abstract: the final decisions also included combined battery with solar cells .
abstract: the team will design a single-curved device with a scroll wheel and speech recognition , in black and yellow , the company colours .
action: the industrial designer and the user interface designer will work on a drawing of a prototype .
action: they will also try to find a way to promote the corporate identity in the design of the look and feel and interface .
action: the id and ui will also have to figure out whether to use rubber just for the buttons and side finish , or for the whole front of the remote .
action: the marketing expert will carry out a product evaluation .
decisions: changeable covers for the remote control can link the product to current fashion trends , but also trends followed by other age groups .
decisions: a scroll wheel will be included in the design .
decisions: a single-curved rubber casing can also be used .
decisions: lcd is not going to be implemented .
decisions: the preferred energy source was a combination of batteries and solar cells .
problems: it is not clear whether a kinetic dynamo can be used , because it is unlikely that a user shakes the remote enough , as one would do with similarly powered watches .
problems: the use of a scroll wheel with integrated button was debated , as not everyone was convinced of its use for this project .
problems: using the speech recognition on the device may not be convenient , since the remote will have to pointing towards the tv at the same time for the infrared to work .
problems: lcd screens may add an extra hi-tech touch , but given all the other features , it might be too much .
problems: the company colours ( grey and yellow and black ) did not seem sufficiently bright and trendy to everyone .
problems: printing an image on the remote to make it more colourful is doable , but can not be done by the manufacturing department .
problems: the front could have a rubber finish , or the buttons will be made of rubber .
problems: it was debated that customers may prefer a total spongy texture , not just in the buttons and the sides of the remote .
abstract: it can be used as a normal remote , but the speech recognition also provides a more advanced alternative interface .
abstract: the speech recognition works as a finding mechanism as well .
abstract: the rubber case is yellow with grey or black , with buttons either made of plastic or rubber .
abstract: an extra button could activate / deactivate the voice recognition .
abstract: the prototype proved extremely over budget .
abstract: the main contributing factors were the solar cell and speech recognition .
abstract: one way to compensate for the loss of features , but still attract their target group , would be to add more colour to the design .
abstract: after the costing , the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1 ( excellent ) -7 ( very bad ) .
abstract: the criteria used were fancifulness ( 2 ) , technological innovation ( 2 ) , ease of use ( 2.5 ) , whether it is easy to find ( 1 ) , sponginess ( 1.5 ) , number of features ( 1 ) .
abstract: finally , the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity ( choices too narrow ) , leadership and teamwork ( happy with it , but they missed communicating in between meetings ) , and means ( smartboard was not satisfactory , but the digital pens were alright , but not too useful ) .
abstract: the delay in providing costs of components was criticised .
action: the prototype will have to be redesigned , so that it is compatible with the budget constraints . . 
decisions: the idea to include a solar cell as a power source had to be abandoned , due to the escalated costs .
decisions: the same happened with the speech recognition .
problems: the prototype proved extremely over budget .
problems: it would cost 22 euros .
problems: the team thought all the changes to accommodate the budget requirements made a very dull device .
problems: it was suggested that they go for a completely simple design so as to maximise the profit , although this was not what was asked in the project requirements .
problems: the device can not be a hi-tech , innovative one any more .
abstract: the goal of the project is to design an original , trendy and user-friendly remote control for tv .
abstract: the team comprises the project manager , the marketing expert , who is looking at user needs , the user interface designer , looking at usability , and the industrial designer , working on the engineering and materials .
abstract: the project will be completed with three further meetings: the following meeting concerns the functional design .
abstract: the project manager gave a quick overview of the equipment available .
abstract: the remote needs to be produced for 12 . 50 euros in order to be sold for double that amount .
abstract: the whole team tried out the smartboard , by drawing their favourite animals .
abstract: afterwards , they discussed briefly their first ideas , including the use of light materials and usability concerns .
decisions: the remote is just going to be for tv .
decisions: the design should generally be intuitive without changes that would render it an unfamiliar object to customers .
decisions: the team will also take into account possible usability issues concerning disabled people .
decisions: they also agreed to choose light materials .
abstract: customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes .
abstract: they like innovative technology like speech recognition and lcd screens .
abstract: it also transpires that remotes are easy to lose .
abstract: everyone agreed that they need to incorporate a locating mechanism in their design , and that changeable covers could make appealing-looking remotes .
abstract: the need for clarity of button functions was mentioned .
abstract: on the other hand , materials should be more durable .
abstract: the function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip , and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver ( the tv ) via infrared .
abstract: there are some new requirements: the target group will be people below 40 , the device will have to be for tv only , they should ignore the teletext function , and , also , the remote should be recognisable as a real reaction product .
abstract: they drew some of their ideas , and discussed the positioning of the buttons and the lcd .
abstract: the most used buttons are going to be placed on top .
abstract: it might be possible to use a charger for the remote .
action: the id will present the components concept .
action: he will also check into the importance and possibility of using rechargeable batteries and a charger .
action: he will also draw some ideas for the shape of the remote .
action: the marketing expert will need to find information on current trends and see into the financial issues concerning the integration of a charger .
action: the team will also examine whether they can use an lcd and / or speech recognition .
action: finally , they will try to think of a name for their product .
decisions: the target group will be people below 40 .
decisions: the company colours and slogan will have to be shown on the device .
decisions: buttons should be made bigger , with clearly defined functions and of durable materials to avoid fading of the symbols .
decisions: it would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control , when the user loses it .
decisions: a button that sticks on the tv could be pressed to make the lost remote beep , and perhaps also light up .
decisions: the remote is going to be a universal one .
decisions: because symbols may fade , the additional covers could include those .
decisions: the remote will need to be different from those available in the market in terms of shape and colour .
decisions: the important buttons will be on top .
problems: speech recognition and lcd screens could be added to the remote control , but they might be too expensive for this project .
problems: the industrial designer wondered whether the remote should be universal or programmable .
problems: symbols on remotes fade with time .
problems: it may not be technically possible for a universal remote control to create menus for various advanced settings on the tv itself .
problems: different tvs have different functions incorporated in their built-in menus , making it hard to know in advance which buttons you can do without on the remote .
problems: the team also discussed extensively the positioning of various buttons .
problems: using a charger for the remote may be too expensive .
problems: consumers claim they would pay more for a remote with lcd screen , but adding the component might be too expensive .
problems: in the case where it is added , the issue would be whether to place it at the top or the bottom of the remote .
abstract: the ui and id presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design .
abstract: the rubber case is yellow with black buttons and dark yellow for the menus .
abstract: there are buttons for teletext , favourite channel , mute and ok .
abstract: it incorporates both lcd screen and speech recognition .
abstract: the prototype proved over budget ( 17 euros ) .
abstract: the latter was taken out , along with the special colour .
abstract: everyone agreed that the financial information should not have been given to them at the last moment .
abstract: after the costing , the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1 ( excellent ) -7 ( very bad ) .
abstract: the criteria used were look and feel ( 1 ) , whether it is easy to find ( 1 ) , whether it is easy to learn ( 2 ) , use of lcd ( 3 ) , speech recognition ( 7 ) , trendiness ( 2 ) .
abstract: finally , the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity ( satisfactory ) , leadership and teamwork ( happy with it , but they missed communicating in between meetings ) , and means ( smartboard could be improved in terms of response time , the digital pens could not be used on more than one page at the same time ) .
action: the pm is going to finish the project report .
action: the ui and id will send him their design to include .
decisions: because the prototype was over budget , the team decided to take out the speech recognition from the design .
decisions: they also discarded the special colour , and decided to rely on the changeable covers for an attractive look .
problems: the production cost was 17 euros , 4.5 more than the budget .
problems: there was disagreement over whether the special colour should be scrapped and the look to rely on the separate covers .
problems: other solutions , like abandoning the curve of the casing or replace the rubber with plastic were also suggested .
problems: they were also not allowed to raise the budget limit .
problems: the precise use of the lcd was not defined: it could be used for tv configuration , or , if possible , for displaying the tv programme and previews .
problems: although the smartboard was useful to draw ideas quickly , it could be improved in terms of response time .
problems: similarly , the digital pens did not allow the user to work on more than one page at a time .
problems: the team were unable to communicate amongst themselves in between meetings , which hindered the flow of information .
abstract: two main options were discussed as to the organisation of the collected data .
abstract: on the one hand , a bespoke xml structure that connects transcriptions and annotations ( down to the word-level ) to a common timeline .
abstract: its advantages are that it is easier to read , parse , map onto the transcriber format and to expand with extra features .
abstract: phone-level analysis can be included in the same structure , or in a separate , linked file .
abstract: the respective frame-level representation can be handled by p-files , a technology developed at icsi , which also comes with a library of tools .
abstract: xml standards offer libraries that can be used for the development of search tools .
abstract: on the other hand , the atlas ( nist ) technology offers a very similar , but more generic organisational scheme based on nodes and links .
abstract: these are labeled with domain specific types , like `` utterance '' or `` speaker '' .
abstract: this option offer well-developed infrastructure and flexibility as to the type of data storage ( flat xml files or relational database ) .
abstract: in either case , it is important for the chosen format to allow for fast searches , flexible updates and , if possible , be reusable in future work .
decisions: in order to confirm the suitability of the data format provided by the atlas project , its current state of development will be investigated .
decisions: more specifically , the issues that have to be ascertained are , firstly , whether the external file representation offers a format that would be appropriate for speech data , and , secondly , how the linking between the different annotations ( eg , between word-level representations and prosodic-feature structures ) can be achieved .
decisions: regardless of the actual format , however , there was consensus that keeping levels of analysis ( words , phones , frames , etc ) on separate , inter-linked files can make their management easier .
problems: choosing a project-specific format for the representation of the data might not be optimal for future work .
problems: on the other hand , it is not yet clear whether a more standardised , but generic technology , like that of the atlas project , can accommodate all the requirements of speech analysis .
problems: regardless of the particular format , including all annotations ( sentences , words , phones , frames , etc ) in one file could result in unmanageable file sizes .
problems: even p-files , which are only for frame-level annotation , may be too verbose for the amount of data resulting from hour-long recordings .
problems: the actual mapping of word-level transcriptions to frame-level representations is expected to be problematic anyway .
problems: likewise , problems will arise if , in the future , slightly different transcripts of the same data are annotated in formats that do not include time-marks .
problems: trying to merge such annotations later will not be easy , because of the combination of transcription discrepancies with the loss of the underlying connection offered by the time-marks .
abstract: the initial task of the edu group is to work on inferring intentions through context .
abstract: in the navigational paradigm used for the task , these intentions are to `` see '' to `` enter '' or to `` get to the closest point of '' a building .
abstract: there will be purpose-designed experiments carried out .
abstract: however , the starting point is , through the use of existing data , to determine possible linguistic , discourse or situation features that define intentionality .
abstract: these may include the type of building , time of day , particular phrases used or whether the user is a tourist or a native .
abstract: initially , these features will be hand-coded , but the goal is to find ways of extracting them automatically from the xml data .
abstract: consequently , they will be fed into a belief-net -implemented on a software package like javabayes- and the conditional probability of each intention calculated .
abstract: a prototype system will be put together to test hypotheses regarding both the exact nature of the features and how intentions are derived from them .
decisions: inferring intentions in a navigational context is an appropriate task both in project and real-world terms .
decisions: its goals are clearly defined and contributre to a smarter system .
decisions: although there are some preliminary data to work on , task-specific experiments and recordings will take place .
decisions: the xml format is going to be used has not been defined , although the smartkom data can be used as a foundation .
decisions: in the first instance , the group will have to decide on the software package to be used for the creation and manipulation of the belief-nets .
decisions: stability and ease-of-use -in addition to ability to handle xml- of the package are the focus at this stage , instead of the ability to handle large amounts of data .
decisions: experts in bayes nets within icsi can be consulted on the matter .
decisions: the decision will be presented in the next meeting along with a first schema of the belief-nets themselves .
decisions: possible intermediate nodes can be added to the nets after this .
decisions: the hypothesis that a set of features from which intentions can be derived exists has to be assessed , before moving on to how to extract these features from the data automatically .
problems: curent navigation systems do not provide for the user 's particular intentions when asking for directions .
problems: they always compute the shortest path between source and destination .
problems: the smartkom parser , for example , does not mark up data with features adequate for the inference of these intentions .
problems: although it is understandable that language , discourse and situation features will play a role in how they are weighed , the exact nature of those features is unclear .
problems: also hard to evaluate at this stage , is how the assumed features will combine in a belief-net , in order to provide the conditional probabilities of the users ' intentions .
problems: even if these problems are solved , extracting the features from the data may prove to be a bottleneck .
problems: the existing data are appropriate only for preliminary work , as they do n't include intention-related information .
problems: on the other hand , the details of the experiments that will have to be designed to get more appropriate data are not clearcut and are yet to be settled .
abstract: the group discussed the first version of the bayes-net used to work out a user 's intentions when asking for directions from a navigation device .
abstract: three intentions were identified: vista ( to view ) , enter ( to visit ) and tango ( to approach ) .
abstract: the structure of the belief-net comprises , firstly , a feature layer , which includes linguistic , discourse and world knowledge information that can be gleaned from the data .
abstract: it is possible for these variables to form thematic clusters ( eg `` entrance '' , `` type of object '' , `` verb '' ) , each one with a separate middle layer .
abstract: these feed , in turn , into the main middle layer , that defines more general hidden variables , such as the tourist / business status of the user .
abstract: the feature layer can end up being cue-based , while the middle layers task-based .
abstract: the latter determine the final probability of each intention in the output layer .
abstract: this first model of the belief-net was built in javabayes , since it is a free package , has a graphical interface , and it can take xml files as input .
abstract: at this stage , all the actual probabilities are ad-hoc and hand-coded .
abstract: however , there has been progress in the design and organisation of experiments , that will eventually provide data more useful and appropriate for this task .
decisions: it is necessary for the belief-net to have at least one layer of nodes between the features and the final output .
decisions: another technique to systematise the work is the thematic clustering of the features , each cluster forming a bayes-net of each own: for example features like `` admission fee '' and `` opening hours '' can feed into an intermediate `` entrance '' node connecting to the main middle layer .
decisions: the next stage is to refine the set of feature nodes and identify possible clusters .
decisions: although , in theory , traditional ai plan recognition techniques could also be helpful for inferring intentions , the schemas involved are too elaborate for this task .
decisions: further work also includes discussing the possible advantages of bayes-net packages , other than javabayes , with experts at icsi .
decisions: if they continue using javabayes , a script to help with the inputting of probabilities in the nodes is needed , as the in-built method is cumbersome .
decisions: finally , it was decided that at least some of the experiments designed for the new data collection initiative will factor in the intentions studied in the current task .
problems: especially with lexical cues ( verbs , modifiers etc ) , no one offered specific intuitions as to how they might contribute to the inference of intentions .
problems: other features , like `` admission fee '' , may be intuitively linked with one of the outputs ( enter ) , however , any probabilities are coded in an ad-hoc fashion and are by no means realistic .
problems: cases like this , where feature and output seem to be linked directly , bring the necessity of a middle layer in the belief-net to question .
problems: nevertheless , not having a middle layer would not allow for shifts in the discourse and would make the setting of probabilities and manipulation of the belief-net clumsy .
problems: some issues with the use of javabayes also arose: the addition of new variables in an existing node overwrites all previous settings , and the native text file where the probability tables are set is not easy to read ; this makes adding and changing variables and nodes problematic .
problems: finally , it is unclear how much learning can be done on the created nets .
abstract: a test run of the data collection design was very successful .
abstract: the group decided to hire the `` wizard '' and continue with the refinement of the design and recruitment of subjects .
abstract: it is not a working net yet , but identifying clusters of features that define the output mode provides a visual aid for further work .
abstract: there are potential problems from a combinatorics perspective .
abstract: these can be tackled either with technical adjustments or through careful knowledge engineering .
abstract: a base solution for the task would be to simply add some extra action-mode rules in the smartkom system .
abstract: action modes , however , can be inferred more efficiently by feeding a collection of features -from the ontology , discourse history , parsing , etc . - into bayes-nets that would replace those rules .
abstract: for instance , the final combination of features used in the current study may form a representation of the ontology , general enough to employ in any task that includes trajectors and paths .
decisions: although the data collection test went well and it was decided to hire the `` wizard '' , there are minor amendments in the procedure to be carried out ( shortenting the preparatory reading , numbering tasks etc ) .
decisions: a presentation of the data collection design should be included in the forthcoming meeting with other research groups , along with some account of the system design and the use of belief-nets .
decisions: their input vector is to be provided by information extracted from the various modules of the system , such as the ontology and discourse history , using standard rule-based methods .
decisions: the output action essentially provides additional semantic parameters for the x-schema , and , in turn , may trigger the collection of more features from the data .
decisions: the feature extraction could be carried out by a software tool checking object ( feature ) trees and filling them with appropriate values .
problems: after the trial run of the experiment , some minor issues , like the length of the preliminary reading and the need to order the tasks given to the subjects , were highlighted .
problems: it is also possible that the pool of subjects ends up comprising almost entirely of students ; more variation in the sample is needed .
problems: from a system design perspective , the progress so far has shown that the combinatorics of the bayes-net even for a simple task , like the choice of vista / enter / tango mode , could render it unmanageable .
problems: the belief-net presented in the meeting is not a working bayes-net .
problems: consequently , it is as yet unclear what the decision nodes in the net are , and what values these can take .
problems: even if those were decided , how to extract the necessary information from the data , would still be an open issue .
problems: looking at the bigger picture , the current task is yet to provide insights into more general ways to achieve linguistic deep understanding .
problems: with these intricacies in mind , it is not easy to put together a presentation of the project cohesive and attractive enough for the other research groups in the institute .
abstract: the data collection running in parallel with the project can start shortly with recruiting subjects .
abstract: meanwhile , the german parser now works with english sentences .
abstract: the parser 's output modifies the xml used by the system to initiate actions and generate responses .
abstract: the xml for map requests also comprise a route , route elements and points of interest along the way .
abstract: it is at this level that enter / vista / approach tags will be added as action modes .
abstract: as the project evolves , further enrichment of the ontology ( actions , linguistic features ) will be necessary .
abstract: similarly , object representations will include an eva vector .
abstract: this can be incorporated in the database entry for a particular building or inherited from the ontology of the building type .
abstract: these elements will constitute only a small part of the inputs of the bayes-net that determines the action mode .
abstract: the actual number of the inputs can create a combinatorial explosion when setting the probabilities .
abstract: noisy-or 's can help avoid this by simplifying the probability tables and applying a deterministic function to produce their complete version .
decisions: as the data collection is about to begin , there are some minor changes to be done in the design of the experiment , the script and the permission forms .
decisions: subjects can be recruited either from within the university or through other social circles .
decisions: as to the system design , the next step is the translation of the generator into english .
decisions: moreover , it is important to test the system and its internal workings by adding new sentence types and modifying the parser .
decisions: all further research will use the existing domain ( `` tourists in heidelberg '' ) , as this provides enough diversity for the purposes of the project .
decisions: it is therefore preferable for the group to exercise foresight and agree on the set of new tags they will need in the long run , so that they limit the number of change requests .
decisions: finally , on a more technical note , noisy-or 's were discussed and considered a sensible approach to deal with the potential problems with the setting the conditional probabilities of the bayes-nets .
problems: although the parser has been modified to work with english , the details of its internal workings ( calling functions , setting discourse variables , generating actions ) are not yet clear .
problems: understanding the parsed data is helped by the database of objects , people and events accompanying the system , but the mapping of referring expressions to database objects can still be a hurdle .
problems: on a different level , the bayes-net used to generate the different action modes can easily become unmanageable as the number of features to be taken into account increases .
problems: this can be tackled with the use of the noisy-or technique .
problems: the deterministic functions this requires can not be introduced directly into javabayes , although some runaround ways can be implemented .
problems: a final , high-level issue , that has not been dealt with yet , is the definition of the constructions and the construction grammar framework analysis behind the whole enterprise .
abstract: the data collection script has been slightly modified , so that it encourages more natural dialogue between the subjects and the `` wizard '' .
abstract: another trial run will take place , while a call to recruit subjects is being emailed to students .
abstract: meanwhile , the translation of the tv and cinema information system to english is almost complete .
abstract: on the other hand , there was a presentation of the model that offers more elaborate action planning for smartkom , of which enter / view / approach ( eva ) modes are a part .
abstract: these modes will form categories of complete xml schemas with information filled in from the language understanding in a more elaborate way than the current object- '' go action '' -object model .
abstract: these categories will , in turn , be linked with action schemas , one of which is source-path-goal ( spg ) .
abstract: categories and action schemas can have -in theory- any number of blocks depending on the expansion of the domain .
abstract: the notation provides for linking and referencing between different schemas .
abstract: the model also allows for multiple action schemas to be triggered in parallel .
abstract: however , the structure of the model is open for discussion , since its use was to elicit discussion and highlight issues .
decisions: as the data collection is about to start , a call for the recruitment of subjects is going to be sent out .
decisions: the main pool of subjects is going to be the student community in the institute .
decisions: along with the `` wizard '' , who is going to be an integral part of the experiments , another person needs to be hired as the instructor for the tasks involved in them .
decisions: meetings were rescheduled and are now going to take place on fridays .
decisions: for the next meeting , there is going to be a presentation of the modifications in the parser module of the basic system .
decisions: additionally , the proposed xml model will be put to the test with concrete data .
decisions: similarly , such examples will clarify issues relating to the binding and redundancy of features with common characteristics amongst the shcemas ( eg `` container '' for enter and `` goal '' for spg ) .
problems: subjects in the trial runs of the experiment were given detailed descriptions of the tasks , which led to the subsequent dialogue being a re-iteration or re-phrasing of the instructions .
problems: using pictures instead would be one way to deal with the problem , however , it was deemed too laborious and it would divert the focus of the experiment .
problems: as the original action planner of the smartkom system only included a generic spg schema , a new module was presented that allows for variety in the user intentions to be included .
problems: this being only a model , there are several issues that will need to be clarified in the future .
problems: how the model deals with redundancy of information among categories and action schemas , and whether a flat or a hierarchical model would be preferable are two of them .
problems: what is also clear is that as the domain of research broadens beyond the study of eva modes , the complexity of the model will also increase .
abstract: its structure was discussed during the meeting .
abstract: there are several endpoints ( user , ontology , discourse etc ) with separate eva ( enter / view / approach ) values .
abstract: details of how different inputs feed into them were discussed at length .
abstract: ideas mentioned included grouping features of buildings like `` selling '' , `` fixing '' and `` exhibiting '' , as well as creating a user-compatibility node that would take different values depending on the situation and the user status .
abstract: similarly , a go-there ( towards a building ) node can be influenced by things like the user 's budget and discourse parameters amongst other things .
abstract: the latter are still ill-defined at this stage .
abstract: the study of the linguistic constructions that people use in this kind of navigational domain is expected to be prove useful in that respect .
abstract: as each node in the tree is the decision point of the combination of its parent nodes , which rules govern this combination is an important issue .
abstract: there are several approaches ranging from simply averaging the inputs to using a hidden variable in order to weight them differently depending on context .
abstract: if the latter architecture is used , the net could -to an extent- be trained with the data that is currently being collected .
decisions: since the net architecture and possible decision algorithms were discussed , it is necessary to examine how much of this javabayes can accommodate and , if not , what modifications would be necessary .
decisions: finally , the analysis of the linguistic constructions for the current research domain can begin even with limited data , as , at this stage , they need not be very detailed .
problems: a lot of the details have been glossed over: the user model can potentially comprise a huge number of factors ; a planning `` go-there '' node needs input from several other areas of the net ; there are intricate interactions between discourse and the situation model .
problems: similarly , what discourse properties are of importance and how they influence eva probabilities is still a mystery .
problems: on a more general note , there is also the question of whether the net should be updated continuously or only when it is needed .
problems: the more interesting solutions would ideally require training data , and it is still debatable whether the current collection would be appropriate for this particular task .
problems: in any case , how different architectures can be implemented in javabayes and what modifications would be necessary for the purposes of this project also need to be investigated .
abstract: the berkeley even deeper understanding group discussed plans and concerns regarding the architecture of smartkom , its proposed modules , and the types of interactions expected to take place between modules .
abstract: the meeting was largely focused on smartkom 's decision making capacity and how to adapt this functionality to the tourist information domain .
decisions: the group set a date for assessing smartkom plans .
decisions: it was decided that smartkom 's action plans should be represented in xml as a state transition network .
decisions: it was proposed that the term 'dialogue planner ' should replace 'dialogue manager ' .
decisions: prolog will be phased out completely and replaced by java code .
decisions: the dialogue manager must be capable of changing states , i.e . go from being event driven to answering a question from a planning module .
decisions: smartkom should feature a well defined core interface , with domain-specific information kept external .
decisions: a syntactic analysis component that performs chunk parsing will be added to the system .
problems: as a functional module , the action planner is too restrictive for the tourist domain and requires complex slots from the dialogue manager .
problems: what form will the language input have , and what will the action planner do with it ?
problems: links must be in place between the input end , action planner , parser , and language feedback components for communicating the current state of plan .
problems: interactions in a deep map system between the spatial planner and the route planner are too convoluted .
problems: smartkom requires a fast and robust parser that includes language-specific extensions .
problems: which form of semantic construction grammar should be used , and how would such information be derived from the parsed input ?
abstract: the system is still buggy and unstable , but it will soon be ready for a demonstration .
abstract: this is the first of two working demos required for the project .
abstract: further than that , there are no restrictions on the focus of the research or its possible applications .
abstract: for example , issues like spatial descriptions could be investigated .
abstract: the variety of linguistic conventions seem to develop around an ego / allo-centric and a proximal / distal paradigm .
abstract: the latter is also reflected in neuro-physiological data .
abstract: from an engineering perspective , the belief-net for the ave task should be completed within a few weeks .
abstract: the majority of the nodes are already there .
abstract: this leaves the dependencies between them and the rules of computation to be set .
abstract: since the whole system is going to be re-designed , there are major decisions to be taken regarding the parser and the ontology , as well as what can be re-used from past eml projects .
abstract: in parallel , another team is working on formalisation and notation .
abstract: finally , more ideas are expected to come from students and their research .
decisions: the final english smartkom demo will be presented to the whole institute once the system is de-bugged and stabilised .
decisions: after the demo , the focus of research can switch towards purely scientific goals , including issues on ontology , deep semantic constructions , execution engines etc .
decisions: moreover , a new system will be designed for the project and at least some parts of it should be built .
decisions: similarly , the construction analyser should be a single , general tool working for both the tourist domain and child language modelling .
decisions: the focus for the next meeting will be on the belief-net , of which a working demo should be complete in the next few weeks .
decisions: since there are not enough data , its connections and weights will have to be designed .
decisions: in order to promote the collaboration with eml , the group-ware server there will be updated with all progress being made in the two sites .
decisions: a talk on some of the issues will also be organised to take place at dfki .
problems: the german smartkom version available on the server does not work .
problems: the english version , although still under development , does work , however , the system is still unstable as -apart from other reasons- it was initially built to work with a touch screen .
problems: de-bugging and cleaning up has to take place before any new modules are added on it .
problems: these will have to be guessed instead of learnt through data , as not enough data is available for such a task .
problems: finally , it has been noted that the javabayes gui does not satisfy all the presentation requirements for this belief-net and modifying the underlying code would be too time-consuming .
abstract: the main focus of the meeting was firstly on the structure of the belief-net , its decision nodes and the parameters that influence them , and secondly , on the design of the data collection tasks .
abstract: for the latter , there are already 30 subjects lined up and more are expected to be recruited off campus .
abstract: it was agreed that making subjects select from categories of tasks , such as `` big place '' , `` service '' , etc . could provide a better range of data .
abstract: the duration of each dialogue will probably be no more than 10 minutes .
abstract: these nodes represent decisions that will function as parameters to action calls in the system .
abstract: their values will either be inferred from the user-system interaction , or -as a last resort- requested directly from the user .
abstract: finally , as to the semantic and syntactic constructions , work will start with more general and brief descriptions , before moving to exhaustive analysis of at least a subset .
abstract: similarly , the construction parser that is to be built within a year is expected to be relatively basic , yet robust .
decisions: as the data collection is ready to start , it was agreed that for the first ten subjects the interaction with the system / instructor will be along the lines of a basic response system .
decisions: tasks will be divided in categories ( `` tour '' , `` attend '' etc ) and subjects are going to be asked to choose no more than one task out of each category .
decisions: this first run will probably take a couple of weeks , but the first results ( audio files and selected highlights ) will be discussed shortly , in order to decide whether more detail ( complex spatial relationships , temporal planning etc ) should be included in the design or particular constructions be elicited .
decisions: regarding the completion of the belief-net , the remaining details , mainly the properties of the ontology and discourse nodes , should be added .
decisions: after building in the conditional probability tables , a working prototype of the net will be ready .
decisions: finally , the initial work on constructions should focus on a general overview of the dialogues with brief descriptions .
decisions: further analysis will follow from there in a top-down fashion .
problems: although there is an effort to include some of the key features of the belief-net in the design of the data gathering , not all of them can be built in .
problems: the tasks that the subjects will have to carry out will be categorised in ways that will indicate eva intentions , however , this approach may limit the variety of possible constructions used within a single category of entities .
problems: a minor problem has arisen with the laboratory where recordings are supposed to take place , but this is currently being sorted out .
problems: finally , it was noted that although a general overview of the pertinent constructions is attainable , no more than ten of them can be analysed in detail with the summer months .
abstract: the input layer deriving information from things like the user and situation models , feeds into a set of decision nodes , such as the enter / view / approach ( eva ) endpoint .
abstract: in any particular situation , most of the outputs will not be relevant to the given context .
abstract: therefore , they will either have to be pruned a posteriori , or only a subset of the possible decision nodes will be computed in each occasion .
abstract: the latter option could could follow a binary search-tree approach and it could also be better in computational terms .
abstract: in any case , on what basis the `` winner '' output is chosen is not clear .
abstract: one suggestion was discussed: the particular constructions used can determine the pertinent decision ( output ) nodes .
abstract: the complete prototype of the bayes-net will be presented in the next meeting .
abstract: after that , it will be possible to define interfaces and a dummy construction parser , in order to test and link modules together .
decisions: there are many interdependencies between the output nodes that this approach could not take into account .
decisions: the rest of the values for the bayes-net nodes will be built in within the week .
decisions: the finished prototype will be presented during the next meeting .
problems: any set of inputs will provide either the whole range of output values of the bayes-net or an a priori selection of those outputs .
problems: in both cases , what is needed is a way to single out the appropriate outputs for any given context .
problems: for example , in the case of a `` where is '' question , whether the prevalent output should be `` go-there '' or `` info-on '' or even a third option has to be computed somehow .
problems: furthermore , no inputs for the ontology and discourse can be built in yet , as they involve research that will be carried out in the future .
problems: finally , there has been a problem with adding probabilities in a net created with the hugin software , but this should be overcome very shortly .
abstract: an idea for future work was suggested during the visit of the german project manager: the possibility to use the same system for language generation .
abstract: having a system able to ask questions could contribute significantly to training the belief-net .
abstract: setting up certain inputs in the bayes-net would imply certain intentions , which would trigger dialogues .
abstract: there is potential to make a conference paper out of presenting the current work and the project aspirations within a parsing paradigm .
abstract: the focus should be the bayes-net , to which all other modules interface .
abstract: situation , user , discourse and ontology feed into the net to infer user intentions .
abstract: someone asking where the castle is after having asked about the admission fee , indicates that -given that the castle is open to tourists- they want to go there , as opposed to knowing its whereabouts .
abstract: it was suggested that they start analysing what the discourse and ontology would give as inputs to the bayes-net by working on simple utterances like `` where is x ? `` .
abstract: with this addition , all input layers of the net would be functioning .
decisions: similarly , as no one could recall some of the points of the conference call , the group will have to meet again and define the exact structure and content of the paper they are going to submit .
decisions: the bayes-net is going to be the focus of the presentation .
decisions: in order to complete a functioning prototype of the belief-net , it was decided to start expanding the ontology and discourse nodes by working with a simple construction , like `` where is x ? `` .
decisions: a robust analysis of such a basic utterance will indicate what the limits of the information derived from the construction are , as well as ways to design the whole module and fit other constructions in .
problems: the idea to create a language generation module for the system , along with the language understanding , was met with interest , although it was made clear that generation is not just the inverse of understanding .
problems: understanding what a construction entails does not mean the system can use the construction in all appropriate circumstances .
problems: a dialogue producing system would be useful for training the system further , even though the number of input permutations could render the process computationally unwieldy .
problems: regarding the conference paper , it was noted that at this stage they have not completed any big parts of the system and there is no evaluation .
problems: similarly , the length of the paper would not allow for presentation of the formalism in detail .
problems: the originating observation behind the whole project is that utterances like `` where is x ? '' are seemingly unambiguous , but , in context , they can acquire much more complex interpretations .
abstract: minor technical issues , such as format conversions for xml and javabayes and the full translation of the smartkom generation module in english , are currently being resolved .
abstract: the voice synthesiser will also be replaced by better technology .
abstract: an important research issue to be investigated is how the concept of mental spaces and probabilistic relational models can be integrated into the belief-net .
abstract: mental space interdependencies are based on relatively clean rules , since people seem to manage them easily .
abstract: a step towards this goal is the construction formalism being put together .
abstract: this module will eventually have to include ways to simulate questions , do emphasis and focus .
abstract: the constructions could be built assuming either conventional or conversational implicature .
abstract: at this stage both routes need to be examined .
abstract: the formalism will also serve as a starting point for the definition of construal mechanisms .
abstract: one suggestion was to use the spreading activation as a paradigm for activating nodes in the belief-net .
abstract: finally , using type constraints in the construction analysis should work , as long as they are complex enough not to generate too many parses .
decisions: it is necessary to ask the javabayes programmer whether he already has xml conversion programs .
decisions: for the smartkom generation module , all the syntax-to-prosody rules are going to be re-written for english .
decisions: additionally , ogi can offer a range of synthesiser voices to choose from .
decisions: the focus of the next meeting , whose time was rescheduled , will be the discussion of the revised construction formalism .
decisions: the presentation will unify the existing ideas and help identify the areas in need of further work , such as how it can deal with time and tense use and how they affect inferences in belief-nets .
decisions: the ambiguity in a `` where is x ? '' construction can be coded in the formalism as a semantic feature or pushed forward to the belief-net where pragmatic features will disambiguate it: in terms of system design , both options need to be investigated at this stage .
problems: as the translation of the german smartkom into english moves on , the generation rules may prove difficult to tackle for someone without experience in functional programming , as they are written in lisp .
problems: as far as the construction analysis is concerned , the two problems that will need to be solved are to identify the couplings between constructions in different mental spaces and to define how inferences will work in the belief-net from a technical point of view .
problems: additionally , in the example `` where is x ? '' construction , the ambiguity ( location or path ) could be coded either in the semantics of the construction or as if determined by context .
problems: the former could mean creating a different construction for every slight pragmatic variation .
problems: on the other hand , some of the belief-net probabilities could be instantiated in the lexicon .
problems: finally , it is still undecided where construal comes in , which would help delimit the constructions as well .
abstract: the discussion concerned the revised semantic specification and the construction formalism .
abstract: the different levels of the latter focus on what construction types are encountered and what bindings there are between them .
abstract: the notation maintains properties of both dependency and constituent-based grammars .
abstract: the encoding of features is still incomplete: frame profiles , focus , adjectives , nominal expressions are phenomena in the process of being integrated .
abstract: similarly , ways to handle mental spaces will have to be added on top .
abstract: on the other hand , the semantic specification structures information in terms of `` scenario '' , `` referent '' and `` discourse segment '' .
abstract: each category comprises a number of slots filled in by information derived from the utterance .
abstract: it is , essentially , a toolkit with which to create semantic constructions , as well as the bindings between them and with the ontology .
abstract: among the issues still being defined , mental spaces and context ( eg pronoun references ) present similarities that can be echoed in the specification .
abstract: work on both of these formalisms will continue with circumscription of the construction space that will be studied in more detail .
abstract: work on construal will use bayes-nets , which will be fed information from other modules and implement general rules to infer how utterances are construed .
decisions: amongst other things `` cause '' has to be added as another x-schema .
decisions: linguistic hedging will also be encoded as a demarcation of evidentiality or speaker confidence .
decisions: mental spaces can be tackled with mechanisms that can also deal with context issues ( time , space etc . ) : creating a base space and rules of interaction with other interconnected spaces .
decisions: however , the complexity of these mechanisms has to be bound as well: it is necessary to define the range of constructions to be studied .
decisions: given the domains currently used ( tourist , child language learning ) , some features , like speaker attitude , are not of equal importance at this stage .
decisions: on the other hand , it was decided for the inheritance between constructions to be left out for now , as the notation can be rendered more elegant later on .
decisions: finally , a preliminary presentation on the idea of how to use bayes-nets for construal will take place in the next meeting .
problems: the construction formalism is not yet complete as to the semantic constraints -the terminology has also been met with objections- and does not deal with mental spaces .
problems: on their own , constructions can only give limited information regarding mental spaces: forms can provide cues to create a different mental space , but the semantic nuances are defined by context .
problems: other issues concern focus and stress: focus is seen as an information structure device , but there has been no suggestion as to how to predict its effects or break it down in possible focused elements ; as to stress , it may not be useful as a form value , as it shows the focus exponent , but not what the focus is on .
problems: moving to the semantic specification , the analysis still needs mechanisms to deal with causality , as well as mental spaces and bindings between them .
abstract: the meeting was taken up by discussion about a thesis proposal and a talk about to take place at eml .
abstract: the latter will present the work that is currently being done at icsi including examples of inference of user intentions and of the recordings of the on-going data collection .
abstract: the talk will also outline the theoretical ( x-schemas , image schemas , bayes-nets ) and neural background .
abstract: the thesis proposal , on the other hand , presents the idea of `` construal '' and makes claims as to how inferences are drawn in a probabilistic relational model by using information from the ontology , situation , user and discourse models .
abstract: base constructions deal with the norm , while further general domain mechanisms determine how the constructions are invoked depending on the context .
abstract: several potential examples of polysemy were discussed in detail: `` walk / run into '' , `` on the bus '' , `` out of film '' , `` where is x ? `` .
abstract: however , none of them was an example of lexical polysemy resolved by construal straightforward enough to include in the proposal ; the tourist domain is not metaphor rich .
decisions: as the talk at eml will also refer to a theoretical framework , it was suggested that along with presenting ntl and the piece on mirror neurons , it also alludes to relevant fmri work .
decisions: the neural side of the research could be of interest to various groups .
decisions: the language analysis itself will be introduced in terms of image schemas .
decisions: on the other hand , it was arranged for more feedback on the thesis proposal to be sent by email .
decisions: the latest version of the construction formalism will also be needed to complete the presentation .
problems: it was noted that the thesis proposal did not put any emphasis on metaphor or on the scalability achieved by combining constructions with general construal mechanisms: constructions cover base cases , while metaphoric and metonymic cases are resolved with the extra help provided by construal .
problems: it was agreed that metaphors are not abundant in the spatial domain .
problems: some of the candidates discussed were phrases like `` on the bus '' , `` out of film '' , non-spatial uses of `` where '' or other fixed expressions .
abstract: there is a new wizard for phase two , during which subjects will be given more complex scenarios .
abstract: also finished are the modifications on smartkom: the remaining glitches will take no more than a day to iron out .
abstract: a big part of the meeting was covered by the presentation of the prm of the proposed system .
abstract: an alternative representation of the bayes-net , it depicts context features as classes , and dependencies as relations between them .
abstract: the current outputs show the desirability of a site , as well as its eva mode .
abstract: the fact that this model allows for instantiations of classes fits the research purposes much better than the extended belief-net .
abstract: following this , a visiting researcher presented an overview of a parallel project at the international university .
abstract: it attempts to build a smart tutoring system for a computer science course .
abstract: the assumption is that document searches can give more personalised results , if they take into account contextual parameters ( user , situation ) .
abstract: although no detailed linguistic analysis takes place , it was suggested that the use of framenet could be a useful approach .
abstract: there were also further suggestions for meetings with icsi researchers .
decisions: as the data collection is going into its second phase , more complex scenarios will be used to generate more intricate dialogues .
decisions: subjects can be recruited from within the psychology department students , since such participation in experiments is compulsory in their syllabus .
decisions: as the work on creating a prm for the system has progressed , it is now necessary to find an implementation that can work as a prm interpreter .
decisions: there are no plans to build one from scratch , but it seems that other research groups at stanford may already have one .
decisions: moreover , closer collaboration with the local prm group will be pursued with additional participation in their meetings .
problems: an early version of the prm of the system presented the same problem as a flat bayes-net: the cpt 's become too large .
problems: another prm issue that arose and remained unclear was how the probabilities are specified ( instead of learnt ) on the actual relations between the classes .
problems: furthermore , the lack of a prm interpreter is an open issue .
problems: it is not within the remit of the project to build one from scratch , therefore , an existing implementation has to be found .
problems: on the other hand , the discussion about the smart tutoring system being built at the international university showed the importance of finding out which context parameters are influential in a given domain .
problems: it is easy to hack up a system for a small domain , but making it scalable is much more difficult .
problems: finally , there was a passing mention of problems encountered with the speech synthesis module of smartkom .
abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed the aims , methods , timing , and outsourcing issues concerning transcription of the meeting recorder corpus .
abstract: the transcriber software tool was introduced , along with a set of transcription conventions for coding different speech events .
abstract: the prospect of sending the data to an external transcription service was weighed against that of hiring a graduate student transcriber pool .
abstract: it was tentatively decided that the latter option would be less costly and allow bmr to maintain greater control over the transcription process .
abstract: methods for distributing the data were briefly discussed , along with an initiative for creating a bmr project website .
abstract: the group received an update on the meeting room recording setup and electronics .
decisions: the group will obtain a copy of the corpus of spoken american english ( csae ) from the ldc to compare the methods and conventions used by uc santa barbara with those being considered for the meeting recorder project .
decisions: speakers fe008 and me011 will experiment with pre-segmentation procedures in hopes of facilitating the transcription process .
decisions: speaker fe008 will perform the transcription for one meeting ( 40-60 minutes of data ) as a pilot project .
decisions: a tentative decision was made to put speaker fe008 in charge of the in-house transcription effort .
decisions: modifications to the transcriber source code , e.g . adjusting the delay between the audio play function and the inputting of time boundaries , may be undertaken by the bmr group .
decisions: an initiative for creating an internal bmr project website was discussed , along with ideas for providing web access to external organizations , such as the university of washington .
decisions: a cabinet will be built to house wires and other electronic equipment used in the recording setup .
decisions: a laptop and wireless modem will be avaiable to participants for monitoring the recording progress .
problems: how should transcripts and corresponding audio files be formatted and distributed ?
problems: external transcription services are expensive , difficult to monitor , and are unlikely to be able to handle multi-channel data .
problems: what size of segment is most useful for doing transcriptions ?
problems: transcriber 's interface only allows the user to view two overlapping speakers .
problems: decisions must be made regarding the security of electronic recording equipment .
abstract: topics discussed by the berkeley meeting recorder group included a potential collaboration with another icsi member regarding the analysis of inference structures , efforts by speaker mn005 to detect speaker overlap , the current status on recordings and transcriptions , and future efforts to collect meeting data .
abstract: in addition to weekly meetings by the bmr group , efforts are in progress to record meetings by other icsi research groups , as well as routine discussions by non-icsi members .
decisions: the group will resume its discussion of speaker anonymization in a subsequent meeting .
decisions: to save time , speaker mn005 will only mark the sample of transcribed data for regions of overlapping speech , as opposed to marking all acoustic events .
decisions: the digits extraction task will be delegated to whomever is working on acoustics for the meeting recorder project .
decisions: the group will inquire with other icsi researchers and colleagues at the university of washington about collecting additional meeting data .
decisions: echo cancellation experiments will be performed on meeting recorder digits data .
problems: use of pronouns ( e.g . he , she , you ) during meetings is potentially problematic for indexing referents and analysing speech understanding .
problems: sensitivity issues involved in mentioning individuals by name were also discussed .
problems: data obtained via the close-talking microphone channels do n't match meeting content yielded via the far-field microphones .
problems: the collection of meeting data from non-meeting recorder participants is likely to be more infrequent .
abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed research aims and corresponding concerns for future data collection .
abstract: it was agreed that a substantial amount of meeting data is required from different domains , and comprising several speakers , to perform the types of discourse and acoustic analyses desired .
abstract: ongoing efforts by speaker mn005 to automatically detect regions of speaker overlap were considered .
abstract: it was suggested that speaker mn005 focus on a small set of acoustic parameters , e.g . energy and harmonics-related features , to distinguish regions of overlap from those containing the speech of just one speaker .
abstract: disk space issues were discussed .
abstract: and , finally , the problem of speaker anonymization was explored .
decisions: recordings must be of existing meetings that are conducted in english .
decisions: participants should ideally consist of professors and doctoral students , but no undergraduate students , who are willing to record their meetings at icsi .
decisions: the meeting recorder corpus should comprise data from a large number of speakers representing different domains .
decisions: speaker me011 will pursue volunteers from the haas business school to record their weekly meetings at icsi .
decisions: a tentative decision was made to offer participants a recorded version of their meeting on a cd rom once the transcript screening phase is complete for that meeting .
problems: non-native speakers with a low proficiency in english are problematic for language modelling .
problems: the prospect of creating another recording setup requires the elimination certain more complicated dimensions of the existing setup , e.g . the use of close-talking and far-field microphones .
problems: speaker anonymization poses problems for the transcription proccess , and also discourse analysis , as it makes it more difficult to track who is speaking and to whom a particular utterance is being addressed .
problems: as the current version of transcriptions does not include speaker identification labels , no multiple speaker transcription conventions are in use .
abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group focussed its discussion on overlapping speech segments .
abstract: speaker fe008 presented raw counts and percentages for one transcribed meeting , revealing a large number of overlaps throughout the 40-plus-minute transcript .
abstract: efforts by speakers fe008 and fe016 are in progress to categorize and subcategorize types of overlapping speech and evaluate the contribution of multiple speakers in an interaction to the amount and types of overlap observed .
abstract: speaker me011 described his attempts to automatically identify speakers via the close-talking microphone channels using thresholding and filtering methods and an existing speaker-change detection algorithm .
abstract: the group also tentatively discussed the erection of visual barriers during meeting recordings , and speaker me013 presented a list of work performed by bmr over the previous three months to be included in a forthcoming report to ibm .
decisions: for future meetings , speaker me011 will generate a system for mapping speakers and their positions in the recording room .
decisions: speaker fe008 will analyze backchannels for a subset of meeting data and givee a report in the next meeting .
problems: for language and dialogue modelling , current methods of marking and segmenting overlap are abstracted from real time , as individual speaker turns are indicated sequentially .
problems: a large amount of data must be collected to address research questions concerning overlapping speech .
problems: for automatic speaker identification , thresholding and filtering methods are sensitive regarding the particular filter width and threshold selected .
problems: while such parameters can be finely tuned for one speaker to achieve good results , extending the same parameters to another speaker is problematic .
problems: the broad phone classifier of the speaker-change detector is peforming poorly .
problems: also , barriers that do not affect the overall room acoustics would be required .
abstract: the berkely meeting recorder group discussed efforts by speaker mn005 to measure energy levels in cases of speaker overlap in which the time window analyzed was 200 milliseconds or greater .
abstract: preliminary results were presented showing that log domain analyses did not reveal a significant difference in mean energy levels for windows of overlapping versus non-overlapping speech .
abstract: in contrast , raw energy analyses were successful in showing the two groups to be distinct .
abstract: participants discussed alternate strategies for examining energy and the importance of categorizing types of speaker overlap .
abstract: participants also reviewed the latest iteration of speaker forms , and discussed recent changes to the transcriber tool .
decisions: continuing efforts by speaker mn005 to measure energy levels in cases of speaker overlap will not include additional log energy analyses , but rather an analysis of raw energy for normalized speaker dataacross windows of varying duration , followed by an examination of pitch- and harmonicity-related features .
decisions: speakers fe008 and fe016 discussed plans to categorize and produce a taxonomy of types of speaker overlap .
problems: time marks for transcribed or force-aligned data are needed to analyze types of speaker overlap .
problems: with respect to speaker forms , the group discussed problems associated with categorizing regional dialects of american english .
problems: the new version of transcriber does not feature the waveform , as re-drawing of this window is too slow using snack .
abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group talked about the ongoing transcription effort and issues related to the transcriber tool , which despite its limitations for capturing tight time markings for overlapping speech , will continue to remain in use .
abstract: speaker mn014 explained his efforts to pre-segment the signal into speech and non-speech portions for facilitating transcriptions .
abstract: recording equipment and procedures were discussed , with a focus on audible breathing and the need for standards in microphone wear and use .
abstract: and , finally , it was determined that speaker mn005 's efforts to detect speaker overlap using energy should instead be focussed on pitch- and harmonicity-related features or be guided by a non-featural , statistical approach , i.e . via the use of markov models .
decisions: in the interest of time , it was decided that the group should continue using the existing transcriber tool and perform a forced alignment on the close-talking microphones that will , it is hoped , help to recover some of the time information indicating where different speaker overlaps occurred in the signal .
decisions: a meeting will be arranged with nist to decide on a common standard and format for doing transcriptions .
decisions: one or two meetings will be assigned to multiple transcribers to check for inter-annotator agreement .
decisions: to cut down on audible breaths during recordings , the group will institute some level of standards for microphone wear and use .
decisions: speaker mn005 will feed his hand-segmented data into the speech segmenter developed by javier to train it to identify different types of speech ( i.e . that of single versus multiple speakers ) , as well as focussing on pitch- and harmonicity-related features for identifying overlapping speech .
problems: there is no channel identifier to help in encoding speaker overlaps .
problems: speech uttered while laughing is problematic for asr .
problems: so far , speaker mn005 's attempts to detect speaker overlap have been unsuccessful , as it has not been possible to normalize energy as a reliable indicator of overlap .
abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed recording equipment and setup issues , recent developments in the transcription effort , other potential types of tagging to be assigned to transcribers , and the post-processing of waveforms .
abstract: the discussion was largely focused on efforts to facilitate transcriptions , including the improvement of strategies for transcribing overlapping speech , and achieving greater uniformity in the type of equipment used during recordings and the manner in which recording devices are worn by speakers .
decisions: to achieve greater uniformity in across-speaker recording conditions , the group decided to purchase three additional head-mounted microphones .
decisions: future work will include recording more varied meeting data from non-icsi discussion groups .
decisions: it was proposed by speaker fe016 that better communication be established between researchers involved in post-processing of the waveform and asr .
problems: use of dissimilar microphones adds an extra , unwanted variable to individual speaker recordings .
problems: similarly , differences in the type of recording equipment used and the manner in which microphones are worn by speakers causes problems for the transcription effort .
problems: setting up a microphone array and performing video recordings ( in a possible collaboration with nist ) are problematic due to the types of changes in infrastructure they require .
problems: ibm 's single-channel approach to transcriptions may pose problems for the post-processing of waveforms and forced alignments , as the group foresees difficulties in referencing chopped segments back to the original times / locations from which they were extracted .
problems: another post-processing problem involves cross-talk , and , in particular , situations in which a speaker whose contributions to the discussion are relatively sparse but whose microphone picks up signals from the other speakers .
abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed the collection status for a set of connected digits recordings that are nearly complete and ready to be trained on a recognizer .
abstract: anticipated results were discussed in reference to results obtained for other digits corpora , i.e . aurora and ti-digits .
abstract: the group also considered the prospect of performing fine-grained acoustic-phonetic analyses on a subset of meeting recorder digits or switchboard data .
abstract: pre-segmentation manipulations that allow for the segmentation of channel-specific speech / non-speech portions of the signal and the distinction of foreground versus background speech were discussed .
abstract: finally , speaker fe008 and fe016 reported on new efforts to adapt transcriptions to the needs of the sri recognizer , including conventions for encoding acronyms , numbers , ambient noise , and unidentified inbreaths .
decisions: the group decided to delegate the extraction of digits to the transcriber pool .
decisions: a tentative decision was also made to delegate transcribers with the task of labelling a subset of digits or switchboard data for fine-grained acoustic-phonetic features .
decisions: speaker fe008 will run selected meeting recorder data through channelize and determine whether the resulting units are of a sufficient length .
problems: speaker mn014 reported problems pre-segmenting speech recorded via the lapel microphones .
problems: normalization of the energy measured across and within channels is problematic when performed for speakers who say little or nothing during meetings .
problems: the evaluation of pre-segmented data is difficult without tightly transcribed time references to the individual channels from which the speech was derived .
problems: the sri recognizer requires that multi-channel format units not be too large , indicating that some additional pre-processing of unit lengths may be necessary .
abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed recording equipment issues , including the purchase of two additional headsets and the prospect of getting a new base station and a set of wireless microphones to replace those wired microphones currently in use .
abstract: speaker fe008 presented the current status on transcriptions , and explained procedures for cleaning up transcripts and ensuring they conform with set conventions .
abstract: speaker mn014 briefly described his efforts to normalize loudness levels across speech channels to distinguish between foreground and background speech .
abstract: finally , the group discussed legal and procedural issues concerning the provision of transcripts to meeting participants for 'bleeping out ' any sections of speech they want excluded from the meeting recorder database .
decisions: the consent form issued to subjects prior to meetings will be revised to make more explicit details concerning access to transcripts and the ability of subjects to mark sections of meetings for exclusion from the database .
decisions: the group decided to replace wired microphones with a wireless setup , i.e . a new base station and set of wireless microphones .
decisions: efforts will be made to ensure that recording conventions are consistent across icsi , the university of washington , and sri .
problems: some of the meeting recordings contain spikes .
problems: with respect to editing bleeps , should participants be allowed to edit out others ' speech ?
problems: it was suggested that making transcripts available to all of the subjects involved might make it too easy for them to edit out sections of meetings , whereas the bias should be to ensure that editing bleeps occur only rarely in the database .
abstract: topics discussed by the berkeley meeting recorder group included the status of the first test set of digits data , naming conventions for files , speaker identification tags , and encoding files with details about the recording .
abstract: the group also discussed a proposal for a grant from the nsf 's itr ( information technology research ) program , transcriptions , and efforts by speaker mn005 to detect speaker overlap using harmonicity-related features .
abstract: particular focus was paid to questions about transcription procedures , i.e . how to deal with overlooked backchannels , and audible breaths .
decisions: a small percentage of transcripts will be changed to reflect mis-read , uncorrected digits .
decisions: a speaker database will be compiled to establish consistent links between speakers and their corresponding identification tags .
decisions: sections of densely overlapping speech will require hand-checking so that overlooked backchannels may be manually segmented and labelled .
decisions: the transcribers should only code audible breaths within a grouping of words , and not outside regions of continuous speech .
decisions: it was further determined that audible breaths are an important facet of recorded speech , and that removing them from the corpus would be contrary to the aims of the project .
decisions: speaker mn005 will prepare his results for detecting speaker overlap and present them in the next meeting .
problems: during digits readings , subjects tend to chunk numbers together rather than reading each number separately .
problems: when working from the mixed channel , transcribers may select only one start and end time for overlapping speech , resulting in points of overlap that are less tightly tuned .
problems: transcribers are likely to overlook backchannels in densely populated sections of speaker overlap .
problems: speaker mn014 reported that this is also problematic for the automatic detection of speech and non-speech , as backchannels that are very short and not loud enough will inevitably be overlooked .
problems: the encoding of all audible breaths is too time-consuming .
abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed digits data , recent asr results , the status of transcriptions , and disk space and storage format issues .
abstract: approximately two hours of digits have been recorded , half of which have been extracted .
abstract: researchers doing asr are looking into methods for generating a better channel-based segmentation to improve recognition results for close-talking microphone data .
abstract: transcription checking procedures were reviewed , and efforts to coordinate the channelization and presegmention of data with the tightening of time bins were discussed .
decisions: digits forms will instruct speakers to read digits separately and not as connected numbers .
decisions: transcribers will be given channelized data that has been segmented for speech / non-speech boundaries to determine whether such pre-processing facilitates the transcription process .
problems: participants have been slow in returning the relevant forms necessary for matching digits data with speaker ids . forms containing digits that were written out in english were unsuccessful for obtaining desired prosodic groupings .
problems: acoustic adaptation is problematic for speakers who seldom talk during meetings .
problems: speaker overlap causes recognition errors .
problems: the lapel microphone is problematic as it picks up overlapping background speech .
problems: more disk space is needed .
problems: loading long waveforms in x waves is very time consuming .
problems: the dictionary must be updated with forms introduced as part of speaker fe008 's set of transcription conventions .
problems: the ongoing tightening of boundaries on time bins causes segment boundaries to change , indicating potential problems for other ongoing processing tasks .
abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed the preparation of a data sample for ibm , the manual adjustment of time bins by transcribers , recognition results for a test set of digits data , and forced alignments .
abstract: preliminary recognition results were presented for a subset of digits data .
abstract: efforts to deal with cross-talk and improve forced alignments for non-digits data were also discussed .
decisions: subsequent manual adjustment of speech and non-speech boundaries will be delegated to the transcriber pool .
decisions: a subset of meeting recorder data will be prepared ( i.e . pre-segmented and manually adjusted ) for delivery to ibm .
decisions: the transcriber interface may require modifications if it becomes necessary for transcribers to quickly switch among waveform displays .
problems: transcribers risk overlooking speech that is deeply embedded in the mixed signal .
problems: should transcriptions be derived from each of the close-talking channels or from the mixed signal alone ?
problems: the pre-segmentation tool does not perform well on short utterances , e.g . backchannels .
problems: the transcriber interface does not allow the user to quickly switch among visual displays , i.e . multi-channel waveforms .
problems: forced alignments were problematic for non-digits data due to cross-talk .
problems: echo cancellation was considered as a means of improving forced alignments , but was ultimately deemed to be too time-consuming given the dynamic aspect of adapting distances between speakers .
problems: comparing error rates in terms of the recording device used , i.e . lapel versus wireless microphones , is tedious .
problems: deleting segments of the recordings is expected to be very time-consuming for transcribers .
problems: more results are needed for generating adequate submissions for eurospeech'01 .
problems: participants have complained that the head-mounted microphone is uncomfortable .
abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed efforts to train and test the aurora group 's htk-based recognition system on icsi 's digits corpus .
abstract: members also discussed efforts to produce forced alignments from a selection of meeting recorder data .
abstract: performance in both tasks was adversely affected by the manner of recording conditions implemented and difficulties attributing utterances to the appropriate speakers .
abstract: while debugging efforts resulted in improved forced alignments , dealing with mixed channel speech and speaker overlap remains a key objective for future work .
abstract: the group is additionally focused on a continued ability to feed different features into the recognizer and then train the system accordingly .
decisions: for comparing meeting recorder digits results , it was decided that the aurora htk-based system should be tested on data from the ti digits corpus .
decisions: the script for extracting speaker id information will require modifications to obtain a more accurate estimation of the amount of data recorded per speaker .
decisions: subsequent recognition experiments will look at large vocabulary speech from a far-field microphone ( as performed in switchboard evaluations ) .
decisions: hand-marked , word-level alignments are needed to reveal speaker boundaries and tune the parameters of the model .
decisions: modifications to the transcriber tool are required for allowing transcribers to simultaneously view the signal in xwaves and see where words are located in time .
problems: a significant loss in recognition resulted from not having included the type of phone-loop adaptation found in the sri system .
problems: recognition performance was worse for digits recorded in closed microphone conditions versus those recorded in a studio ( e.g . ti-digits ) .
problems: a mismatch between the manner in which data were collected and the models used for doing recognition -- -e . g . bandwidth parameterization and the use of near- versus far-field microphones -- -was identified .
problems: too little data per speaker can have a negative effect on vtl estimation .
problems: the pzm channel selected for obtaining digits data was too far away from most of the speakers .
problems: current speech alignment techniques assume that foreground speech must be continuous and , barring some isolated words and backchannels , can not cope with overlapping background speech .
problems: performing adaptations on both the foreground and background speaker produced a new variety of misalignments , a problem resulting , in part , from the fact that background speakers often match better to foreground conditionss .
problems: transcribers occasionally misidentified speakers and omitted backchannels that were more hidden in the mixed signal .
abstract: the main topics of the agenda were a paper submitted to eurospeech and the organising of the recording transcriptions to be done by ibm .
abstract: the results presented in the former show a significant percentage of overlapping speech even without counting in backchanneling .
abstract: additionally , the high error rate in the recognition of such overlapping speech by the sri recogniser was minimised simply by changing the scoring method used .
abstract: finally , a strong correlation between pauses and interruptions was confirmed .
abstract: all these measurements were based on the sample of available transcripts .
abstract: other features , like prosody , will be studied in the near future .
abstract: an ftp directory containing such experimental data is being set up for the benefit of other researchers .
abstract: regarding the transcriptions to be carried out by ibm , the discussion mainly concerned the format of the recordings that should be sent to them .
abstract: suggestions included sending only the channels with the dominant speakers for transcription , but it was finally agreed on sending the original files with minimal modifications , as there will be extensive in-house post-processing .
abstract: within this discussion , the rationale behind the coding of the time bins according to the flow of discourse was also explained .
decisions: the files made available in the ftp directory will be the original ones ( before down-sampling ) , as these seem to be wanted by other parties .
decisions: moreover , as files may have been modified through different processing , tests will be carried out in order to ensure the generation of beep files in a consistent way .
decisions: also towards this goal , some of the time bins will need to be merged .
decisions: on the other hand , the two meetings where time bins have been hand-coded in detail will be used to fine-tune the forced alignments .
decisions: recordings will be sent to ibm for transcription .
decisions: before that , the files will be automatically pre-segmented into speech / non-speech bins and the beeps will be inserted .
decisions: in order to make things easier for the transcribers , breathy channels , which are erroneously marked as speech , will be re-classified correctly with other methods .
decisions: all this pre-processing will have to be evaluated first by checking a sample of the output files .
decisions: other issues , like whether and how synthesised speech off a laptop needs be transcribed , will be resolved during the in-house post-processing of the transcriptions .
