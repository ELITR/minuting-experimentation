B:  you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button 
B:  and in our case we are using a um a wheel control . 
B:  The push button are usually extremely cheap , 
B:  but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . 
B:  And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not  if if we could combine something with the push button . 
B:  Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button . 
A:  So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ? 
B:  We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money . 
B:  the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , 
B:  We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button . 
C:  Um , what is the purpose of the light ? 
A:  You can easily find the button in the dark or so ? 
B:  As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light . 
B:  I don't think that this is really expensive , 
C:  Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , 
A:  But it can be uh battery consuming , no ? 
A:  To have the light always on ? 
B:  Yeah , a little bit . 

C:  So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . 
C:  And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . 
C:  So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , 
C:  So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . 

C:  And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler . 
C:  We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle . 
A:  With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part . 
C:  I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . 
C:  Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way . 
C:  Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel 
C:  and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case . 

D:  And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , 
D:  uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . 
D:  <other> So , maybe if our <laugh> remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> And the mm the material is expected to be spongy . 

D:  <other> So , maybe if our <laugh> remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> And the mm the material is expected to be spongy . 
C:  I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , 
A:  Yeah , because it's robust . 
A:  Maybe uh um <other> a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that . 
A:  Yeah . Maybe pear yeah or something like that . 

A:  <laugh> I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well . 
A:  I think we can keep the wheel 

C:  Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess . 
A:  Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then . 
B:  but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , 
C:  You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . 
B:  So we will just use a a standard battery ? 
A:  I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape .

B:  chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use .

A:  I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has . 
D:  that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible .
