C:  Um uh my role is industrial designer 
A:  And as you already know I am Betty . 
A:  I am the project manager for today . 

A:  This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control . 
A:  Uh should be original <laugh> , trendy , and , of course , user friendly . 

A:  <other> Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . 
A:  That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with . 
A:  The same goes for the conceptual design , 
A:  Detailed design , same thing basically . 

A:  Then , tool training try out the white board , 
A:  participant can draw their favourite animal . 
A:  You wanna go Eileen and  
A:  And remember you have to press so it works . 

A:  Here's the project finance 
A:  Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro . 
A:  Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro , 
A:  the market range unlimited meaning international 
A:  and the production cost should not exceed  hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro . 
A:  now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing 

B:  Yes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact . 
B:  And um and it should have multi-purpose . 
B:  Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system . 

A:  It should be something new  it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have . 
B:  Yeah , design should be , yeah  it should be different . 
A:  Maybe it should  different colours or materials or you know . 

D:  I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap , 
A:  Well or yeah or if it's really , if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal . 
C:  maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . 
A:  and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough . 

A:  The industrial designer  That's you . 
C:  Uh working design , yeah , it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design . 
A:  so so you are the working design . 
A:  So you have a working design and then a functional design . 
A:  And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , 
A:  like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . 
A:  I think  basically basically you will get instructions to work with 
A:  Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes .
