A:  Okay so welcome everyone . 
A:  So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control . 
A:  So I will first start with a warm welcome opening <laugh> stuff , 
A:  then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . 
A:  And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas 
A:  and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be  you will have to fulfil to complete this process . 
A:  So the the goal is to have a remote control 
A:  so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly . 
A:  So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points . 
A:  First it will be the functional design . 
A:  Third is the conceptual design 
A:  and then is the desired design . 
A:  So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . 
A:  And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that . 
A:  And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing <other> and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point . 

A:  So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board . 
B:  It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan . 
A:  Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost . <laugh> 
D:  It's a cat . 
A:  <laugh> Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow . <laugh> 

A:  So  Here the uh financial objective of our project . 
A:  That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros 
A:  and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros . 
A:  <other> Yeah if it's trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs . 

A:  so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple . 
A:  Maybe I can have the  your opinion from the marketing side ? 
B:  Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one 
A:  And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil ? 
C:  If we don't have so many buttons could be nice . 
A:  And do you have it also to be  to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ? 
C:  Something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box . 
A:  So . Fit in your hand , yeah . 
A:  <laugh> Water-proof as well . 
A:  Maybe water-proof would be very original . 
B:  And , and that's one of the  that's one of the shock  I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it . 
A:  But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well . 
A:  Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well . 
C:  most of the time I I lose my remote control . 
C:  We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping . 
A:  Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep . 
A:  That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve . 
B:  So i it's just going to add t to the cost . 
A:  Yeah . We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer . 
A:  <laugh> Okay so try to find that for next meeting . <laugh> 

A:  Okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device . 
B:  Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one 
A:  so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple . 
A:  <laugh> Water-proof as well . 
A:  Maybe water-proof would be very original . 
B:  And , and that's one of the  that's one of the shock  I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it .

C:  We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping . 
A:  Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep . 
A:  That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve . 
B:  So i it's just going to add t to the cost . 
A:  Yeah . We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer . 
A:  <laugh> Okay so try to find that for next meeting . <laugh> 

A:  So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working  any working function we have discussed . 
A:  So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user . 
A:  And also um <other> I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user . 
A:  and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon . <other> 

A:  <laugh> Okay so try to find that for next meeting . <laugh> 
A:  So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working  any working function we have discussed .
