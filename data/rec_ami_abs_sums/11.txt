B:  um we decided to use a kinetic charger , 
B:  standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , 
B:  We wanted a stand-by function . 
B:  The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . 
B:  Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design . 
B:  Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel . 
B:  Um <other> and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . 
B:  Um <other> and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ . 

B:  Prototype presentation . 
A:  Me and William worked on a prototype , 
A:  and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that . 
A:  I can hold it like  
C:  and I'll I'll show you the presentation . 
C:  And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . Um 
C:  It's gonna have a a plastic body <other> um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . 
C:  This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing 
C:  um which there'd be sort of a wide choice  
C:  Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , 
C:  Um <cough> it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design <other> 
C:  and uh <cough> the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um <other> how do you say , it's  yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top 
A:  The black and white touch screen 
C:  and the buttons at the bottom would d 
C:  so so it'll fully close flat . 
C:  we've um already said  d decided on the kinetic batteries , 
C:  which  actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , 
B:  So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , 
C:  Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in <other> 
C:  and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , 
C:  so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . 
C:  So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something . 
C:  Um the standard , there's  be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about . 
C:  obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , 
C:  it would need two separate P_C_B_s , 
C:  so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . 
C:  <other> And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , 
C:  we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . 
C:  And the infrared um sender would be on the  on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the  
C:  So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ . 
C:  And then finally um on to the interface . 
C:  <other> The top screen , as we said , is  would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen 
C:  which  yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , 
C:  uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect . 
C:  And now we've  we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top . 
B:  But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product 
C:  And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , 
C:  as that is  that's the company logo  . 

B:  Um I've now got evaluation criteria . 
D:  This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . 
D:  the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . 
D:  are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? 
D:  So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , 
D:  The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , 
D:  and those  the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . 
D:  <other> The design should minimise R_S_I_ 
D:  and be easy to locate 
D:  and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , 
D:  though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , 
D:  We're going to use a seven point scale , 
D:  where one is true 
D:  and seven is false . 
D:  and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . 
A:  Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market  
D:  w we'll discuss each one 
D:  and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . 
D:  I won't write all of that out again . 
D:  It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , 
D:  Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , 
D:  and we could take an average at the end . 
D:  So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , 
D:  and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who . 
D:  Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . 
D:  My own rating for that would be a two . 
D:  Two and three quarters ? 
D:  criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative . 
D:  I would give that a three . 
C:  I'd give it a one . 
B:  It's just two point five for that one . 
D:  ease of use . 
D:  Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true . 
B:  I would say a two . I would say a two . 
B:  One point seven f five . 
D:  it incorporates current fashion trends , 
D:  I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . 
D:  Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ? 
C:  the the base colour was um <other> white or or like or l sort of a light blue , 
C:  but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any  basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised . 
D:  So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . 
C:  'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , 
D:  In that case it's got to be a one for me . 
C:  Yeah , I'll give it a one as well . 
D:  to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . 
D:  I don't think we've really touched on that a lot . 
D:  we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . 
D:  but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ? 
B:  the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_ 
B:  but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much . 
D:  I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that 
D:  and give it a four . 
C:  I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , 
D:  And finally , last but not least , easy to locate . 
D:  Now we talked about voice recognition , 
D:  we talked about a beeper , 
D:  have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? 
C:  Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , 
D:  And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , that  yeah , that's feasible . 
C:  it would be quite loud . 
B:  And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room . 
D:  That's a one for me . 
C:  <other> I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 
C:  'cause it is our product , 
D:  We've got our our  we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . 
D:  The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , 
D:  i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . 

D:  <other> Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , 
D:  or do we have to make further modifications ? 
B:  I don't think so . 
D:  We happy to go ahead ? 
B:  I think we  yeah . I think we're set . 
D:  I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , 
D:  I'll just leave it there . 
D:  and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . 

B:  I've got finance here now . 
B:  We just type numbers into this 
B:  and we come out with the final value . 
B:  So are we still on for kinetic ? 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . 
B:  Um it might have influenced our choice . 
C:  It was a regular chip on print 
C:  you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , 
C:  there should just be one . 
C:  one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker . 
B:  One double curve . 
C:  'cause it's two . 
B:  what's a single curve then ? 
D:  It would just be a flat bottom with one curve .  like a domed thing . 
B:  <other> Um we've got plastic and rubber , 
A:  I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing , 
B:  See , it says case material . 
B:  we're not actually using plastic in the case , 
D:  There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . 
D:  So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ? 
B:  Or sh we should just put it in as one , 
B:  because the plastic is zero anyway . 
B:  special colour , do we need that ? 
D:  Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours . 
C:  the push-button's one 
C:  and L_C_ display one . 
A:  <other> I think we could change the battery also . 
A:  Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery . 
D:  and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , 
D:  is that going to make a difference ? 
B:  so the highest we've got is the electronics here . Um <other> and the interface . 
D:  If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ? 
C:  it <other> um it would make one difference . 
A:  What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery  . 
C:  but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it . 
C:  If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five . 
B:  If we change it to the battery it's  that's minus three . 

C:  but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it . 
C:  If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five . 
B:  We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version . 
C:  I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , 
C:  because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product . 
D:  We can put in our recommendations . 
D:  If we if we're working to head office specifications as  this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we  the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings . 
D:  Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers 
D:  So if we take voice recognition out  
C:  That'll do it . Twelve point three five . 
A:  we are close to the budget . 
C:  Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ? 
A:  So we are under the budget . 

B:  Product evaluation . 
B:  We've done room for creativity , 
B:  Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't  didn't feel able to make . Um 
B:  I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork . 
D:  Although we had our separate tasks , 
A:  I think we had a nice time . 
D:  there was so much interaction , 
D:  so much that we needed to um bounce off each other . 
D:  in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take 
D:  and adjust our remit where necessary . 
A:  Yeah , I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody . 
A:  We came to a very predic creative design , yeah . 
A:  And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well . 
C:  although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , 
C:  but that's that's good . 
C:  I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually  if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different , 
B:  I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , 
B:  you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model . 

A:  I think we had a nice time . 
D:  Although we had our separate tasks , 
D:  there was so much interaction , 
D:  so much that we needed to um bounce off each other .

B:  I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , 
B:  you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model . 

D:  I think it's really good that this has been very market research based , 
D:  because <other> just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . 
D:  We see it in mobile phones a lot , 
D:  and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . 
D:  There are innovations in that that people don't really want . 
D:  and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based . 

B:  Um <other> our costs are below budget 
B:  with recommendations that they  the budget be increased , 
B:  Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ? And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ? 
D:  I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone . 
D:  I think we've done very well to get within budget 

B:  Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire . 
A:  There's a final questionnaire . 
B:  we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with <other> <laugh> everything that I fell behind with , 

D:  If we if we're working to head office specifications as  this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we  the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings .

C:  That'll do it . Twelve point three five . 

C:  It's gonna have a a plastic body <other> um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . 
C:  This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing 
C:  Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , 
C:  um which there'd be sort of a wide choice  

A:  The black and white touch screen 
C:  <other> The top screen , as we said , is  would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen 

C:  And now we've  we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top . 

D:  We happy to go ahead ?
