A:  this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . 
A:  Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting , 
A:  the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . 
A:  Um and we should each have a presentation to make . 
A:  Um we have certain decisions to make 
A:  <other> Um there are the decisions we have to turn to , 
A:  but we'll come back to them in a minute 
A:  after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . 
A:  Um Sarah , you presented a marketing research report 
A:  um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition . 
A:  And then Steph did a second presentation 
A:  um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . 
A:  Kate presented a working design of  going after  going over the basics on the whiteboard 
A:  um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . 
A:  Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries 
A:  and having a docking place as a selling point . 
A:  we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . 
A:  Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ , 
A:  Um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held . 
A:  <other> Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . 
A:  Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . 
A:  Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . 

D:  first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up , 
D:  which was uh current cost of the competition devices , 
D:  and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros , depending on uh branding . 
D:  But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for , we're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market . 
D:  I investigated the remote control market in greater detail , 
D:  and my uh  the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch . 
D:  What's hot , 
D:  fruit and veg . Spongy . 
D:  And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . <other> 
D:  This is really interesting change from past years , 
D:  because it is much more organic , 
D:  <other> And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . 
D:  on um <other> what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . 
D:  Functional is out . 
D:  Fancy . 
D:  And f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , I'm I'm thinking polished , elegant , <other> you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . 
D:  This is twice as important as the next finding , 
D:  which is technologically innovative . 
D:  This is interesting , 
D:  'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , 
D:  but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically <other> superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances . 
D:  Ease of use . Again , pretty low , 
D:  I mean it's the top three , 
D:  but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . 
D:  I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of <laugh> fruit <laugh> fruit themed sleeves . 
A:  It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone . 
D:  I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress .  you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy . 
D:  initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear . 
D:  They could be interchangeable , 
D:  they're spongy , 
D:  So what we're talking about is changing . this concept . 
D:  Everyone has a T_V_ remote , 
D:  but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the  someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers . 
D:  So I really open this up to uh any other feedback . This <other> spongy fruit and veg . 

D:  What's hot , 
D:  fruit and veg . Spongy . 
D:  And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . <other> 
D:  This is really interesting change from past years , 
D:  because it is much more organic , 
D:  <other> And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . 
D:  on um <other> what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . 
D:  Functional is out . 
D:  Fancy . 
D:  And f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , I'm I'm thinking polished , elegant , <other> you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above .

D:  So I really open this up to uh any other feedback . This <other> spongy fruit and veg . 

B:  I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this . 
B:  Spongy is gonna be difficult , I'm afraid . 
C:  <other> And as for as for um well budgeting as well , if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components . 
B:  we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . 
B:  I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , 
B:  I was thinking titanium myself . 
C:  I have been influenced by pictures of iPods , 
D:  I think many of us would associate those with fancy . 
D:  it would be uh a a very simple product 
D:  that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . So  
A:  Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management 
B:  W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit , 
C:  I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next . 
D:  I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone . 

B:  you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you , 
B:  I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , 
B:  and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , 
B:  who have told me what's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , 
B:  this is the innards of a remote control um . 
B:  and that's the the back of the interface . 
B:  And this is a push-button one , 
B:  so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons 
B:  that go through onto the the board at the back 
B:  and they push these buttons here . 
B:  that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate . 
B:  We got to have something that pushes the little buttons 
B:  that um talk to the chip 
B:  that encodes the message 
B:  that sends the the message to the receiver . 
B:  <laugh> So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source . 
B:  Um we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment . 
B:  We can have a hand  <laugh> 
B:  a wind-up , yeah , 
B:  but i it maybe is  doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg . 
B:  <other> <laugh> Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , 
B:  where um <other> you you actually get the energy by moving the device , 
B:  Or we we had talked about solar power , 
B:  but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark . 
B:  I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case . 
B:  It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , <laugh> or titanium . 
B:  Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber , 
B:  and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , 
B:  but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that . 
B:  what does the interface look like ? 
B:  push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with . <other> 
B:  Um we can have scroll buttons 
B:  and the the scroll button can incorporate a push , 
B:  so you can have it like on a mouse 
B:  where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that 
B:  and push to select something . 
B:  <other> Um you can have multiple scroll buttons , 
B:  And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote , 
B:  but this will increase the cost . <cough> <other> 
B:  Um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , 
B:  If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . 
B:  Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . 
B:  And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . 
B:  I don't know what that is , 
B:  but I think they think it's quite important 
B:  I I think we've got two options . 
B:  We can either go for a really cheap model , 
B:  keep all of the costs down , 
B:  Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , 
B:  I think it , um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple , 
B:  <laugh> Um <other> but it could have an L_C_D_ screen 
B:  and it could have multiple scroll buttons , 
D:  Um do you have any idea if if this could  if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ? 
B:  and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker . <other> 
B:  I'm afraid I don't have that information available . 
B:  Um manufacturing didn't actually give  attach any prices to any of this , I'm afraid . 
C:  so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it . 
C:  I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company . 
C:  That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise . 
B:  We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one , 
B:  which would allow um say a banana , 
B:  but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , 

C:  I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says , 
C:  just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , 
C:  which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . 
C:  Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , 
C:  <other> Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel , 
C:  um what functions we actually need , 
C:  but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . 
C:  It has uh scroll wheels without without a display , 
C:  So I was thinking that uh <other> um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um 
C:  and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . 
C:  and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , 
C:  you can scroll along 
C:  and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen . 
C:  Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , 
C:  um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , 
C:  but still quite simple and quite cost effective . 
C:  what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , 
C:  I was thinking , yellow and black , 
C:  just because that's the company's colours , 
C:  with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , <other> just small along the bottom 
B:  Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea . 
C:  But as for actually arranging them  let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one . 
C:  And I quite like it , 
C:  'cause it's just smooth and hand-held 
C:  and it's got these easily reachable buttons 
C:  so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . Up , down , left , right . 
B:  Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ? 
C:  I I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , 
C:  like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . And enter in the middle , 
C:  and when when you click on each one , it  you can go into a new menu for that . 
C:  And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . 
C:  I mean titanium would be great , 
C:  but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . 
C:  If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too futuristic . 
B:  we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately . 
C:  Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else . 
B:  <other> And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea , 
B:  I think I think that's a g nice clean design , 
C:  But they all have this this feature of this uh  It's not quite a scroll wheel , but it's a kind of selection in this circle , 
B:  But we can implement it with simple push buttons , 
C:  either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , <other> uh and then also <other> when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down . 
C:  So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle . 
D:  <other> It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic , 
D:  Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? And have it abstract . 
D:  we could call <other> like a fruit name , 
B:  Mm . We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather  if you feel  if you like the spongy  
D:  I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so  
C:  Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention 
C:  This is actually the volume up and down , 
C:  but <other> they both say V_ on them , 
C:  so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these . 
C:  But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down . 
C:  If we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions . 

A:  Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things . 
A:  They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , 
A:  which  the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar . 
A:  You were saying that the kinetic would be useful , 
A:  um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . Um 
A:  or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it . 
B:  unfortunately I don't have costing information . 
B:  I i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , 
A:  What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ? 
D:  I've used kinetic in terms of watches 
D:  you don't even notice um that it's there . 
C:  I've never come across it before , 
C:  but it sounds fantastic . 
C:  it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient . 
C:  a good selling point . 
A:  So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible . 
C:  But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs . 
A:  Mm . 
A:  Um <laugh> the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision . 
B:  Um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique 
B:  um and I would certainly recommend it , I think , 
A:  Um what about the case ? 
A:  I think they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber , 
C:  Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy Yeah , s thick spongy cover , 
A:  and I think we've discussed not having titanium . 
A:  Um we've sort of eliminated wood . 
A:  We said plastic or rubber . 
B:  I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible , 
B:  but I agree , it's uh  sounds like a nice idea if it is . 
A:  Um the next part they want is the user interface concept . 
D:  Then I'll just say I support either  from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that . 
C:  like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen . 
C:  I'd  like push buttons with  

A:  Marketing they want product evaluation . 
A:  you get product <other> evaluation . 

A:  And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , 
A:  Um the look and feel design is for Kate , 

A:  And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , 
A:  uh Steph gets the user interface design , 

A:  Um the two of you <laugh> get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype . 

A:  So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible . 

C:  Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy Yeah , s thick spongy cover ,
