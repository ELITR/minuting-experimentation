A:  Right well um from the last meeting <laugh> I was trying to send you the minutes , 
A:  but uh it didn't work out too well , 
A:  so maybe in sort of um quick summary of the last uh meeting , I can quickly give you what we what we had . 
A:  Right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . 
A:  We had uh made our decisions about uh made our decisions about uh the device itself , 
A:  that it was gonna be simple to make it uh enable us to complete the project in time . 
A:  We're gonna have uh effectively two pages , 
A:  a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted , 
A:  and then the uh the backup features on the second page so that it could uh meet the technical requirements . 

B:  For the components design , um next step is 
B:  basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . 
B:  We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . 
B:  Then there is a chip 
B:  and still the sender . 
B:  So um yes  including the power s supply as well . 
B:  Uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , 
B:  There's a dynamo . 
B:  There's a kinetic option , 
B:  which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . 
B:  but I think that was gonna cost a little more . 
B:  And then there's solar cells . Um as a final option . 
B:  For the buttons , we have um an integrated push button , 
B:  which I guess is just the same as the standard ones . 
B:  This says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal  for like uh like modern computer . 
B:  Um there's a scroll wheel which is  you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , 
B:  Um one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , 
B:  if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , 
A:  What would be the cost do do we know ? 
B:  I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons , 
B:  but it does affect the printed circuit board . 
B:  The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board . 
B:  So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button . 
B:  Um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . 
B:  There's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost , 
B:  Um going to my personal preferences , um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic 
B:  And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . 
B:  Um for the buttons , I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . 
B:  So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board . 
B:  Um and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . 
B:  if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . I'm guessing . 
B:  Uh but I don't know , 
B:  so that is something I'll have to look into . 

B:  So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button . 
B:  So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board . 
B:  Um and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . 
B:  if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . I'm guessing . 
B:  Uh but I don't know , 
B:  so that is something I'll have to look into . 

B:  Um that's a that's a decision for all of us . Um . 
A:  So are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue , 
A:  I mean one way is to do each of the presentations 
A:  and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were . 
C:  that's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away . 
A:  so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular  and what required advance . Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time 
B:  As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel , 
B:  The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information . Um . 
A:  the scroll wheel required the regular , 
A:  The display requires an advanced chip 
B:  And note that the push button just requires a simple chip , 
C:  Yeah , and if we're going for sleek and sexy , I think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky ? 
B:  So maybe just a simple push button , 
C:  Yeah , a simple pushbuttons . 
B:   Did everyone get this on the speech recognition ? 
B:  So it is basically the concept we discussed before . 
B:  Um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board . 
A:  So if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? 
D:  I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we  m make a decision . 
C:  But the way that I interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly , 
C:  it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message . 
C:  So I don't think it would effect our circuit board . 
B:  so we'd have a simple circuit board 
C:  And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it . 
B:  so we'd stick with the simple circuit board 
A:  W w kinetic . 
B:  I I thought so just for  just for ease of not having to replace the batteries . 
B:  Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement . 
D:  Just just for the call and find thing . 
A:  Are we going for speech recognition ? 
B:  It's it's just an addition thing 
A:  And so we would want it in as an extra 
B:  but  Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later . 

C:  So I don't think it would effect our circuit board .

C:  Um okay , so very brief presentation , um . 
C:  From looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly um sleek and sexy . 
C:  Um I haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there , 
C:  um but there's some curved cases that you can see , uh a range of sizes uh . 
C:  All of them have a lot of buttons there um 
C:  Um some of the uh remotes that I looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um where it was connected to the remote control functions . 
C:  And uh it was quite uh a swish model , 
C:  I mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing 
C:  Um the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , um there's examples of those , 
C:  but they don't look as sleek as other models . 
C:  and  because it impacts on other  on the materials and the price it's not great . 
C:  Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , um . 
C:  There was children's remote , 
C:  where um they just had a very limited range of buttons 
C:  and they were b uh bright and colourful 
C:  and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels . 
A:  Well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market 
A:  The one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications . 
A:  So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , 
A:  and then you could have additional features 
A:  You'd have model one , model two and model three , 
B:  So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step , 
A:  and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments .

A:  and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments . 

C:  Um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design . 
C:  Um just to avoid ambiguity . 
C:  Um I think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up , 
C:  they might see yeah , they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down , 
C:  whereas the actual button's pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up . 
C:  So , be careful what you put on the buttons 
C:  and be careful of the shape that you make them , 
C:  because they might be kind of two um contradicting kind of shapes . 
B:  So maybe we could have volume written on the side 

D:  I've I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching . 
D:  Right , um I've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market 
D:  that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . 
D:  And we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment . 
D:  So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the uh fashion trends . 
D:  The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional . 
D:  And second , there should be some technological innovation . 
D:  And then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well . 
D:  And apparently , the fashion trends <laugh> are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme . 
D:  <laugh> Um but um the feel of the material should be spongy , 
D:  we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else . 
D:  And then also try and add in technological informat innovation 
D:  which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap . 
D:  And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations . 
D:  So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , 
D:  or the the buttons could be spongy , uh somehow . 
D:  And then sort of even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote , 
D:  How how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends , 
D:  do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , 
D:  or or you know , do they not matter that much ? 

C:  I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use . 
A:  Well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons , 
C:  Maybe just one button , 
B:  I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends . 
B:   to something which is maybe more universal . 
C:  But I suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design , 
B:  Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about , um . 
B:  Maybe still with a rubber design we could  
A:  The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ? 
A:  Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle . 
A:  You're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that , 
B:  I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual  
B:  Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions 
B:  like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . 
C:  Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case , 
C:  But we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme , aren't we ? 
A:  You could have your company badge and logo . 
A:  I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there , it actually has a sort of um stick on badge 
B:  And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider . 
D:  I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into . 
C:  Okay , so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case  
D:  whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year , you know . 

C:  say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . 
C:  Maybe that could be a little apple . 
A:  th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you're looking for functionality . 
A:  If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's uh <other> I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever . 
C:  It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as well as buttons . 
A:  Rubber buttons require rubber case .  
C:  Okay , so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case  
D:  whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year , you know . 
B:   it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case , 
B:  and then have the standard rubber buttons as well . 
B:  Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? 
B:  But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine . <laugh> 
A:  one thing to consider is that in some ways you want um  by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other 
A:  therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can  if you can store them up on top of each other . 
C:  Shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ? 
B:  We'll go for single curve , yeah . 
D:  And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit . <laugh> Or veg . 
A:  so it's not really spongy feel buttons , it's just rubber buttons . 
D:  Could be a red apple , yeah . 
C:  Yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can , 
C:  'Cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain . 
C:  Uh just to keep the shape of the buttons simple . 

None

A:   I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever . 

None

B:  So maybe just a simple push button , 
C:  Yeah , a simple pushbuttons . 
A:  Alright , so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons , 
B:  So did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply ? 

B:  so we'd stick with the simple circuit board 

A:  but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here 

C:  I think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function . 
A:  the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote . 
C:  and and the voice recognition , we can use that can't we , just to find it . Without affecting the circuit board . 

C:  say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . 
C:  Maybe that could be a little apple . 
D:  And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit . <laugh> Or veg . 
D:  Could be a red apple , yeah . 

C:  It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as well as buttons . 
A:  Rubber buttons require rubber case .  
C:  Shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ? 
B:  We'll go for single curve , yeah . 
C:  And the rubber push buttons , rubber case . 
C:  Yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can , 

A:  I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there , it actually has a sort of um stick on badge 
A:  You could have your company badge and logo . 

None
