A:  Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one . 
A:  And  take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . 
A:  And we have  think I got a new project requirement . 
A:  So I think uh teletext becomes outdated . 
A:  and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , 
A:  So the popularity of the  since the popularity of the internet , 
A:  so the remote control should be only used for the the television . 
A:  And of course we should have our image  in the in the design . 
A:  So , let's start with the the industrial designer . 

C:  <laugh> Right , so um I will talk about the the w working design and  
C:  And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the  our new remote control for television . 
C:  So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do . 
C:  I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market 
C:  and what what is the the cheapest possible <laugh> things we hav we can use . 
C:  Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype 
C:  And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that . 
C:  And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . 
C:  So , wha what I think <laugh> for now <laugh> is <other> we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired 
C:  so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the  . 
C:  Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . 
C:  And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication 
C:  So uh this is the <laugh> the schema of the <laugh> o of the future uh remote controls 
C:  so uh you can you can see the components , uh battery 
C:  and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set . 
C:  The one on top is for the um  well the functionali the functionalities 
D:  One is a communication . 
C:  and the the th red um  sorry the green one is is to  well , putting things together , 
C:  um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to  uh to communicate with the T_V_ set . 

C:  I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for <laugh> for the functionalities which is easy to to t 
B:  What is F_P_G_A_ ? 
D:  It's a field programmable gateway arrays . 
B:  So why's it  how is it different from the Bluetooth ? 
C:  Well , uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can  pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want . 
C:  And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices . 
B:  So this are the  they have to work together ? 
B:  Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice  
C:  Well , th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send . 
D:  Or it's something like  isn't hardware the first one ? 
D:  And the second one is for the software . 
D:  Okay , and how about the battery power ? 
D:  Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? 
C:  I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the  
C:  And uh I I don't think it will need um <other> very uh much power to make it run , so  
B:  Mm . You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it . 
C:  It's a good idea . 
D:  Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . 
D:  People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . 
D:  We just make a small charger 
B:  Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ? 
D:  we do not want to make it P_D_A_ . <laugh> 
C:  Also , but but <laugh> I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote <laugh> control . 

B:  So I'm working on the technical functions design . 
B:  So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . 
B:  So <laugh> so I found on a webs on the internet 
B:  and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . 
B:  <laugh> For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . 
B:  So I found two very good prototypes for <laugh> for this interface from our competitors 
A:  This are usual functionality  . 
B:  Ours is a bit uh different . 
B:  So these are two example . 
B:  One is from <other>  
B:  the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah . 
B:  This is the most competing prototypes I've found <laugh> . 

B:  But then uh loo but then I found if you look at  you see on the left one there are too many buttons  
A:  And they are small  . 
B:  O on the right I tried to play with <other> the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number 
B:  so it's very lousy . 
B:  <laugh> So you <laugh> so you move to the next the next one . 
B:  And then I I look at the user manual 
B:  they are a hundred pages thick , 
B:  so we don't want that . 

B:  <laugh> So I propose the easy to use uh prototype . 
B:  You can navigate on T_V_ screen 
B:  and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end  in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ 
B:  and we need some  to do some preprocessing . 
B:  From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the <laugh> on the remote controller , right ? 
B:  <laugh> And then we  the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in  we may K_I_V_ . 
A:  What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ 
B:  Yeah , all the processing is done  the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the  <laugh> 
A:  So we should have specific T_V_ ? 
C:  We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah because  <laugh> are you just wondering what controller  okay . 
C:  I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that 
C:  and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because  

B:  So I come up with a simple design , 
B:  just keep the v navigation buttons . <laugh> 
C:  Yes , that's a good idea , I think . 
C:  We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to  i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh <other>  
C:  Well , f four five buttons , it's sufficient . 
C:  It's easy to build , 
C:  it does not consume much power . <laugh> 
D:  Oh , but you have a catch there , 
D:  um assume that um if you want to go to  if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then <imitates zapping> . 
C:  Well , then y you you go to the main menu 
C:  and uh you have uh go to channel 
B:  No , because you choose by channel , 
B:  so you don't have hundred channels to choose from . 
C:   but uh I I think i i  if you if you want to to make uh  well a a big jump <laugh>  but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could  
C:  but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , 
C:  well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or  
C:  we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that . 
B:  Uh it's gonna be small . 
B:  So it'll beep if you wanna find it 
D:  too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . <laugh> 
B:  you just uh shout  y h just  
B:  it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . 
D:   just  give it a name and we call him . 
B:  <laugh> And  responds to you , and  <laugh> 

D:  Okay , after having the inputs from <other> industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . 
D:  And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , 
D:  and the users send the feedbacks , 
D:  and based on that  These are the findings which we got 
D:  and  yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote 
D:  And next one was the size of the remote control . 
D:  It has to be of course a very slim and small one . 
D:  And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , 
D:  I mean we have to look for a trade-off . 
D:  The features and the cost . 
B:  <other> I no  I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost . 
B:  Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , 
D:  Little bit more if it's with extra features . 
C:  Yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think  
D:  but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . 
D:  I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . 
D:  And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages . 
D:  It's going to be very slim . 
D:   it's not going to take much space also . 
C:  And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons 
D:  Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . 
B:  I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited  you have limited vocabulary  
B:  But I think if you  to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem . 
C:  Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts 
C:  we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well  yes a microphone into the the remote control , so  
A:  What about lighting adaptive options ? 
D:  Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but <other> I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . 

C:  Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts 
B:  But I think if you  to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem .

C:  we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well  yes a microphone into the the remote control , so  
A:  What about lighting adaptive options ? 
D:  Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but <other> I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . 
A:  According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that . 
B:  but it's quite possible 
B:  but maybe not in this project . 
A:  So any things to to discuss ? 
D:  I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing . 
D:  The speech interface 
D:  and uh less uh reasonable uh cost . 
D:  And the lighting adaptation 
D:  and the teletext . 
D:  And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . 
D:  If you are watching an foreign movie , you get  subtitles sometimes . 
D:  And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . 
D:  And if I am a German then I would like to have the  my options in German . 
D:  So , the remote  it should have some  it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . 

C:  Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? 
C:  I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ? 
C:  Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh <other> about a way to to access the internet via the television . 
C:  Yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . 
C:  So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a  w which will c which will come in a few years . 
A:  So you have to anticipate the the future ? 
C:  well , not not to implement it , 
C:  but to  well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a  yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital , right . 

B:  Mm . You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it . 
C:  It's a good idea . 
D:  We just make a small charger 

A:  and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , 
D:  Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but <other> I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . 
A:  According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that . 

D:  um assume that um if you want to go to  if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then <imitates zapping> . 
C:  Well , then y you you go to the main menu 
C:  and uh you have uh go to channel 
B:  No , because you choose by channel , 
C:   but uh I I think i i  if you if you want to to make uh  well a a big jump <laugh>  but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could  
C:  but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , 
C:  well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or
