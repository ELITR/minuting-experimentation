A:  Uh now we're going um into the functional design . 
A:  Then our agenda . 
A:  first the opening . 
A:  Uh this time I will take the minutes . 
A:  Uh you're going to have a presentation . All of you . 
A:  Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations . 
A:  So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , 
A:  and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements 
A:  And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include . 
D:  My name is Freek Van Ponnen . 
D:  I'm the Market Expert . 
D:  We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab 
D:  where we observed um users operating remote controls . 
D:  Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . 
D:  Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved . 
D:  these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . 
D:  uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . 
D:  Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . 
D:  Um in addition remotes were not very functional . 
D:  Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . 
D:  And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . 
D:  Then we did some research to the most relevant functions . 
D:  Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . 
D:  The power button got a nine . 
D:  And teletext got a six and a half . 
D:  Then there are some one-time use function . 
D:  That uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . 
D:  Which are not really used very frequently , 
D:  but are still considered to be of some importance . 
D:  Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour . 
D:  Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . 
D:  the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market . 
D:  They are not really very interested in features . 
D:  But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . 
D:  What I think this indicates for our um design . I think we should make a remote for the future . 
D:  And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . 
D:  Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . 
D:  Um  The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ . 
D:  And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . 
D:  I think we should make very few buttons . 
D:  Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . 

D:  But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . 
D:  And this would , could get a button in it 
D:  which would send a signal to the remote 
D:  which would then beep . 
D:  So you'd know where it is in the room . 
D:  And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . 
D:  Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . 
D:  This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . 
D:  This would also greatly increase the production costs 
D:  but I think these are just some small factors we could consider . 

B:  I've been looking at uh the user interface of it . Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it . Um  
B:  I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control . 
B:  I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control . 
B:  Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet 
B:  and  not much information about it ,   Um about uh interface 
B:  Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television , uh stereo . 
B:  But uh it must be uh user-friendly . 
B:  you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh  Yeah . Uh uh uh  Yeah . In one um remote control . 
B:  you can see , this is uh quite simple uh remote control . 
B:  but uh  This uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons . 
B:  what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are . 
B:  like uh the on-off uh button . Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button . 
B:  My personal uh preferences um . 
B:  Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device . 
B:  And um here you've got a s kind of a display . 
B:  It's a touchscreen . 
B:  you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh  . 
B:  And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device . 
B:  you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device . 
B:  We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh 
B:  Everybody uh have to use it so  Uh ol even even old people um young people . 
B:  we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large . 
C:  I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros . 
B:  N I I don't think so . 
B:  Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . S um it's uh not uh in colour or something . 
D:  it would certainly make a fancy design . 
C:  But the  It wouldn't be very robust . 

C:  I've got a presentation about the working design . 
C:  Um first about how it works . 
C:  Everybody knows how a remote works . 
C:  The user presses a button . 
C:  The remote determines what button it is , 
C:  uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . 
C:  The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . 
C:  we've got um the the plate . 
C:  It gots conductive disks for every button . 
C:  When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , 
C:  goes to the LED 
C:  and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ . 
C:  this is a schematic overview . 
C:  You've got the buttons . 
C:  The power source . 
C:  And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . 
C:  I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . 
C:  Keep the inner workings simple , 
C:  Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , 
C:  and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . 
C:  it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . 
A:  so I'm here to mess things up 
A:  and uh tell you some new uh requirements . 
A:  we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . 
A:  Um that's because <other> uh it will be too complex 
A:  and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions . 
A:  Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , 
A:  because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . 
A:  Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . Uh that's the the market we have to to to target , 
A:  because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . 
A:  And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . 
A:  So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . 

A:  I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions . 
A:  <laugh> Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . Um  
D:  'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature 
D:  But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access 
D:  within the next like twenty years is very slim . 
D:  In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . 
D:  So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . 
D:  Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small . 
D:  But I mean if I s if I see this , it's  I think we're just gonna go for another 
A:  Standard remote . 
A:  I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons 
A:  Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach 
A:  if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now . 
A:  But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think   the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it . 
C:  I think that if we're  If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um  I don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ? 
C:  if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think . 
C:  We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . 
A:  Uh I think teletext can be uh 
A:  um can be a function as well . But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost , 
B:  But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles . 
D:  I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext . 
A:  Is anybody um really against teletext ? 
A:  I think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles . 
A:  I think uh that's very important we have a few buttons . 
B:  So we can s we can skip the display , 
A:  But do you need the buttons for one to zero . 
D:  Think if you're gonna include teletext you do . 
A:  Or a joystick like ? 
A:  maybe we can implement the scroll button ? 
A:  Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or  
D:  but um I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast . 
D:  And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . 
C:  If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . 
C:  So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout . 
A:  I think it's very important in the in the design . 
A:  You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . 
D:  But I don't think  I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_ , you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible . 
A:  you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station . 
D:  I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons 
D:  But I don't think we should spend very much time in that . 
A:  Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ? 
C:  And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible 
C:  we're just gonna focus on the extras ? 
A:  I think so . 
D:  fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost . 
A:  So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something . 
C:  Like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound . 
D:  you have it's on some phones too , 
D:  which have a docking station . 
D:  And you just press a button 
D:  and the phone goes ringing . 
A:  point is the L_C_D_ screen . 
A:   Uh another 
A:  Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much , 
C:  um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 
D:  it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , 
D:  which would explain a button if you press it . 
D:  And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen , 
A:  Just the L_C_D_ . 
A:  That's a good idea . 
A:  Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions  
A:  And default materials . I think that's a good idea as well , 
A:  Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . 
A:  If we want um a  with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can 
A:  target the real elderly people . 
A:   Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example . 
D:  But I'd have to look into that a little more . 
D:  And with uh the little screen in it ,  which explains the buttons . You could  I think we n it would be a lot easier to 
D:  adapt it to different cultures . 
D:  If we're able to really bring an innovative product . 
D:  I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , 
D:  and we're focusing on elderly people here 
D:  which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , 

A:  <other> Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept , 

A:  User Interface Designer the user interface concept , 
A:  and the trend-watching . 

A:  we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . 

A:  Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . 
A:   Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example . 

None

A:  Uh I think teletext can be uh 
A:  um can be a function as well . But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost , 

A:  Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions

D:  which would explain a button if you press it . 

D:  it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , 

A:  In different languages , you know . 
D:  adapt it to different cultures . 
D:  And with uh the little screen in it ,  which explains the buttons . You could  I think we n it would be a lot easier to 

C:  I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros . 
B:  N I I don't think so . 
B:  Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . S um it's uh not uh in colour or something .
