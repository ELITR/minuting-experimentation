B:  let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . 
B:  Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , 
B:  uh show you some samples , uh 
B:  uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . 
B:  And uh my personal preferences . 
B:  <other> Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . 
B:  the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . 
B:  The channels buttons , one to nine , 
B:  zero to nine , 
B:  and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . 
B:  Uh the volume and channel quadrants , 
B:  uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . 
B:  And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . 
B:  Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples . 
B:  Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's  that they're all pretty uh uh high uh  
D:  Large . 
D:  A lot  a lot of buttons buttons . 
B:  Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long . 
B:  Um , power buttons are mostly at the top 
B:  uh left or right . 
B:  Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . 
B:  And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . 
B:  Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , 
B:  but we don't use that . 
B:  But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . 
B:  Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ . 
B:  So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that . 
A:  For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? 
A:  We don't have buttons for the menu . 
A:  Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel  . 
B:  I thought that was our uh idea . 
B:  And that the menu button is okay . 
A:  Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows . 
B:  The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean . 

B:  Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . 
B:  But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . 
B:  Uh , round edges . 
B:  The logo at the bottom . 
B:  And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . 
B:  Uh , recognisable . 
A:  <laugh> Not too much colours . 
B:  Uh , no . Not too much . 
B:  But this has to be has to be trendy 
B:  Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion . 

C:  Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want , 
C:  our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . 
C:  And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . 
C:  First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . 
C:  Like , totally yellow , totally red . 
C:  Uh , the shapes are curved and round , 
C:  Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . 
C:  But to give him the shape of your hand , so you  it's easier to use or something like that . 
C:  The battery , there are few options . 
C:  Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . 
C:  Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice  have it curved . 
C:  And maybe like it's hand-shaped . 
C:  Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic 
C:  And also rubber 
C:  And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the  for remote control , 
C:  that we then use the primary colours . 

C:  Uh the push-buttons . 
C:  We have one new thing uh discovered . 
C:  It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . 
C:  Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . 
C:  When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up 
C:  and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel . 
C:  You can do it with your thumb . 
C:  And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons 
C:  The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . 
C:  There are also uh simple chips . 
C:  They are uh cheaper . 
C:  Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , 
C:  And you have also advanced um chips . 
C:  But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . 
C:  And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , 
C:  Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . 
C:  A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . 
C:  The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip . 

D:  This is with an L_C_D_ ? No , 
A:  But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel . 
C:  And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news . 
C:  but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls . 
C:  And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . 
C:  <laugh> I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . 
D:  And that might uh bring back the costs uh  
C:  I think we must discuss who  uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . 
C:  With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control . 
C:  Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ . 
A:  Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . 
C:  Not with an L_C_D_ . 
A:  But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . 
C:  but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . 
A:  but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . 
C:  Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control . 
D:  Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ? 
C:  But I don't know uh how much higher . <laugh> 
D:  I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better . 
C:  The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip . 

D:  So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching . 
D:  Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . 
D:  They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan . 
D:  Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . 
D:  Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products . 
D:  And um , material ? That should feel  have uh a spongy feeling . 
D:  Then the old and rich . 
D:  They like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes . 
D:  We uh aim at the younger market . 
D:  Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . 
D:  However , with trends it's always if there's  it's now . 
D:  It it it might last one year , and next year it be  uh can be totally different . 

A:  Well , we have to decide on the concept . 
A:  Maybe one of you can paint it on the board . 
D:  Can make several uh concepts . 
D:  We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand . 
C:  This is the remote control . 
C:  And then you have something like th this under it . 
A:  So , it has to be soft ? 
C:  And it has to be soft , yeah . 
C:  Buttons on top of it . 
C:  The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb . 
C:  But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . 
D:  If we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ? 
C:  with the menu uh button . 
C:  And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . 
A:  But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu . 
C:  Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu . 
A:  Yeah , but <laugh> again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? 
C:  And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher . 
A:  we make two concepts . 
A:  One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ . 
C:  And and this one has to be soft . 
C:  And this has to be harder , 
B:  And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . 
A:  It's not good to use . 
C:  Or some kind of rubber around it . 
A:  One with two scroll buttons and one with without . 
A:  Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu . 
A:  And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ . 
B:  Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose . 
A:  Then it depends on the cost . 
D:  M uh yeah , maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um 
D:  more separate , yeah . 
D:  Like , you have the menu button in between uh  
C:  I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for . 
A:  When you uh  the menu , you have to go there there there there . 
D:  We have two buttons missing . 
D:  The mute button . 
A:  Mute . And the other . 
C:  Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle . 
C:  With the switch button . 
A:  But how do you wanna solve it ? 
A:  Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy . 
C:  Uh , then you can also have like uh th um  
C:  Yeah , and joystick , I think . 
A:  Or a small one just like in a laptop . 
A:  Does that break , a joystick ? 
A:  But how expensive it is ? <laugh> 
A:  For the young peoples I think scroll button's good . 
A:  That's not expensive than uh  Joystick is better . 
C:  I mean the the shape of the remote control . 
C:  Just like a Playstation thing . 
A:  Maybe , if it's possible , <other> it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . 
A:  Then for the components , we use a normal battery . 
A:  Then it's  Ch cheapest way , I think . 
A:  Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . 
C:  Now we put uh rubber around it . 
C:  Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . 

C:  Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . 
A:  Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ . 
C:  If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . 
C:  If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip . 
A:  And uh , we  If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to 
C:  Uh the most expensive . 
A:  So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ 
C:  Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? 
A:  If you have pistol , it  L_C_D_'s not easy . 
C:  if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller . 
A:  Then this is the design . 
A:  And the buttons are on the next page . 
A:  So , depends on the cost . 
D:  And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? 
C:  they're not uh in details . 
C:  It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ? <laugh> 
A:  So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it . 

A:  Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . 

A:  You two stay here . <laugh> 
A:  It has to be ready in the next meeting . 

A:  Then for the components , we use a normal battery . 
A:  Then it's  Ch cheapest way , I think . 

C:  Now we put uh rubber around it . 
C:  Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . 

A:  But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . 
C:  And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news . 
D:  I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better . 
D:  And that might uh bring back the costs uh  
C:  And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher . 

A:  Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . 
D:  Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ? 
C:  <laugh> I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . 
C:  But I don't know uh how much higher . <laugh> 
C:  The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip . 
A:  So , depends on the cost . 

A:  but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . 
C:  but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . 
C:  Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control . 
A:  But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu . 
C:  Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu . 
A:  Yeah , but <laugh> again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? 

B:  And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger .
