D:  It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling . 
D:  <other> Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too . 
D:  <other> Uh the last point is easy to use . 

D:  So it must be very bright , very colourful . 
D:  Fruit and vegetables are cool . 
A:  Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . 

D:  Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong . 
D:  I was thinking of something like uh <other> well uh iron plate over it , 

C:  Uh the buttons of course rubber , 
C:  uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . 
C:  But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , 
C:  And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote , 
C:  Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . 
C:  No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , 
C:  so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , 

B:  Um it's not really speech recognition , 
B:  and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . 
B:  No it doesn't does not do anything . 

C:  Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours . 
C:  And also they like curved round shapes . 

C:  Can you draw it now ? 

C:  And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ? 
C:  Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? 
D:  Yeah , fine . <laugh> 
B:  And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . 

D:  But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part . 
B:  if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should . 
B:  Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy . 

C:  Well a case ? Uh that's me . 
C:  <other> Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , 
C:  And then the front is made of plastic . 
A:  Titanium back , plastic front . 
A:  Okay . 

D:  I think we can launch a couple of packages . 
A:  Launch different lines at once . 

A:  Industry designer ,  . User Interface , Mike . You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . 

A:  Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means , 

C:  Uh the buttons of course rubber , 
C:  I think everyone agrees . 

C:  so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , 
C:  But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , 

A:  Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . 
D:  Yeah , that's great . 

B:  Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . 
C:  Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? 
C:  And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ? 
B:  And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . 
D:  Yeah , fine . <laugh> 

B:  Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and  uh and that kind of stuff <laugh> 

A:  Maybe a a cheap voice recording . 
C:  We all agree on that . Yeah . 

C:  Well a case ? Uh that's me . 
C:  <other> Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , 
C:  And then the front is made of plastic . 
A:  Titanium back , plastic front . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ? 
D:  Yeah . Round . 

D:  So uh a little corner of titanium . 

A:  all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work . 

D:  I think we can launch a couple of packages . 
A:  Launch different lines at once . 
C:  Yeah but you you can have some basic colours , 

C:  But you can put it on the back , 
B:  Ah the logo should be on the top I think . 
B:  Right corner , yes . 
A:  Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo 
A:  and logo also on the front 

C:  Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , 

C:  Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , 
C:  but it doesn't have a really really tough look . So  
D:  But the feel of plastic isn't strong . <other> 

B:  and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . 
B:  Um it's not really speech recognition , 
B:  No it doesn't does not do anything . 

D:  When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match . 
C:  and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . 
C:  but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , 

C:  Well yeah . Um I think um <other> a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be  
B:  Uh I I'd say only the logo . 
C:  Well , our slogan is not very long . 
C:  But you can put it on the back , 
B:  Ah the logo should be on the top I think . 
B:  Right corner , yes . 
A:  Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo 
A:  and logo also on the front
