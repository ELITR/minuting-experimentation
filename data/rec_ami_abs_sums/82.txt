A:  Okay . So first , <other> let's uh see the prototype . 

C:  And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this <other> jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . <other> 
C:  So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume . 
C:  And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours . 
C:  For the L_C_D_ . 
B:  It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . 
A:  The scroll-wheel , okay . 
C:  One L_C_D_ displayed . 

C:  And we have speech recognition . 
C:  And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . 
C:  And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition . <other> 

None

C:  <other> Material , we want to stick to titanium . 
A:  wh what are the strawberries for ? <laugh> 
C:  The case is silver titanium , no ? 
C:  So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours . 
C:  Titanium . 

A:  let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium . <laugh> 
D:  so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . 
D:  One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . 
D:  what do you think , is it fancy ? <laugh> 
D:  So here , two . Up . 
D:  Then we have uh technology . 
D:  d I think it's a one for that , at least . 
D:  Robustness , uh-huh . 
A:  It's um robust , yeah . 
D:  Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? 
D:  Okay , two . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> So size and weight . 
D:  Up to three for that , 
D:  Colour and shape . 
D:  I suggested three . 
D:  And uh the last one is adaptive . 
A:  Okay . <other> Let's go for one . <laugh> 
D:  Now we have to do the average . <laugh> 
D:  Two point one seven . 
A:  So now , it has to fulfil the <laugh> financial criterium ? 
D:  So we are at seventeen dot eight . 

D:  Project evaluation , good . <sound indicating relief> 
A:  Mm . See mm how  <other> Are we a good team ? Mm . 
A:  Is there enough room for creativity ? 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  Team-work , very strong , I would say . 

None

D:  So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay , 

A:  Apparently , we have to choose one or the other . <other> 
D:  if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_ 
D:  and the speaker . 
B:  So , put minus one there , please . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> I'm not sure if this is legal . 
D:  Okay , we're uh on target . 

A:  wh what are the strawberries for ? <laugh> 
B:  That's location sensors . 
A:  <other> And what about the strawberries on the top ? 

A:  <laugh> I'm not convince . 
D:  <cough> Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year . 

D:  So we are at seventeen dot eight . 

A:  <other> So think of what we can cut uh here . <laugh> 
D:  Are we supposed to cut things out now ?
