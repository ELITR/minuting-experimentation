A:  we're making a remote control 
A:  Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , 
A:  and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me <other> tell us what's possible 
A:  and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go 
A:  and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible 

A:  for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it ,

B:  Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . 
C:  does anybody have any initial ideas ? 
D:  as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door

C:  so touch screen design rather than button 
C:  so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things . 
A:  maybe like an L_  like a touch screen type of remote ? 
B:  I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important ,

B:  maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote . 
A:  Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing 
A:  that you could place something else 
A:  and it makes the remote page .
