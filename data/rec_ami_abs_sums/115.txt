D:  Do you know how how I can wake it up ? 
C:  I've lost my screen . Uh  <laugh> 
B:  Never close your laptop . 

A:  Well , welcome to the kick-off meeting . 
A:  Well , this is the agenda for today . 
A:  examples of the tool training , project plan discussion and the closing . 
A:  Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control . 
A:  Uh , some of the <other> oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly . 
A:  Um , I  oh forget  I forget the whole acquaintance part , but we we all know each other . 
A:  Uh we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . 
A:  Every uh level of design consists of some individual work , and we uh close it with a meeting . 

A:  Uh , some of the <other> oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly . 

A:  Okay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools . 
A:  This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now . 
A:  there's a document folder called um the sh <other> shared document folder . 
A:  so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . 
A:  There is a tool-bar over here . 
A:  It's like a very simple uh paint application . 
A:  and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button . 
A:  and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , 
A:  Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards . 
A:  Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , 
A:  Well , I'm gonna draw um a p piranha . Uh , a fish . 
A:  And uh  so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths . 
B:  but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird . 
A:  and then we are uh through the tool training , I guess . 

A:  Okay , this is uh something about the project finance . 
A:  The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros . 
A:  And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros . 
A:  The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , 
A:  and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control . 

A:  well , we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . 
D:  I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , 
D:  but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever . 
D:  Uh , so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with 
D:  uh grouped buttons , you know . 
A:  And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um  what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ? 
A:  Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh  
A:  Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or uh  

D:  Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders . 
B:   I thought it was only for television . 
B:  So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ . 
A:  Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well . 

A:  The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course , 
A:  The User Interface Designer <other> 
A:  the technical functions design . 
A:  And the Management Expert of uh  the Marketing Expert . User requirements specifi 
A:  I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down 
A:  I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes . <laugh> 
A:  We'll see each other in uh thirty minutes .
