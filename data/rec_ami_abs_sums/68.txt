A:  I'm Ada Longmund , 
A:  and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager . 
A:  Our project project is to create um a new remote control 
A:  so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly . 
A:  if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work 
A:  and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other . 
A:  Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . Uh . 
A:  the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . <laugh> 
A:  it will uh be a an international remote control , 
A:  I think it's quite good price , yeah . 
A:  and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . 
A:  try to create something new 
A:  And <other> and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , 
A:  you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role 
A:  you will have to work on the design 
A:  and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control 
A:  and think of the user requirement specifications . 
D:  Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think . AMI 
C:  I_D_ is for the Industrial Design , 
C:  And U_I_D_ , it's for the User Interface Designer , 
A:  I will manage all all the group . 
D:  and Marketing Expert , it's me . 
B:  what's the difference between 
B:  user interface design d industrial design ? <laugh>

A:  and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it . 
C:  I I think the user the user interface design is  he will design how the user will you know  the relation between the user and you know the remote control so  
C:  And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like . 
A:  Maybe , it is the outside and the inside . 
C:  'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know . 
D:  I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have 
D:  and then thi this would <other> I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer . 
A:  so really the remote control to be international . 
A:  And not too expensive . 
A:  And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now .
