A:  Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , 
A:  for us to go over the previous minutes , 
A:  then for the two of you to present your prototype 
A:  and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria . 
A:  We then have a finance aspect , 
A:  And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my , 
A:  um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . 
A:  So we're going to make a very fast track . 
A:  um each of you made your presentations . 
A:  <other> Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . 
A:  The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . 
A:  Um we decided chip on print would be used . 
A:  Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , 
A:  powered by kinetic energy . 
A:  There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . 
A:  Um looking like a scroll , 
A:  but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use , 
A:  Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product 
A:  Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . 
A:  and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints 

A:  Um we're down to the prototype presentation . 
C:  well you see , 
C:  each made one , 
C:  This is the one that I made . 
C:  It is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . 
C:  This is like a scroll , 
C:  but they are push buttons 
C:  and they enter  takes you into the different menus . 
C:  And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . 
C:  the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right <other> in the different menus . 
C:  The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , 
C:  lack of uh buttons all over the place . 
C:  <other> Form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , 
C:  but I think we have two different options , 
C:  Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , 
C:  because we did make a another one , 
C:  which wa uh is in the shape of banana , 
C:  if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , 
C:  which is also nice 
C:  and easy to hold 
C:  and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , 
C:  just a slightly different design . 
C:  uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . 
C:  Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one  
C:  uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . 
C:  we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . 
C:  colour , I think  I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , 
C:  but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well . 
C:  maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them . 
B:  I don't have very much to add . 
B:  The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . 
B:  We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , 
B:  We have simple rubber push buttons 
C:  I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . 
C:  This one has no obvious connections to fruit , 
C:  it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , 
C:  you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , 
B:  <other> Would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ? 
A:  I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the 
C:  Breaking , 
C:  that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , 
D:  I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role . 
C:  Yeah ,  we really like we really like that design , 
C:  <other> I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of  <other> I mean actually how to program the menus 
B:  And it's a very simple design , 
C:  and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , 

C:  This is the one that I made . 
C:  This is like a scroll , 
C:  but they are push buttons 
C:  and they enter  takes you into the different menus . 
C:  And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . 
C:  the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right <other> in the different menus . 
C:  The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , 
C:  lack of uh buttons all over the place . 
C:  <other> Form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , 
C:  Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one  
C:  uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons .

C:  I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . 

D:  This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , 
D:  this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers 
D:  a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . 
D:  I'm going to go and use the whiteboard , 
D:  and I've made a list of criteria to look at , 
D:  but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , 
D:  fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other . 
D:  And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , 
D:  some of them seem rather close , 
C:  what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials . 
D:  We'll put price up at the top . 
C:  <laugh> Not that we actually know anything about it , 
D:  wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ? 
C:  It depends what what you mean by fancy really , 
C:  I'd call these quite uh minimalist , 
B:  a plain , simple , clean design . 
C:  it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , 
C:  I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , 
C:   like stylish or aesthetic . 
D:  in terms of elegant , fancy . we'll call it E_F_ um , do we do we think that perhaps  and maybe we should say the yellow ? 
C:  they're both yellow with black buttons , 
C:  but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . 
C:  So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two 
C:  but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , 
D:  I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana . 
D:  And of the two I really like I m I like the banana , 
C:  that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , 
A:  I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true . 
A:  It's more true than false , about a two . 
D:  <other> technologically innovative . 
B:  I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative . 
D:  we'll say  we'll say uh false . 
D:  Easy to use . 
D:  <other> One , 
D:  trendy , s <other> and I say specifically spongy fruity . 
C:  maybe only a two or a three then , 
C:  we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific  
B:  We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy . 
C:  Yeah , I don't really think that's gonna work , 
D:  two ? Um 
D:  are there excess buttons ? 
D:  <other> <laugh> That is false . 
D:  Um <other> good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons . 
A:  Better , more intuitive buttons , yes . 
D:  Ugly . 
C:  No . <laugh> 
B:  I think they're different , 
C:  it is quite it is quite quirky I think . 
C:  It could be quite a good brand , like a good little object . 
D:  uh could we say it's cost saving ? 
C:  we also need tho think about the energy . 
C:  Is it the kinetic energy ? 
C:  it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . 
C:  but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet , 
D:  do you have any idea about price or other features ? 
B:  I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . 
D:  So true one 
C:  I would say maybe a two , 
D:  And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these 
D:  instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive 
D:  and then make that true , 
D:  'cause I have to do an average . <other> 
D:  And then um excess buttons . 
C:  Just putting no excess buttons . 
D:  so it doesn't ruin the polarity . 
C:  see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , 
C:  because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . 
C:  I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition 
C:  but but we are at the upper end of the push button market . <laugh> 
D:  let me know if if any of these  um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here  if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . 
D:  If not I'll average those . 
D:  and I'll uh figure out the average here . 
D:  Thank you for everyone's help with that . 

D:  I can give you a number , 
D:  the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , 
D:  There were six true or ones , 
D:  two s almost true or close to true , 
D:  and then uh one false , seven points , 
C:  And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology , 
C:  which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works , 

A:  and the next big thing is the finance . 
A:  And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet 
A:  it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device . 
A:  Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells . 
C:  just kinetic then ,  . 
A:  Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those . 
B:  'cause we've just got push buttons , 
A:  and we only need one of those . 
A:  the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . 
A:  It looks like it  single curve , 
C:  What does double curved mean , I don't understand . 
B:  I I think you  it means you reverse the curve . 
B:  you can do a banana in single curve , 
A:  case material supplements . Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour . 
C:  I just wanna say plastic . 
B:  I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , 
A:  Okay . We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added 
A:  And the buttons  Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ? 
B:  does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? 
A:  Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black . 
B:  'Cause I think they can be plastic . 
B:  Yeah . They could be plastic , 
B:  we don't have to have rubber buttons , 
A:  We had the special colour . 

A:  Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed . 
B:  More profit . 

A:  go to the project evaluation , next slide . 
A:  the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity . 
A:  leadership , 
D:  Sure . 
A:  teamwork , 
D:  Yes . 
A:  means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things . 
B:  Yeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought . <other> 
C:  'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . 
A:  and we're satisfied with all the above . 
A:  we went over all those things 
A:  Um did we find any new ideas ? 
D:  I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I  that really opened my eyes . 
C:  Spongy . 
C:  And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , 
C:  Good work as a design team , 
B:  I'm not sure all the wires are really great though . 

A:  And we've therefore  we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , 

A:  And we've therefore  we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , 

A:  I have a final report to present , 

C:  it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . 
C:  just kinetic then ,  . 

A:  Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those . 

B:  'cause we've just got push buttons , 

A:  It looks like it  single curve , 
B:  you can do a banana in single curve , 

A:  We had the special colour . 

C:  I just wanna say plastic . 

A:  Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black . 

B:  Yeah . They could be plastic , 
B:  we don't have to have rubber buttons , 

C:  So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two
