D:  So welcome to the marketing presentation once again . 
D:  Um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public , because that's our public . 
D:  fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , uh shoes and furniture . 
D:  And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . 
D:  oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . 
D:  most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel . 
D:  And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative . 
D:  I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition , 
D:  And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use . 
D:  Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . 
D:  Uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours 
D:  <laugh> Just made a quick design . 

D:  most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel . 
D:  And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative . 
D:  I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition , 
D:  And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use . 
D:  Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . 
C:  I first uh chose for the battery , 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . 
C:  But I really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy , 

C:  I'm dealing with the components design . 
C:  I uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products . 
C:  Uh for example the energy source . we have four types . 
C:  The basic battery . 
C:  Uh we have a hand dynamo , 
C:  Uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it . 
C:  And uh of course solar cells . 
C:  for the uh a case , there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case . 
C:  Single curved , which means that it has uh curves in one dimension . 
C:  Or the double curved . 
C:  but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now . 
C:  Well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium . 
C:  I would definitely go for rubber 
C:  We have yeah several uh interface designs . 
C:  Uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , 
C:  but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons . 
C:  the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement uh for the production , 'cause they they can print it better . 
C:  I can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make . 
C:  But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again . 
D:  and  especially when the material's rubber . It can be done , I mean , you can't harm it , 
C:  No it means curved in two dimensions . 
D:  So double curved is like this , this , this , or  
C:  So uh w single curved ? Uh let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . 

A:  So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . 
A:  Uh the case would be doubly curved . So  
D:  Rubber material . 

B:  One one uh very important thing I was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option . 
A:  I think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present . 
B:  But do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ? 
B:  For for everything , 
B:  in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . 
B:  Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control . 
B:  And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options . 
B:  but this is the the the simple uh layout . 
B:  Uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button . 
B:  And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous  so that's an a also an option . 

A:  I didn't get any information about that so  
C:  I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost , 
A:  Advanced chip . Okay . 
D:  Rubber material . 
A:  Uh the case would be doubly curved . So  
A:  So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . 
A:  Uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? 
B:  This is the the menu I was uh looking uh at . 
C:  S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form uh yeah serves the function , you know . 
C:  But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that . 
C:  And th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions . 
C:  where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . And  
B:  Th this looks a little bit like like for only for children . So  
C:  Yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually , 
C:  'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . 
C:  Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , 
B:  Okay but the the colours , you you can make it uh make the colours with  LEDs uh beneath the the buttons . 
B:  If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it . 
C:  And this is , this is with the curved that I mean . 
A:  Well we could make a compromise between that . 
A:  Uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . So to appeal a little more to the all the public . 
D:  Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ? 
C:  I would go for the double curved . 
C:  I mean our aim is to make something different right ? 
C:  And I I'm I'm thinking uh you know uh a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb . 
B:  but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . 
C:  You can make a trigger button or something like that . 
C:  and we need something that well that  that you can able to use in one hand I think . 
D:  But from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape . 
D:  A little upwards . So that the screen is more 
D:  So then you have double double curved in some way . 
C:  How about we do a uh a pop-up screen , like the laptop . 
A:  If you can uh flip . 
D:  But I dunno if that's too expensive . 
A:  Okay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way . 
A:  and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically . 
D:  So  okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open . 
C:  Well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . 
C:  We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break . 
C:   or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ? 
A:  I think that uh it's a nice design . 
D:  Yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape . 
A:  So the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ? 
A:  And ergonomical shape . Yeah . 
C:  I would give it a female shape 
D:  I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? 
D:  Like some soft <other> green or something ? 
A:  Orange or something . 
D:  and then and then very bright , uh a yellow banana , <other> an orange , uh a green apple , stuff like that , 
C:  Yeah w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow . 
B:  Yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . 
B:  If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , 
D:  So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess . 
D:  Yeah with some some yellow banana  
C:  'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often . 
C:  So it  not not only in in the colours <other> of the LEDs , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , 
D:  I mean , the the colour of the background of the display ? 
D:  So just just a <other> a blue blue backlight or something like that . 
B:  maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? 
C:  But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ? 
D:  But then then again , which colour should the buttons be ? 
D:  But maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people . 
C:  <other> Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . Even for colourblind . 
D:  So red buttons are okay ? 
D:  You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess . 
C:  what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with uh one coloured LED behind it . 

A:  but  uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . 
A:  Next thirty minutes to design something so  
C:  So we're gonna work here ? On this sketchboard ? 

A:  You will do the evaluation . 
A:  <laugh> You probably get a mail . 
A:  Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation  you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . 

A:  So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . 

A:  Uh the case would be doubly curved . So  
D:  Rubber material . 

A:  Advanced chip . Okay . 

C:   . <other> I did get a bit more done than the last time , 
C:  'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the  
C:  <other> Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there , 
C:  and also with  I don't know how to use PowerPoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it . 

D:  So double curved is like this , this , this , or  
C:  No it means curved in two dimensions . 
C:  So uh w single curved ? Uh let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . 

C:  I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost , 
A:  I didn't get any information about that so
