A:  Um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting . 
A:  I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary , 
A:  which means I will make uh minutes 
A:  Um if I'm right , there are three presentations , 
A:  And um we will also take a look at new project requirements , um if you haven't heard about them yet . 
A:  Um well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation . 
C:  I'll go first . Okay . I'll go first yeah . 
C:  I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . 
C:  Uh when you press a button , <other> uh that's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume , um a little connection is made 
C:  on a little print plate 
C:  Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal 
C:  which uh then is si uh signalled <other> to uh several transistors 
C:  And that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal 
C:  which is sent to the television set . 
C:  Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls , are that uh they are very easy to produce , 
C:  uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production 
C:  Uh and the technology's already available , 
C:  Uh I made a little uh uh animation of <laugh> about how a tran our uh remote controller works . 
C:  the sub-component , I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it's the button . 
C:  Uh when it is pressed down , um , the switch is ter is uh is switched on , 
C:  so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course , 
C:  Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . 
C:  Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , 
C:  Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons . 
C:  Perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons 
C:  because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged , 
C:  uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore . 
C:  And uh well as I said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs . <other> 

B:  and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . 
B:  Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found . 
B:  Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , 
B:  adjust volume , that kind of thing . 
B:  There are some uh examples of remote controls . 
B:  You can see they are very different . 
B:  The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . 
B:  And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . 
B:  Um <other> I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , 
B:  A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that . 
B:  personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . 
B:  And then uh make it  I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . 
B:  If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , 
B:  you could reuse the buttons 
B:  And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . 

D:  <other> We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , 
D:  that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , 
D:  The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . 
D:  Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . 
D:  And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . 
D:  The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , 
D:  and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area . 
D:  Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . 
D:  <other> Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , 
D:  and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , 
D:  Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , 
D:  because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , 
D:  The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , 
D:  so those  they  those have to h be find very easily . 
D:  Buttons . Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . 
D:  or in L_C_D_ screen . 
D:  but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . 
D:  So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . 
D:  because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . 
D:  so the buttons sh should be that small , 
D:  So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , 
D:  The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . 
D:  And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . 
D:  Because they use the remote control often more often , 
D:  and are more technical than the ol older people . 
D:  So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot  not that much on the younger pep younger people , 
D:  but also somewhat on the elderly people . 

D:  So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , 
D:  so the buttons sh should be that small , 
D:  or shouldn't be that complex 
D:  because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . 
D:  So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . 
D:  but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . 
D:  so those  they  those have to h be find very easily . 
D:  but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use 
D:  And it should be easy to use . Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . 

A:  <other> I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements ? 
A:  then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them 
A:  Um teletext does  has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . 
A:  <other> So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext . 
A:  Uh the remote control should only be used for the television , 
A:  otherwise the project becomes more complex , 
A:  Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , 
A:  and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , 
A:  And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , 
A:  which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . 
A:  according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions . 
B:  you said it should only uh work with one appliance ? 
A:  Yeah . Only be used for television . 
B:  Then it should have uh on , off , 
C:  Standby options , 
D:  the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it , 
B:  A button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers . 
D:  because some T_V_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , 
D:  I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that , 
D:  and that's that's not relaxed 
C:  But uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get 
A:  new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , 
D:  Uh younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen . 
C:  But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap . 
C:  A touch screen uh probably uh even more . 
C:  perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen . 
D:  you don't know how much it costs , the L_C_D_ screen . 
D:  I don't have any costs here , 
B:  But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ? 
C:  for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen 
C:  and it's possible to p uh press them down , just like a touch screen . 
A:  we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ? 
D:  I think it's the most easier thing , 
B:  but also on the older , 
B:  But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , 
B:  and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ? 
D:  But our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty . 
D:  but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger . 
D:  if it costs  gets too much , too expensive , then yeah , we should be sticking to rubber buttons . 
C:  I think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of L_C_D_ uh screens . 
C:  if you uh you receive an email about that , uh can you post it in the  
A:  But for now it's L_C_D_ . Okay . 
D:  it'll look fancy with L_C_D_ screen . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  They think it's ugly . When it has an L_C_D_ screen . 
D:  Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it . 
A:  what else does our remote need ? 
B:  A mute button . 
D:  <other> The most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection , volume con selection , 
D:  and power s power usage . 
D:  And a teletext , but that is not of the question . 
B:  But shouldn't you put a button of  for teletext on the  for the people who want to use it ? 
A:  and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext . 
D:  And other other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , 
B:  they are less important , 
B:  but I think they should be there , 
C:  but in a sub sub-menu or something like that . 
C:  Uh I think it's also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in English , uh , to not use batteries , 
B:  Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off . 
D:  power supply is one of the most important things . 
B:  If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno . 
D:  because I don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it , 
D:  so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down , the remote shuts down . 
C:  And go to standby mode when you don't use it , 
A:  And maybe a low battery indicator ? On the screen . 
D:  of put it in a recharger . Charger . 
A:  So we are going for the for the recharger . 
B:  I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days , 
C:  uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television , 
C:  that's also a a a great advantage 
C:  because you can't lose it anymore . 
B:  <laugh> But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch 
B:  because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_ . 
C:  just a cable , or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on . Something like that , 
C:  Functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , 
C:  so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points 
D:  I think that this should be standard . Large button  large buttons . 
A:  And you said something about speech recognition ? 
D:  also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent . 
B:  twelve fifty , twelve fifty . <laugh> 
B:  I know let's do a speech . <laugh> 
B:  But they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something , 
D:  <other> I think an L_C_D_ screen <other> should be suf sufficient . 
A:  But when you look at the percentages  
A:  but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh . 
D:  I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen , 
A:  But would it be useful to imple implement both ? 
D:  Yeah , if the costs al allow it . <laugh> 
B:  but how would you like to implement that , 
B:  that you say volume up , and then it goes up , 
C:  Certain systems already exist , I think . 
B:  Then you also have to have different languages if we go international . 
D:  But that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen . 
B:  you can use icons 
C:  it should be done . If it could be done , should be done . 
A:  so we only do this when we have enough money left . 
A:  I've written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , uh the digits from one to zero , huh . Um  or from zero to nine . Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator . 
A:  And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons 
B:  You also now have colours . 
D:  Curved ? 
A:  so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu , 
D:  We could check the other remote controls with technical functions . 
A:  Aren't we forgetting something very important ? 
D:  wide screen , high screen , different things you have , 
D:  it should be available , but then in separate screen settings or something . 
D:  Channel settings . 
D:  Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote , an expanded version . 
B:  and the buttons , should they have colours ? 
C:  Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the L_C_D_ screen . 
B:  Perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones <laugh> . 
C:  make it available in different colours , you mean ? 
A:  we're having a a general menu with the most used functions , uh teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings , 
B:  Or do we have any buttons ? On the remote . 
D:  you only have channel button or volume button . 
B:  So we don't have any normal buttons 
B:  But that's also in the L_C_D_ , 
D:  Maybe only the on and o on and off button . 
B:  But isn't idea to use uh uh what you said , uh normal on and off button for the T_V_ , 
B:  But a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ , 
A:  maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ , 
A:  There has to be a on button on the remote , 
B:  No 
B:  you just tap I think . 
C:  because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on . 
B:  I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , 
B:  But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , 
C:  I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control . 
A:  So actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote . No buttons at all . 
A:  that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote . 
A:  postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting , 

None

A:  Um teletext does  has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . 
A:  <other> So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext .
