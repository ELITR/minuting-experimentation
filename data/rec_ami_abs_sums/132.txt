D:  they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control , 

D:  And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition 
D:  And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen 
D:  Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . 

D:  that was  in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control , 

D:  so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . 
A:  So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere 

B:  There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . 

A:  you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable . 

C:  The switch uh uh <other> uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code , 
C:  then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . 
C:  You have infrared 

A:  Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore 
A:  <other> This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , 
A:  um the younger people were defined under forty . 
A:   And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , 

A:  we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example . 
A:  I think that the <other> the buttons should be  the channel buttons should be <other> uh on their own . 
B:  and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume  
A:  Think it's like this . <other> 
B:  Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle . 
A:  Yeah , in the middle . 
B:  uh the power button somewhere over here ? 
A:  I think it should be at the bottom somewhere . 
A:  Mute . 
D:  <other> Around uh not uh not at top at the  around the volume selection . 
B:  Where would we want the uh teletext button ? 
B:  Do we put it somewhere over here ? 
B:  Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , 
D:  In the middle . 
A:  Maybe in a circle for example , like we  like in this example . 
B:  but we do agree that we <other> keep this at the centre , 
A:  I think the channel button should be in the centre . 

A:  just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , 

C:  Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? 
A:  to have uh like sort of a  maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it . 

None

A:  you have to come up with a components concept , 

A:  but just take a look at it , 

None

B:  I'll put some on paper 
A:  draw us up some some designs of of possible  

A:  you should do some trend-watching , 
B:  Could you post some <other> other essentials of what people want , 

C:  I have to check that out , 
A:  Yeah , just look at the possibilities then , 
A:  Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space . 

C:  uh let's give this uh a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars . 
A:  Yeah , let's think of a name , okay . 

A:  <other> This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , 
A:  um the younger people were defined under forty . 

None

A:   And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , 

B:  And possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger 
A:  you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable . 
A:  just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , 
A:  we don't want  we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot . 

D:  so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . 
B:  this is basically what I h had in mind in the  fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound , 
A:  So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere 

A:  I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , 
A:  just make a button on your T_V_ 
A:  we should go for that . 
C:  Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you  if it's lost , for people that are deaf . 
B:  We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you  that some light lights up . 
A:  We could do that . 

A:  I think it's universal . I think we should go for universal , 

A:  For example , if your buttons are faded , after  I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . 

A:  Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever . 
D:  And uh with different colours uh . 
A:  we should do a little thing about design , 
D:  <laugh> Different colours maybe . 
C:  And the design , it should differ . 

A:  just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , 

B:  'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too . 
A:  Speech recognition , I think it's very hard , 
B:  Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen . 

C:  then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , 

B:  Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while . 

B:  Is it techni technically possible to uh <other> send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu , 
C:  I don't think so . 

A:  but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s . 
C:  Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . 
C:  If it isn't , then we cannot reach it . 
A:  But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu . 
C:  Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ? 

None

A:  Think it's like this . <other> 
B:  and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume  
A:  I think that the <other> the buttons should be  the channel buttons should be <other> uh on their own . 
B:  Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle . 
A:  Yeah , in the middle . 
B:  uh the power button somewhere over here ? 
A:  I think it should be at the bottom somewhere . 
A:  Mute . 
D:  <other> Around uh not uh not at top at the  around the volume selection . 
B:  Where would we want the uh teletext button ? 
B:  Do we put it somewhere over here ? 
B:  Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , 
D:  In the middle . 
A:  Maybe in a circle for example , like we  like in this example . 
B:  but we do agree that we <other> keep this at the centre , 
A:  I think the channel button should be in the centre . 

C:  Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? 
A:  I'm not sure y <other> I'm not sure it's  if it's expensive , 
C:  But I think that will cost a lot . 
A:  I'm not sure if it costs a lot , 

D:  And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen 
D:  Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . 
B:  Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen . 

D:  If you're reading from top to bottom , I think it's better to put it uh at the top . 
A:  I  I'm not sure . 
A:  So we have three people saying it should be on top .
