A:  Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . 
A:  Well , teletext goes out . 
A:  and they don't want it , 
A:  Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . 

A:  because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . 

D:  They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . 
D:  Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . 
D:  And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . 
D:  They also like that , 

D:  Furthermore , it's uh <other> seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . 
D:  A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their <laugh> in their living room . 
D:  Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn . 

C:  And the <other> the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , 
C:  The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . 
C:  Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , 

C:  uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , 
C:  So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , 
B:  I like user-centr centred uh <other> uh also the best . 

A:  And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . 
D:  No not clickable . 
A:  Uh well I think so , yes . Um  
D:  Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? 

C:  and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , 
A:  <laugh> We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons  
C:  Channel , yeah . 
C:  Volume control . 
A:  Uh the mute button . 
A:  Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . 
A:  Menu button . 
C:  Yeah . I think that's important . 

A:  and the design comes into the next round ? 

A:  and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So  

D:  So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than  I think . 

B:  I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . 
A:  but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . 

C:  So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , 
C:  uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , 
B:  I like user-centr centred uh <other> uh also the best . 

A:  And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . 
D:  No not clickable . 
D:  Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? 
A:  Uh well I think so , yes . Um  

A:  <laugh> We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons  
C:  Channel , yeah . 
C:  Volume control . 
A:  Uh the mute button . 
A:  Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . 
A:  Menu button . 
C:  Yeah . I think that's important . 

A:  Alright so no button for that . 
A:  Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ? 

None

C:  But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . 
A:  Th that's a bit uh waste . 
D:  I do think we have to put that underneath a clip . 

D:  But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences . 
A:  but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . 
A:  That's very irritating , I think . 
D:  Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was <other> t kinda true . 
B:  I think we we should use something like this um to um  The the channel up and channel down button ? <other> Yeah , in circle , you know ? 
D:  So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . 
B:  Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . 
D:  So the the <other> channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down . 
B:  No I don't think . 
C:  I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , 
C:  but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . 

D:  Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . 
C:  It's going to be expensive . Yeah . 
D:  I don't have any information on that . So  <laugh> 
B:  I think that's uh difficult to realise also . 
D:  And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . 
D:  Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features . 
B:  Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition . 
B:  <other> Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . 

D:  I think it should be at the top . 
B:  Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . 
A:  because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . 
A:  We don't want them to look like a calculator . 
C:  I think it's still important to have it at the top , 

D:  But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences . 
A:  but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . 
A:  That's very irritating , I think . 
B:  I think we we should use something like this um to um  The the channel up and channel down button ? <other> Yeah , in circle , you know ? 
D:  Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was <other> t kinda true . 
D:  So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . 
B:  Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . 
D:  So the the <other> channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down . 
B:  No I don't think . 
C:  I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , 
C:  but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . 

A:  And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video . 
D:  Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh
