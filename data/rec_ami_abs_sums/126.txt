A:  Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype . 
D:  <laugh> This is it . 
B:  It's uh it's uh it's yellow . 
B:  And uh , this is rubber . 
B:  And and and this too . 
B:  And the rest is hard plastic . 
B:  the sides . 
B:  We had a new idea <laugh> that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside . 
B:  And then it covers the  these buttons 
B:  And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick . 
B:  So , you can still operate uh all the things . 
B:  Because you don't always use the menu . 
A:  And the buttons ? 
B:  Big buttons . 
B:  And everything is blue , except the power button . 
B:  yeah , and the mute and the the other button . 
A:  And the joystick is for the volume and the channels . 
B:  Very obvious . 
C:  Up is channel up . 
C:  Down is channel down . 
C:  To the right is volume up . 
C:  To the left is volume down . 
A:  Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ . 
A:  What's the R_R_ 
B:  R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo . 
D:  That's on the rub rubber part . 
A:  So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . 
A:  So , that's it . That's prototype . 

D:  Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . 
D:  I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , 
D:  uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . 
D:  Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? 
D:  And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . 
D:  Um , well uh we have the Word document 
D:  Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . 
D:  But um , if I can get a number in here . 
D:  Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . 
D:  Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . 
D:  And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . 
D:  Yeah , I think it's uh  <laugh> Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh  it doesn't contain many new features . 
D:  Um , I think I will give it a  yeah , yeah , yeah  , a four . 
C:  I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . 
C:  I think technologically I'll give it an seven . 
D:  So now i I think you uh see it  um its statement . 
D:  And you  true or false . 
C:  Oh , true or false . 
C:  Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two . 
A:  Two . 
D:  It's a one . <laugh> The first item . 
D:  Um , this product is for all sorts of customers . 
D:  Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market 
D:  and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . 
D:  That's uh a six . 
B:  Mm , four . 
A:  So I think it's four . 
B:  I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons . 
C:  Maybe version uh three point O_ uh  <laugh> has other colours . <laugh> 
A:  We put the fashion in electronics . 
D:  Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? 
D:  I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . 
D:  Um , so I would give it a two . 
C:  Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . 
A:  Uh , I say uh a five . 
A:  It's not fashion , it's new . 
B:  Then make it th three . 
D:  The next element um is the product looks good . 
D:  Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . 
D:  So , I would give this a five . 
C:  I give it a one . <laugh> 
A:  Well , I say three . 
D:  Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . 
D:  I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . 
D:  Well , uh if we go to <other> uh this fashion , I  We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . 
D:  So , I would give this a two . 
C:  One . 
A:  Me too . One . 
A:  It does not get lost easily . 
D:  Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ? 
B:  Yes . <laugh> 
A:  No , we did not . 
A:  So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ? 
C:  Ah . Yellow . 
A:  I don't think so . 
C:  It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch . 
A:  A one ? <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , o one . 
D:  Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market . 
D:  Uh yeah , did we achieve that . 
D:  I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two . 
A:  There's a fancy look-and-feel . 
D:  That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . 
D:  Well , let's also give this a two . 
C:  I gave this a one because of the rubber . 
C:  Yeah , f very fancy  trendy . 
A:  It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy . 
A:  So I think s two is better . 
D:  uh it goes with the latest trends . 
A:  No , it's new . 
A:  Innovation . 
D:  If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , 
D:  well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food 
D:  We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . 
D:  We'll go for a three . 
C:  I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . 
C:  But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . 
C:  Something what also younger people want . 

C:  Two . 
D:  So um , come back to the presentation now . 
D:  So , we find yourself there , 
D:  and now we have to calculate an average rating . 
A:  Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty ,  . 
A:  Twenty one . 
A:  So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third . 
D:  So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think . 
A:  So , it's good . 
D:  So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . <laugh> 

D:  Next . Finance . 
A:  So , now uh we have a product . 
A:  But uh , is it cheap enough ? 
A:  We have a battery . 
C:  Cheapest there is . 
A:  Electronics . Advanced chip . 
A:  it's the most advanced . 
A:  We have the simple , regular and advanced . 
A:  We have the adva advanced . 
A:  We have double curved . 
A:   we have half rubber , half plastic . 
A:  Special colour . 
A:  Yes , yellow . 
A:  So , we have the L_C_D_ 
A:  We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ? 
C:  One . 
A:  And it's not really a s 
C:  Joystick uh thing . 
A:  Now , uh button supplement . 
A:  Special colour . 
A:  The buttons are regular colour . 
A:  It's too expensive . 
A:  Fifteen Euros . 
A:  So , we have to change something . 

A:  well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 
A:  'Cause we can't lose the battery . 
A:  We can't lose the advanced chip . 
A:  We can't lose the double curve . 
A:  We have rubber , special colour . 
C:  Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour . 
C:  Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ? 
D:  For a remote control , I think it is . <laugh> 
D:  If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right . 
A:  Um , then we uh lose two Euros . 
A:  Then we have thirteen Euros . 
A:  Half a Euro too much . 
A:  Exactly the special colours . 
C:  Um <other> just only plastic or only rubber ? 
C:  One Euro discount . 
A:  I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . 
C:  And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour  
C:  Normal colour , and the the joystick away , 
A:  But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ? 
A:  Or it's then a regular ? 
D:  The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ 
C:  If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ . 
C:  Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . 
D:  And then uh we move the the colour . 
A:  No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . 
A:  And you cannot use the red and green button . 
C:  So , all the buttons has to  have to be the same colour . 
A:  What's the normal colour ? 
A:  Very good . 

A:  Now , uh project eva evaluation . 
C:  process . Went good . 
C:  I think uh the creativity uh <laugh> was good enough . 
C:  Uh leadership . 
C:  Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote . 
C:  Team-work okay . 
C:  New ideas found . <other> 
C:  Nope . 
B:  I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , 
B:  the the SMARTboard 
D:  Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . 
D:  Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . 
D:  Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient . 
D:  Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor  
D:  Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . 
D:  Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . 
D:  And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . 
A:  I think it was good . 
A:  Not too many discussions . 
A:  So , it's good for the speed . 
A:  So , I think we're ready . 
A:  Good price . 
A:  Evaluation ready . 

C:  process . Went good .
