A:  and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . 
A:  So let's see the  what did you prepare . 
A:  So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design 
B:  S so so I discussed with Guillaume . 
B:  and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , 
B:  One with and one without L_C_D_s . 
B:  Um but both comes with a charger 
B:  and then detachable and uh or  control module . 
B:  And detachable big buttons for all people um . 
C:  <laugh> S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes <laugh> . 
C:  Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . 
A:  How much does it cost this one ? 
C:  Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars 
A:  Ah it's above it's above the budget . 
C:  but uh it's just a prototype 
C:  the  and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars .  

B:  because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . 
C:  And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . 
C:  You can uh choose the direction 
C:  You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the <laugh> for the speech recognition system here . 
C:  And here the the switch that control if you want  
B:  The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . 
D:  Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? 
C:  Well so it's a microphone array . 
A:  Oh it's very costly , microphone array <laugh> . 
C:  it's just a single microphone , 
C:  I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to  
C:  well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . 
C:  And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . 
C:  And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger . 
A:  How many b battery is there ? 
B:  Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . 
B:  A_A_ rechargeable batteries . 
D:  Is that two or one ? 
B:  <laugh> Actually uh it's a flexible thing . 
C:  So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger 
C:  and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright . 
B:  I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , 
B:  This button is like the mouse  is like a joystick , 
B:  you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction 
B:  and it  the additi functions associated to all the actions 
B:  you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button <laugh> . 
B:  You can move up , down , left , right , 
B:  or you can do a swing . 
B:  Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ . 
C:  So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . 
C:  The second version is also simpler , 
C:  we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also <laugh> . 
D:  Uh-huh and also the switch . 
C:  Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . 
C:  But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . 
C:  Press one button uh acting as a a enter button . 
C:  So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user . 
C:  And uh it's also cheaper to produce . 
D:  And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , 
D:  and if you disable speech recognition system then ? 
B:  W w I'll I'll come to that point later on . 
B:  in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah . 
B:  It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone 
B:  but uh again depends on the types . 
B:  I think we have to investigate more on that , but <other>  
B:  Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , 
B:  again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . 
B:  Lithium-ion may be a good one , 
B:  again you pay for what you get , 
B:  And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , 
B:  So when you finish watching your T_V_ <cough> and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , 
B:  and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . 
B:  so we didn't define the vocabulary 
B:  so it's up to the user to define 
B:  And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a  of T_V_ programmes by genre , 
B:  and this can be used by the adult or by the children . 

B:  the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular 
B:  If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , 
D:  Something like customised . Yeah 
B:  for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it  put it back in , or you can use the other one , 
B:  or <laugh> the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah . 
B:  You want a microphone to put in the <laugh> speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see <laugh> . 
B:  It's pretty flexible in the yeah price <laugh> . 
C:  We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , 
C:  and it acts like the previous one , 
C:  you just plug in and it works . 
B:  the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful . 
B:  Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , 
B:  powerful is that all the controls with <other> the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n 
B:  that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here <laugh> . 
B:  Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you . 
B:  The first one is the speech recogniser , 
B:  again it's detachable or add-on . 
B:  And then we also have security feature 
B:  it's very robust  , 
B:  so you want more function you pay more . 

C:  You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control 
C:  that that you ca you can add up <laugh> to the  to your remote control 
C:  i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on . 
C:  H here is just the the the module for the kids 
C:  and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up  they come up with their modules , 
B:  and the material , what's the material again ? 
C:  The titanium 

C:  We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . <laugh> 
A:  What's the price to p to produce ? 
C:  Well so the price to produce  For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . 
C:  The  without without the charger 
C:  it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems . 
C:  Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , 
C:  and finally three dollars for the charger . 
C:  So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the L_C_D_ <laugh> , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . 
A:  We don't have all the options <laugh> . 
C:  so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars . 
A:  it's below the the the budget . 

D:  I think we will just have a rough look 
D:  and then we can make our statements , 
D:  and we can finalise the product based on this discu 
D:  So the marketing made an evaluation criteria 
D:  and these were some of the findings , 
D:  and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , 
D:  but most of the people what they are interested is  first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , 
D:  it should be very fancy with colourful 
D:  and uh very handy to hold . 
D:  And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative . 
D:  Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . 
D:  And the third one is easy to use . 
C:  since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons . 
C:  Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself 
D:  here you can find  these are the latest fashion updates , 
D:  and so this  in Paris and Milan  they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , 
D:  so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . 
D:  So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes . 
D:  And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , 
D:  it should be somewhat spongy . 
B:  you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy <laugh> . 
D:  Yeah so uh <laugh> so finally we have these three criterias . 
D:  One is fancy look , 
D:  second is innovative , 
D:  and third is easy to use . 

D:  So  and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , 
D:  say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , 
D:  and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this . 
D:  So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , 
D:  so on this scale , if it is true , if it is  if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , 
D:  or if it is false , it doesn't  it looks uh  it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . 
B:  But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ? 
D:  according to you designers , 
D:  On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look  how does it look ? 
D:  D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? 
C:  I'll I'll say three or four . 
B:  <other> I think we can improve on the design . 
B:  Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh  <laugh> design . 
B:  Um we have been focused all all this <other> time on the <cough> on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . 
D:  So I take three on  with L_C_D_ ? 
D:  So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ? 
C:  Uh four . 
C:  I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated 
C:  so removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . 
D:  And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ . 
C:  Well it's it's the same for both 
C:  so <other> I will give a five , six . <laugh> 
B:  from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um <cough> the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , 
B:  and for now  and another innovation we have is simplicity 
B:  and  simplicity , few buttons , we've uh <other>  A lot of functionalities . 
D:  So without L_C_D_ ? 
C:  Mm for both it's the the same innovations . 
B:  So maybe I can put six to seven . 
D:  actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . 
D:  then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness . 
D:  So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? 
C:  Well I think both are really easy to use 
C:  and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so  
C:  so I will give a six for the easy to use . 
A:  No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ . 
A:  Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , 
D:  So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes 
D:  according to fruit and vegetable 
D:  or a spongy touch 
D:  without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . 
B:  I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . 
B:  I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people . 
B:  For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated 
B:  because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . 
B:  For kids they want simply the  s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , 
B:  but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um  we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . 
D:  So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ? 
C:  Um six . 
D:  and it's going to be much simpler to use . 

C:  so let's go back to our laboratory and <laugh>  
B:  <laugh> To improve on the design . 

C:  so let's go back to our laboratory and <laugh>  
B:  <laugh> To improve on the design . 
A:   what about the integration of speech recognition ? 
B:  The speech recogniser is a add-on module . 
D:  That's going to be an optional . 
D:  S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . 
D:  As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , 

A:  I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , 
A:  because maybe parents will lose these uh  
D:  but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module 
A:  Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , 
B:  <cough> The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children 
B:   <other> when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , 
B:  and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . 
A:  So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional  uh will be optional . 
B:  <cough> But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? <laugh> 
A:  I think it inc increase . <laugh> 
C:  because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but  
C:  it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the <laugh> functionalities um on the same module , but uh  
B:  Well well the other aspect is that if <other> in the  when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the  you're gonna keep the same customer , 
B:  because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons . 
B:  i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . 
B:  attracting them to come back in again and again . 
B:  Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be  can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? 

D:  And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? 
D:  Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? 
C:  but we are also the um well the components will have to change 
C:  because uh we have to deal with the shape 
D:  Or uh it could be like this  the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all . 
B:  What we can change is to propose the <other> customers with skins . 
B:  For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin 
B:  and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better . 
C:  we can have the same global shape 
C:  and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that . 
D:  I think you need to look into the material . 

A:  Project evaluation project satisfaction , for example . 
A:  I don't know , we have to ask these question . 
B:  <cough> Room for creativity . 
B:  This room is a bit small , but <cough> 
B:  <laugh> but I think it's okay for us to work with . <other> 
D:  This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations . 

D:  And the leadership was excellent . 
A:  Yeah I think so <laugh> . 
A:  Uh the teamwork was very very good . 
D:  And new ideas found . 
C:  <other> Come up with new product <laugh> . 
C:  Yeah and also more well uh <other> more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting 
C:  uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , 
C:  We achieved uh project goal I think . 
D:  that is within the budget . 
C:  yes , more or less . 
A:  Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . 
A:  Yeah thank you for your work and  

None

B:  Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . 
B:  Um but both comes with a charger 
B:  A_A_ rechargeable batteries . 

C:  You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control 
C:  H here is just the the the module for the kids 
C:  and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up  they come up with their modules , 
C:  We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , 

B:  and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . 
B:  So when you finish watching your T_V_ <cough> and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , 

B:  the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular 
B:  so you want more function you pay more . 
B:  for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it  put it back in , or you can use the other one , 

C:  so let's go back to our laboratory and <laugh>  
B:  <laugh> To improve on the design . 

D:  S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . 
D:  As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , 
A:   what about the integration of speech recognition ? 
D:  That's going to be an optional . 

A:  Uh the teamwork was very very good . 
D:  And the leadership was excellent . 
C:  Yeah and also more well uh <other> more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting 
C:  uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , 

B:  Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ? 
C:  but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen . 
B:  We haven't really uh determined <laugh> what are  actually actually 
D:  I mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . 
D:  on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now . 
C:  If you have the L_C_D_ , 
D:  Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . 
B:  But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ . 
B:  Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ <cough> we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , 

C:  I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated 
B:  Um we have been focused all all this <other> time on the <cough> on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . 

C:  so let's go back to our laboratory and <laugh>  
B:  <laugh> To improve on the design . 

D:  Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? 
D:  And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? 
C:  but we are also the um well the components will have to change 
C:  because uh we have to deal with the shape 
B:  What we can change is to propose the <other> customers with skins . 
D:  I think you need to look into the material . 

C:  Yeah and also more well uh <other> more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting 
C:  uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that ,
