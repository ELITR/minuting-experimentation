C:  this is our design . 

C:  We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . 
C:  Th So there's this part um <other> which is made of hard plastic , the front . 
C:  And uh we're we're using different colours . 

C:  and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , 

C:  uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part . 
C:  And we thought about the logo big in the middle . 
C:  And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo . 

C:  I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons . 
C:  the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . 
C:  Um um with kind of arrow shapes , 
C:  And the video button . 
B:  Menu for the L_C_D_ screen . 

C:  And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen . 

D:  I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . 

D:  That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria . 
D:  Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? 
D:  Easy to change channels ? 
D:  The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ? 
A:  Are there enough technology ? 
A:  Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? 
A:  Is the material attractive ? 

A:  look at the costs at this point . 
A:  The sample speaker , 
A:  Kick it out . 
C:  So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid . 

None

A:  but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project , 
A:  are we satisfactory about our creativity ? 
C:  Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah . 
A:  Uh leadership 
D:  Well it's <laugh>  It was very democratic . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Well the managers were terrible . So , with their all their useless requirements . 
A:  teamwork ? 
A:  Well great I think . 
A:  Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ? 
C:  It was a complete disaster . 
A:  And uh the digi the digital pen ? 
D:  Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . I I agree on that . 

None

C:  And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen . 
C:  Well the the  Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but  
B:  Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree 
B:  and only Nils  
A:  So <other> let it be like this at uh at this moment . 

A:  The sample speaker , 
A:  Kick it out . 

C:  So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid . 

A:  If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But  

B:  and only Nils  
C:  Well the the  Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but  

A:  Kick it out . 
A:  Then we go to fourteen point six . 
A:  The sample speaker , 

None

D:  Yeah , we need to have the <other> the L_C_D_ screen . 
C:  But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen . 
C:  <laugh> Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing . 

B:  Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium , 
A:  Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy . 

B:  Well we make it more expensive to buy . 
A:  Well , then we have two dollars less profit . 
A:  I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days . 

A:  Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ? 
C:  It was a complete disaster . 

C:  Uh <other> a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing .
