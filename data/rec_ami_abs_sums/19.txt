A:  So  is the agenda ? 
A:  Opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing . 
A:  Project aim is a new remote control . 
A:  It's original , uh trendy and it's user-friendly . 
A:  Try out the whiteboard , 
A:  every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal . 
A:  so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working . 

A:  Okay , project finance , 
A:  selling price twenty five Euros , 
A:  profit aim fifty million Euros . 
D:  Market range internationally sold . 
A:  it's gotta be  can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . 
A:  Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ? 
B:  Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ? 
D:  Yeah . Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control . 
A:  Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and  
C:  I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ 
C:  and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that , 
C:  but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . 
A:  'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices , 
A:  but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . 
A:  and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these  any of these ideas are feasible or not . 
A:  So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . 
D:  Couldn't we have like one that comes out ? 
D:  you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically . 
B:  Um  have uh one very complicated one on one side with <other> all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , 
B:  and then on the other side o <other> one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and <other> minus , and the just the mute button , for example . 
C:  I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 
C:  'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . 
B:  No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold 
A:  or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . <other> 
C:  D_V_D_ players , things like that . 
C:  but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate 
A:  I think we should also have a back-up plan of  I  
A:  'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that  
C:  but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , 
A:  We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just  that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . 
D:  But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? 
C:  have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , 
A:  Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people 
A:  or  big buttons for  touchy buttons for  
D:  <laugh> I think a flip up thing , 
A:  like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , 

A:  User Interface Designer , that's that's 
A:  so you gotta  you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . Um . 
A:  Industrial Designer , you are the one  , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um 
B:  Mm . Har how it works an 
A:  And in marketing  
A:  User requirements specifications . 
B:  Do you think our two kind of overlap , because  
C:  Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap . 
A:  You two <other> you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you  working together . 
A:  You're the one that's gotta go and find out  do th do the research , 

None
