A:  but 
A:  i hope that everybody's fine 
A:  with recording this meeting yes 
A:  ok 
A:  thank 
A:  you and i see that 
A:  it is indeed being recording 
A:  still so that's good yeah 
A:  so i'll try to share 
A:  my screen because i was 
A:  given the presentation options so 
A:  probably you see my screen 
A:  i'll yes we do and 
A:  yeah and there is this 
A:  minimizes so there is a 
A:  small agenda for the call 
A:  today unfortunately we were there 
A:  is no overlap between alpha 
A:  view and her voice in 
A:  this week so old created 
A:  a triple for the next 
A:  week as well and 
A:  she hopefully will find something 
A:  their if none than world 
A:  were i'll just transfer 
A:  or whatever is whatever is 
A:  needed to change okay 
A:  so for 
A:  today we have this small 
A:  call and the news is 
A:  that are there any news 
A:  from us all about the 
A:  status because you have the 
A:  official a contact points and 
A:  i'm not sure whether you 
A:  have received a response from 
A:  them whatsoever i am not 
A:  sure either about the in 
A:  i 
A:  hope that they will be 
A:  years i 
A:  was tasked to questions 
A:  we are asking so i 
A:  can hope that some direct 
A:  but i'm not sure yeah 
A:  so that it's already like 
A:  two weeks since you have 
A:  contacted them at least so 
A:  hopefully they will be able 
A:  to respond in some reasonable 
A:  dom is the second question 
A:  is can we go on 
A:  and like split the budget 
A:  that we previously allocated for 
A:  saul among other parties this 
A:  is the or until sold 
A:  decision and i know that 
A:  you are like not the 
A:  this is a very decisive 
A:  person but still do you 
A:  think do send that would 
A:  install the idea is that 
A:  you don't want to get 
A:  any money from this project 
A:  yes 
A:  we 
A:  don't want any money i 
A:  that 
A:  could be considered official mean 
A:  yeah 
A:  ok so we will we 
A:  will proceed and will modify 
A:  the budget without you but 
A:  at the same time we 
A:  will all look at person 
A:  months to you or it 
A:  like you should allocate those 
A:  in the or leave and 
A:  i will somehow make it 
A:  clear in the tables that 
A:  the person months that are 
A:  by saul will not be 
A:  paid for from the budget 
A:  but you will be assumed 
A:  to have your own funding 
A:  for those first months knows 
A:  so i don't know how 
A:  this is going to be 
A:  checked by the commission of 
A:  the words the just 
A:  promised some sensible number of 
A:  puzzlement that you could indeed 
A:  claim that you'll have worked 
A:  on the project and it 
A:  definitely should be that you 
A:  wanted you within or the 
A:  scope of the project so 
A:  just like broadcasters further wouldn't 
A:  stop thank 
A:  you so then the speech 
A:  to speech translation is something 
A:  that all of you doesn't 
A:  want to have in the 
A:  like they don't want to 
A:  ship translate it to audio 
A:  tour the partners that the 
A:  parties in the remote conference 
A:  calls i don't think that 
A:  this is a big problem 
A:  i think that we're just 
A:  the make sure that in 
A:  the project there is no 
A:  promise on this are and 
A:  with 
A:  boys this make the situation 
A:  easier because she is a 
A:  would only make sure that 
A:  the platform from produces subtitles 
A:  and send them to for 
A:  the a real case not 
A:  remote but the of physical 
A:  work use case we are 
A:  still probably undecided how are 
A:  we going to ship but 
A:  the translations that the participants 
A:  but my baseline idea is 
A:  some web page that gets 
A:  updated so that would be 
A:  a gain speech to text 
A:  translation and i don't know 
A:  darrieux whether you have experience 
A:  with being wise to individual 
A:  cell phones or so how 
A:  should we approach this for 
A:  the for the conference or 
A:  the workshops at the saw 
A:  events the 
A:  more we don't have our 
A:  experience so we always or 
A:  provided subtitles basically yes we 
A:  have to identify all the 
A:  of 
A:  the translation i think but 
A:  the text 
A:  to speech doesn't allow the 
A:  us so much information to 
A:  the tax the impact the 
A:  of book 
A:  pro once 
A:  you yeah 
A:  i just wanted to do 
A:  is to confirm that i 
A:  also think that it actually 
A:  makes the information harder to 
A:  digest yes 
A:  because a it's the one 
A:  where it doesn't provide any 
A:  and information doesn't 
A:  provide then commissioner ok 
A:  yeah thank you us so 
A:  that 
A:  we will board in the 
A:  project as you specified or 
A:  you'll within the eu integration 
A:  like 
A:  make sure the is clear 
A:  and follow should be aware 
A:  of this like for their 
A:  workshops that the sole shouldn't 
A:  from home make sure that 
A:  participants have some devices at 
A:  hand that ken a display 
A:  the subtitles in some form 
A:  of because each of the 
A:  idea is that each of 
A:  the participants we'll be seeing 
A:  the transitions in his own 
A:  language a soul integration 
A:  of should translate from the 
A:  single speech signal that comes 
A:  in a tool or the 
A:  many target languages and should 
A:  those subtitles to the different 
A:  users at the workshop yes 
A:  that's correct the a 
A:  application 
A:  and could provide some would 
A:  be a hobby obligation or 
A:  correct the debts for the 
A:  remote meetings but i don't 
A:  think that this is the 
A:  case for the life meetings 
A:  the saul the 
A:  euro sigh congress so there 
A:  is the plenary session of 
A:  the euro so congress and 
A:  in there is the individual 
A:  meetings 
A:  like the workshops and in 
A:  the plenary session and there 
A:  is the single speech given 
A:  by the speaker and then 
A:  possibly some questions and we'll 
A:  try to connect to the 
A:  in their brothers and transcribe 
A:  their voices and or directly 
A:  the main one and then 
A:  this will be shipping the 
A:  subtitles to somewhere and this 
A:  somewhere in 
A:  a very baseline solution can 
A:  be just the web page 
A:  with like all the rest 
A:  ratio yeah 
A:  asking 
A:  the integration or 
A:  hold the in presentation 
A:  application development yes 
A:  for life meetings yesterday the 
A:  idea is that did the 
A:  u in this project you 
A:  are the integrator for all 
A:  the technological and you are 
A:  also the final application provider 
A:  for their life in 
A:  the life meetings and 
A:  i think the should be 
A:  in like president of the 
A:  at the conference at the 
A:  congress for dissemination purposes because 
A:  there will be also the 
A:  meetings 
A:  done remotely among the cell 
A:  or a institute 
A:  engine pulled the remote meetings 
A:  they will use the platform 
A:  and then the subtitles are 
A:  delivered through parable is into 
A:  the ulfa view but for 
A:  ok that's what time you 
A:  know yeah so this was 
A:  this was also for militia 
A:  just you do to make 
A:  known 
A:  in and saw that the 
A:  and maybe a saul should 
A:  contribute to that integration task 
A:  some person months are on 
A:  like agreeing on the interface 
A:  are 
A:  you this 
A:  yes 
A:  and for the workshop for 
A:  the life of ants yeah 
A:  of 
A:  course this has to be 
A:  your yet 
A:  so simply diary all created 
A:  in the on integration and 
A:  this task should have some 
A:  like many more person month 
A:  by paranoid because they need 
A:  to develop this but also 
A:  there should be some small 
A:  amounts of person months by 
A:  a us all arthur like 
A:  and make sure that is 
A:  aware of what the platform 
A:  needs and the and how 
A:  to like it make sure 
A:  that the participants can use 
A:  it or 
A:  thank 
A:  you so now let's move 
A:  to the next the item 
A:  in the agenda and there's 
A:  the task and the liberals 
A:  are related to the euro 
A:  sigh congress and others all 
A:  events and this is something 
A:  that would like to just 
A:  clarify how i see it 
A:  and make sure that you 
A:  a use it similarly earth 
A:  so there will be the 
A:  main euro sigh congress in 
A:  the middle of the project 
A:  and then before that there 
A:  could be some dry runs 
A:  workshops or that there will 
A:  be some we will make 
A:  sure that there are some 
A:  and after that there will 
A:  be also other events again 
A:  this workshop style the events 
A:  mainly so when i say 
A:  workshop style i mean it's 
A:  alive meeting of to twenty 
A:  people and each of them 
A:  strives to speak english but 
A:  they are non-native speakers and 
A:  there is the supplied link 
A:  running and the translates 
A:  this non-native english into all 
A:  the participants languages so that 
A:  they can of follow of 
A:  the discussion was like more 
A:  input and a confidence i 
A:  hope that everybody sees it 
A:  the same way so 
A:  saw should make sure that 
A:  there is the there is 
A:  enough events happening and then 
A:  we know about them and 
A:  that we like connects to 
A:  them aside from the main 
A:  euro sigh congress and there 
A:  was should be ready to 
A:  well i don't know maybe 
A:  you should have like you 
A:  definitely have person month and 
A:  travel plans in the budget 
A:  for the main congress but 
A:  maybe you should add some 
A:  extra for the other events 
A:  that are iran and also 
A:  that the follow-up once yes 
A:  the we have core opry 
A:  already the number of events 
A:  that would be manageable i 
A:  think the 
A:  but 
A:  important the also hold the 
A:  view the 
A:  review meetings yeah 
A:  exactly so i thing that 
A:  in the first year we 
A:  should have at least one 
A:  a dry run workshop which 
A:  is like cool actually complete 
A:  test but it's still before 
A:  the mainly recycling rates in 
A:  the second year to definitely 
A:  should be the main congress 
A:  and then maybe one more 
A:  in the same second a 
A:  year or the like tool 
A:  in the thirty years so 
A:  i would ask 
A:  us all if it's that 
A:  if it seems reasonable to 
A:  f one driver and one 
A:  main congress and to follow 
A:  up workshops where you could 
A:  check if this is it 
A:  this is feasible or if 
A:  we have to go for 
A:  just one driver and main 
A:  conference and one follow follow-up 
A:  well 
A:  it is i believe it 
A:  s not decided there no 
A:  and only a vague idea 
A:  that the of course something 
A:  could well be happening a 
A:  year after congress about the 
A:  world and how many of 
A:  s on this idea by 
A:  also you're reminded me an 
A:  important thing i need to 
A:  also ask about because 
A:  there is the clear distinction 
A:  now between and 
A:  your speech 
A:  i get the idea that 
A:  you are interested mainly in 
A:  the types think you yes 
A:  that's because it's like a 
A:  it's more in line with 
A:  the speech research partners want 
A:  to focus on that's non-native 
A:  speech and reduces the of 
A:  the further burden of the 
A:  source languages so it's maybe 
A:  the more important setting could 
A:  be the congress with the 
A:  plenary sessions is something too 
A:  to show off about the 
A:  workshops are like 
A:  more practical i would say 
A:  so that's the that's why 
A:  i kind of promoted them 
A:  now yes sense of but 
A:  they need to us i 
A:  have no idea what forum 
A:  the other be in yeah 
A:  i understood that from what 
A:  i've heard from your colleagues 
A:  i've understood that it's mainly 
A:  these were trapped by the 
A:  station's that the congress is 
A:  with plenary sessions this if 
A:  something the not that frequent 
A:  so 
A:  i think that the darrieux 
A:  fought for now i think 
A:  we're quite on the safe 
A:  side to say that will 
A:  have to wonder iran one 
A:  main and then tool experiments 
A:  so if you can plan 
A:  pour it bends in total 
A:  one of them being that 
A:  the longer one that will 
A:  probably be easy to accomplish 
A:  and i 
A:  would create the i would 
A:  like not to create one 
A:  single pascal saw are 
A:  one the mobile area okay 
A:  yeah so they don't this 
A:  task should derby planned for 
A:  the fall the three years 
A:  like the may be starting 
A:  at month seven because there's 
A:  nothing could have been earlier 
A:  about the running until the 
A:  end without any specific dates 
A:  right exactly okay so let's 
A:  make this one guy asked 
A:  for us all events and 
A:  then in the dark description 
A:  will say that we play 
A:  and have the drive around 
A:  and then the main and 
A:  then the two will follow 
A:  ups yeah 
A:  okay thank you and then 
A:  a related thing is of 
A:  the view or like where 
A:  the event should be mentioned 
A:  and with that into the 
A:  agent to hear so the 
A:  you know the integration work 
A:  package is the one that 
A:  makes sure that everything runs 
A:  that actually delivers the software 
A:  and the tool to the 
A:  to those events while the 
A:  seven dissemination helps 
A:  to promote the project and 
A:  its result at these events 
A:  so this is like corrugated 
A:  activity and the dissemination is 
A:  something that should include a 
A:  view where 
A:  is the integration for the 
A:  events does not need to 
A:  both of you because of 
A:  view is not providing anything 
A:  any more platform into these 
A:  events is 
A:  that clear yes okay yeah 
A:  so now let's move on 
A:  to the next and i 
A:  don't which is the okay 
A:  just let me add one 
A:  and 
A:  the also provides or 
A:  a sucker for not only 
A:  for language 
A:  are currently so it 
A:  obviously being our mother tongue 
A:  language is that the one 
A:  where we perform better and 
A:  we already specialized that the 
A:  for 
A:  many is a domain so 
A:  the so called the bombings 
A:  a country one of our 
A:  customer is the constitutional car 
A:  also all 
A:  about the and the personal 
A:  months acquired the for training 
A:  dedicated the model italian is 
A:  far more than the and 
A:  let me let me say 
A:  you can vary from my 
A:  three 
A:  to six months for some 
A:  months for maximum so it's 
A:  not a huge pasco and 
A:  we can't we have perform 
A:  the tests or so on 
A:  the a at the italian 
A:  parliament that we have been 
A:  competing for the and 
A:  the we reach the accuracy 
A:  up to ninety eight has 
A:  st so 
A:  the it's 
A:  is considered the speech 
A:  recognition system so that's 
A:  very good and i think 
A:  that the that needs to 
A:  be like advertised for in 
A:  the project proposal as well 
A:  and that extends your role 
A:  from being just the integrator 
A:  to also working directly on 
A:  the is our work begich 
A:  right yes yeah so please 
A:  make sure that your purse 
A:  month are already it'll also 
A:  include india is our work 
A:  package and in the description 
A:  the which is not yet 
A:  populated from a very much 
A:  so called little 
A:  slower than we are with 
A:  the writing so this you 
A:  can easily propose your own 
A:  person months there in the 
A:  end the or packages and 
A:  they will see that you 
A:  want to be a body 
A:  or in touch with them 
A:  anyway probably so a just 
A:  the let's make it clear 
A:  in the proposal into the 
A:  and is not one of 
A:  the big languages of saul 
A:  of but it's still one 
A:  of the official languages so 
A:  it it's totally acceptable to 
A:  it to have that in 
A:  and since we have the 
A:  italian partner and the best 
A:  the is our system for 
A:  eight billion in it's it 
A:  would be a pity not 
A:  to use it i would 
A:  say it's so a so 
A:  it's up to you to 
A:  put three or six person 
A:  month there it's just see 
A:  that the it's not too 
A:  much effort needed which is 
A:  good at the same time 
A:  it's good to put that 
A:  effort in so the justification 
A:  is something that can be 
A:  easily word it it's that's 
A:  perfect okay 
A:  so thank 
A:  you so we probably do 
A:  not mean to any specific 
A:  need from a from mosul 
A:  on this but still maybe 
A:  ask around or mentioned that 
A:  in the project there is 
A:  this partner who has the 
A:  best villain recognition in the 
A:  world so that there is 
A:  the chance to use it 
A:  milosz 
A:  i 
A:  guess i can ask around 
A:  about two i'll probably get 
A:  the official again 
A:  that it would be unfair 
A:  to the 
A:  other but 
A:  what to do was probably 
A:  well 
A:  in this way anyway okay 
A:  so simple 
A:  and well the mention it 
A:  only when appropriate and when 
A:  noah no one could be 
A:  offended by the fact that 
A:  we are interested in doing 
A:  it okay 
A:  so now the are the 
A:  next the idea ms the 
A:  this table on the speaker 
A:  made us so if we 
A:  can open that that's part 
A:  of the project 
A:  the 
A:  search each on the budget 
A:  and this is something where 
A:  we need tour is like 
A:  it is for us this 
A:  is for our souls and 
A:  estimate how many burst months 
A:  should be a locate in 
A:  the data collection were package 
A:  and she ship the had 
A:  this the already doing good 
A:  detailed accounting on how many 
A:  hours per speaker do we 
A:  need the for the two 
A:  to be able to add 
A:  a and 
A:  so 
A:  on so and also one 
A:  purpose is to add up 
A:  to the speaker and second 
A:  purpose is to have this 
A:  person as the risk-taker at 
A:  one of the life events 
A:  so 
A:  as you see on online 
A:  seventeen and below there 
A:  is what i entered for 
A:  our souls but this is 
A:  an area of guests and 
A:  i don't know because it's 
A:  hugh but maybe there was 
A:  also knows how many hours 
A:  for speakers urged do we 
A:  need to be able to 
A:  them so my eye and 
A:  my understanding is that for 
A:  each tree speaker or that 
A:  we want to reliably recognize 
A:  we will ask them to 
A:  a certain number of hours 
A:  and the read aloud some 
A:  written text a record this 
A:  is that the way this 
A:  is done or is it 
A:  done differently the speaker adaptation 
A:  and 
A:  essentially how you describe the 
A:  number 
A:  of our are also the 
A:  pens on the system has 
A:  the ability to 
A:  record the forty hours of 
A:  school church that's a lot 
A:  of work yeah a 
A:  lot of work so i 
A:  don't know how much should 
A:  we say that we need 
A:  better speaker general 
A:  usually 
A:  we collect the fewer data 
A:  in not a to or 
A:  maximize both the effort needed 
A:  the and oscar 
A:  let me say march and 
A:  much more of a one-hour 
A:  it 
A:  depends on the and 
A:  also 
A:  of the more 
A:  the data the moss the 
A:  effect that the other nation 
A:  has so it's always 
A:  the so what if we 
A:  or did we sit like 
A:  for hours instead of forty 
A:  four hours to obscure each 
A:  of the check because speakers 
A:  like we would have three 
A:  or speakers the 
A:  that could be like some 
A:  risk takers and also like 
A:  the main person giving the 
A:  plan there is interest free 
A:  speech and then for english 
A:  we as charles university would 
A:  have liked to get hold 
A:  of two of them and 
A:  each of them and these 
A:  were speakers could be may 
A:  be asked to do more 
A:  maybe up to five hours 
A:  per their speaker and then 
A:  for the presence of these 
A:  risk takers at the conference 
A:  that actually needs to estimate 
A:  the full duration of the 
A:  event so three full days 
A:  of dry run and five 
A:  four main conference now i 
A:  heard that the main conferences 
A:  for dates right four 
A:  days from the top of 
A:  my head i don't know 
A:  i 
A:  think it's i think it's 
A:  four days so 
A:  this here is formula that 
A:  doesn't 
A:  really work here's 
A:  a formula that did 
A:  it that 
A:  estimates knowledge like seventy hours 
A:  that need to be covered 
A:  and this is obviously no 
A:  longer like uninterrupted speech was 
A:  so these always hours per 
A:  speaker should be also like 
A:  the total 
A:  are so we need the 
A:  speaker for so if there 
A:  is like some training phase 
A:  or whatever that should be 
A:  included in this so that's 
A:  why when the area so 
A:  that you ask for the 
A:  person to speak for one 
A:  hour it's it would be 
A:  probably good to party like 
A:  two hours but 
A:  actually expect and i don't 
A:  get more than three hours 
A:  of the recording or something 
A:  like that so 
A:  i would like now to 
A:  the because 
A:  i was being about the 
A:  numbers the starts 
A:  from an already existing go 
A:  acoustic model for the language 
A:  so all of the okay 
A:  so 
A:  it's to have a check 
A:  in the english language to 
A:  all the station 
A:  yeah 
A:  so i assume that fish 
A:  motive for the so well 
A:  actually when that when the 
A:  recording happens you need just 
A:  the person proper a device 
A:  to record the ways but 
A:  then to actually make use 
A:  of these days where you 
A:  do have to have the 
A:  moto just 
A:  i assume that for english 
A:  i 
A:  have lost your or 
A:  believing 
A:  ok i 
A:  have lost the yeah 
A:  so i was just thinking 
A:  that for the recording you 
A:  have falsely that person and 
A:  the device and then for 
A:  the of this recording for 
A:  the actual model adaptation a 
A:  your need to have the 
A:  baseline acoustic model and i 
A:  assume that the poor english 
A:  this will be given to 
A:  bird or to the project 
A:  by karlsruhe or edinburgh or 
A:  possibly even her voice a 
A:  week we will try to 
A:  create our own but we 
A:  are still starting with this 
A:  so i don't expect that 
A:  we'll be able to have 
A:  like the best before models 
A:  are sold at four check 
A:  of a in touch with 
A:  the czech radio and they 
A:  should be able to provide 
A:  us with us like a 
A:  considerable number of hours like 
A:  getting the numbers right now 
A:  and put them into the 
A:  proposal a to create the 
A:  baseline acoustic model so there 
A:  will be more necessary to 
A:  process this that 
A:  but we should not need 
A:  any recordings for the base 
A:  line acoustic model for check 
A:  hopefully the data is already 
A:  out there somewhere okay and 
A:  the most important for me 
A:  also to 
A:  also have the transcription of 
A:  which yes so the nets 
A:  for the czech radio also 
A:  has an that there was 
A:  a project here that also 
A:  did this transcribing of the 
A:  czech recordings so that there 
A:  is some transcribe data for 
A:  check my 
A:  friend in 
A:  the adaptation that is to 
A:  be able to collect the 
A:  a 
A:  so 
A:  speaking sessions in order to 
A:  also be able to maul 
A:  the not only the boys 
A:  but also the way it 
A:  is the speech during elio 
A:  life session because you know 
A:  it or reading the and 
A:  without the pressure of the 
A:  event that is the friend 
A:  of bending the yeah 
A:  so let's that that's a 
A:  very good idea i 
A:  will make sure that we 
A:  have this like it actually 
A:  fits nicely in the in 
A:  the hours here in this 
A:  table so we could have 
A:  like one more purpose and 
A:  that would be the like 
A:  recording or adapting or the 
A:  at the wrist broken in 
A:  bones so that could be 
A:  part of this these conferences 
A:  already or it could be 
A:  a separate thing i think 
A:  this is that in the 
A:  propose that we should write 
A:  that this will happen at 
A:  the dry run but we 
A:  may want to have like 
A:  more a search was speaking 
A:  sections as 
A:  well as 
A:  up thank 
A:  you so for italy and 
A:  for the other languages can 
A:  you please populate this stable 
A:  as i said this is 
A:  for us or the idea 
A:  is that we will like 
A:  this that they build the 
A:  upper parts on this do 
A:  the at ups and so 
A:  this the blue one at 
A:  the hours by the different 
A:  languages that we want to 
A:  record and the rich supt 
A:  able summarizes these first months 
A:  by a partner so then 
A:  each of you once like 
A:  you have indicated that you 
A:  on that type of language 
A:  and a double speaker we'll 
A:  see how many person months 
A:  it creates and this number 
A:  should be accounted for in 
A:  the in the data work 
A:  package so we can obviously 
A:  process also english speaking a 
A:  risk takers giving short term 
A:  contracts to them and to 
A:  and doing the recording here 
A:  in prague so if for 
A:  example a edinburgh would such 
A:  is that they want to 
A:  have some english for speakers 
A:  like a and than just 
A:  make sure that you like 
A:  create this line here and 
A:  say than it is to 
A:  be included in our budget 
A:  because like we should be 
A:  paying those people but it 
A:  is for the purposes that 
A:  edinburgh wants to do something 
A:  specific if that would be 
A:  the case the 
A:  butt of these as to 
A:  be feared the by each 
A:  partner all 
A:  the needs 
A:  for german yet so all 
A:  that did this should be 
A:  filled by all the teams 
A:  that want to get like 
A:  direct access to data for 
A:  speaker at patient and to 
A:  up the cars were to 
A:  decide how much of the 
A:  time do they want to 
A:  invest in vision for german 
A:  the project that 
A:  will so yeah 
A:  it's the alike very uncertain 
A:  at the moment but we 
A:  hope to get hold of 
A:  the of the actual interpreters 
A:  who will be interpreting and 
A:  the saw a euros i 
A:  can rest and it would 
A:  be great get these for 
A:  the adaptations sessions and these 
A:  would be speaking german french 
A:  as 
A:  well a so maybe our 
A:  creator here like all these 
A:  for each of these languages 
A:  some charles university handled three 
A:  speakers and hold that we 
A:  will get these people and 
A:  record those but if through 
A:  a or your would like 
A:  to have more data of 
A:  warrior particle language of interest 
A:  then enter this here well 
A:  as i said this is 
A:  only for us to see 
A:  how much do 
A:  we have to have one 
A:  on the data of and 
A:  this is this is what 
A:  we will their so the 
A:  than these person month here 
A:  do not make it directly 
A:  to the to the spreadsheet 
A:  here to the hordes they 
A:  should get to hear only 
A:  through the all relief involvement 
A:  in the data collection ask 
A:  okay so 
A:  is their there's one more 
A:  thing and that would be 
A:  the other direction the 
A:  other direct coast so for 
A:  the equipment that 
A:  yeah it's i don't know 
A:  how to alter global this 
A:  but it and are you 
A:  previously said that you were 
A:  just fine for the conference 
A:  interpreting that you already ran 
A:  for the for the insurance 
A:  company you are just fine 
A:  with the or the audio 
A:  equipment that was there was 
A:  their can we simply trust 
A:  that the same will happen 
A:  for the euro sigh congress 
A:  or do we want to 
A:  be specific as i initially 
A:  suggested that like you would 
A:  describe what equipment is needed 
A:  and say oh well then 
A:  include this in their call 
A:  for tenders i 
A:  the 
A:  checking the of specific abu 
A:  especially because 
A:  we 
A:  have lost because of a 
A:  have to be they have 
A:  to use a the and 
A:  had sets the in order 
A:  to be sure but the 
A:  oldest seed now use the 
A:  in the better for palazzo 
A:  so it's the i 
A:  will the some for 
A:  the equipment because we will 
A:  have also call the 
A:  for 
A:  publishing and we will have 
A:  to get all your from 
A:  the in from 
A:  the and 
A:  sens all 
A:  of the or 
A:  identify where engines 
A:  will decide if a and 
A:  ben also the publishing 
A:  the those are so that 
A:  would be a the 
A:  also some equipment on board 
A:  by saya are we learn 
A:  the i 
A:  will make a commission as 
A:  soon as possible yeah 
A:  this so the idea where 
A:  this belongs the thanks for 
A:  it this that this belongs 
A:  exactly to this sheets jewelry 
A:  detailed other director sheet in 
A:  the google sheet a so 
A:  far you don't have any 
A:  line for equipment because they 
A:  haven't realized this and then 
A:  just right down online here 
A:  and write down that this 
A:  is for equipment and write 
A:  down that this is the 
A:  equipment for the risky cure 
A:  recordings and this is the 
A:  and this is the hardware 
A:  for the conference or whatever 
A:  what ever is needed and 
A:  this should get ended up 
A:  for 
A:  each of the partner here 
A:  and also listed 
A:  by dr by type and 
A:  if there are more types 
A:  if you need to create 
A:  more types than just to 
A:  create those in our figure 
A:  this table the 
A:  and 
A:  the total numbers the partner 
A:  then get automatically copy each 
A:  to this firsts sheet so 
A:  we'll see how that balances 
A:  the or budget okay some 
A:  for of all the equipment 
A:  i 
A:  think that we will also 
A:  need some of those devices 
A:  for the risky credit station 
A:  so if you could like 
A:  estimate how much is like 
A:  one key the four recording 
A:  one person this so that 
A:  we can do the recordings 
A:  with the race because here 
A:  and then we will but 
A:  depending on how much is 
A:  that we will probably purchase 
A:  were like or maybe 
A:  even more for this site 
A:  so that we can do 
A:  the recordings of the other 
A:  speakers here okay so 
A:  if you can make like 
A:  a separate line for one 
A:  key for risky per according 
A:  an out copy that for 
A:  ourselves than okay when the 
A:  and 
A:  the but 
A:  is the cost 
A:  of the equipment yet okay 
A:  thank you so this will 
A:  have next call a with 
A:  others on thursday so if 
A:  you could do this before 
A:  thursday with some rough lumber 
A:  that would probably be good 
A:  well the time is running 
A:  up its we have like 
A:  fourteen days to finish the 
A:  proposal and that's very little 
A:  ok 
A:  so the last the which 
A:  is the missing text parts 
A:  and here 
A:  i think that it's probably 
A:  more efficient if we just 
A:  say goodbye and everybody will 
A:  spend the remaining fifty made 
A:  in writing and writing or 
A:  do you have any other 
A:  ideas how to make sure 
A:  that we create a good 
A:  proposal it 
A:  the 
A:  a i think it's important 
A:  but also for the integration 
A:  park the other part is 
A:  that needs to integrate because 
A:  all of the parties will 
A:  need to integrate the also 
A:  participate in the drafting the 
A:  text ideas 
A:  i can and i d 
A:  as a tool and improve 
A:  the information and the but 
A:  so from my side yeah 
A:  so there's one thing i 
A:  actually the one to wanted 
A:  to comment on things you 
A:  created that tasks in the 
A:  integration work package but primal 
A:  titles only and it was 
A:  not clear to me what 
A:  is the integration with publishing 
A:  platform so the publishing platform 
A:  is for the minutes that's 
A:  like the or 
A:  that's task six point for 
A:  a while try to open 
A:  that here if i ask 
A:  six point four was the 
A:  one about the was not 
A:  so clear to me and 
A:  the euro we already thought 
A:  about but before and the 
A:  implement the development of the 
A:  plot of the publishing platform 
A:  all four 
A:  were like making it yeah 
A:  so now the tasks i 
A:  like it's hard for me 
A:  to look at it but 
A:  the task integration or 
A:  any 
A:  only it so task six 
A:  point one is the integration 
A:  of from 
A:  multiple partners into the power 
A:  of voices but form and 
A:  the that's so everybody is 
A:  involved in their which is 
A:  expected to be expected the 
A:  integration of multi darker than 
A:  the engine should definitely include 
A:  us and edinburgh i guess 
A:  so 
A:  we can make sure that 
A:  you are there as well 
A:  i'm talking about this if 
A:  you can see my screen 
A:  then i'm talking about six 
A:  point two and 
A:  then we have this automatic 
A:  minute being there will be 
A:  more from 
A:  and from all from off 
A:  of you are i'm not 
A:  sure about so this is 
A:  record regarding the other email 
A:  the workbench 
A:  leadership i don't know how 
A:  much you want to delve 
A:  into meeting yourselves or how 
A:  much because we're so 
A:  i think the we 
A:  can discuss yeah 
A:  exactly so this is it 
A:  this is the worry or 
A:  you're in when norman cook 
A:  also raised in near 
A:  and the integration with publishing 
A:  platform and it's probably something 
A:  which will be mainly per 
A:  voice and almost nothing from 
A:  others or maybe exclusively for 
A:  what's right you 
A:  know maybe i will or 
A:  i would like to also 
A:  odd the 
A:  design and testing purposes because 
A:  the cell 
A:  and power was should be 
A:  here at the euros like 
A:  congress this is actually something 
A:  which terry named today but 
A:  it should be all this 
A:  all events and these should 
A:  include everyone because everyone will 
A:  be a like the are 
A:  going to be available for 
A:  the congress and also for 
A:  the other are the events 
A:  so that the involvement in 
A:  terms of first months were 
A:  very but everybody should not 
A:  be there yeah 
A:  ok so the deliverables i 
A:  think that will probably promise 
A:  reports only or 
A:  systems i don't know the 
A:  maybe recall could comment on 
A:  there and design of the 
A:  liberals because that's what like 
A:  in the spoken language translation 
A:  and maybe we could mimic 
A:  this layout in indy integration 
A:  work which you why 
A:  has so what 
A:  kind of thing here at 
A:  we 
A:  had a similar we 
A:  had systems 
A:  every at and 
A:  with some reports that we 
A:  wrote and the 
A:  pension 
A:  kinda 
A:  and that 
A:  once 
A:  and that we have to 
A:  find a to 
A:  allow the integration of it 
A:  as well i'm not one 
A:  hundred percent sure like whether 
A:  all the pros promise 
A:  to deliver for 
A:  our was 
A:  mentioned a 
A:  the 
A:  muscles are a herd that 
A:  milestones are something that you 
A:  just take off in the 
A:  system were arrested for each 
A:  deliverable even if it's a 
A:  there has to be like 
A:  a cover report is that 
A:  i think it's pdf 
A:  and in 
A:  fact those were small is 
A:  how you install this is 
A:  the number of or 
A:  from 
A:  like 
A:  i 
A:  that 
A:  the and that the let's 
A:  is so i suggested that 
A:  to do the same thing 
A:  is the question the harder 
A:  question is the timing so 
A:  maybe darrieux if you were 
A:  a walk which the such 
A:  as something for a low 
A:  for your package like buy 
A:  when should be what should 
A:  version of a liberal and 
A:  then we will check it 
A:  in the timing of the 
A:  terrible should be somewhat in 
A:  line with the timing of 
A:  the work packages inch this 
A:  that 
A:  the work because that we 
A:  have just talked about is 
A:  spoken english translation and that's 
A:  three so 
A:  recourse tasks all run of 
A:  throughout the whole project so 
A:  the organization is then kind 
A:  of taken 
A:  over by the individual prototypes 
A:  and the releases i would 
A:  slightly proof for to have 
A:  some like progress visible also 
A:  in the tasks and that's 
A:  what i do for my 
A:  of multilingual mission translation so 
A:  this is like the current 
A:  tentative plan that will first 
A:  focus on market whatever 
A:  in there will be terrible 
A:  for the related to those 
A:  and i like the idea 
A:  of having few months between 
A:  the software and the report 
A:  and the integration so for 
A:  the nasir number 
A:  six there is also this 
A:  will like compact block off 
A:  of tasks all tasks running 
A:  through all the project duration 
A:  and i would like to 
A:  see this as somehow a 
A:  somehow grady is 
A:  so the port at for 
A:  example them anything integration is 
A:  definitely something that can start 
A:  only like in the middle 
A:  of the project so 
A:  which will just the either 
A:  diary or myself will just 
A:  review that the more you 
A:  do darrieux the better because 
A:  the more reliable the estimates 
A:  are i would just make 
A:  something up a but you 
A:  do it just 
A:  to speed up or slow 
A:  the text the image 
A:  the development of the is 
A:  it okay if i write 
A:  it in a hostel 
A:  for me cool walk total 
A:  ok i prefer google doc 
A:  if you don't mind so 
A:  well i don't have microsoft 
A:  word at all so if 
A:  you send me a word 
A:  document will anyway 
A:  to just open it actually 
A:  and 
A:  so if you start google 
A:  separate one than to do 
A:  the merging of the text 
A:  into the old ok that's 
A:  fine we'll look is fun 
A:  from ok 
A:  so i think that's it 
A:  for now and 
A:  close the call on live 
A:  there any other questions novel 
A:  question yeah 
A:  ok so thanks very much 
A:  everybody for joining today and 
A:  the we'll recall again on 
A:  thursday and otherwise we keep 
A:  the exchange email will 
A:  go like get created quickly 
A:  they yeah 
A:  by 
A:  on it 
A:  like mill she noticed there 
A:  lajoie 
A:  but
