ELITR Pre-project meeting 2018
Fri, May 04, 2018
time and place?
Attendees: CUNI, Karlsruhe, UEDIN, Alfaview, ?
The purpose: To familiarize attendees with individual work-packages, to discuss the division of labor and tune some details about the project

An update on SAO status
● A partner in the B part, in the actual application 3rd part, linked through other partners 
● A separate columns in the budget draft especially for SAO - later included in total afterward
● Technically, standalone partner contributing a few person-months

Leadership of work-packages
● CUNI - multilingual MT, management and probably also keeps minuting
● UEDIN will lead data work-package

Involvement on partners in the integration work-package 6
● Everybody to check and provide input till tomorrow to draft should be completed

Deliverables 
● Publishing platform - software and report (not confirmed yet)
● Other events after the EUROSAI event for month 32 - a report about running

Milestones
● first engine integrated with the platform
● first preparatory event at SAO
● Unified communication platform integrated - could also be deliverable, it’s on the agreement between Alfaview and PerVoice
● EUROSAI event - also deliverable - a report in the form of journal paper describing technical aspects of the running the event
● Automatic minuting integrated with platform - first version

The project name
● Probably ELITR - nicer content and spelled-out version

Presentation of the respective work-packages by work-package leaders - at first to decide who leads which WP
WP1 - Data
The data for speaker and accent adaptation
● KIT - the leading partner
● A budget contribution - KIT and UEDIN to consider:
● Number of demanded hours per speaker, number of speakers for recordings - adaptation purposes and presence at the conferences
External resources for MT and SLT
● A new data will be created only for the ASR adaptation
● KIT to add tasks and UEDIN to estimate the number of devoted person-months
 Collecting minuting data
● To gather existing online meetings and manually revise the transcript
● Creating and collecting documents - agendas, minutes for making training and test sets
 Deliverables
● Initial release if the training data month 6, a final release at the end of second year
● Three different test sets months 10, 20, 30
● The corpus of the minutes - training data for the summarization
WP2 ASR
Robustness of acoustic modeling
Semi-supervised language adaptation
Lifelong learning during deployment
Deliverables missing

WP3 SLT
Transcript normalization
Developing methods to increase the robustness of MT systems towards noisy input texts
End-to-end speech text translation
Deliverables
● Three prototypes - alignment of prototypes are required
● Reports in the middle and at the end of the project
 Suggestion to include some languages for business reasons
● A question to Alfaview about languages in their interest - English, Spanish, Chinese would also be good
● Actually is also listed Arabic and Kazakh

WP4 Multilingual MT
 The baseline model - CUNI, KIT, UEDIN - It runs during the first half on first year
● Two purposes: delivery of the MT to PerVoice into the integration and for the research afterward
● Suggestion to go some of the languages only for the multilingual systems
 Document-level translation - Runs throughout three years
● For speech and also for the test
Multi-target MT - in the first year
● For the conference in the middle of the second year - translation from 6 to 43 languages
 Multi-source - second year
● Training on more sources of language to gain in translation quality
 Flexible multilingual MT
● Capable of translating from one-more languages into one-more languages at the same time
Deliverables missing - probably yearly reports and one deliverable on the baseline MT models

The gaps in introductory sections
● Partner description - everybody has to mention two people

Objectives, the relation to the work program, the early parts of the concept
● Everyone should read it and comment it

Methodology polishment required - two partners for each part
● Remote conferencing - reviewed by KIT
● The state of ASR missing - to write by KIT and UEDIN to review
● MT incomplete - CUNI to fill and UEDIN will review it
● SLT - hopefully written by UEDIN, reviewed by CUNI
● The summarization is also probably finished - KIT to review it
● Minuting tools - reviewed by Alfaview
● Handling people - should be reviewed by everyone

The concept seems rather weak - Alfaview to provide further dissemination

Ambition missing - will be written by CUNI
Expected impacts - Everyone to review it, every suggestion is welcome

Impact maximization - Alfaview to derive specific tasks for dissemination work-package
● Managing social media, local press releases, CeBIT - description and planned activities

WP5 Minuting
Discussion about the task “The live minute platform.”
● Collaboration between CUNI and Alfaview is necessary
● According to Alfaview, it is not doable with the scope of this project - only in case, it would be found some co-editing solution, especially for the actual project.
●  The first year - only research focused on online solutions - in case of failure end here for a while
● The second year - a possibility of implementing the interface
● Deliverables - two research reports to first year (initial, final) and demonstrator

WP6 The integration of the system 
The integration with the unified platform - Alfaview to describe the task
The integration of the minuting: AV, CUNI, PV - clarification of the role of PV - transcript generation
Task 6.3 will be replaced by task 5.5

WP7 Dissemination
 Lead by Alfaview - to populate tasks and to specify activities 
 Workshop on NLP technology at the EUROSAI Congress
● To promote and disseminate technologies and collect user feedback
● CUNI also plans to contribute to the organization of the workshop and feedback collection
 Deliverables - A short report about the workshop

Every task should be put into some specific time

CUNI or Alfaview have to create task related to the website

France should focus only on the platform task, Brigitte and Carolina mainly to dissemination task
