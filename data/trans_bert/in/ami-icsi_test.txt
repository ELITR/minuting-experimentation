{"src": "um i spoke with dave johnson about putting all the meeting recorder stuff on non - backed - up disk to save the overhead of backup and uh , so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and uh recording meetings . so i guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that , things that are recreatable easily and also yeah , basically things that are recreatable .", "tgt": "abstract: additionally , the group have progressed further with data storage issues , with backing-up their data now regarded as a priority , and more disk space required ."}
{"src": "so i 've been doing a bunch of xml tools yeah and then the other thing also that thilo noticed is , on the microphone , i mean this is why i wan na use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text the the one that shows up here , that will flash yellow if the mike is n't connected .", "tgt": "abstract: tools for accessing key file information have been developed which should ensure all meeting information is present ."}
{"src": "good . crosspads ? who basically said `` if you 're not using them , could you return them ? `` we we used them a couple times , we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . uh part of the reason i think part of the reason that adam was so interested in uh the speechcorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a pda with a wireless card . and and that way you can synchronize very easily with the the the meeting i mean for what what you 've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else , maybe we could do like a student project , you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool . i mean if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more", "tgt": "abstract: the collection of crosspad note-taking data will be pursued in future meetings ."}
{"src": "i know that uh that thilo you were , um , bringing the channeltrans interface onto the windows machine ? yeah it 's it basically it 's done , and then at the same time i 'll probably rewire the room as per jane 's suggestion w uh we ordered uh more wireless , so that uh the first n channels are wireless , eh are the m the close - talking and the next n are far - field . i mean there 's there 's all this stuff going on uh between uh andreas and and and dave and chuck and others with various kinds of runs uh um recognition runs , trying to figure things out about the features but it 's it 's all sort of in process ,", "tgt": "abstract: finally , other progress made includes getting the channeltrans interface working , ordering more wireless microphones , and analysing recognition runs ."}
{"src": "s so when we here were having this demo meeting , what we 're sort of coming up with is that we wan na have all these pieces together , to first order , by the end of the month next month . uh that 'll that 'll give us that 'll give us a week or so to uh to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works ,", "tgt": "decisions: darpa demo illustrating prosody of meeting events will be completed by the end of the ( next ) month , so as to allow a week or so for transferring data across to laptops ."}
{"src": "um i spoke with dave johnson about putting all the meeting recorder stuff on non - backed - up disk to save the overhead of backup but he thought it was a bad idea . in fact what he said is doing the manual one , doing uh nw archive to copy it is a good idea and we should do that and have it backed up . he w he 's a firm believer in in lots of different modalities of backup . this data can not be recovered . and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup . if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gon na burden things in the incremental backups . just just the monthly full . and we 're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it 's w probably ok . and uh , so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and uh recording meetings . so i guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that , things that are recreatable easily and also yeah , basically things that are recreatable .", "tgt": "decisions: after consulting others , the group decide that not backing up their meeting data is a bad idea , since this can not be recovered ."}
{"src": "in fact what he said is doing the manual one , doing uh nw archive to copy it is a good idea and we should do that and have it backed up . he w he 's a firm believer in in lots of different modalities of backup . this data can not be recovered . and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup . if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gon na burden things in the incremental backups . just just the monthly full . and we 're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it 's w probably ok . and uh , so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and uh recording meetings . so i guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that , things that are recreatable easily and also yeah , basically things that are recreatable .", "tgt": "decisions: therefore , meeting recorder data will be backed up , and also stored manually using the nw archive ."}
{"src": "so i guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that , things that are recreatable easily and also yeah , basically things that are recreatable . and uh , so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and uh recording meetings .", "tgt": "decisions: more disk space will be purchased , however for now , data which is easily re-creatable will not be backed up ."}
{"src": "uh part of the reason i think part of the reason that adam was so interested in uh the speechcorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes but uh by i i would suggest you return one . because we we you know , we we have n't used it at all . one would probably be fine . maybe we could do like a student project , you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool . i mean if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more", "tgt": "decisions: after evaluating the use of the crosspads , the group decide to return one , and also keep one which will be left out in meetings to encourage its use ."}
{"src": "we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a pda with a wireless card . and and that way you can synchronize very easily with the the the meeting i mean for what what you 've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else , maybe we could do like a student project , you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool . i mean if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more", "tgt": "decisions: use of pdas and buttons for note-taking will be investigated , along with using the data for a student research project ."}
{"src": "i mean you hav sorta have to . yeah , so we might wan na do it simultaneous .", "tgt": "decisions: because of time constraints , the group decide to do simultaneous digits ."}
{"src": "but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either but it does mean you need to be running a web server . and so it it 's pretty big and complex . uh and it would be difficult to port to windows uh the other option is dan did the tcl - tk thisl gui front - end for broadcast news", "tgt": "problems: improving the thisl front-end user interface may be difficult if it is to run on windows as a web server tcl-tk may need to be used instead ."}
{"src": "so yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in xml", "tgt": "problems: more information on xml transcription formats is required for the creation of the tools ."}
{"src": "oh , quick question on that . is do we have the the seat information ? the seat information is on the key files for the ones which but i just had n't ever been putting it in the key files . i never knew we were supposed to put it in the key file . i mean this is why i wan na use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text because with the plain text it 's very easy to skip those things . yeah and then the other thing also that thilo noticed is , on the microphone , on channel zero it says hand - held mike or crown mike , you actually have to say which one . and then uh also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under `` participants `` they were filled in under `` description `` . the the one that shows up here , that will flash yellow if the mike is n't connected .", "tgt": "problems: information for key files , such as microphone type , seating , and participant information , is not being properly recorded , and in some cases the microphones are n't working properly ."}
{"src": "i mean this is why i wan na use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text because with the plain text it 's very easy to skip those things . yeah and then the other thing also that thilo noticed is , on the microphone , the the one that shows up here , that will flash yellow if the mike is n't connected .", "tgt": "problems: however this should be rectified by the use of appropriate xml tools ."}
{"src": "we we used them a couple times , and i have uh so my my feeling on it is that i think in principle it 's a really nice idea , and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . on the other hand , i the down side for me was that i think the pen is really noisy . so that you can you have a record of whatever it is you 've written . so i if you take notes it 's a great little device . and one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because uh we were interested in in higher - level things , not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth so that it 's synchronized with the time on that and then you have to download to an application , and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you wan na do anything with this information . and you do n't wan na take notes well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wan na make an x", "tgt": "problems: the crosspads have not been used to their full potential , which is because of a number of problems regarding their use:"}
{"src": "so that it 's synchronized with the time on that and then you have to download to an application , and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you wan na do anything with this information .", "tgt": "problems: first , they need to be synchronised with the time of the meeting recording , and secondly , they use a non standard data format which needs converting ."}
{"src": "and you do n't wan na take notes well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wan na make an x", "tgt": "problems: additionally , some people tend not to make notes in meetings ."}
{"src": "so , i think this is gon na be a pretty short meeting because i have four agenda items ,", "tgt": "abstract: this is a relatively short meeting of the meeting recorder group , with only a few agenda items ."}
{"src": "three of them were requested by jane who is not gon na be at the meeting today . um well first of all with ibm i got a note from brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a week or week and a half ago and hopefully next week we 'll have the transcription back from that . so we 're doing some in parallel .", "tgt": "abstract: transcription was discussed briefly because jane was not present , however this appears to be progressing well in parallel with ibm ."}
{"src": "so i 've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected that 's the thing that i sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages so jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but i do n't really think there 's much to talk about . i 'm gon na send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to suggest edits . so but it 's just transcripts , not the not the audio ? nope , they 'll have access to the audio also . because the transcripts might not be right . so , um the audio that they 're gon na have access to , will that be the uncompressed version ? or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and yeah , it 's it 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , uh , uh , it takes too long to do random access decompression .", "tgt": "abstract: web pages have been set up to show transcription status and to allow participants to approve transcripts ."}
{"src": "um , darpa demo status , not much to say . the back - end stuff is working out fine . and , also um , i was just showing andreas , i got um an x waves kind of display , and i do n't know how much more we can do with it with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom", "tgt": "abstract: darpa demos are progressing well with the back-end indexed to allow front-end filtering , and a potential demo ideas investigated which would use x waves ."}
{"src": "i 've been putting together uh transcriber things for windows but but it would be cool if the transcriber interface had like another window for the you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform . and see the pitch contours also . just record the audio clip and show an image and i think that 's and , the more live , the better , but uh , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent . so i think for a lot of reasons , i think it would be very nice to have this transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it", "tgt": "abstract: transcriber is now working for windows , however live pitch contours may not work in the time available ."}
{"src": "and the last i item on the agenda is disk issues yet again . we 're we 're only about thirty percent on the second disk . but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings .", "tgt": "abstract: backed-up disk space is now fine , however temporary space is running out fast ."}
{"src": "uh , you know dave johnson is gone for , like , ten days , i mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , so this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to dave , but at any rate i think that there 's a there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need", "tgt": "abstract: interim measures are discussed while sysadmin are away ."}
{"src": "um yot i tested the uh the sort of final version of the plp configuration um on development test data for for this year 's hub - five test set . and the recognition performance was exactly , and i mean exactly up to the you know , the first decimal , same as with the uh mel cepstra front - end . they they were the males i think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really . and then the really nice thing was that if if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement .", "tgt": "abstract: improvement has been made in the final version of the plp , which shows better female performance , and combined with mel ceptra offers 1.5 % improvement ."}
{"src": "and then we had some results on digits , uh , with um and the reason is basically there 's a whole bunch of read speech data in the hub - five training set .", "tgt": "abstract: digit performance also improved thanks to training using scripted speech data ."}
{"src": "and then i th guess chuck and i had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system", "tgt": "abstract: progress has also been made in sri alignment for tandem system ."}
{"src": "so something that we wan na do next meeting is is uh to put together um , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it , um , that we 've done . i mean just sort of bulletize i mean o e do do i can i can dream up text but this is basically gon na lead to the annual report . so just a week from tomorrow ? um uh one thing i mean we in past meetings we had um also a you know various variously talked about the um work that w uh was happening sort of on the on the recognition side well , it 's that it 's just gon na be ver very boring for people who are not you know , sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system . well , ok , so how many how many people here would not be interested in uh in a meeting about recognition ? liz and jane probably . why do n't we alternate this meeting every other week ? but i do i do n't i mean a lot of times lately it seems like we do n't really have enough for a full meeting on meeting recorder . and then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting . uh . so uh . um . let 's chat about it with liz and jane when we get a chance , see what they think and", "tgt": "abstract: the group note that the annual report needs to be worked on for next week , and it is also suggested to hold recognition meetings separately , however these issues will be discussed in more detail at the next meeting ."}
{"src": "because i i need to ask jane whether it 's it would be ok for her um , s some of her people to transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the smartkom data collection , which is these short like five or seven minute sessions . but to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started . and so um i wanted to ask jane if if uh , you know , maybe one of their transcribers could could do i mean since these are very short , that should really be uh ,", "tgt": "decisions: jane will be contacted to see whether transcribers could work on a small amount of smartkom data , in order to get the project moving ."}
{"src": "i 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it .", "tgt": "decisions: details of the transcription status web page will be sent to the group ."}
{"src": "so jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but i do n't really think there 's much to talk about . i 'm gon na send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to suggest edits . so but it 's just transcripts , not the not the audio ? nope , they 'll have access to the audio also . because the transcripts might not be right . so , um the audio that they 're gon na have access to , will that be the uncompressed version ? or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and yeah , it 's it 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , uh , uh , it takes too long to do random access decompression . yeah , i was just wondering because we 're uh running out of the un - backed - up disk space on", "tgt": "decisions: participants will be contacted to approve transcripts or suggest edits , however this depends upon decisions regarding disk space and ( un ) compression of audio files ."}
{"src": "uh , you know dave johnson is gone for , like , ten days , i mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , so this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to dave , but at any rate i think that there 's a there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need", "tgt": "decisions: there are disk space problems regarding scratch space , although the group decide that a solution about adding extra drives can not be resolved without talking to sysadmin ."}
{"src": "i have um i have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer . i mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , so this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to dave , but at any rate i think that there 's a there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need", "tgt": "decisions: until they can be contacted , the group will use the hard drives on each other 's machines ."}
{"src": "but but it would be cool if the transcriber interface had like another window for the you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform . and see the pitch contours also . just record the audio clip and show an image and i think that 's and , the more live , the better , but uh , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent . so i think for a lot of reasons , i think it would be very nice to have this transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it", "tgt": "decisions: displaying pitch contours live in transcriber would be desirable for the demo , however , if the group run out of time , the group note that they could generate this statically using powerpoint ."}
{"src": "um uh one thing i mean we in past meetings we had um also a you know various variously talked about the um work that w uh was happening sort of on the on the recognition side well , it 's that it 's just gon na be ver very boring for people who are not you know , sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system . well , ok , so how many how many people here would not be interested in uh in a meeting about recognition ? liz and jane probably . why do n't we alternate this meeting every other week ? but i do i do n't i mean a lot of times lately it seems like we do n't really have enough for a full meeting on meeting recorder . and then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting . uh . so uh . um . let 's chat about it with liz and jane when we get a chance , see what they think and", "tgt": "decisions: the group decide that it may be more beneficial to have separate meetings to discuss recognition , since jane and liz are less likely to be interested in this ."}
{"src": "uh . so uh . um . let 's chat about it with liz and jane when we get a chance , see what they think and", "tgt": "decisions: they will discuss this with them before going ahead ."}
{"src": "but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings . and , my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space , but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data all at once , in a lot of different ways . you we need about a gig per meeting . i have um i have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer . but at any rate i think that there 's a there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need", "tgt": "problems: scratch disk space used to store the uncompressed meetings when they are being processed is getting short - the group are using 98 % ."}
{"src": "well , maybe it should get another rack . uh , you know dave johnson is gone for , like , ten days , i have um i have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer . i mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , well i sent that message out to , i guess , you and dave asking for if we could get some disk . the sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine . so they do n't want to stack up external drives . so this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to dave , i think part of the reason why dave ca n't get the the new machines up is because he does n't have room in the machine room right now . but at any rate i think that there 's a there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need", "tgt": "problems: various options are suggested about adding extra drives , externally to their machines , or to the server , but these can not be resolved until after the relevant sysadmin person returns from a break in 10 days time ."}
{"src": "uh the back - end is uh , going more slowly as i s i think i said before just cuz i 'm not much of a tcl - tk programmer .", "tgt": "problems: time is getting tight for some of the demo development , especially a lack of tcl-tk skills slowing up back-end progress ."}

{"src": "so something that we wan na do next meeting is is uh to put together um , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it , um , that we 've done . i mean just sort of bulletize i mean o e do do i can i can dream up text but this is basically gon na lead to the annual report . so just a week from tomorrow ?", "tgt": "problems: annual report is due next week , so this will need to be discussed at the next meeting ."}
{"src": "so i did n't send out agenda items because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item and now we have two . and if you disagree with it , why do n't you read it and give me comments on it ?", "tgt": "abstract: although the meeting recorder group only list two agenda items , this meeting explores transcription , and in particular , consent forms in depth , and at times results in heated debate ."}
{"src": "so , uh , as most of you should know , i did send out the consent form thingies and we had decided that they have they only needed to sign once . no . at some point y you go around and get people to sign something ? this is in the summer period and presumably people may be out of town . but we can make the assumption , ca n't we ? that , um , they will be receiving email , uh , most of the month . it well , it well , you 're right . sometimes somebody will be away that 's it 's , you know , just a certain risk to take . cuz i because if we wan na be able to give it to people july fifteenth , if somebody 's gon na come back and say `` ok , i do n't want this and this and this used `` , uh , clearly we need some time to respond to that .", "tgt": "abstract: with regard to obtaining consent , the group discuss the extent to which they need to attempt to contact people , which methods are most appropriate , and how much responsibility rests on participants being available and checking their e-mail regularly ."}

{"src": "so , just to repeat the thing bef that we said last week , it was there 's this suggestion of alternating weeks on more , uh , automatic speech recognition related or not ? well we have n't really started , but i figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each . so next week we 'll do automatic transcription status , plus anything that 's real timely .", "tgt": "decisions: they decide that covering such topics over alternate weeks will commence at the next meeting , although other topics will be discussed if time allows ."}
{"src": "and then maybe it 'd be good to set an explicit deadline , something like a week before that , uh , j july fifteenth date , or two weeks before .", "tgt": "decisions: the group decide that it would be good to set a date for having the non-native network services group data , and one or two weeks before the 15th of july is suggested ."}
{"src": "and we had decided that they have they only needed to sign once . no . at some point y you go around and get people to sign something ? so . a and , then , you know , say very clearly that if they do n't if we do n't hear from them , you know , as morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain period after we contact them that is implicitly giving their agreement . well , they 've already signed a form . and the s and the form was approved by human subjects , i i i em email is enough . i mean , i 'm not a lawyer , but i 've been through these things a f things f like this a few times with lawyers now so i i i i 'm pretty comfortable with that .", "tgt": "decisions: with regard to contacting participants to request consent , the group decide that no signature is required , and an e-mail would be enough ."}
{"src": "so if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe i will call the attorney about it .", "tgt": "decisions: however for `` boundary cases '' legal advice would be sought ."}
{"src": "so i guess if you 're in both these types of meetings , you 'd have a lot . i mean , it also depends on how many like , if we release this time it 's a fairly small number of meetings , well , what my s expectation is , is that we 'll send out one of these emails every time a meeting has been checked and is ready .", "tgt": "decisions: as soon as the next set of data is ready for checking , participants should be contacted , so that this process is on-going ."}
{"src": "but i thought it might be good to remind people two weeks prior to that cuz i because if we wan na be able to give it to people july fifteenth , if somebody 's gon na come back and say `` ok , i do n't want this and this and this used `` , uh , clearly we need some time to respond to that . the other thing that there 's a psychological effect that at least for most people , that if they 've responded to your email saying `` yes , i will do it `` or `` yes , i got your email `` , they 're more likely to actually do it later than to just ignore it . you know , an official ok from somebody is better than no answer , even if they responded that they got your email . and it i this discussion has made me think it might be nice to have a follow - up email within the next couple of days saying `` by the way , you know , we wan na hear back from you by x date", "tgt": "decisions: when the deadline for giving consent is approaching , a reminder e-mail should be sent out ."}
{"src": "al - altogether we 've got twenty people . these people are people who read their email almost all the time . i i really do n't see that it 's a problem . i i think that it 's a common courtesy to ask them uh , to expect for them to , uh , be able to have @ @ us try to contact them , u just in case they had n't gotten their email . i think they 'd appreciate it . and if there 's half the people , say , who do n't respond at all by , you know , some period of time , we can just make a list of these people and i 'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever , and they 'll just call them up and say , you know , `` have you is is this ok ? and would you please mail you know , mail adam that it is , if i if it , you know , is or not . `` the other thing that there 's a psychological effect that at least for most people , that if they 've responded to your email saying `` yes , i will do it `` or `` yes , i got your email `` , they 're more likely to actually do it later than to just ignore it . you know , an official ok from somebody is better than no answer , even if they responded that they got your email . so what are we gon na do when we run into someone that we ca n't get in touch with ? i do n't think , uh they 're so recent , these visitors . i i mean , i i w i 'll be able to if you have any trouble finding them , i really think i could find them . well , the way icsi goes , people , uh , who , uh , were here ten years ago still have acc have forwards to other accounts and so on . that if they give us contact information and that contact information is n't accurate that we fulfilled our burden .", "tgt": "decisions: in cases where no consent response is given , participants could be chased up since many are local ."}

{"src": "well , the inputs are one dimension of the cube , so , a a actually maybe now you 've got me sort of intrigued . can you describe what what 's on the cube ? basically , the the cube will have three dimensions . the first dimension is the the features that we 're going to use . and the second dimension , um , is the training corpus . and that 's the training on the discriminant neural net . and then , there 's the testing corpus .", "tgt": "abstract: essentially the cube consists of three dimension: input features ; training corpus ; and test corpus ."}

{"src": "and uh and the other the the last topic i had here was , um , uh d dave 's fine offer to to , uh , do something on this . i mean he 's doing he 's working on other things , but to to do something on this project . so the question is , `` where where could we , uh , uh , most use dave 's help ? `` and , um , trying to have a closer look at the perhaps the , um , speech , uh , noise detection or , uh , voiced - sound - unvoiced - sound detection let 's fall back to that . but i think the first responsibility is sort of to figure out if there 's something that , uh , an an additional what an additional clever person could help with when we 're really in a crunch for time . but if we could think of some some piece that 's that 's well defined , that he could help with , he 's expressing a will willingness to do that . so wh that so the the other suggestion that just came up was , well what about having him work on the , uh , multilingual super f superset kind of thing . uh , coming up with that and then , you know , training it training a net on that , say , um , from from , uh from timit or something .", "tgt": "decisions: people are to consider what me034 could do on the project to speed things up , though creating the phoneme superset is a possibility ."}
{"src": "stephane , where you 're doing your computations . it 's nutmeg and mustard , i think , well , you 're the you 're the disk czar now . well , i 'll check on that .", "tgt": "decisions: speaker me018 is to look into the machines that mn007 has been running data on to find out what they are ."}
{"src": "an another question occurred to me is is what were you folks planning to do about normalization ? well , we were thinking about using this systematically for all the experiments . but we think perhaps we can use the the best , uh , um , uh , normalization scheme as ogi is using , so , with parameters that they use there , i mean it 's i i we we seem to have enough dimensions as it is .", "tgt": "decisions: rather than consider level of normalization as a further dimension to the project , whatever ogi finds the best will be used systematically ."}
{"src": "clearly , there there 's no way we can even begin to do an any significant amount here unless we use multiple machines . i mean there 's plenty of machines here and they 're n they 're often not in in a great great deal of use . y you did a you did it on a spert board . yes . again , we do have a bunch of spert boards . you could set up , uh , you know , ten different jobs , or something , to run on spert different spert boards or or we 're not going to get through any significant number of these . so , with very limited time , we actually have really quite a quite a bit of computational resource available if you , you know , get a look across the institute and how little things are being used . and , uh , the thing is that once you get a better handle on how much you can realistically do , uh , um , concurrently on different machines , different sperts , and so forth , uh , and you see how long it takes on what machine and so forth , you can stand back from it and say , `` ok , if we look at all these combinations we 're talking about , and combinations of combinations , and so forth , `` you 'll probably find you ca n't do it all .", "tgt": "decisions: need to use multiple machines and spert boards to run processes on because they take so long ."}
{"src": "so so , maybe we could look at articulatory type stuff , because that 's that 's the other route to go . to really mark articulatory features , you really wan na look at the acoustics and and see where everything is , and we 're not gon na do that . uh , the second class way of doing it is to look at the , uh , phones that are labeled and translate them into acoustic uh , uh articulatory , uh , uh , features . so it wo n't really be right . is that we could we could , uh , just translate instead of translating to a superset , just translate to articulatory features , some set of articulatory features and train with that . we could do an interesting cheating experiment with that too . so i was thinking , you know it made me think about this , that if it 'd be an interesting experiment just to see , you know , if you did get all of those right .", "tgt": "decisions: they will consider looking at articulatory features rather than straight phonemes , though it would n't be perfect ."}
{"src": "so it seems like there 's there 's some peculiarities of the , uh of each of these dimensions that are getting sorted out . and then , um , if if you work on getting the , uh , assembly lines together , and then the the pieces sort of get ready to go into the assembly line what 's what 's great about this is it sets it up in a very systematic way , so that , uh , once these all of these , you know , mundane but real problems get sorted out , we can just start turning the crank and , uh , the thing is that once you get a better handle on how much you can realistically do , uh , um , concurrently on different machines , different sperts , and so forth , uh , and you see how long it takes on what machine and so forth , you can stand back from it and say , `` ok , if we look at all these combinations we 're talking about , and combinations of combinations , and so forth , `` you 'll probably find you ca n't do it all . so then at that point , uh , we should sort out which ones do we throw away . which of the combinations across you know , what are the most likely ones ,", "tgt": "problems: it is not clear what combinations of dimensions , which features , should be run in the cube project ."}

{"src": "uh how do you know what language it is ? somebody picks up the phone . so thi this is their image . so the phone does n't know what a what what your language is . but the particular image that the cellular industry has right now is that it 's distributed speech recognition , where the , uh , uh , probabilistic part , and and s semantics and so forth are all on the servers , and you compute features of the uh , on the phone . we might might or might not agree that that 's the way it will be in ten years , but that 's that 's that 's what they 're asking for . so so i think that th th it is an important issue whether it works cross - language .", "tgt": "problems: to bear in mind is the fact that the cellular industry has an image of speech recognition in that 's what they are after ."}
{"src": "were the digits , um , hand - labeled for phones ? those were those were automatically derived by by dan using , um , embedded embedded training and alignment . i i think you 're doing this test because you want to determine whether or not , uh , having s general speech performs as well as having specific speech . so i was just wondering if the fact that timit you 're using the hand - labeled stuff from timit might be confuse the results that you get . it would be another interesting scientific question to ask , `` is it because it 's a broad source or because it was , you know , carefully ? ``", "tgt": "problems: must be careful if using a broad training source that is carefully hand marked , because it would be unclear which is the reason for improvement ."}
{"src": "is n't there like a limit on the computation load , or d latency , or something like that for aurora task ? so , there 's not really a limit . what it is is that there 's there 's , uh it 's just penalty , that that if you 're using , uh , a megabyte , then they 'll say that 's very nice , but , of course , it will never go on a cheap cell phone .", "tgt": "problems: memory is of concern , because final product needs to run potentially one cheaper cell phones , which have limited memory capacity ."}
{"src": "has ogi done anything about this issue ? do they have do they have any kind of superset that they already have ? well , they they they 're going actually the the other way , defining uh , phoneme clusters , apparently . so they just throw the speech from all different languages together , then cluster it into sixty or fifty or whatever clusters ? and e i perhaps u using broad phoneme classes , it 's it 's ok for um , uh classifying the digits , but as soon as you will have more words , well , words can differ with only a single phoneme , and which could be the same , uh , class . so you 're saying that there may not be enough information coming out of the net to help you discriminate the words ? yeah , fact , most confusions are within the phone phone classes , right ?", "tgt": "problems: ogi does n't have a phoneme superset ready prepared , for they are working with clusters , which may be good enough for digits , but not for discriminating words ."}
{"src": "so where are we on on uh our runs ? uh so . uh we so as i was already said , we we mainly focused on uh four kind of features . the plp , the plp with jrasta , the msg , and the mfcc from the baseline aurora . uh , and we focused for the the test part on the english and the italian . um . we 've trained uh several neural networks on so on the ti - digits english and on the italian data and also on the broad uh english uh french and uh spanish databases . and um , actually what we we @ @ observed is that if the network is trained on the task data it works pretty well .", "tgt": "abstract: the meeting was dominated by a discussion of the first results coming in ."}
{"src": "the first testing is with task data the second test is trained on a single language um with broad database , but the same language as the t task data . but for italian we choose spanish which we assume is close to italian . the third test is by using , um the three language database that 's including the w the the the one that it 's yeah . it 's the broad data . and the fourth test is uh excluding from these three languages the language that is the task language .", "tgt": "abstract: there have been four types of test , in which the training data varies , and a variety of input features have been tried ."}
{"src": "but actually we did n't train network on uh both types of data we only did either task task data or uh broad data . and then when we jump to the multilingual data it 's uh it become worse uh . the error rate increase u of of of ten percent , relative . example uh when we go from ti - digits training to timit training uh we lose uh around ten percent , twenty to to thirty percent further . ok , but i think that given the pressure of time we probably want to draw because of that especially , we wan na draw some conclusions from this , and make some strong decisions for what we 're gon na do testing on before next week .", "tgt": "abstract: the process and results were explained to the group , the implications of the results discussed , and plans for moving forward were made ."}
{"src": "so they 're they 're doing the the vad i guess they mean voice activity detection so again , it 's the silence so um their uh the results look pretty good . so um i think that it 's it 's nice to do that in this because in fact , it 's gon na give a better word error result and therefore will help within an evaluation . um . uh , as you know , part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the word models are pretty bad and nobody wants has has approached improving them . so um the question we 're gon na wan na go through next week when hynek shows up i guess is given that we 've been we 're uh looking at uh , by then i guess , combinations of features and multi - band uh , and we 've been looking at cross - language , cross task issues . but they 've been looking at uh at these issues . at the on - line normalization and the uh voice activity detection . and i guess when he comes here we 're gon na have to start deciding about um what do we choose from what we 've looked at to um blend with some group of things in what they 've looked at and once we choose that , how do we split up the effort ?", "tgt": "abstract: there was also discussion of some of the work being conducted by research partners ogi , including how the two groups should best work together ."}
{"src": "we have the little tiny ibm machine that might someday grow up to be a big ibm machine . it 's got s slots for eight , i think we only got two so far , yeah , i mean you can check with uh dave johnson . and somebody could do you know , uh , check out uh the multi - threading libraries . i mean , i guess the prudent thing to do would be for somebody to do the work on on getting our code running on that machine with two processors even though there are n't five or eight .", "tgt": "abstract: the group also briefly touched upon resource issues ."}
{"src": "uh so , act actually we have discussed uh @ @ um , these and and we were thinking perhaps that uh the way we use the tandem is not if we trained the networks on the on a language and a t or a specific task , um , what we ask is to the network is to put the bound the decision boundaries somewhere in the space . and uh mmm and ask the network to put one , at one side of the for for a particular phoneme at one side of the boundary decision boundary and so there is kind of reduction of the information there that 's not correct because if we change task and if the phonemes are not in the same context in the new task , obviously the decision boundaries are not should not be at the same place . but the way the feature gives the the way the network gives the features is that it reduce completely the it removes completely the information a lot of information from the the features by uh uh placing the decision boundaries at optimal places for one kind of data the way we we do it now is that we have a neural network and basically the net network is trained almost to give binary decisions .", "tgt": "decisions: speaker mn007 would like to investigate increasing the context of the phonemes ."}
{"src": "and once you the other thing is that once you represent start representing more and more context it is uh much more um specific to a particular task in language . for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will never occur in one language and will occur frequently in the other , the issue of getting enough training for a particular kind of context becomes harder . we already actually do n't have a huge amount of training data the way we we do it now is that we have a neural network and basically the net network is trained almost to give binary decisions . but it would still be even more of a binary decision . that would be even even more distinct of a binary decision . i mean we we could disagree about it at length but the the real thing is if you 're interested in it you 'll probably try it and and we 'll see .", "tgt": "decisions: speaker mn013 does agree with mn007s assessment of the outcome , and points out the lack of data , but acknowledges that if mn007 is interested he will go ahead with it ."}

{"src": "uh , probably the neural net", "tgt": "decisions: it is agreed that he should start with the neural net training , then work on htk ."}
{"src": "but actually there is something important , is that um we made a lot of assumption concerning the on - line normalization and we just noticed uh recently that uh the approach that we were using was not uh leading to very good results when we used the straight features to htk . so what we see that is there is that um uh the way we were doing this was not correct , when we use the networks our number are better that uh pratibha results . and basically , the first thing is the mmm , alpha uh value . um , i used point five percent , which was the default value in the in the programs here . and pratibha used five percent . i assume that this was not important because uh previous results from from dan and show that basically the both both values g give the same same uh results . it was true on uh ti - digits but it 's not true on italian . uh , second thing is the initialization of the stuff . actually , uh what we were doing is to start the recursion from the beginning of the utterance . and using initial values that are the global mean and variances measured across the whole database . and pratibha did something different is that he uh she initialed the um values of the mean and variance by computing this on the twenty - five first frames of each utterance . mmm . there were other minor differences , so . uh , i changed the code uh and now we have a baseline that 's similar to the ogi baseline . well , the the the networks are retaining with these new features .", "tgt": "problems: incorrect assumptions were made when considering the on-line normalization for the main task . members used different values to a previous study , and whilst it was believed not to make a difference , it does , so networks are being retrained ."}
{"src": "there there is another difference , is that the noise the noises are different . well , for for the italian part i mean the uh the um networks are trained with noise from aurora ti - digits , and perhaps the noise are quite different from the noises in the speech that italian . uh um now , what 's the noise condition um of the training data the noise condition is the same so there 's not a statistical sta a strong st statistically different noise characteristic between uh the training and test no these are the s s s same noises , at least at least for the first for the well - matched ,", "tgt": "problems: currently working with noise conditions being the same in training and test data , but there is nothing which matches the noise on the italian test data ."}

{"src": "so they 're they 're doing the the vad i guess they mean voice activity detection so again , it 's the silence so um their uh the results look pretty good . so um i think that it 's it 's nice to do that in this because in fact , it 's gon na give a better word error result and therefore will help within an evaluation . um . uh , as you know , part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the word models are pretty bad and nobody wants has has approached improving them .", "tgt": "problems: ogi have an interesting approach to voice activation detection for removing blocks of silence , that shows good results , but currently the word model being used is too poor to make good use of this and no one is working on improving it ."}

{"src": "yeah , that seems like a good thing to do , probably , not uh again a short - term sort of thing . the two of the main issues perhaps are still the language dependency and the noise dependency . and perhaps to try to reduce the language dependency , we should focus on finding some other kind of training targets . for moment you use we use phonetic targets but we could also use articulatory targets , soft targets , and perhaps even , um use networks that does n't do classification but just regression and well , basically com com compute features and noit not , nnn , features without noise . i mean uh , transform the fea noisy features in other features that are not noisy .", "tgt": "decisions: same goes for anything else that comes up and looks interesting , leave it for just now ."}

{"src": "uh . the problem is that it 's very big and we still have to think how to where to put it uh either some delay and we if we put it on the server side , it does n't work , because on the server side features you already have lda applied from the f from the terminal side and so you accumulate the delay", "tgt": "problems: the new vad is quite a large network , and adds a delay to the process ."}

{"src": "but the other thing is uh to use a different vad entirely . i i do n't know what the thinking was amongst the the the the etsi folk but um if everybody agreed sure let 's use this vad and take that out of there they just want , apparently they do n't want to fix the vad because they think there is some interaction between feature extraction and and vad or frame dropping but they still want to just to give some um requirement for this vad because it 's it will not be part of they do n't want it to be part of the standard . so there just will be some requirements that are still not uh not yet uh ready i think . but i do n't think we need to be stuck on using our or ogi 's vad . we could use somebody else 's if it 's smaller you know , as long as it did the job .", "tgt": "problems: the alternative is to get yet another vad form somewhere else , though it 's not clear if they will even be required in the final system ."}
{"src": "yeah , it 's it 's another problem . if you look at this um spectrum , is it the mel - filters ? and what we clearly see is that in some cases , and the the harmonics are resolved by the f well , there are still appear after mel - filtering , and it happens for high pitched voice because the width of the lower frequency mel - filters is sometimes even smaller than the pitch . so we were thinking to modify the mel - spectrum to have something that that 's smoother on low frequencies .", "tgt": "problems: there are some problems with the voiced / unvoiced feature detection , because some pitches are slipping through the filtering ."}

{"src": "do you know who was who was since we were n't in on it , uh , do you know who was in from ogi ? but the points that they were supposed to discuss is still , uh , things like the weights , i have no idea . so the points were the the weights how to weight the different error rates that are obtained from different language and and conditions . it 's not clear that they will keep the same kind of weighting . some people are arguing that it would be better to have weights on well , to to combine error rates before computing improvement . and so , perhaps they will change the weights to well , i mean , the fact that it 's inconsistent is an obvious mistake . but the question is , do you average the relative improvements or do you average the error rates and take the relative improvement maybe of that ? and the thing is it 's not just a pure average because there are these weightings . it 's just when you when you get all done , i think that they pro but i think they started off this process with the notion that you should be significantly better than the previous standard . so they said `` how much is significantly better ? and and so they said `` well , you know , you should have half the errors , `` or something , `` that you had before `` . but it does seem like i i it does seem like it 's more logical to combine them first but there is this this is this still this problem of weights . when when you combine error rate it tends to give more importance to the difficult cases , some people think that it 's more important to look at to have ten percent imp relative improvement on well - matched case than to have fifty percent on the m mismatched , and other people think that it 's more important to improve a lot on the mismatch it sounds like they do n't really have a good idea about what the final application is gon na be . i mean , they don they they do n't they do n't really know , i think . so the argument for that being the the the more important thing , is that you 're gon na try and do that , but you wan na see how badly it deviates from that when when when the , uh it 's a little different . the opposite argument is you 're never really gon na have a good sample of all these different things . i gather that in these meetings it 's it 's really tricky to make anything ac make any policy change because everybody has has , uh , their own opinion but there is probably a a big change that will be made is that the the baseline th they want to have a new baseline , perhaps , and apparently , uh , some people are pushing to still keep this fifty percent number . so they want to have at least fifty percent improvement on the baseline , so whose vad uh , they did n't decide yet .", "tgt": "problems: not only are the group unsure what if anything was decided , but project changes are being considered including changing the baseline and improvement weighting , though everyone has their own opinion on these matters ."}

{"src": "wh why would that be , um , considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using htk ? uh , with some input from , uh , andreas , i have a theory in two parts . because this is also one big difference between the two systems . the other differences were the fact that maybe the acoustic models of the sri are more sri system are more complex . you know , they have channel adaptation . well , there 's also the normalization .", "tgt": "abstract: this then prompted discussion about the reasons behind such findings , which were for the most part not as expected ."}

{"src": "o o one thing , um , i noticed is that , um , the mean subtraction seems to make the pzm signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized . so i was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the aurora baseline system is just as a kind of gain control ? cuz some of the pzm signals sound pretty quiet if you do n't amplify them . i do n't see why why your signal is louder after processing , i do n't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect . i mean , i think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have better signal - to - noise ratio . i think , maybe i did n't look , but one thing that makes a difference is this dc offset compensation . uh , eh do y did you have a look at at the meet uh , meeting digits , if they have a dc component , no . the dc component could be negligible . i mean , any all of the mikes have the dc removal some capacitor sitting right in that bias it . yeah . the microphone is n't gon na pass any dc . actually , there are instrumentation mikes that that do pass go down to dc . no , it 's the electronics . then there 's amplification afterwards . you can have dc offset in the data .", "tgt": "problems: a couple of issues have arisen that need to be looked into further such as dc-offset and effects of pzm signals ."}

{"src": "uh , the next thing is this this vad problem that , so , i 'm just talking about the the curves that i i sent i sent you so , whi that shows that when the snr decrease , uh , the current vad approach does n't drop much frames for some particular noises , uh , which might be then noises that are closer to speech , uh , acoustically . i i just to clarify something for me . they were supp supposedly , in the next evaluation , they 're going to be supplying us with boundaries . so does any of this matter ? first of all , the boundaries might be , uh like we would have t two hundred milliseconds or before and after speech . so removing more than that might still make a difference in the results . do we ? i mean , is there some reason that we think that 's the case ? no . but maybe we 'll get some insight on that when when , uh , the gang gets back from crete .", "tgt": "problems: similarly , since at the next stage of the project data will have marked boundaries , it is not clear that voice-activity detection is worth pursuing ."}

{"src": "can i ask just a a high level question ? can you just say like one or two sentences about wiener filtering and why why are people doing that ? i mean , so the basic principle of wiener filter is like you try to minimize the , uh , d uh , difference between the noisy signal and the clean signal and for this i u simply used some code that , uh , i had from from belgium , which is technique that , um , takes a bunch of frame , and for each frequency bands of this frame , takes a look at the minima of the energy . and then average these minima and take this as an an energy estimate of the noise for this particular frequency band .", "tgt": "abstract: a number of the group also took time to explain the basics of their approaches to the group ."}

{"src": "yeah , another thing that i it 's important to mention is , um , that this has a this has some additional latency . and i noticed that it 's better if we take into account this latency . it 's depending on how all this stuff comes out we may or may not be able to add any latency . b but i do n't think we have to worry too much on that right now while you kno . i would worry about it a little . because if we completely ignore latency , and then we discover that we really have to do something about it , we 're going to be find ourselves in a bind . and and that 's sort of one of the all of that sort of stuff is things that they 're debating in their standards committee .", "tgt": "problems: in implementing smoothing to the spectral subtraction , latency has been increased ; while some feel this is nothing to worry about , others feel it is better to worry now , in case it turns out to be something to worry about ."}

{"src": "and then there 's um , another thing i wan na start looking at , um , wi is , um , the choice of the analysis window length . with the with the htk set - up i should be able to do some experiments , on just varying that length , say between one and three seconds , in a few different reverberation conditions , i guess one thing that might also be an issue , uh , cuz part of what you 're doing is you 're getting a a spectrum over a bunch of different kinds of speech sounds . and so it might matter how fast someone was talking for instance . you know , if you if if if there 's a lot of phones in one second maybe you 'll get a a really good sampling of all these different things , and and , uh , on the other hand if someone 's talking slowly maybe you 'd need more . a actually i was just thinking about what i was asking about earlier , wi which is about having less than say twelve seconds in the smartkom system to do the mean subtraction . you said in systems where you use cepstral mean subtraction , they concatenate utterances and , do you know how they address this issue of , um , testing versus training ? i think what they do is they do it always on - line , i mean , that you just take what you have from the past , that you calculate the mean of this and subtract the mean . and , um , so so in tha in that case , wh what do they do when they 're t um , performing the cepstral mean subtraction on the training data ? so because you 'd have hours and hours of training data . so do they cut it off and start over ? and so if you 're splitting things up into utterances so , for instance , in a dialogue system , where you 're gon na be asking , uh , you know , th for some information , there 's some initial th something . and i think the heuristics of exactly how people handle that and how they handle their training i 'm sure vary from place to place . so you 'd you and so in training you would start over at at every new phone call or at every new speaker . it it seems to be the best what wh wh what what we can do in this moment is multi - condition training . and every when we now start introducing some some noise reduction technique we we introduce also somehow artificial distortions . and these artificial distortions uh , i have the feeling that they are the reason why why we have the problems in this multi - condition training . that means the h m ms we trained , they are they are based on gaussians , and if we introduce now this this u spectral subtraction , or wiener filtering stuff i mean , this is your noise estimate and you somehow subtract it or do whatever . and then i think what you do is you introduce some some artificial distribution in this in in the models . so so , basically our our position is that , um , we should n't be unduly constraining the latency at this point because we 're all still experimenting with trying to make the performance better in the presence of noise . uh , there is a minority in that group who is a arguing who are arguing for um , uh , having a further constraining of the latency . so we 're s just continuing to keep aware of what the trade - offs are and , you know , what what do we gain from having longer or shorter latencies ? well , france telecom was was was very short latency it was in the order of thirty milliseconds", "tgt": "abstract: while on these topics , related areas discussed included recognition window length , training versus test set sizes , artificial distortion and latency concerns ."}
{"src": "maybe you you are leaving in in about two weeks carmen . what what i would do is i i i would pick @ @ the best consolation , which you think , and c create create all the results for the whole database that you get to the final number as as sunil did it and maybe also to to write somehow a document where you describe your approach , and what you have done . i was thinking to do that next week . i wi i i will do that next week .", "tgt": "decisions: speaker fn002 is soon to be leaving the group , and so she will choose her best setup , run a complete set of experiments , and write up her work , procedure and results for next week ."}
{"src": "so the other thing is the i 'm just looking at a little bit on the delay issue where the delay of the system is like a hundred and eighty millisecond . so i just just tried another sk system i mean , another filter which i 've like shown at the end . which is very similar to the existing uh , filter . only uh , only thing is that the phase is is like a totally nonlinear phase so it 's just like it 's like a three percent relative degradation , but but is there is there a problem with the one hundred eighty milliseconds ?", "tgt": "problems: new filters introduced to reduce latency by mn052 , performed slightly worse than those they replaced ."}
{"src": "for italian and spanish it 's th this value works good but not necessarily for finnish . but unfortunately there is , like , this forty millisecond latency yeah , so i would try to somewhat reduce this @ @ . i already know that if i completely remove this latency , so . um , it um there is a three percent hit on italian .", "tgt": "problems: whereas mn007 has added some latency to the process which he feels he can reduce ."}
{"src": "anyway we after coming back from qualcomm we had , you know , very strong feedback and , uh , i think it was hynek and guenter 's and my opinion also that , um , you know , we sort of spread out to look at a number of different ways of doing noise suppression . but given the limited time , uh , it was sort of time to choose one . uh , and so , uh , th the vector taylor series had n't really worked out that much . uh , the subspace stuff , uh , had not been worked with so much . um , so it sort of came down to spectral subtraction versus wiener filtering . uh , we had a long discussion about how they were the same and how they were d uh , completely different .", "tgt": "abstract: icsi 's meeting recorder group have returned from a meeting with some important decisions to make ."}
{"src": "so instead they went to yosemite and bonded , and and they came out with a single single piece of software . so it 's another another victory for international collaboration . so so you guys have combined or you 're going to be combining the software ? well , the piece of software has , like , plenty of options , so depending on that , it it becomes either spectral subtraction or wiener filtering . but the thing is the important thing is that there is a piece of software that you that we all will be using now .", "tgt": "abstract: they have developed a piece of software which allows them to implement their two main approaches to dealing with noise ."}
{"src": "but , still so , there will be a piece of software with , uh , will give this system , the fifty - three point sixty - six , by default how how is how good is that ? it 's just one percent off of the best proposal . it 's between i we are second actually if we take this system . compared to the last evaluation numbers ? yeah . yeah . so it so , um , it 's it it 's not using our full bal bag of tricks , if you will . and , uh , and it it is , uh , very close in performance to the best thing that was there before . uh , but , you know , looking at it another way , maybe more importantly , uh , we did n't have any explicit noise , uh , handling we did n't explicitly have anything to deal with stationary noise .", "tgt": "abstract: the base rate is currently set at the second best rate as of the last project evaluation , and it does not yet include everything the group have been working on ."}
{"src": "i mean , i gather you have it sounds like you have a few more days of of nailing things down with the software and so on . but and then but , um , arguably what we should do is , even though the software can do many things , we should for now pick a set of things , and not change that . and then focus on everything that 's left . so there 's the neural net issue . there 's the vad issue . and , uh , there 's the second stream thing . what was the issue with the vad ? i guess they still allow two hundred milliseconds on either side or some ? and all the speech pauses , which is sometimes on the speechdat - car you have pauses that are more than one or two seconds . we cou we can do better , i think , so , our current vad is is more than twenty percent , while their is fourteen . that 's that 's a good set of work that that , uh just one more thing . like , should we do something f more for the noise estimation , yeah . i was wondering about that .", "tgt": "abstract: with this in mind , they have decided to set most things , and concentrate on studying only a few key aspects , the neural network , the voice activity detector , and the noise estimation ."}
{"src": "and i think , you know , that our goal should be by next week , when hynek comes back , uh , to uh , really just to have a firm path , uh , for the you know , for the time he 's gone , of of , uh , what things will be attacked .", "tgt": "decisions: by the time a senior member of their research partners ogi returns , they want to have a firm plan of what they will be doing ."}
{"src": "we do still , however , have to consider its latency . we ca n't have unlimited amounts of latency . uh , y you know , that 's still being debated by the by people in europe but , uh , no matter how they end up there , it 's not going to be unlimited amounts , so we i mean , if so if we if so which is like if we reduce the delay of va yeah . the you smooth it and then delay the decision by so that 's that 's really not not bad . so we may in fact we 'll see what they decide . we may in fact have , um , the the , uh , latency time available for to have a neural net . what amount of latency are you thinking about when you say that ? you know , they 're saying , uh one group is saying a hundred and thirty milliseconds and another group is saying two hundred and fifty milliseconds .", "tgt": "problems: system latency is still an issue , but limits have still not been set by the project heads ."}
{"src": "so the frame - dropping is the last thing that we do . did you happen to notice how much , uh , the change was due to just this frame - dropping problem ? just the frame - dropping problem . and then we have to be careful with that also with the neural net because in the proposal the neural net was also , uh , working on after frame - dropping . oh , that 's a real good point .", "tgt": "problems: the group have encountered problems with frame-dropping , and will need to bear that in mind since their neural network would come after that stage ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: icsi 's meeting recorder group at berkeley met mainly to discuss work on their main project , the aurora task , but also talked about the work of one of their student members ."}
{"src": "so we we had a meeting with , uh with hynek , um , in in which , uh , uh , sunil and stephane , uh summarized where they were and and , uh , talked about where we were gon na go . so that that happened sort of mid - week . but i guess maybe the thing since you were n't yo you guys were n't at that that meeting , might be just just to , um , sort of recap , uh , the the conclusions of the meeting . you 're talking about the meeting with hynek ? since he 's going out of town like now , and i 'm going out town in a couple weeks , uh , and time is marching , sort of , given all the mu many wonderful things we could be working on , what what will we actually focus on ? and , uh and what do we freeze ? and , you know , what do we ? and then within that , i guess the idea was to freeze a certain set of options for now , to run it , uh , a particular way , and decide on what things are gon na be experimented with , as opposed to just experimenting with everything . so keep a certain set of things constant . uh , maybe describe roughly what what we are keeping constant for now , well . so we 've been working like six weeks on on the noise compensation and we end up with something that seems reasonable . are you gon na use which of the two techniques ? so finally it 's it 's , um , wiener filtering on fft bins . so we are going to fix this for the moment and work on the other aspects of the whole system . but structurally it seemed like the things the main things that that we brought up that , uh , are are gon na need to get worked on seriously are , uh , uh , a a significantly better vad , uh , putting the neural net on , um , which , you know , we have n't been doing anything with , the , uh , neural net at the end there , and , uh , the , uh , opening up the second front .", "tgt": "abstract: some members of the group met recently with research partners to settle on the current state of their software , and decide on the future work they would investigate , and these decisions were relayed to the rest of the group ."}

{"src": "to c and i 'll put together an overall cover . people are supposed to send me u r for their for web pages , uh , you need to put together a mailing list . we talked about that we 're getting the recording equipment running at uw .", "tgt": "abstract: finally , project web pages and mailing list are being set up and uw are going to investigate the suitability of their recording equipment ."}
{"src": "and other tasks during data collection , but if we had the crosspads , we could ask people , you know , if if something comes up write it down and mark it somehow , so , if you could sense just when people are writing , and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to be using that for other purposes , and each person has a note pad . they just get it when they come in the room . then you c you can just have a fff plot of wh you know , who 's writing when . but i bet that 's that will allow you to go into the sort of the hot places where people are writing things down . so so the question that that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during during th during the collection . and i guess the crosspads was certainly one idea , ok . so crosspads , we 're just gon na try it and see what happens . crosspads we were going to try ,", "tgt": "decisions: within the piloting of data collection ideas , it was decided that crosspads are going to be used for detection of `` hot points '' during the meeting ."}
{"src": "and the fir third thing i wanted to say is the summaries afterwards , and so why do n't we just use the notes that somebody takes ? i e my thought was to have multiple people summarize it , on recording rather than writing you know , a two - minute summary of what the meeting was about , i think you would get , so , my proposal would be that it may be worth considering both of those types , you know , the note - taking and a spontaneous oral summary afterwards , so , i j i think we should just say this is not we do n't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could could they send it to us ? yeah . i think that i think doing it orally at the end of the meeting is the best time . getting electronic summary from a note - taking person if they happen to do it anyway . and then the last thing c would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards and give an oral summary .", "tgt": "decisions: other ideas to be tested are the use of summaries or minutes -if a group normally produce them- and the recording of oral summaries by individual participants after the meeting ."}
{"src": "i think for this data capture , it would be nice to have a digital camera just to take pictures of who 's there , and then we could also put in what 's on the board . well , minimally , i mean , what what dan is referring to at least having some representation of the p the spatial position of the people , like for a meeting like this , at least , uh , take a polaroid of the of the of the boards , a couple digital pictures of the the table and boards to set the context of the meeting .", "tgt": "decisions: photographing the contents of the board and the positions of the meeting participants will provide extra information ."}
{"src": "i 'm also wondering if we could ask the the people a a question which would be `` what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting ? `` we 'll i mean , we 'll we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is is to d generate queries in the future , uh , and then going around the room at the end to just say qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned .", "tgt": "decisions: for query generation purposes , all participants will also be asked for their highlight of the meeting ."}
{"src": "and , i guess we just left it as @ @ that if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it ,", "tgt": "decisions: the general goal regarding the corpus is to investigate the acquisition of further appropriate data through public sources or available collections of other institutions ."}
{"src": "i do n't think we should have rules of participation , so i 'm just writing here , we 're not gon na try to specify rules of interaction", "tgt": "decisions: as to recordings at icsi , the group agreed that imposing rules of participation in order to avoid speaker overlaps was not desirable ."}
{"src": "but i think we should try to get a variety of meetings . that 's something that if we get the the meeting stuff going at uw , that i probably can do more than you guys , so it also depends on the style of the group of people . but we 're gon na try to get more variety by i using different groups of people", "tgt": "decisions: instead , they will aim for collecting stylistically varied data ( different group dynamics and types of meeting ) ."}
{"src": "people are supposed to send me u r for their for web pages , to c and i 'll put together an overall cover . we talked about that we 're getting the recording equipment running at uw .", "tgt": "decisions: further action will also be taken to close other pending issues: the web pages will be organised , the recording room will be finalised and uw will also test their recording infrastructure ."}
{"src": "and , uh , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , uh , reduces enormously . you 're probably not gon na get a lot of people wanting to do this . that that y that you ca n't certainly ca n't require it or people are n't gon na want to do this .", "tgt": "problems: the recording of meetings and any possible additional tasks must be set up in a user-friendly way , otherwise it would be difficult to recruit volunteers ."}
{"src": "so , i j i think we should just say this is not we do n't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could could they send it to us ? yeah . what i was gon na say is that i do n't want to ask people to do something they would n't normally do in a meeting . you 're probably not gon na get a lot of people wanting to do this . that that y that you ca n't certainly ca n't require it or people are n't gon na want to do this .", "tgt": "problems: asking participants to do more than they normally would in a meeting could put people off ."}
{"src": "but that it 's gon na be a lot of effort on our part to create it , and store it , i think that if you have that , then people who are interested in vision can use this database . the problem with it is you 'll have more people who do n't want to be filmed than who do n't want to be recorded . but , you know , that 's a lot of infrastructure and work .", "tgt": "problems: the video-recording of meetings , apart from adding an extra level of instrumentation complexity , can also make people apprehensive ."}
{"src": "i mean , the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the , uh , quality of the handwriting recognition was quite poor .", "tgt": "problems: the usability and usefulness of crosspads is not certain ."}
{"src": "but as far as i know they did n't offer that data to the community at this meeting . so there 's lots of recordings that they 're not close - talk mike ,", "tgt": "problems: acquiring data from other sources will not be straightforward , as they may either not be suitable for this project or not publicly available ."}
{"src": "i just do n't know how else to generate the queries other than getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say `` that 's important , but if we were asking the question , which i thought we were , of of of , um , `` how do we figure out what 's the nature of the queries that people are gon na want to ask of such a system ? `` , knowing what 's important does n't tell you what people are going to be asking . uh , i would n't have any idea what kind of questions i want to ask .", "tgt": "problems: querying is also a major issue: what users would ask from a system is not clear ."}
{"src": "i mean , the level of the query could be , you know , very low - level or very high - level .", "tgt": "problems: how this system would resolve high-level queries ( eg regarding agreement between participants ) is also hard to tell at this stage ."}
{"src": "uh , so do they how are they gon na do the multi - channel ?", "tgt": "problems: as transcription has not started yet , there was concern as to how ibm will deal with multi-channel data ."}
{"src": "i just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which ca n't be processed .", "tgt": "problems: the abundance of speaker overlaps may also affect the quality of the trascription ."}
{"src": "so the there will be jargon that we he there 'll be transcription errors .", "tgt": "problems: however , it was accepted that some problems with the transcription of jargon are , to an extent , unavoidable ."}
