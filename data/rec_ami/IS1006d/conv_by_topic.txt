C:  <cough> 
A:  Mm . 
D:  So , Hi Christa . <laugh> 
A:  So , uh now <other> it's the  <laugh> Hi Sammy . <laugh> It's the detail design meeting , so we're going  last meeting . So um , first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype . Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . Then , w we  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yes . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> <other> Yes . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> And then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible <laugh> and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team . <other> And that's all . Okay . So first , <other> let's uh 
B:  And chocolate ? <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> 
D:  Mm . 
B:  <other> 
A:  see the prototype . 


C:  Yeah . Uh , here we have our prototype model . 
A:  <other> Okay . And you have some slides then ?  Yeah . Mm . 
D:   . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , we have also some slides . 
B:  Yes , and place some slides . 
A:  Okay . Uh so in which uh  
C:  In  
B:  Uh , participant three . <other> Prototype . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm okay . Mm . 
C:  Five . 
B:  <other> Uh , so 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Him . 
B:  this is our remote control . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  It's a r working prototype . You can use it now by switching all these buttons . So first , I present as we came to this perfect model , and then we'll give some technical specifications . That's <other> well <other> <other> , so that's that . Please , next slide . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <other> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  We analysed all the fruits and contacted NASA , and uh made some <other> real good  Yeah . If you can see this , and the stars are showing that  . And um , 
A:  <laugh> MASA ? <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  s society will accept that . For sure . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and uh ultimate smell of it . S please , next slide . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> <cough> <laugh> 
B:  But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the m 
D:  <laugh> <other> 
B:  the  modern material we can p select . And it's practical . And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  And as I said , <laugh> it's perfect . <laugh> 
C:   . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Okay . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Please press it . Everyone is  f really uh really glad to obtain an  
C:  Experience . Explanat 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> 
D:  Such a nice thing . <cough> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  See this  . <laugh> 
B:  s such a r such a device . So you can touch it with your hands . Sure . Yes . <laugh> 
D:  Can I ? Ho-ho . 
C:  You can  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <sound indicating reaction to material> <laugh> <sound imitating flatulence>   <laugh> 
A:  What do you say ? <laugh> 
B:  N 
D:  It says <sound imitating flatulence> <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> You must say it . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Spongy . 
D:  I will uh  
A:  <laugh> One day . He <other> <laugh> 
D:  I'll buy it . <laugh> If I if I need so . <laugh> Hopefully my daughter will like it . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> <laugh> Okay . Y and we got the answer . Uh , it is , yes , of course .  , please next slide . Um , this is a prototype . You can have a look at it , and  
A:  <other> 
D:  Yes , of course . Of c course . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Ah . 
C:  <other> 
B:  That's all I wanted to say . 


D:  <other> It's my turn . Mm-hmm . Let's see if this  Yeah , if you meet <laugh> 
A:  Let's uh , yeah , let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> <cough> 
D:  the evaluation criterion . 
A:  Oops . 
D:  <cough> 
C:  Fudge . 
D:  Yeah . So , evaluation please . So . You made a very nice prototype , and um , I think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our  what we want to do , and things like that . So mm  <other> Uh , next slide , please . <other> As you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry <laugh> uh <laugh> remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it . Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  To  so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . And seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil at all . And we're all l going to list all the criterion . I'm going to go to that next slide , and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ? 
A:  Okay . 
C:  Fancy . 
D:  So these are the criterion uh I'm  I thought were important . Of course , this can be discussed , but let's let's see , so let's vote . So we have fancy here and we have the scale 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  from one to seven with four in the middle . So , 
C:  Huh . Yeah , what's is really  
D:  what do you think , is it fancy ? <laugh> 
C:  Uh , it's really  <laugh> 
A:  Uh , I think that fancy , we can say it is fancy . <laugh> <other> 
D:  <laugh> It is very very fancy . Or have you ever seen something like that ? <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> Oh . I am not the d the only one choosing , yeah . Uh what do you think ? 
D:  Yeah , of course . What do you think ? 
B:  Feel the weight . 
D:  Is it  
A:  <other> 
D:  The weight is later . <laugh> Now <laugh> we're  <laugh> We're on the fanciness now . I think it's quite fancy . 
C:  Yeah . Oh . 
B:  Really . <laugh> 
A:  Uh-huh . <laugh> 
B:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . We can give at least five or six , seven . 
D:  It's uh  
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , so  No it's it's one . Yeah , o one means it's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all . So it's one or two . What do you think ? Two ? Okay . So here , two . Up . Then we have uh technology . 
A:  It's in the other  . Yeah . 
C:  Oh ,  Oh . So  Oh , okay . 
A:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah , okay . Oh , okay . So  
A:  <other> Two . Let's say two , yeah . 
C:  M maybe two . 
B:  Two . Two . 
C:  Technology . Yeah . Um  
D:  So , what about technology ? We have uh we have speech recognition , we have location based  , we have L_C_D_ . 
C:  And we have L_C_D_ . So you change colours . 
A:  Change colour of t 
D:  Change colour , I mean that's very  
C:  Useful . 
A:  Yeah , I think it's a  
D:  Quite d I think it's a one for that , at least . At least a one , yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . It's silly . 
B:  Yeah . Uh  
A:  Mm-mm . 
D:  Robustness , uh-huh . 
C:  Uh , still we need to cha <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> So <laugh> let's suppose my daughter take it and um <laugh>  and through it away . Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again ? Uh , maybe not the prototype . <laugh> Let's try . <laugh> 
A:  <sharp intake of air> <other> <other> Um  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  The strawberries <laugh> Oh . 
C:  Yeah , it  <laugh> Maybe strawberry . 
D:  <laugh> Oh my god . <laugh> Okay , we just lost one strawberry . So  <laugh> Not at all ? 
B:  No . No . How can I say this . It's still it's still working , and your daughter got a bonus . <laugh> A strawberry . 
C:  Oh . Yeah , we can easily plug it . 
D:  It is  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . So it's not so bad . I um uh I would say three . 
A:  Mm-mm . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . But it's too  . It's um robust , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ? 
C:  Useful ? Yeah ,   
D:  Useful . <laugh> Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? So I don't know . 
D:  Two or three ? Two or three ? Two . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . Two , maybe . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  Okay , two . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> So size and weight . 
C:  Yeah , yeah .  
D:  Is it the the the effective size and weight that the  Is it uh real size , real weight ? Or  Because it  Size is going to be that , yeah ? 
C:  Yeah , it's  size al almost   Yeah , because it is  The weight will be bit lighter . We will s We use titanium . Yeah . 
D:  Uh , and and  
B:  Sure , without titanium alloy , it's going to be light . 
A:  Mm-mm . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  It's going to be lighter , because this seems to be very heavy f I mean , for my daughter , for instance . <laugh> Not sure if uh <laugh> she can use it . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Of course . 
C:  Heavy . Yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> <laugh> 
C:  But sides  uh , the sides should be okay .  . Yeah mm . 
D:  So , should be okay . Up to three for that , because I'm  haven't seen the weight so I must not uh  Colour and shape . 
A:  Mm-mm . 
B:  Okay . Okay . 
C:  Oh . 
A:  <other> <other> Uh-oh . <laugh> 
B:  <loud palatal exhale indicating awe or fatigue> 
D:  Well , so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ . But um , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh <laugh> the case . It's a  it's going to be titanium . Okay , okay . That's nice . <laugh> I think it's good . Okay . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  The case is silver titanium , no ? 
A:  Yeah , it's  . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Let's imagine . 
B:  Moreover , moreover it covers it covers all the end goals . Even if it is , you know , it's very rounded , but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Okay , so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , we've  yeah we have sensors here and so here and here , so we just  Yeah , so even if you don't put , it works . But this is really fancy .  
B:  <other> 
A:  Also . Okay . 
D:  I suggested three . Because uh , everybody s doesn't seem to be convince , although it's quite  You have good arguments . But  
A:  Okay . <other> 
B:  Okay . Okay . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Okay . <other> 
D:  And uh the last one is adaptive . This is not r maybe not as important as the other one , <other> but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use ? 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Sure , sure , just look at it . 
D:  <laugh> Great . <laugh> Fully adaptable . That's  Yeah . <laugh> So you can fit into your palm , okay . That  What else can we need ? You  Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well ? 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> It's full adaptable . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Wow , that's a  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know . 
A:  <other> Yea 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> You can  Yeah . <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , it's fudge titanium . <laugh> You know . Right , yeah . <laugh> And uh  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> It's fudge , yeah , yeah . Yeah , fruit titanium , yeah . Well , I if if this is  if you are ready to do that , then I think it deserves a one . <laugh> 
B:  Mm ,   
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay . <other> Let's go for one . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Okay . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Now we have to do the average . <laugh> 
B:  <loud exhale indicating fatigue> 
C:  Three , three , six , eight , eleven . 
D:  <laugh> Who is good in math ? <laugh> 
B:  It's two point one seven . 
D:  Okay . <laugh> Two point one seven . That's nice . Two point one seven out of seven . I think we have a good 
C:  Hmm .  . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  good thing . Well , that's all I had to say about the evaluation . So  
A:  So it's a good evaluation . 
D:  It seems to be good , yeah . We have uh  
A:  Yeah . Mm . 
C:  Yeah mm . Yeah , two one one seven , we have . So  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm-mm . 
D:  Yeah . Okay . Thanks . 


A:  <other> Okay . So now , it has to fulfil the <laugh> financial criterium ? 
D:  <cough> 
C:  Financi 
D:  Ah-ha . 
A:  So , I have an  Here . Um   . 
C:  <sound indicating surprise> 
D:  <other> <laugh> 
A:  <sharp exhale> 
C:  <other> 
A:  <laugh>  
C:  <laugh> Energy . Uh , we use bat 
D:  So so how many batteries do we need ? One battery ? 
C:  One battery . Yep . 
A:  Okay , so two . 
D:  Good . Why two ? 
C:  Oh , we just need one , I guess . 
D:  <laugh> Say no . No , ne never install . 
A:  Uh-huh . <laugh> 
D:  Two batteries or one ? 
A:  <other> Oh . 
C:  No , number is one . We need only one battery . 
D:  Only one . 
A:  Yeah yeah , but the price is two . Oh , number . Sorry sorry sorry . I'm sorry . 
D:  No , no . But no , no . No , no way . 
B:  No , uh you just  Number . Yeah . 
C:  Number , number . 
D:  Yeah . You never use uh Excel ? <laugh> Good . <laugh> 
C:   
A:  Yeah . Yeah . Oh . No , never . <laugh> 
B:  How  What what's the limit ? <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> H <other> 
D:  <laugh> It's twelve bucks . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh , it's it's okay that I don't know , 'cause uh it's not my field . Twelve bucks . Okay , now  Mm-hmm . Check that number also . <laugh> 
C:  <other> 
D:  Twelve bucks . Twelve and a half , I think . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  So we  
D:  Okay . <laugh> Okay , electronics . So  
C:  <laugh> We have sample chip . Uh , like simple chip , yeah . So , yeah . Yeah . Four buttons at least . And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition . <other> 
D:  It's a simple chip ? Simple chip , okay . One . 
A:  <other> 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Okay . <other> And for the   One also . 
D:  One or two ? One ? Okay . 
C:  Yeah , one to one . Yeah , one . 
D:  So the case , which one uh is it in the end ? 
C:  Yeah , I think we will go for a single curve , no ? 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Let's do a single curve . 
C:  Oh , is   
B:  It's it's flat . 
D:  It's flat , and curved . 
C:  <laugh> Oh . <laugh> Oh , okay . 
A:  I thought you can curve <laugh>  somebody . <laugh> 
B:  It's flat . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> But it is flat , you  Look . It's curvable , but it's not curved . <laugh> 
D:  It's curvable . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Maybe there is a supplement for that  , no ? It's only  curve ? Okay , let's go . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Oh see , I I think <laugh> that the the price is this one . 
C:  Yeah . <other> 
D:  <laugh> This  Okay , you d <laugh> We tried , we tried . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . Don't chip on me . <laugh> <other> <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh>  Oh . 
B:  Oh , okay . 
D:  So , what is it ? T titanium ? Mm , that's expensive . Mm-hmm . 
C:  Titanium . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  <other> Mm-mm . 
C:  <sound indicating surprise> 
B:  Mm . 
A:  <other> Yeah . <other> But she wanted u the <laugh> fudge titanium . I think it's five , but  <laugh> you don't say  . <laugh> 
D:  Okay . <cough> 
C:  Yeah , well  
D:  <laugh> Let's stick to s titan . Special colour ? No because uh  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Well , n Why three ? Why three ? 
C:  No , only one , no ? 
A:  Mm . Oh , sorry . Again , I'm    See it . 
D:  Yeah . <cough> 
C:  Um  
A:  Special colour , or it's only on the  
C:  Interface . 
D:  Oh . 
C:  Yes , in L_C_D_ display . Ok 
A:  Yeah , but <other> there is no <other> colour here . So I put it here . 
C:  Yeah , an Yeah . Push-button . 
D:  So the L_C_D_  
A:  How many push-button ? Three or two ? 
C:  Scro Uh , two . 
D:  Two . 
A:  Is there  The scroll-wheel , okay . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <sound indicating surprise> It's going to be expensive . 
C:  One scroll wheel <laugh> . One L_C_D_ 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> 
C:  displayed . 
A:  Okay . Um  
D:  <cough> 
A:  That's that's not  We choose this one , and not this one . 
D:  That's all ? No . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh , I think , no it's  Uh , is it a scroll wheel and pe push button , th this centre one ? Or only only scroll wheel , okay . 
C:  Yeah , it's cheaper . 
A:  Or only a scroll-wheel . 
C:  Yeah . Only scroll wheel . Yeah mm . So  
D:  <laugh> You are trying to make make up  <laugh> make us up . 
A:  <laugh> You try to s <laugh> No , no , no . <laugh> Because <other> how do you do to <sound indicating frustration> y select ? 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  It's already  <sound indicating recognition of problem> Ah . 
D:  No , but you select with the two d the other two buttons , no ? 
C:  Y ye 
A:  Yeah , I mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel and then you  
D:  That's true . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Then it automatically  we can just do like you feel , it goes . And it will activate  Um , plus , yeah , it's  price is really  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Stay longer . Okay . Oops . <laugh> Okay , okay . Um  
D:  It should stay . Yeah . 
C:  Special colours , yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  For buttons . 
C:  Okay . Yeah , buttons and strawberries . Yeah . 
B:  No , buttons just normal . 
C:  Special form . 
A:  You you have all of these , no ? 
D:  <laugh> She's very hard on this . <laugh> Special colour ? 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Mm maybe n not this one but  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . No . Special material ? 
C:  Uh , we have titan 
B:  That's for buttons . But buttons are standard . 
D:  Yeah , buttons are the standard buttons . Yeah . It's only buttons , these . 
A:  Yeah , so  
D:  Nothing special . Okay . So we are at seventeen dot eight . 
C:  Yeah . <sound indicating surprise> 
B:  <loud exhale indicating fatigue> 
A:  Not special colours an interest in ? 
D:  No , the colour is in the L_C_D_ . 
A:  <other> And buttons are not colourised ? They are m 
D:  I no . 
C:  Mm , hmm , I think uh because you can just go for a good colours . Yeah , and uh  
D:  We can just use this red . <laugh> It's  <laugh> 
A:  Boo-hoo . <other> It's already too expensive . <laugh> Apparently . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  <cough> So what is  Are we supposed to cut things out now ? Uh , until we get twelve fifty . 
A:  Yeah . Mm . Mm-hmm . Mm . 
C:  Oh . <sound indicating surprise> 
D:  <sarcastic awe> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> So think of what we can cut uh here . 
D:  <cough> Well , 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <sound indicating something is difficult> 
D:  if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_ and the speaker . 
C:  <laugh> Sample speaker . Yeah . 
A:  Apparently , we have to choose one or the other . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . <other> 
B:  Well , as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> 
B:  So , the point is that when you take device and push the button , you produce enough energy 
A:  But you don't need a battery ? Mm . 
B:  to make electricity . Yeah , that you don't need a battery . So , it's something like hand dynamo robot . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  A real high-tech version of it . 
D:  So that would  
A:  But um it's like the hand dynamo , no ? 
C:  Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand 
D:  So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay , we only  We we win one . That's already that . Okay , let's do that . 
C:   is  
B:  Okay , but l 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh it's a it's a beginning . Okay . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Why not . Let's do that . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  So  One here and here . 
C:  Yeah , just remo 
A:  'Kay . 
B:  And I propose to  So uh , about chips . Advanced chip on print , right ? So , put minus one there , please . <laugh> 
C:  S 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  <laugh> I'm not sure if this is legal . 
A:  <laugh> Mm . <laugh> That's right . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Why not ? 
C:  <laugh> Uh , no . 
B:  And ? 
D:  And ? 
A:  M maybe minus uh three , no ? <laugh> 
D:  No . <laugh> Okay , let's see . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  So , was there result ? Let's have a look . 
C:  No , no . It's not  
A:  <other> Mm-hmm . Mm . 
C:  It's not changing , no ? It  you don't 
D:  Yeah , yeah , yeah , if  Click somewhere , you'll see features . Yes , it does . 
B:  Why ? Oops . 
A:  <other> <laugh> So  <laugh> <other> Oh , sorry . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Maybe put minus two , so it looks uh <laugh> more reasonable . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . Why not . 
D:  Yeah , anyway  No , minus two . 
B:  Minus . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Nobody will know . <laugh> It's not recorded , is it ? <laugh> Okay , we're on time . Good . 
A:  Mm . <laugh> 
B:  Good . 
A:  <other> Okay . 
C:  So now on , we can increase our  <laugh> Still you have two more . <laugh> Maybe we can use it for our party . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh , we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want . <laugh> Oh . Both its it's cool . <laugh> 
D:  <other> <laugh> 
B:  And a battery and a battery , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , yeah . 
D:  No , now we are exp exceeding I think . It
