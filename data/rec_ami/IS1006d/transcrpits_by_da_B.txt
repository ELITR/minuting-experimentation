<laugh> <other> Yes . <laugh> 
And chocolate ? <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yes , and place some slides . 
Uh , participant three . <other> Prototype . 
<other> Uh , so 
this is our remote control . 
It's a r working prototype . 
You can use it now by switching all these buttons . 
So first , I present as we came to this perfect model , 
and then we'll give some technical specifications . 
That's <other> well <other> <other> , so that's that . 
Please , next slide . 
We analysed all the fruits 
and contacted NASA , 
and uh made some <other> real good  
Yeah . 
If you can see this , and the stars are showing that  . And um , <other> s society will accept that . For sure . 
<laugh> And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and uh ultimate smell of it . 
S please , next slide . 
But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 
'cause it's the most of the moder the m the  modern material we can p select . And it's practical . And it's still say it's for our needs , 
so please press something . 
And as I said , <laugh> it's perfect . <laugh> 
<laugh> Please press it . 
Everyone is  f really uh really glad to obtain an  <other> s such a r such a device . 
So you can touch it with your hands . 
Sure . Yes . <laugh> 
N 
<laugh> You must say it . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Y and we got the answer . 
Uh , it is , yes , of course . 
 , please next slide . 
Um , this is a prototype . 
You can have a look at it , 
and  That's all I wanted to say . 
Now it's technical specification by our colleague . 
We are still working on titanium . 
So , r we'll start with L_C_D_ . 
You can ask Bob . It's Tuesday . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
That's location sensors . 
Yeah , and we can just  some strawberry first . Um  
Oops . 
<laugh> 
Let's make a party first maybe . <laugh> <other> 
Feel the weight . 
Really . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Two . Two . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . Uh  
No . 
No . 
How can I say this . 
It's still it's still working , 
and your daughter got a bonus . 
<laugh> A strawberry . 
You can . 
You go  you  
So , the basic mode  
Yeah . 
So that's simple . 
The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial . 
With two buttons , you do this like uh volume up , volume down . 
Or if you go to the site , it's channel up channel down . 
And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this . 
You select twenty , you select five . 
That's it . 
No . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . 
Like , selecting the menus . 
Sure , 
without titanium alloy , it's going to be light . 
Of course . 
Okay . Okay . 
And  
Moreover , moreover 
it covers it covers all the end goals . 
Even if it is , you know , it's very rounded , 
but still you got some rubber fruit here , 
and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that . 
Okay . Okay . 
Sure , sure , just look at it . 
<laugh> It's full adaptable . <laugh> 
Yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know . 
Mm ,   
It's two point one seven . 
No , 
uh you just  
Number . Yeah . 
How  
What what's the limit ? <laugh> 
Uh , it's it's okay that I don't know , 
'cause uh it's not my field . 
Twelve bucks . 
Okay , 
now  Mm-hmm . 
Check that number also . <laugh> 
It's it's flat . 
It's flat . 
<laugh> But it is flat , 
you  Look . 
It's curvable , 
but it's not curved . <laugh> 
Oh , okay . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Well , n Why three ? 
Why three ? 
For buttons . 
No , 
buttons just normal . 
That's for buttons . 
But buttons are standard . 
Well , 
as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , 
I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy . 
So , the point is that when you take device and push the button , you produce enough energy 
to make electricity . 
Yeah , 
that you don't need a battery . 
So , it's something like hand dynamo robot . A real high-tech version of it . 
Okay , 
Why not . 
Let's do that . 
And I propose to  
So uh , about chips . 
Advanced chip on print , right ? 
So , put minus one there , please . <laugh> 
Why not ? 
And ? 
So , was there result ? 
Let's have a look . 
Why ? 
Oops . 
Yeah . 
Why not . 
Minus . 
Good . 
And a battery and a battery , yeah . 
Now it's fancy , 
let's add one instead of two . <laugh> 
Well , I don't know . 
I don't know . 
I am not sure who was programming this calculator , you know . 
'Cause uh  I wonder if we put A_ or B_ somewhere instead of a number . 
Next slide . 
Okay . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
M maybe not , huh ? 
What was the  
Oh yeah , 
what was good ? 
Everything . 
What was bad ? 
Yeah . 
A good leader , you know , a good leader is somewhere in the shade and   
Of course . Uh  
Not to waste time , that's important . 
We need time f 
New materials . 
Budget . 
Alright . 
Okay . 
Yeah , it is . 
So , we see , we can even forecast .  they propose us like celebration , everything , 
we could forecast it , right ? 
You ? 
It was you . 
Okay . 
<other> Okay .
