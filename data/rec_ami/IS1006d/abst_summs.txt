A:  Okay . So first , <other> let's uh see the prototype . 
abst_sum - abstract: This last meeting started with the presentation of a remote control prototype.

C:  And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this <other> jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . <other> 
C:  So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume . 
C:  And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours . 
C:  For the L_C_D_ . 
B:  It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . 
A:  The scroll-wheel , okay . 
C:  One L_C_D_ displayed . 
abst_sum - abstract: It has on-off and volume buttons, an LCD screen (it can be active or switched off) in various colours, which largely replaces the use of push buttons, and a jog-wheel for navigation and option selection in the menus presented on the LCD.

C:  And we have speech recognition . 
C:  And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . 
C:  And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition . <other> 
abst_sum - abstract: It also includes speech recognition as an alternative interface, which also serves as mechanism for locating the device.

None
abst_sum - abstract: It was designed to be powered by a single battery.

C:  <other> Material , we want to stick to titanium . 
A:  wh what are the strawberries for ? <laugh> 
C:  The case is silver titanium , no ? 
C:  So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours . 
C:  Titanium . 
abst_sum - abstract: The casing will be made of titanium with rubber strawberries following the fruit and veg fashion.

A:  let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium . <laugh> 
D:  so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . 
D:  One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . 
D:  what do you think , is it fancy ? <laugh> 
D:  So here , two . Up . 
D:  Then we have uh technology . 
D:  d I think it's a one for that , at least . 
D:  Robustness , uh-huh . 
A:  It's um robust , yeah . 
D:  Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? 
D:  Okay , two . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> So size and weight . 
D:  Up to three for that , 
D:  Colour and shape . 
D:  I suggested three . 
D:  And uh the last one is adaptive . 
A:  Okay . <other> Let's go for one . <laugh> 
D:  Now we have to do the average . <laugh> 
D:  Two point one seven . 
A:  So now , it has to fulfil the <laugh> financial criterium ? 
D:  So we are at seventeen dot eight . 
abst_sum - abstract: The prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) in terms of fancifulness, technology, robustness, usefulness, size, colour and shape and customizability: the average mark was 2.17; the team were satisfied with their prototype, although after costs were calculated it proved very expensive.

D:  Project evaluation , good . <sound indicating relief> 
A:  Mm . See mm how  <other> Are we a good team ? Mm . 
A:  Is there enough room for creativity ? 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  Team-work , very strong , I would say . 
abst_sum - abstract: Finally, the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team, they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager's leadership.

None
abst_sum - action: *NA*

D:  So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay , 
abst_sum - decisions: After the team realised the prototype was over budget, they replaced the battery with a hand dynamo.

A:  Apparently , we have to choose one or the other . <other> 
D:  if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_ 
D:  and the speaker . 
B:  So , put minus one there , please . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> I'm not sure if this is legal . 
D:  Okay , we're uh on target . 
abst_sum - decisions: When it became evident from the costs of components and materials that they would have to do without either the LCD or the speech recognition, they decided to change the given prices in order to accommodate them to their design and budget.

A:  wh what are the strawberries for ? <laugh> 
B:  That's location sensors . 
A:  <other> And what about the strawberries on the top ? 
abst_sum - problems: The gratuitous presence of decorative rubber strawberries on a titanium case (even if they cover sensors) did not meet everyone's approval.

A:  <laugh> I'm not convince . 
D:  <cough> Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year . 
abst_sum - problems: Although, the attempt was towards keeping with the current fashion trends, the result did not satisfy the program manager.

D:  So we are at seventeen dot eight . 
abst_sum - problems: The prototype was more than 40% over budget.

A:  <other> So think of what we can cut uh here . <laugh> 
D:  Are we supposed to cut things out now ? 
abst_sum - problems: The team realised that their budget did not allow for all the specifications of their prototype.
