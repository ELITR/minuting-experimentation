So , 
Hi Christa . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yes . <laugh> 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Such a nice thing . <cough> 
Can I ? 
Ho-ho . 
<sound indicating reaction to material> <laugh> <sound imitating flatulence>   <laugh> 
It says <sound imitating flatulence> <laugh> 
I will uh  
I'll buy it . <laugh> 
If I if I need so . <laugh> 
Hopefully my daughter will like it . <laugh> 
Yes , of course . Of c course . <laugh> 
Ah . 
Oh , there is <laugh> a button missing . 
<laugh> Okay . <laugh> 
It's in option . <laugh> 
Hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> Hey , babe . 
<laugh> Bob . <laugh> Hey Bob . <laugh> 
Okay , 
that's good . 
<laugh> Oh , these are strawberries . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Fruit smelling spongy titanium . 
<laugh> I didn't know it exist , 
but that's great . 
Ha . 
You mean we can change the colour uh of th 
Yeah . Yeah okay , for the L_C_D_ . 
Tit titanium is  
Uh , okay . 
<laugh> Yeah , Bob , please . <laugh>  Tuesday colour . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> Black for Sunday . <laugh> 
On the L_C_D_ ? 
Oh . 
<laugh> Of course . 
<laugh> What do you think ? <laugh> 
Strawberry sensors . <laugh> 
Very useful . 
<other> <laugh> 
Lounge meeting . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Alright . Good . <laugh> 
So , huh . Interesting . In interesting . Mm mm . 
<laugh> It makes sense . 
So uh , this is  
What a design . 
<other> It's my turn . 
Mm-hmm . 
Let's see if this  Yeah , if you meet <laugh> the evaluation criterion . 
<cough> 
Yeah . So , evaluation please . 
So . 
You made a very nice prototype , 
and um , I think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our  what we want to do , and things like that . 
So mm  <other> Uh , 
next slide , please . 
<other> As you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry <laugh> uh <laugh> remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it . 
Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can . 
To  
so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . 
One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . 
And seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil at all . 
And we're all l going to list all the criterion . 
I'm going to go to that next slide , 
and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . 
And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . 
So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ? 
So these are the criterion uh I'm  I thought were important . 
Of course , this can be discussed , but let's let's see , 
so let's vote . 
So we have fancy here 
and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle . 
So , 
what do you think , is it fancy ? <laugh> 
<laugh> It is very very fancy . 
Or have you ever seen something like that ? <laugh> 
Yeah , of course . 
What do you think ? 
Is it  
The weight is later . 
<laugh> Now <laugh> we're  <laugh> 
We're on the fanciness now . 
I think it's quite fancy . 
It's uh  
Yeah , so  
No it's it's one . 
Yeah , o one means it's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all . 
So it's one or two . 
What do you think ? 
Two ? 
Okay . 
So here , two . Up . 
Then we have uh technology . 
So , what about technology ? 
We have uh we have speech recognition , 
we have location based  , 
we have L_C_D_ . 
Change colour , 
I mean that's very  
Quite 
d I think it's a one for that , at least . 
At least a one , yeah . 
Robustness , uh-huh . 
<laugh> So <laugh> let's suppose my daughter take it and um <laugh>  and through it away . 
Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again ? 
Uh , maybe not the prototype . 
<laugh> Let's try . <laugh> 
<laugh> Oh my god . <laugh> 
Okay , we just lost one strawberry . 
So  <laugh> 
Not at all ? 
It is  
Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
So it's not so bad . 
I um uh I would say three . 
Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ? 
Useful . <laugh> 
Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? 
So I don't know . 
These buttons are uh  It not clear . 
But you have at least uh next produce . 
Uh , it depends on the  
Okay . 
So but , for instance , because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly . 
Directly . 
Yeah . 
Oh , it's a jog dial , okay . 
Uh-huh . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
<sound indicating recognition or awe> Okay . 
It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ? 
Don't you think so ? 
May  not  okay , we can go . That's uh  You're right . 
That's  it's less uh  Yeah . 
But it's it's nice , because people anyway don't go there . 
But  
<cough> So what do you think for it , usefulness ? 
Seems to be useful . <laugh> 
Both . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Up down or left right . Yeah . 
That  
Cool . 
I would say then uh   
Two or three ? 
Two or three ? 
Two . 
Okay , two . <laugh> 
<laugh> So size and weight . 
Is it the the the effective size and weight that the  
Is it uh real size , real weight ? 
Or  Because it  
Size is going to be that , yeah ? 
Uh , and and  
It's going to be lighter , 
because this seems to be very heavy f I mean , 
for my daughter , for instance . 
<laugh> Not sure if uh <laugh> she can use it . <laugh> 
So , should be okay . 
Up to three for that , 
because I'm  haven't seen the weight so I must not uh  
Colour and shape . 
Well , 
so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ . 
But um , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh <laugh> the case . 
It's a  it's going to be titanium . Okay , okay . 
That's nice . 
<laugh> I think it's good . Okay . 
Yahoo . <laugh> 
<cough> Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year . 
So  <laugh> 
Uh , I think usefulness is m as as 
I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness . 
Whether it's fancy or not now , it  we have to decide . 
But this 
If it's  
Uh-huh . 
So , that they will  that maybe the fruit may be here instead . <laugh> 
So , it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh  
I suggested three . 
Because uh , everybody s doesn't seem to be convince , 
although it's quite  
You have good arguments . 
But  
And uh the last one is adaptive . 
This is not r maybe not as important as the other one , <other> 
but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use ? 
<laugh> Great . 
<laugh> Fully adaptable . 
That's  
Yeah . <laugh> 
So you can fit into your palm , okay . 
That  
What else can we need ? 
You  Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well ? 
<laugh> It's fudge , yeah , yeah . 
Yeah , fruit titanium , yeah . 
Well , I if if this is  
if you are ready to do that , then I think it deserves a one . <laugh> 
<laugh> Okay . 
Now we have to do the average . <laugh> 
<laugh> Who is good in math ? <laugh> 
Okay . <laugh> 
Two point one seven . 
That's nice . 
Two point one seven out of seven . 
I think we have a good good thing . 
Well , that's all I had to say about the evaluation . 
So  
It seems to be good , yeah . 
We have uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . Thanks . 
<cough> 
Ah-ha . 
<other> <laugh> 
So so how many batteries do we need ? 
One battery ? 
Good . 
Why two ? 
<laugh> Say no . 
No , ne never install . 
Two batteries or one ? 
Only one . 
No , no . But no , no . No , no way . 
Yeah . 
You never use uh Excel ? <laugh> 
Good . <laugh> 
<laugh> It's twelve bucks . 
Twelve bucks . 
Twelve and a half , I think . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Okay , electronics . 
So  
It's a simple chip ? 
Simple chip , okay . 
One . 
Okay . 
One or two ? 
One ? 
Okay . 
So the case , which one uh is it in the end ? 
Let's do a single curve . 
It's flat , and curved . 
It's curvable . <laugh> 
Maybe there is a supplement for that  , 
no ? 
It's only  curve ? 
Okay , let's go . 
<laugh> This  
Okay , 
you d <laugh> 
We tried , we tried . 
So , what is it ? 
T titanium ? 
Mm , that's expensive . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . <cough> 
<laugh> Let's stick to s titan . 
Special colour ? 
No because uh  
Yeah . <cough> 
Oh . 
So the L_C_D_  
Two . 
Yeah . 
<sound indicating surprise> 
It's going to be expensive . 
<laugh> <cough> 
That's all ? 
No . 
Oh , I think , no it's  
Uh , is it a scroll wheel and pe push button , th this centre one ? 
Or only only scroll wheel , okay . 
<laugh> You are trying to make make up  <laugh> make us up . 
No , but you select with the two d the other two buttons , 
no ? 
That's true . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
It should stay . Yeah . 
<laugh> She's very hard on this . <laugh> 
Special colour ? 
Yeah . 
No . 
Special material ? 
Yeah , 
buttons are the standard buttons . 
Yeah . 
It's only buttons , these . 
Nothing special . 
Okay . 
So we are at seventeen dot eight . 
No , the colour is in the L_C_D_ . 
I no . 
We can just use this red . 
<laugh> It's  <laugh> 
So what is  
Are we supposed to cut things out now ? 
Uh , until we get twelve fifty . 
<cough> Well , 
if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_ 
and the speaker . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
So that would  
So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay , 
we only  
We we win one . 
That's already that . 
Okay , let's do that . 
<laugh> I'm not sure if this is legal . 
And ? 
No . <laugh> 
Okay , let's see . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah , 
if  
Click somewhere , 
you'll see features . 
Yes , it does . 
Maybe put minus two , so it looks uh <laugh> more reasonable . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
anyway  
No , 
minus two . 
Nobody will know . 
<laugh> It's not recorded , is it ? 
<laugh> Okay , we're on time . 
Good . 
No , now we are exp exceeding I think . 
It  
Is it ? <laugh> 
I think we're exceeding now . 
We have to remove the  
Uh , it's better . 
I think they are counting uh  
We would prefer , 
yeah . Maximum is maximum . 
So , remove one of them . Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay , we're uh on target . 
<sound indicating relief> 
I'm just curious to see this 
uh  <laugh> my  <laugh> address chip on print . 
Trick <laugh> . 
Uh , I would say it's the Russian trick , but 
<laugh>  Anyway  <laugh> 
No , 
they may have some their origins , strange origins  
<laugh> No , no , no . 
Let's finish this meeting instead . <laugh> 
What else ? 
No . 
This is right . 
Okay , 
so finance , that's done . 
Are the cost under twelve ? 
Yes . 
Project evaluation , good . <sound indicating relief> 
Project process . 
Safe uh asse uh safe assessment . 
Yeah , I think we've listened to everybody . 
Everybody could say what they thought . 
And uh  
Yeah . 
When we see the results , there is no doubt there  <laugh> 
<cough> Maybe a lack of leadership ? <laugh> 
Team-work , very strong , I would say . 
Team-work , no problem . 
Means . 
Whiteboard , digital pens . 
Yeah , 
I think white-board is useful . 
Digital pens , useful . 
New ideas found ? 
Yeah . 
But uh  
Yeah , 
but uh then I I mus 
That's true . 
And there's uh one very important point . 
We're on time . 
Meetings finish when they have to or even before . 
The  
for meeting it's uh one of the most important thing . 
Yeah . Yeah , 
we have other <other> uh remote controls to create . <laugh> 
Mm . <cough>  . 
Mm , yeah . 
Hey , 
just wondering if my uh  
what about the the pink  <laugh> the pinkness of that uh 
 . They are working on a  
Okay , good . 
I think we are great . 
There's no no other words for that . <laugh> 
<laugh> We are probably the best . 
Real Reaction is uh 
 Yeah . Yeah . 
<sound effect> Finished ? 
Ah , celebration . 
Are the costs within the budget ? 
Of course they are . Yeah . 
<laugh> Is the project evaluated ? 
Yes , it is . <laugh> 
To whom ? 
To the whole our company ? 
So , let's celebrate . Uh  <sarcastic celebratory noise> <laugh> 
<other> I think the meeting   
The meeting is over at least . 
So , we have to go out . <laugh> 
Yeah , yeah , yeah .
