A:  So 
D:  So  
A:  I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting . 
D:  Of course . <laugh> 
A:  Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation . Um uh we want to know  to  at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the  from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  third part <laugh> uh I don't remember <laugh> which is not very good . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Ah of course , how to to design this uh this  <other> yeah . 
D:  Nice stuff <laugh> 
A:  So um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert . 
D:  <other> Who starts ? 
A:  So wait a minute 
D:  <other> Oh . Ha . 


D:  okay . 
D:  So as you know , you  I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . 
D:  So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way <laugh> because they are supposed to be useful . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . 
D:  Um next please . <other> 
D:  what else do I have ? Next slide ? 
D:  Ah <laugh> now I remember what is R_S_I_ <laugh> it's repetitivity stress injury . 
A:  <laugh> <laugh> 
C:  Uh . 
D:  <laugh> We have to be careful with that word but <laugh> uh anyway I continue my presentation 
D:  And um I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . And uh , if you have any question ? 
A:  Mm I think it's good , okay . You done a good review . 
C:  Thank you . 


A:  So um now I think it's the turn of the the  <laugh> I'm not sure um  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Of the technical function , so <other> uh 
D:  So I think it's you , huh ? 
C:  Uh it's 
D:  No ? <laugh> 
B:  <other> That's me . 
C:  techni function of  
A:  what effect  
D:  No , user requiremen 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . Wait a second . Argh . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  I have to do working design so uh . 
A:  So you're  
B:  That's  but this but number three , yes . Mm-hmm . 


B:  So , my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design . However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . 
D:  <other> 
B:  Uh , as I'm a more an artist that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this . So next slide please . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Okay . Let's go . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  And uh a general method which is  seems to be very useful for our task is not to forget about uh Occam razor . We should never complicate things too much . We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control . 
C:  Mm . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use . 
D:  Makes sense . <laugh> 
B:  So , make a click , please . 
B:  Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple 
A:  Oh sorry . <laugh> 
B:  simple desires into simple actions . 
D:  Nice . Nice sentence . 
B:  Findings . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay . Oh sorry . 
B:  Our question of the style , we should remember that our company 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Concept . <laugh> Be simple . Be simple and you'll lean on this market . Market is a  of remote controls  you know it better , it's very 
C:  <laugh> S you should  yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Mm . 
B:  well , it's it's not an easy field to to play , you know ? 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  So be simple . 
B:  Alright ? Thanks for your attention . 
A:  Uh you're finish ? Okay . 


A:  So now <cough> the technical aspects of this new device . Mm . 
C:  Two . Yeah , if  
A:  You prefer it  . <laugh> 
C:   Sorry . Yeah . 


C:  Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh  like digital calculators and electronic calculators . <other> So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . So we need to have some energy source to do what  to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . <other> And usually this  so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages  these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . 
A:  Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh . 
C:  Uh , not very much , like  yeah . 
A:  No . 
D:  Okay . Thanks . 
A:  Okay , thanks . 
C:  Thank you . Yep . Thank you . 


A:  <other> So 
C:  Can you just  yeah . 
A:  mm 
C:   
A:  mm I think , okay , we're just on time . Um mm mm . 


A:  So , we're now going to l have the lunch break . 
D:  Mm great . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um <other> we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um  on the components so <other> uh you will focus on the component concept um 
C:  Yeah yeah . 
A:  uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . 
C:  Mark will  
A:  So <other> um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that's all . 


A:  And we have um maybe we have to  we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ? Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible . 
D:  <cough> 
C:  Uh it's in current price , yeah . 
D:  Difficult . 
A:  Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um . 
C:  Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible . 
A:  Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  And um do you see something else ? 
D:  No . 


D:  Good we're done ? Right , thanks . 
A:  So , yeah , let's go to lunch . 
C:  Yeah . Thank you , thank you very much . 
A:
