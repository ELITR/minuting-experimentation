Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh . 
<laugh> We met before . 
F_ F_ five . 
Agree . 
<laugh> R_S_I_ mm-hmm . 
No , I don't think so . 
Okay . 
But twenty six percent , do you know  
Twenty five . <laugh> 
Every fourth , you know . <laugh> Every four  some of us knows . 
One of us  
Mm-hmm . 
Functions . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
I got one question , 
uh you are a Market Expert 
so 
should we aim at the young people or not ? 
Okay , 
then teletext is used less . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
Mm . Okay . 
<other> That's me . 
That's  but this but number three , 
yes . 
Mm-hmm . 
So , 
my name is Mark Dwight , 
and um I am responsible for User Interface Design . 
However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . 
Uh , as I'm a more an artist 
that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this . 
So next slide please . 
And uh a general method which is  seems to be very useful for our task 
is not to forget about uh Occam razor . 
We should never complicate things too much . 
We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control . 
'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use . 
So , make a click , please . 
So here is this remote control . 
It's quite a standard one , 
but it's not from a T_V_ , 
it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . 
But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . 
Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , 
and please make a click , 
compared to this one 
which one would you prefer ? 
I guess this . 
Sure , sure . 
Yeah , 
and our method is going to be , provide simple 
simple desires into simple actions . 
Findings . 
Our question of the style , we should remember that our company 
puts fashion into electronics 
and we should never forget about it . 
Concept . 
<laugh> Be simple . Be simple 
and you'll lean on this market . 
Market is a  of remote controls  you know it better , 
it's very 
well , 
it's it's not an easy field to to play , 
you know ? 
So be simple . 
For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium . 
It's a really good style , 
it going to be  look like like this . 
It is unbreakable 
and it is very universal . 
W we'll have a screen with a back light 
which can change colours , 
and we can put all the options into this screen . 
We'll need only few buttons . 
All the other things can be controlled through the screen . 
And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 
'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , 
but you should do it by touching it 
and finding it easily just by touch . 
So  
Press  
I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium 
I think , 
and uh what else ? 
I got just very few and good ideas . 
We need power and volume . 
And let us include two nice features into this device , 
first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . 
When you go to the sofa , take your control 
and point it to the T_V_ , 
the T_V_ turns on . 
When you don't touch the control 
but you go out of the  
For for enough time 
like uh you  
It's a question to our technical design , our <other> two engineers . 
And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . 
Suppose you set u you set up some volume 
and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room 
and take your control with you . 
Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes . 
It's easy to do , 
you just control the  
According to the distance .  
Yeah yeah yeah . 
So  
I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter . 
So , 
its main purpose in fact is a back light , 
which change colours , 
which makes it easier to find , 
and each can  
it can respond for your voice , 
like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , 
yeah ? 
So basically that's it . 
Can be easily done , 
'cause 
you got simple designs , 
y 
we should put it to simple actions . 
Let it be universal , 
so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . 
You want to change tracks 
and you want to adjust volume . 
Just few actions , a few actions for everything . 
All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen . 
Okay , okay . 
Okay , 
but it's quite universal you know . 
We can just extend it to any device . 
Uh twenty five . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> In fact I would propose another solution . 
Basically you use just four or five channels , 
right ? 
Yeah . 
So uh 
set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , 
and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next . 
Or say this can be back . 
Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , 
like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ? 
<laugh> Okay . 
<laugh> Okay . 
Alright ? 
Thanks for your attention . 
<other> Too complex . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Um . 
<laugh> Okay .  <laugh> 
No you know 
it's a conceptual question , 
'cause now I see th this  the picture in front of my eyes 
like a user taking his remote control 
and shouting into it , volume up , volume up , 
and and he's coming  you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . <laugh> 
Okay , 
for this budget like twelve Euros . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay. . 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ? 
Like , if I want to put volume up I like do  mm I take my remote control do like  something like 
roll 'em up 
or roll 'em down . 
Mm why ? 
That's just  
<laugh> 
<laugh> We got a really good Market Expert . 
Let's send more , let's sell more . 
Okay . 
Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ? 
Like , you want to find it , you shout 
control , 
and it answers is I'm here ? Or  
Just beeps ? 
I can't whistle . 
No , no , I can't . 
Mm . 
<laugh> Okay . 
Just don't interfere with other devices like 
'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping . 
Yeah , 
I got it at my home , like  <claps> . 
Oops .
