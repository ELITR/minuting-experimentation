<laugh> 
Yeah , 
it is put F_ five  . 
The full page presentation , 
yep . 
Yeah . Yep . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> You can  you are  . 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect . 
Yeah , 
because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology , 
and those waves have high  
Uh . 
Uh . 
Yeah it's  People really <laugh>  
Yeah . Yeah . 
Uh . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
'Cause  
Thank you . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm , yep . 
Thank you . 
Uh it's 
techni function of  
Yeah . 
I have to do working design so uh 
Mm . 
<laugh> It's  
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Maybe it can be yeah middle of  like , between those two 
li 
<laugh> S you should  yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
 <laugh> 
Distance . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . Yeah and it  mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , 
like you can uh de you can just button the number 
and then it go 
t because  
Yeah . 
But still  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah. . 
Yeah . 
But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers 
and then they can just press  suppose two five they just press two and five 
and then  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah 
but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls 
so we can have more functions for T_V_ 
uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Two . 
Yeah , 
if  
 Sorry . 
Yeah . 
Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . 
I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices 
and I previously devised many uh  like digital calculators and electronic calculators . 
<other> So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . 
Well , 
as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . 
So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . 
So we need to have some energy source to do what  to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . <other> 
And usually this  
so to do these functions we need an interface , 
which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . 
And then these messages  these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message 
and then it will process by the chip 
and then it will generate some information to the main device . 
It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . 
Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . 
So , 
basically we need 
uh since we are focusing on our interface device  remote control 
mainly the energy source like the battery 
and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , 
and then we have some chip , 
it's mainly digital signal processing chip because 
since we are  I am one doing mostly digital uh devices 
we ought to have some kind of processor 
which take care of all these functions 
and put it in some digital format . 
And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source 
which sends the information to the main device . 
Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , 
and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s , 
so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things . 
Yeah yeah , 
because the people don't use one particular brand so 
or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good . 
So we need to check their specifications 
and do their uh encryption 
that's passing information to the T_V_ device . 
So we need to have particular encryption codes . 
Then , components , 
so we have the main uh energy source 
and then we will have some buttons 
and then we will have infrared uh source 
and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . 
Uh since I don't have much time 
so I'll input the connections to all this components . 
And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface , 
so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , I'm sure , 
because since our User Interface  speech recognition 
and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy , 
so 
we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip . 
Since we have some kind of uh energy 
this is our 
this normal battery , 
so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power 
and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip 
so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser 
and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user 
so you just <cough> 
yeah , 
so that we just use simple recog 
no 
but but  
Yeah . 
No , 
even in  
you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So  
Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that , 
because we want to have uh millions and in bulk , 
so we can make really simp 
and we want to make really simple device 
because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like 
then we'll have something like this um 
we'll have volume 
and then we will have s particular channel , 
so users can listen . 
Ye 
No , 
yeah , 
a user can use any kind of sender 
but they should have this prompt  volume and then  <other> 
yeah 
volume and decrease or increase , 
so we try to only recognise those words 
and and because we can't really say user to say same wording 
then it become more mechanical and  yeah . 
And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , 
because we don't know like users have different programmes , 
I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh 
so we just want channel number , 
we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else 
because 
it will be complicated 
so we'll have only these three uh main basic 
uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem , 
it's it it will be take care of our main  mm . 
Yeah 
actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this  processor 
and  This really  , 
suppose like here we have our main chip 
which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s . 
Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ 
then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and  like this key . 
So it may not be like very expensive , 
because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control 
so  
and we have only few things here  
Yeah . 
Um uh uh this point we didn't consider 
because it's it's very expensive 
because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros 
and  
Yeah , 
even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , 
because it  different criteria for different people 
like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote 
and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off 
and  
Yay yeah . 
Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , 
so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I  
They can make  
<laugh> <laugh> Yeah we can have  
<laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Uh , not very much , 
like  yeah . 
Thank you . Yep . 
Thank you . 
Can you just  
yeah . 
 
Yeah yeah . 
Mark will  
Uh it's in current price , yeah . 
Yeah . 
But speech recogniser can be possible . 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
Yeah , 
especially the power , it really consumes 
because it should be all the time on 
and  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah I think it's good . 
But it's a good feature I guess yeah 
we need to think about more how to incorporate it . 
Oh . 
Ah it's  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Thank you , thank you very much .
