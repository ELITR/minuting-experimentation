So  
Of course . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Nice stuff <laugh> 
<other> Who starts ? 
<other> Oh . 
Ha . 
okay . 
So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? 
So 
it's being modified . 
Do you want  yeah , open . Read only . 
I hope I saved it . <laugh> 
So , um 
yeah , 
this is my name . <laugh> 
So as you know , you  I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . 
I am the expert in marketing 
and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , 
and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . 
So 
next please . 
Uh-oh . <laugh> 
<laugh> Hmm . 
Yeah 
maybe in the full page 
because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so . 
Uh-huh hmm okay . 
So basically uh 
what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls 
how they feel about w the current remote controls , 
what they like , 
what they don't like 
and um 
and what they do with them by the way <laugh> 
because they are supposed to be useful . <laugh> 
Don't forget about that . 
So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls 
and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . 
And next please . 
Yeah , so basically 
what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . 
First of all , they find it very ugly . <laugh> 
Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one 
uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , 
I mean they're all the same , 
and they're not l good looking . 
Um what is interesting 
is that in fact it seems that they were  people are ready to pay for nice and look  and fancy looking uh remote control , 
so I think we should probably spend lots of time in  and effort in that um . 
And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use 
and it it  the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . 
For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often 
so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality 
that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . 
And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , 
so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . 
Um next please . 
<other> Now <laugh> 
people are very frustrated w with their <laugh> remote controls 
and they for instance uh they don't even find it <laugh> 
it's <laugh> it's often lost somewhere in the in the  in your home 
and nobody knows where it is . 
Maybe if we have something where we could <laugh> ask the remote control please , where are you ? 
<laugh> Like uh something to to  like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . 
Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone 
but <laugh> you can't phone your <laugh> your remote control . 
But why not ? Yeah . 
And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls 
that nobody use , 
in fact they don't even know how to use them , 
so most of the the people say they they don't know how to  they  to use properly their r remote controls . 
And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ 
but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ . 
<laugh> So I think they are bad . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . Mm 
nobody has any idea about that ? 
Well I'll check uh with my 
Oh , okay , 
I think it's a technical thing 
which our  
Okay . 
So , 
it seems that <laugh> it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know <laugh> 
but we have to take this into account . 
<laugh> 
So anyway 
that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user 
and um 
what else do I have ? 
Next slide ? 
Ah yeah . 
So we've listed a couple of uh 
s uh functions 
that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls 
and uh well 
the tables look very nice to read 
but what is important 
is to understand that the power button is not used often 
because in general you <laugh> use it only once per session , 
but it is very relevant . <laugh> 
People want to have a power button . 
Channel selection is uh o often used  very often used 
and indeed uh very relevant . 
<laugh> 
Ah <laugh> 
now I remember what is R_S_I_ <laugh> 
it's repetitivity stress injury . 
<laugh> We have to be careful with that word 
but <laugh> uh anyway 
I continue my presentation 
so  yeah , 
channel selection is um very important , very often used . 
Volume is not often used 
but people uh want to have control on volume 
and that makes sense of course . 
And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . 
All of them . they're not often used 
and they are s more or less relevant . 
It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , 
even if I personally never use it 
but seems that it's average relevant at least , so . 
I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , 
which is not as uh these 
these two one were  had I think ten I think . 
But but if you compare with these ones , uh I think they scored a one or two . 
Not very relevant , so 
if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay 
but just know that people find it somehow relevant . 
That's for the main functions I think 
and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . 
For instance I think  net 
next slide . <other> 
One of the thing  the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility  the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , 
so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons 
but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . 
So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control 
and as we can see it really depends on the age . 
Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . 
And uh as the age goes up <laugh> the <laugh> the relevance goes down . 
<laugh> So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? 
I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . 
If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they  this should be 
so now 
this is of course , 
depends on that . 
And um I don't have any conclusion , 
I didn't have time 
the meeting was very tight , 
so that's basically my findings . 
And uh , 
if you have any question ? 
I can go back . 
Yeah one question , 
yeah ? 
I am . <laugh> 
I think we should aim at the young people . 
But uh I think they are  they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device . 
In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , 
less than  more than  
Then teletext is useless for them I think , 
yeah . 
Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah . 
But  yeah . Nope . 
'Kay ? 
<laugh> 
So I think it's you , huh ? 
No ? <laugh> 
No , 
user requiremen 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Makes sense . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh  I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button . 
<laugh> 
Nice . Nice sentence . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
And when does it turn off ? 
Oh 
so you have a 
sensing  sensor machine that uh knows  
Tech <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
According to your distance to  and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system . 
Uh I'm not sure about the screen , 
wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? 
Uh is it a touch screen by the way ? 
So it gives instructions 
but uh it has to be with an back light somehow .  
Okay . 
Okay . 
So 
for instance if I want to go to  directly to channel twenty five , how would I do  can I do that with this ? 
Yeah 
mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now . 
You know these days we have hundreds of channels , 
that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels . 
Or is it ? 
Most people  
yeah . 
In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button . 
I uh  
B 
yeah . 
Go to channel twenty five . 
One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap . 
So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , 
just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping . 
And it's only next . 
Yeah 
so  but you have to  
Okay . 
So it would be  
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . Alright . 
<laugh> Listening more . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Okay . 
Well 
I could could uh have a look at that <laugh> maybe . 
<laugh> I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . <laugh> 
Although I don't know . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
But uh very very good to sell . <laugh> 
Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , 
and ha ha you cannot use my remote control , 
because it's targeted to me . Whatever . <laugh> 
Hmm . Cheap . 
Millions . <laugh> 
Cheap . 
The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume 
or or it will be something like volume , up , down . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Couple of words . 
Okay . 
Of course uh it has to be  
Okay . 
<laugh> But then I think you you  <laugh> 
First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons . 
It's on top of using the button . 
Well , 
I dunno . <laugh> 
T_V_ . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Very expensive , 
no ? 
And volume control . 
So but uh  
Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? 
So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . 
We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> Yeah , of course . 
<laugh> <sounds resembling fighting> That's no problem , we will sell more . <laugh> 
Yeah exactly . 
Okay . 
Thanks . 
Mm great . <laugh> 
<cough> 
Difficult . 
Mm-hmm . 
No . 
<laugh> Speakers in the remote cont 
Oh yeah . 
It just beeps . 
That would be enough . 
Something very cheap . 
But that's ex that's expensive . Uh . 
Well 
I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them 
and and they  
because of the the frequency they they just answer to that . 
You can't whistle . 
Uh-huh . 
Or a clap . 
You can clap . Can you ? 
Clap is good . 
Tak 
<laugh> Just a <laugh> suggestion . 
<laugh> With only one hand ? <laugh> 
<other> These are not our target people . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Oh 
that's e that already exists 
okay okay . 
Oh yeah , you do have . 
Wow . You're trendy . <laugh> 
Think about it . 
Yeah , okay . 
Okay . 
Good 
we're done ? 
Right , 
thanks .
