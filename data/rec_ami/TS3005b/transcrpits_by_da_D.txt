<other> Yep yep yep yep . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Well , 
shall I go first with the users ? 
I think  
well 
okay no problem . <other> 
Ja precies , ja precies , ja precies 
E_I_E_ . 
 
 
<laugh> Animation . <laugh> 
Infrared light . 
<cough> 
To this meeting . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Smoking . 
'Kay . Check . <other> 
Kijke  
'Kay , so . 
<other> We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , 
that m 
that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , 
or just  
Yeah , and the users , actually . 
The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . 
Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? 
And then  tho that section we're going to focus 
and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . 
Okay . 
Some data . 
Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . 
And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . 
The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , 
and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area . 
 Goed so . 
'Kay . 
Findings . 
Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . 
So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , 
but some somewhat bi bigger than small , 
so you don't lose it that much anymore . 
<other> Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , 
and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , 
so the buttons sh should be that small , 
or shouldn't be that complex 
because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . 
Next . 
Important issues about the remote . 
I think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . 
Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , 
because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , 
so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , 
with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . 
The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , 
so those  they  those have to h be find very easily . 
And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . 
It has also be  have to find easily when the label is gone . 
My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off 
or would be s uh 
 senden  
okay . <other> So uh 
if that's k uh if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily 
on the remote . 
Buttons . Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . 
or should be covered , 
or in L_C_D_ screen . 
L_C_D_ screen is easy 
because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . 
Put one option 
and then you have the all the buttons of that options , 
so the other options would be gone . 
And you don't see the buttons . 
So L_C_D_ screens should be easy , 
but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . 
So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . 
Yeah , touch screen , yeah . 
The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . 
Because they use the remote control often more often , 
and are more technical than the ol older people . 
And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . 
So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot  not that much on the younger pep younger people , 
but also somewhat on the elderly people . 
And on my personal preferences , I don't have any mo more time to come with that , 
but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use 
because you have  you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons . 
And it should be easy to use . Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . 
And that is it . 
Ja ,  
Be 
television . 
Only the television . 
So 
yeah , then you can yeah . 
Requirements , 
no ? 
Functions . 
Yeah , 
the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it , 
oh teletext doesn't have to be ? 
Um other functions . 
<other> Yeah 
I had  
Yeah , yeah . 
I think it's 
I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that , 
because some T_V_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , 
and that's that's not relaxed 
to user . 
<other> Yeah . 
So that it <other> easy and fast . 
Yeah . 
Our main targets' age are ? were ? Forty five plus , or ? 
Forties , okay 
because <other> because younger people as 
Uh younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen . 
From twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent , 
and thirty six to forty five , fifty five percent , 
so I think to um  
Because on most recog remote controls um the print plate will be broken how much , two years . 
You have to press h very hard to go to the next channel . 
With the L_C_D_ screen it's easier 
because you only have to wipe the screen to uh  for fingerprint , 
and then you can use it again . 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah 
but a  you don't know  
True . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
it only says that this perce percentage like L_C_D_ screen . 
Because , yeah and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical . 
<other> And if the only f 
Yeah , 
because our target is sixteen to forty five . 
Yeah 
you don't know how much it costs . 
Yeah , 
you don't know how much it costs , the L_C_D_ screen . 
No , 
I don't have any costs here , 
I only have percentages . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
if you want to adjust , like for example , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen 
and you get the buttons for audio settings , 
so the other buttons are gone . 
I think it's the most easier thing , 
yeah . 
No . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Highly . 
Yeah , 
but  
Um , 
s 
forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , 
and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent . 
But our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty . 
No , that not now , 
but , so  
Yeah , 
but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger . 
Yeah , 
i i if it  
Yeah , 
if it costs  gets too much , too expensive , then yeah , we should be sticking to rubber buttons . 
N 
nothing , no costs at all . 
Yeah , 
in  
I think that should 
yeah 
 I think we all get the costs of everything . 
Yeah , okay , I'll I'll post it . 
Yeah . 
Okay , L_C_D_ , yeah . 
Then you have the seventy five percent of users find it r ugly . 
Yeah , 
and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy . 
Tha i l i 
it'll look fancy with L_C_D_ screen . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
just a  the plain remotes , not not specific L_C_D_ remotes . 
So  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , of course . 
And then you have the other thing , that seventy five percent zap a lot , 
but that's not a f question with the L_C_D_ screen . 
Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it . 
Um  
Mm-hmm . 
<other> The most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection , volume con selection , 
and power s power usage . 
And a teletext , but that is not of the question . 
Other things are  
Sorry ? 
Yeah , it could be . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah , teletext . 
And other other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , 
Less important . 
Yeah , 
should be there , 
but not press  
Yeah , sub-menu , yeah . 
Yeah , 
in a breath it's  
Charted . 
Yeah , 
but we don't we don't have any costs now , 
so  Yeah . 
Yeah 
e e 
power supply is one of the most important things . 
Yeah , 
I think it's it's not that easy 
because I don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it , 
so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down , the remote shuts down . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
After two minutes , 
yeah two three minutes , yeah . 
Yeah . 
And then b that uh 
before an hour when its get again gets empty . 
Then you have plenty of time to recharge it , 
of put it in a recharger . Charger . 
Yeah , 
if it's  . 
Uh . 
Yeah , 
because when you're watching T_V_ , you're zapping and you have to put it in a recharger , 
and I don't think it  
Yeah , 
okay , 
but then we have to be sure that the the the the batteries go <other> hours , six hours , five , six hours , then . 
Yeah , 
then you have a problem . 
Or we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when they're recharged . 
So . 
Yeah 
because you have b 
but you have L_C_D_ screen . 
High power usage . 
Yes . 
True . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
True . 
Yeah , 
you made a point there . 
Yeah , 
otherwise all your  yeah . 
Just a small device <other> . 
Plug it in , that's it . 
Yeah , 
like a  like telephone charger or something . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
It has to be easy to use also , or things . Uh market share , speaker re speech recognition . 
I think . 
Also . 
Well 
I think that this should be standard . Large button  large buttons . 
Yeah ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
 . 
<other> Yeah , 
it says also  
Yeah . 
Twelve . That's an  
also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent . 
But then I I I  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Ninety . Twenty five . 
 channel . 
 <other> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
 twelve . 
Yeah . 
Is this only would you 
would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . It's the only thing it says . 
<other> I think an L_C_D_ screen <other> should be suf sufficient . 
Yeah , 
it says a lot , 
but  
No 
I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen , 
because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five , we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands , 
and fifty five of those people want L_C_D_ screen 
and thirty five want speech recognition . 
So I think it's better to keep it with L_C_D_ screen . 
Yeah , if the costs al allow it . <laugh> 
Nee . 
If it should be done , 
if it could be done , I won't matter . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> True . 
Yeah . True . 
But that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen . 
Because then I think in Chinese is different written , volume is different written than um Swahili or something . 
Ja , well possible . 
Yeah , yeah yeah yeah <other> 
'Kay , 
what else ? 
Yeah , 
we have to keep  Yeah . 
I think it's difficult . 
Every language of dialects  
I think it's very differen difficult . 
Yeah . 
I think it can't be implemented , 
but maybe  
Yeah , 's an option , yes . 
Fifty Euro cents . 
Yeah . 
Mm , yes . 
No , 
but  
Curved ? 
Um . 
I think we should  we could that  
we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub-menus . 
D 
Mainly if you turn the uh remote control on , you have to u you have to see from one till zero , channel and volume . 
And if you want to use teletext screen or audio , then you can press it . 
It should be available 
but not 
not  Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
but s 
Yeah . 
They'd have to be easy to use . 
The sign of it . 
Uh , 
no . 
What else can you do with a television ? 
Uh 
play , pause , doesn't n need to be there . 
Yes , 
so 
this is your presentation . 
We could check the other remote controls with technical functions . 
Which ones were yours ? 
Techni 
Ja ja ja ja ja . Technical functions . Yeah okay . 
Uh I think I go to have volume , mute but I  Yeah  . Very slow . 
Yeah , 
the zoom buttons . 
Yeah , 
b 
wide screen , high screen , different things you have , 
yeah 
different uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah 
it should be available , but then in separate screen settings or something . 
Yeah , 
screen settings , audio settings , teletext settings you have . 
Channel settings . 
So those four , and of course the main . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Like tap screens or something 
or , I dunno . 
Something  
Yeah , 
if uh  
No , 
you don't yu a no you then you don't no ni don't  
then you don't use it . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
So you leave it alone . 
Yeah . 
Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote , an expanded version . 
Yeah . 
Colours . Yeah . 
Yeah , 
then defines itself . 
Because uh how many percent ? 
Eighty percent ? 
Would spend more money if it looks fancy . 
Yeah . <other> 
Rasta colours . 
Yeah , 
see through version . Yeah . 
If you press a button , it turns green . 
Channel settings ? 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . Could be possible . 
Or like uh you have a menu button , you press  
Yeah , 
or otherwise you have a menu button , 
press menu 
then you have uh main uh menu search uh all the all the settings . 
Yeah , no problem . Yep . 
Um , 
I think b 
because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen , 
I think the buttons  
Yeah , 
but but or like you have 
you only have channel button or volume button . 
Those buttons you can you can  
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
th 
No , no normal buttons , yeah . 
Maybe only the on and o on and off button . 
But I don't think  
Mm , 
no . 
No no no , 
because we we discussed that you could charge it , 
otherwise is  it it jumps to stand-by mode automatically . 
Yeah , 
but a T_V_ of course , th that's the  I think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel . 
No . 
Yeah , you tap . 
Touch screen , 
yeah 
then it's turn  turn off , turn on . 
No , 
just the remote . 
A television don't have to be on , 
that one you can <other> press on , 
yeah stand-by , 
then press on remote , 
press on 
and then T_V_ should be available . Or not . 
Separate . 
Yeah , 
but I think the re the remote control , if you press tap the screen , it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button , channel button , and of course of also the on and off button . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> Yeah , if we can afford it . Yeah . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm .
