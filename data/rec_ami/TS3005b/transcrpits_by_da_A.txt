Good morning , again . 
All set ? 
Good . 
Okay . 
Let's see what we can find here . 
Okay . 
A very warm welcome again to everyone . 
Um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting . 
Um and this is what we are going to do . 
The opening , which we are doing now , um and the special note , 
I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary , 
which means I will make uh minutes 
as I did of the previous meeting . 
And uh I also put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder , 
so you can see them 
and review what we have discussed . 
Um if I'm right , there are three presentations , 
I guess each one of you has prepared one ? 
Good . 
And um we will also take a look at new project requirements , um if you haven't heard about them yet . 
And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions 
and we have some more time , forty minutes . 
But I think we will need it . 
Um well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation . 
You can go first , okay . 
Is there an order ? 
I haven't  
And one question , 
uh your name Denni , is it with a 
I_E_  E_I_E_ , okay . 
Thank you . 
Sorry . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
it's a little bug 
it's in the in the smart board . <laugh> 
Okay , 
thank you . 
Yep . 
Please . 
Okay , 
thank you . 
<laugh> 
Okay , 
thank you . 
Um , well 
thank you all , huh . 
<other> I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements ? 
No ? 
Well , 
then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them 
so you can 
all read them . 
Oh , well not in this presentation . Hmm 
Should be in there . 
Well , 
I can tell you them uh from my laptop . 
Um teletext does  has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . 
<other> So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext . 
Uh the remote control should only be used for the television , 
otherwise the project becomes more complex , 
which endangers the time to market , 
and of course would make it more costly , I think . 
Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , 
and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , 
and you talked about that before . 
And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , 
which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . 
So we have to keep that in mind . 
Um well uh 
according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions . 
So , 
who has any idea about what should be on it , and what shouldn't ? 
Yeah . Only be used for television . 
Well 
it says only for television here , huh . 
<laugh> Makes it a lot easier , 
huh ? <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Uh well 
new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , 
and now we have current customers uh of forty plus . 
Mm-hmm . 
So 
we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ? 
And hoping that when we produce a lot it won't be too expensive . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay , so 
L_C_D_ it is ? 
Okay . 
And what else ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah , okay . 
But for now it's L_C_D_ . Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
and maybe you can make something fancy out of an L_C_D_ remote , 
because it's new , as far as I know . <laugh> 
Okay , 
what else does our remote need ? 
Mute button . 
Mm-hmm . Yeah , 
and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
And maybe a low battery indicator ? On the screen . 
<laugh> 
So we are going for the for the recharger . 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
also . 
Okay , well 
I've 
Yeah , 
you have some more 
points . 
<laugh> 
And you said something about speech recognition ? 
Even bigger than for L_C_D_ . <laugh> 
But when you look at the percentages  
Speech recognition scores even higher , huh ? 
Yeah , well , 
maybe because of the cost , 
but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh . 
But would it be useful to imple implement both ? 
On one remote ? 
Or  
Yeah , I dunno . 
So , 
no speech recognition ? 
Or  
 <laugh> 
Yeah , 
and then we have different languages . 
Okay , 
just make a separate remote for each uh  
Okay , 
so we only do this when we have enough money left . 
Okay . Well 
I've written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , uh the digits from one to zero , huh . Um  or from zero to nine . Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator . 
Um we're going to use a docking station and uh probably L_C_D_ 
and if there's enough money , speech recognition . 
And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons 
in general . 
Okay , 
so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu , 
and  
Okay , 
but no more buttons or functions , 
or ? 
Aren't we forgetting something very important ? 
Ping . 
Yeah . 
And a see-through uh 
Okay , well 
that's the 
signal for las final five minutes . 
Um so 
I have uh the things I just read . 
Um then we have uh separate menus for teletext , screen settings , audio settings , 
and what else ? 
Channel settings . 
Okay . 
No , 
we said teletext also a separate menu . 
Okay , 
but we can work that out later , I guess . 
So 
we're having a a general menu with the most used functions , uh teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings , 
and maybe there are options for the remote itself ? Like uh large icons or small icons 
and 
I don't know what else , 
but  
Yeah , 
but on the L_C_D_ , 
huh ? 
Right , yeah , okay . <laugh> 
But we don't need a special  
we don't need a special options menu for the remote itself . 
Okay . 
Well 
maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ , 
because you can't turn it on when the L_C_D_ is off . 
So how do you turn the thing on ? 
There has to be a on button on the remote , 
huh ? 
Tap the thing . Okay . 
And then the television is on also , 
or just the remote ? 
Okay , well  
Yeah . 
So actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote . No buttons at all . 
Okay , well 
that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote . 
Okay , well 
I guess we have to 
postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting , 
because we're running out of time . 
Um 
for now , we're having a lunch break , 
<other> and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work . 
I will uh write uh minutes , if I can create them out of this . 
And uh put them in the the project documents uh folder . 
And here are the individual actions for the for the other roles . 
And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach . 
Luckily as we are . 
Okay , well 
thank you very much , for now , 
and uh have a nice lunch , huh ? <laugh>
