A:  Okay . A very warm welcome again to everyone . Um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting . Um and this is what we are going to do . The opening , which we are doing now , um and the special note , I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary , which means I will make uh minutes as I did of the previous meeting . And uh I also put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder , so you can see them and review what we have discussed . Um if I'm right , there are three presentations , I guess each one of you has prepared one ? Good . And um we will also take a look at new project requirements , um if you haven't heard about them yet . And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time , forty minutes . But I think we will need it . Um well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yes . 
C:  I'll go first . Okay . I'll go first yeah .

D:  E_I_E_ . 
A:  I_E_  E_I_E_ , okay . Thank you . 
B:  <laugh> 


C:  Okay , um I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . It's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those . 
C:  Okay , well , that's my contribution to this meeting , and uh 
B:  Yeah , I've got it there too . <laugh> <laugh> 
D:  <cough> 
B:  Yeah .

B:  <laugh> 
C:  two of these this meeting . So . 


B:  Shall I go uh next ? 
A:  Yep . 
B:  'Kay . 
A:  Please . 
B:  So . 
D:  <laugh> Smoking . 


B:  Well uh , my name's  , and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found . 
B:  And that is my presentation . 
A:  Okay , thank you . 
C:  Okay . <laugh> 


D:  'Kay . Check . <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  You must still have it open . 
D:  Kijke  


D:  'Kay , so . <other> We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just  Yeah , and the users , actually . The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? And then  tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . Okay . 
D:  Next . 
D:  And that is it . 
C:  Okay . <laugh> 
A:  Okay , thank you . 
B:  Oh right . <laugh> 


A:  Um , well thank you all , huh . <other> I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements ? No ? Well , 
B:  <laugh> No . Res I did not . Perhaps the rest ? 
C:  No . 
A:  then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them so you can 
D:  Ja ,  
A:  all read them . Oh , well not in this presentation . Hmm . 
B:  <laugh> Oh . 
A:  Should be in there . Well , I can tell you them uh from my laptop . 


A:  Um teletext does  has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . <other> So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext . Uh the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and of course would make it more costly , I think . Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before . And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . So we have to keep that in mind . 


A:  Um well uh according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Then you have the seventy five percent of users find it r ugly . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  The L_C_D_ ? Oh that's a bit of a problem . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy . 
B:  Oh , that's a bit of a problem . 
C:  Mm . 
D:  Tha i l i it'll look fancy with L_C_D_ screen . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  It's looks fancy one yeah , of L_C_D_ screen . 
B:  Yeah , but they don't they don't like it . They think it's ugly . When it has an L_C_D_ screen . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , just a  the plain remotes , not not specific L_C_D_ remotes . 
B:  Oh , alright , I thought that you said that . 
D:  So  
A:  Yeah , and maybe you can make something fancy out of an L_C_D_ remote , because it's new , as far as I know . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Yeah , of course . 
C:  Mm yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  And then you have the other thing , that seventy five percent zap a lot , but that's not a f question with the L_C_D_ screen . Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it . 
C:  And then not  yeah . Um . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm . Okay ? 
A:  Okay , well I've 
D:  It has to be easy to use also , or things . Uh market share , speaker re speech recognition . 
A:  Yeah , you have some more 
B:  <other> 
A:  points . 
D:  I think . 
A:  Okay . Well I've written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , uh the digits from one to zero , huh . Um  or from zero to nine . Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator . Um we're going to use a docking station and uh probably L_C_D_ and if there's enough money , speech recognition . And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> Mm . 
D:  Mm , yes . 
B:  Five minutes ? 
A:  signal for las final five minutes . Um so I have uh the things I just read . Um then we have uh separate menus for teletext , screen settings , audio settings , and what else ? 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Channel settings ? 
B:  Oh yeah , right . So you can program the T_V_ . 
A:  Channel settings . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Mm . 


A:  Okay , well I guess we have to 
B:  it . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah , if we can afford it . Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Oh , okay  
A:  postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting , because we're running out of time . Um for now , we're having a lunch break , 
C:  Oh . 
A:  <other> and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work . I will uh write uh minutes , if I can create them out of this . And uh put them in the the project documents uh folder . And here are the individual actions for the for the other roles . And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Mm . 
B:  Alright . 
A:  Luckily as we are . Okay , well thank you very much , for now , and uh have a nice lunch , huh ? <laugh>
