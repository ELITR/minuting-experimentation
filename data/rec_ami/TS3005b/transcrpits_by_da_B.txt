Yeah . <laugh> 
Choose a number ? <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yes . 
Well . 
Well <other> 
everybody already has his presentation , 
<laugh> so you can adjust it . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh right . 
<laugh> 
There is something turning . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
I've got it there too . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Shall I go uh next ? 
'Kay . 
So . 
Well uh , 
my name's  , 
and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . 
Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found . 
Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , 
how you uh d 
what you described uh just early . 
And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , 
turn it on , 
turn it off , 
uh change the channel , 
adjust volume , that kind of thing . 
Uh play video , teletext , 
but also t uh play C_D_ 
if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . 
There are some uh examples of remote controls . 
You can see they are very different . 
The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . 
And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . 
And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , 
but uh the the essential stuff is there . 
Um <other> I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , 
because the customers have to use them 
and 
and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it . 
A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that . 
Uh , well 
perf 
personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . 
But uh keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier , 
split screen and uh is that a function that you should have ? 
Because all the T_V_s will have them . 
Or because of only a few and isn't really necessary . 
And then uh make it  I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . 
If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , 
because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . 
The shu c 
you could reuse the buttons 
so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . 
And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . 
And that is my presentation . 
You must still have it open . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> <laugh> 
Oh right . <laugh> 
<laugh> No . Res I did not . 
Perhaps the rest ? 
<laugh> 
Oh . Mm . 
Well 
you said it should only uh work with one appliance ? 
Or with one uh d che only the T_V_ ? 
And the video also , or not uh ? <laugh> 
Oh . Alright . Okay . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Then it should have uh on , off , 
and uh  
Yeah . 
And per perhaps uh  
No . 
Well uh uh 
yes yes s sh 
A button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers . 
Can you  <laugh> 
Don't know if that's got a name , 
but  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
S 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
so you should have that one on . 
Mute misschien also . 
An 
<laugh> 
But , 
do you  
But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ? 
Or because if it only directs at the T_V_ , then you only have uh I don't know what you want to do with the L_C_D_ screen . 
Yeah ? 
Oh right , 
so you can  
Oh , yeah alright . 
So 
you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen . 
Yeah alright , oh right . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Would be yeah . 
<laugh> 
Well 
we had twelve fifty , I guess , for uh production ? 
Any guesses ? <laugh> 
Yeah . 
But  
But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , 
but also on the older , 
and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ? 
Oh , 
so still a little bit people  
Yeah that's right . 
But you don't want to alienate the other uh  
But if they also buy it then it's alright . I guess . 
Yeah . Alright . 
An 
Yes . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
But perhaps later , 
so uh  
Yeah . 
I don't  
Well 
perhaps we should have a backup plan 
that we would use buttons if it's uh <laugh> too expensive . 
Yeah . 
The L_C_D_ ? 
Oh that's a bit of a problem . <laugh> 
Oh , that's a bit of a problem . 
Yeah , 
but they don't they don't like it . 
They think it's ugly . When it has an L_C_D_ screen . 
Oh , alright , 
I thought that you said that . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
A mute button . 
I think . 
And  
Yeah . 
But  
But shouldn't you put a button of  for teletext on the  for the people who want to use it ? 
Remembering we have got a big remote that you have to fill . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
they are less important , 
but I think they should be there , 
or not ? 
Like with a with a mouse , you have not , yeah . 
We should think of the twelve fifty we have 
but  
I don't know how much that's going to uh  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
You should  
Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off . 
If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno . 
You shouldn't on and off 
because that's ver extra , that you have t first you have to turn the remote on , 
and then you can uh  
I don't know . 
Nee that's that's 
uh yeah . 
But then you can't  
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah 
au 
automac matically , 
that it  yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> <cough> 
<laugh> 
If it's sensible . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
b when the batteries are low  
But you'll also forget to put it in , 
because you throw it on the couch 
and you don't remember . 
Yeah . That's right . 
Yeah . 
Well 
I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days , 
or not ? 
'Cause  
Yeah , that's right , 
but  
Yeah . 
Right . <laugh> 
<laugh> But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch 
because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_ . 
Yeah . 
I think everything has it for and  I guess . 
Yeah . 
Alright . 
<other> 
<laugh> Yeah , 
twelve fifty , twelve fifty . <laugh> 
So it's pretty big . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> W 
I know let's do a speech . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
You can clap or something . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Now you shouldn't say the wrong thing , I dunno <laugh> . 
But they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something , 
or ? <laugh> 
Oh , 
but do we want to implement that , 
or ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
I know <laugh> 
Mm . 
Well  
I don't know if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty . 
With that uh  
Yeah , 
but how would you like to implement that , 
that you say volume up , and then it goes up , 
or ? 
Uh . 
Then you also have to have different languages if we go international . 
Then uh it's y <laugh> it's yours to do a French and Dutch and English 
Yeah , that's right . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
you can use icons 
for the 
a speaker and uh  
But if that's better than language for the for the remote . 
Then it's  Yeah . 
Well , 
if it could be done , we  
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
that should be uh anything matters . 
Well , 
you sh you should to adjust the thing . 
Yeah . 
And you have to speak the  
so that it can understand . 
<laugh> You could use that n as an option , if you have money left , or something . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Let's do speech . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
I <other> 
With uh teletext if  it wasn't ver very important , 
it was but  
You also now have colours . 
I don't know if we should implement that . 
Yeah , 
when you press the red button , you go to page one hundred two , 
and when you press the  
I don't know if we should implement that , 
because it says that teletext not really important , 
but yeah , the shortcut , 
and you can't go to sport . 
Yeah . 
'Cause it should be there . 
So actually it is there but it's just not r ready there . 
You'll have to search for it . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
that's a  
I guess not . 
We've got anon 
Have got got two examples here , 
but I don't think there's anything we're missing . 
Well , 
we don't have the video orders <laugh> 
Yeah , 
you could look here 
all the the  
Uh 
th th th th 
I don't know , 
technical functions . 
<laugh> They're a bit small , you can  we should stretch them , 
because <laugh>  
I guess we've got them all . 
And for a T_V_ ? Can you zoom in a T_V_ ? 
Or that you can put 'em on uh on on wide and  
yeah . 
But that should also be a sub then , a sub uh menu thing . 
Yeah , 
so we should also implement se screen settings . 
Oh right . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
so you can program the  
Yeah , 
so the first you see the main , 
and the other ones you can uh go to uh  
Yeah . 
<laugh> I hope we can do this . <laugh> 
We don't have to use that top . Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
And do we want them in different colours , 
or  <laugh> 
And 
and the buttons , should they have colours ? 
Oh 
but we don't have any buttons . 
Yeah . 
They think it's ugly , 
right ? 
Perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones <laugh> . 
You can uh  <laugh> But I don't think that uh  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah . 
A disco version . 
Five minutes ? 
Oh yeah , right . 
So you can program the T_V_ . 
Perhaps you should you'd throw them on on in one pile . 
So , options , and then you sub them . 
Otherwise you have all those teletext , perhaps teletext not , 
but  
Yeah , 
but I  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But  
I don't know . 
Or do we have any buttons ? On the remote . 
Which one ? 
But that's also in the L_C_D_ , 
right ? 
So we don't have any normal buttons 
that uh  
No , alright . 
Yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno 
No , no . 
Oh well , 
you should be able to set which T_V_ you have . 
If you have  if you have uh  
Yeah . 
But isn't idea to use uh uh what you said , uh normal on and off button for the T_V_ , 
that you don't have to use a  
Yeah 
but 
but not for the remote but for the T_V_ , 
that you use  
But a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ , 
yeah . 
No 
you just tap I think . 
But  
Yeah a yeah . 
I don't know whether it's handy to have a n a normal on button , a r just uh rubber uh for for T_V_ , 
so you can turn it on 
and then you can choose the channel . 
Otherwise you  I don't know whether or not that's  
Yeah , yeah . 
To turn it on . 
Of 
or you should put it in the L_C_D_ screen . 
Yeah , 
I have , 
yeah . 
Well 
I 
I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , 
then you uh you you 
then turn it , 
and then the T_V_ goes on . 
But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , 
and then you search the channel which you want . 
Oh right . 
Yeah , I think so too . 
Otherwise y wet e k Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> If we can afford it . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Alright . 
<laugh> 
Lunch . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Should we put this back in our rooms , 
or uh ? 
Yeah .
