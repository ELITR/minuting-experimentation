<other> 
W 
sure . 
 <other> Okay 
uh welcome you all . 
Components design , 
um <other> uh first of all uh I would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things I uh uh  elaborate some of the things I did . 
I I elaborated on the concept . 
What should be um 
uh said about uh the components , uh its properties 
and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls . 
Uh well 
first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um <other> you know from what uh the remote control's formed . 
Uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . 
<other> I would like to uh give you an idea of uh how I thought about . 
<laugh> Giraffe's gone now . 
Okay um 
the case was is made from rubber , I suppose . 
There's one of the  
because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control 
and they break uh 
becau 
the uh titanium was also an option . 
But uh it's a very expensive material . 
Uh rubber is , I think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh 
for our remote control . 
Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber . 
Uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to  it lets lets itself colour . 
Uh titanium uh you have to paint it 
and with that uh it's possible to scratch it 
or uh yeah make it ugly . 
Uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that's sor uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour , 
so if you scratch it it's still the same colour , 
perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged . 
But it's a very strong material . 
Um <other> I h I had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved . 
Uh so 
it's t two dimensional . 
I think it's uh it's best to draw 
oh 
green . 
Uh  
New . Blank . 
Okay . 
Let's make it uh black . 
Okay . 
I thought of an idea like this . 
Oh  that . 
<laugh> Um delete . 
Blank . 
Okay . 
So it also looks nice when it's on your table . 
So you get 
uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table , 
but it's c it's stands . 
Side view yes it's side view 
so uh 
I I'm not technically good at th three D_ modelling , 
but . 
Um uh it's just an idea I had 
so it's uh it's very uh 
so its also looks nice when it's on the table . 
Um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already . 
Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen , 
which is uh is easy to clean too . 
One of the great uh advantages of the L_C_D_ screen you just use some  or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff . 
And um it should be made of strong plastic 
and it should be bright . 
Well 
I already uh s uh explained some properties of that material 
and I think 
uh well 
we also we almost concluded about that 
uh this should uh be uh our uh button component . 
So uh 
uh that's all about uh the buttons . 
Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , 
uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station 
so you can uh put the uh <other> the remote control in a mount station 
so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that . 
Questions ,  ? 
And they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . 
And next step is the chip 
uh th the component that's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television . 
Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip 
but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it 
with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition 
uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase , 
so uh 
there should be some more uh investigation on that side . 
Uh my personal preferences uh 
I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours . 
That was correct , wasn't it ? 
Okay . 
I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber . 
Okay 
they should be m sh they should be in mind , 
wasn't it ? 
Okay 
so it d it doesn't says uh to uh have the slogan ? 
Okay okay . 
Well 
that's possible of course . 
We could make a little R_ and R_  on the top of the machine . 
Uh so 
they are <other> pretty boring , 
I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls 
which peopl uh who people 
in 
which people will find they're uh interesting . 
And uh will buy uh <other> them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours . 
Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely 
imp instead of uh 
of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , 
but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium . 
And I personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control , 
because it yeah it makes sense . 
<laugh> Okay . Well 
that's all about my uh my findings . 
 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
<other> <other> 
Oh my God . <laugh> <laugh> 
Not just a P_ . 
.. .  
 
<laugh> 
Ah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yep . 
Oh okay , 
yeah . 
Oh yeah ,  . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
Go Danny , go Danny . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Fruity ? <laugh> 
Fruity . <other> 
Mm . Okay . 
<laugh>  <laugh> 
 
Mm . 
Okay . 
Changing just the shape of the uh remote control ? 
Yeah , 
s 
round corners , but s but square , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah I know what you mean , 
kind of like a  . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Kinda like a beer glass . <laugh> Yeah . 
I know what you mean . 
It's also easy to to have <other> to to put in your hand . 
Yeah . 
Will recognise that's as a remote control . 
Uh when I saw your d 
Oh . 
Huh . 
Yeah , 
kinda like old cars , uh  
<laugh> 
<laugh> Let's put it all together . 
 
Uh . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Soft rubber . 
 
Yeah I know what you  Um . 
It should shouldn't be  . 
Uh . 
Spongy . 
Yeah . 
Ding ding . 
Um I also s uh can't help but notice <laugh> that you uh used an  you had a remote control  
and the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small . Um . 
.. . 
This was your size , 
but I think it should be larger . 
Yeah , three quarters . 
So uh so you don't have to put your  <other> oh . 
Uh new , blank . 
So uh 
when you get <other> this uh  
Uh kinda like this . 
Or should it be larger ? 
Larger ? 
Because you want to put your hands  
You want 
Yeah . 
Your thumb here . 
Yeah . 
Because when you put your f 
Yeah 
but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll <other> you'll always get some  
You  
Yeah . 
Going to be very greasy and stuff . 
Yeah you don't want it too small . 
How yeah how large  
<laugh> Yeah they have thick fingers  . 
But if you wanna make it in international , 
Japanese uh people got uh rather small hands 
and we got these large  <other> 
Zoom opt Ah yeah of course , 
yeah . 
You can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button . 
Your fingers , yeah . 
You don't want uh  
Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use  
 
Yeah  
You can do  whatever uh any uh cloth . 
Sure . 
The docking station . 
W <other> 
Yeah . 
I kinda like your  
Yeah 
you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice ? Mouse . Computer mouse . 
Kinda like those kind of batteries . 
Yeah . 
The chip on print ? Um  
Uh you gotta f 
Yeah . 
I think so . 
Chip on print with a with a <other> simple uh a sim not a simple but a  
We also discussed that . 
Didn't we ? <other> 
Uh  
Beg your pardon ? 
Yeah sure , of course , yeah . 
 Well uh 
chip on print , I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got , uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button . 
But when you got a L_C_D_ screen , with no uh with not <other>  the buttons are not always on the same place , 
for example if you enlarge a button , or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen , uh the co-ordinations aren't always the same . 
When you got a regular button , th the button of stand-by is always on the same place 
and you got on the and on the  
Yeah . 
 I suppose so . 
It is a simple C_P_U_ 
but it doesn't  
Yeah 
because it has to uh b 
Yeah 
but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume . 
So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_ 
to know uh in which state you are 
and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment . 
Yeah . 
And a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen . 
And the case , yeah we already discussed the case , 
we wanted to make it from rubber 
and uh  
Uh hard rubber I think . 
That's the easy to ha uh to to uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah sure , 
look <other> . 
D 
It's our main target . 
 
Well 
and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ? 
So i 
Because it's a gadget 
and you want to show it off , of course . 
Uh . 
Because it 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
It's a lot easier . 
So , so 
you got uh  
Did you write that down ? 
Uh got a single curved uh rubber 
f uh fancy coloured <laugh> remote control . <other> 
Yeah . 
Sorry ? <laugh> 
Depends on the screen . 
If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . 
If you make it uh in a rectangle  
I so it's it's it's it's  
Square . 
 
 Oh , okay . 
 
Uh .  
Take your time . <laugh> 
 
W 
We'll leave that to the usability engineering then . <laugh> 
 <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Consistency . 
Yeah . 
So not how much  n not how often it's used , but  
Uh . 
 
Yeah 
it does it doesn't really matter , 
but  
Uh . 
 
Okay , um . 
Let's cut to the chase . <laugh> 
Okay , well 
le 
Yeah . Interface , yeah . 
Technologies , uh . 
Yeah . 
Makes it possible to  
Mm . 
 Not even necessary , 
because a lotta  
you can make a very sensitive microphone , 
so it makes it possible to uh <other> just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote . 
Yeah . 
Right . 
But that's not import I think that's not im very important 
because yeah , it doesn't matter where the microphone is . 
Ah okay , sure , okay , 
well 
tha 
Underneath ? 
 Indeed . It shouldn't be uh very uh visible . 
Yeah sure , why no 
Yeah 
but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh  
Uh . 
Yeah , okay . 
 
Okay . Well put it there . I don't mind . <laugh> 
That doesn't doesn't really matter . 
Okay . So ? 
<other> Interface type . 
The L_C_D_ yeah , 
uh supplements well the supplement is to  
yeah . 
 
Hey , 
 . <laugh> 
Use the scroll . 
Yeah I think so too . 
So why not , on on side . 
Fast , 
yeah . 
So 
if you've got a settings , if you  
Yes . <other> 
You have a lot of options , 
because when you use  
Yeah 
you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . 
So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down , 
you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or . 
Just put it on the side and it's very easy to use . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay , 
what's the standard colour ? 
I I 
You got you got different colours , 
but you should have a standard colour . 
Black ? 
With the with the yellow uh  <laugh> 
Just a regular uh remote colour . 
And then have uh different covers uh to use . 
Silver , yeah . 
You see a lot of t uh silver televisions . 
Yeah 
y I think it's better to  
Yeah th yeah . That's right . 
But if you use uh silver , uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy . 
When you use titanium , silver is fancy , 
but when you use silver rubber , it isn't fancy . 
Silver has to shine , 
and rubber doesn't shine . 
Especially when it's made of soft rubber like this . 
You understand ? <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Fruity . 
Fruity loops . 
Okay . 
You ping . <laugh> 
Well 
not what to do . Not what to do . 
Okay . 
Thin I think we should work <other> . 
Thank you very much .
