Mm . Alright . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> It's a colour . <laugh> 
 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
No . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
You can put the R_ and R_ . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Alright . 
I will go next . 
 
Alright so 
I thought a little bit about the interface . Uh how it should look . 
And uh <other> uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen , 
so I had to uh look on that . 
And the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of . 
Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . 
And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device 
and it answers you . 
And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker . 
And so that it you say uh good morning , uh coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning Joe or what's your name . 
This uh and there's an easy way to uh program that 
uh you say record into the device into the speaker 
and then you say the question 
and three seconds later you say the answer 
and then when you say the question it gives you the answer . 
Um perhaps it's useful , 
perhaps for because people um lose the remote , 
they can yell uh remote where are you and  calls or something . 
And perhaps we could uh implement that . 
And then I have to go out of the presentation 
because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like 
but I can't draw , 
so uh 
don't <laugh> make too much of it <laugh> . 
I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw  . 
I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume . 
I don't know if there is an icon for the program , 
but 
yeah . 
So uh 
and then the buttons above and uh below 
the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . 
Um . 
I forgot that one . 
<laugh> I thought I forgot something , 
but uh <laugh> . 
And uh and uh the numbers , 
that should be a bit larger 
I think it's not really on scale and and so forth . 
Um an options button . 
And I thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart 
because it's not really options , I think . 
It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing . 
So could call it settings or something . 
But this is a bit uh how I thought it . 
And uh the L_C_D_ uh somewhere on the remote . 
Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , 
so that it's better in your hand or something uh . 
But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that . 
Uh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do 
and that you could do with something like this this . 
And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings . 
And older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus . 
So they want to u use one button and then something happens , 
and not choose with uh this kind of uh  
And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote , 
so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things . 
That's an option . 
And that was my uh finding 
dinge . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Grass green . 
<laugh> Let's build it into a sponge . 
It was one remote , I think , 
different colours . 
 
You could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea . 
I don't know which shape you should should take , 
but . 
Yeah . 
Perhaps you could find something in the middle . 
Round but square . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Uh i i if you do it uh uh square , with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh 
i 
Do you know what I mean ? 
 wait , 
like <laugh> like this <laugh> uh a bit . 
So it's a bit square , but it's also a bit uh round . 
So 
but then  
Same sides . <laugh> 
But that's uh  
Yeah 
but that's also how other remotes are shaped , 
so that's uh  
But perhaps that's a good thing , 
so that's easy to use . 
People know the  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Swords . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
But that's easily to do with the colour , I think . 
That's easy to do with the colours , I think . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
think uh  
Also in between . <laugh> 
I don't think you should be able to mould it , 
but <laugh>  
Yeah . 
Bit like this kind of rubber . 
This uh  
But it's quite hard , this . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> I don't think it's rubber . 
Uh did you have something about uh  
So we should first decide about shape , I think . 
Which uh  
Then you can fit the L_C_D_ screen in it , 
and can decide uh . 
<laugh> 
Yeah 
it it's supposed to be bit s bit s bit 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Ooh <laugh> 
Yeah . 
But if you pu 
Now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen . 
Perhaps that's best . 
<laugh> But not on the screen because <laugh>  
Yeah 
that's uh that's an idea . 
Looks a bit like a Game Boy now . <laugh> 
You always touch it , 
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Y you could include a pen 
Yeah o yeah  , if they think it's handy to use a pen . 
Yeah 
I think this uh this is a good size for the screen . 
I don't know how how large the actual remote should be 
but a little bit like this , or something . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
I think energy were batteries 
and then uh and uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Just like with the telephone . 
<other> but it should be th I think normal batteries , 
not not like two or two uh  
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Um what was with the chip on print ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<other> 
 
It's rubber . 
Yeah 
but but a hard rubber like this ? 
Or softer rubber 
or  
Yeah . 
It bounces back from the floor where you <laugh> throw it . 
<laugh> Yeah yeah 
this in different colours ? 
Yeah it's a bit . 
But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps . 
Yeah . I think so too . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that's a good idea . 
Yeah , 
alright . 
And then  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , you can uh  
It's pretty easy 
but  
And  
Yeah , 
I had what I just uh 
I should  again . 
I miss a few buttons , 
but . 
Well . 
At least uh <other>  
what we should also have on , I just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh 
 if if you touch options , you can't go back to this uh right away now . 
This   
I don't know . 
I think it's  
I don't know . 
I I thought it was uh easier to handle this way , 
but I don't know what they think . 
Would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical ? 
Th 
Right well 
if we make it like this , I think if you 
put it like this  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But I think I wou 
I think that's a matter of what you're used to . 
I think I would put a plus and a min uh here . 
And then the P_ in the mid in the middle 
and the sound uh in the middle . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Almost . <laugh> 
Yeah 
but I think when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus . 
Yeah 
but I think  
Yeah 
I don't know . 
<other> Perhaps I have some examples . 
I don't know  
That's me . 
But I'm going to look if I've got some examples 
'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used . 
The  
'Cause they can use that better . 
Yeah . 
I  Here is our  here are uh 
I don't really know . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah 
but   But I mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote . 
W what's what's usual or normal . 
Yes 
I'm looking here . 
But here's it's below , 
here also , 
and now here's here's next to each other . 
I think it's  it's a  
Yeah . 
I think the the the volume was usually uh above each other , 
because you go higher and down . 
And the the pay the the 
the program is next to each other , 
because you would go further and back . 
That's how it's is usually  when I look here 
that's what I see . 
<laugh> 
I don't know . 
Yeah . 
This concept is in the actual design , 
but you should know where you would place a  
And the speech uh shall we implement that ? 
Or uh  
Yeah . 
But then you should also find a place  
You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . 
You can talk into the corner . 
Yeah . 
But  
Yeah , that's also  . 
So , 
in the middle or something . 
 but you should uh decide where you want to put it . 
Right ? <laugh> 
You could p you could put it in a logo of the company . <laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
So 
where do you want to put it ? 
Yeah 
actually it does <other> 
because it you can you can find it better if you use it . 
It's a way for you to uh  
So it makes more sense 
just 'cause other remotes don't have that . 
About a microphone , 
there is no button . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Alright . 
Any more uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Um yeah . Yeah 
the the young people do like uh scroll uh 
Or at least  
Yeah 
I don't know if it's really the scroll , 
but the menu  they like most , 
and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh  
But you have  it's f uh 
we have five or four or something . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
It's also different . <laugh> 
You should you should have a black one 
because uh I think black is standard . 
But if you want to be different , then uh  
Silver . 
Silver rubber . <laugh> 
<laugh> But 
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Just all kind of colour . 
Yeah . 
And and do we have to have a normal black one , or uh  
Is it  
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Well 
I don't know what to do , 
but . <laugh> 
Ooh . <laugh> 
Right . 
Yeah . 
But do we have to  
We'll work together , 
but do we have to stay here , 
or do we  
Right . 
Yes . Okay . <laugh> 
Yeah 
I think  . 
No . 
Yeah . 
So 
we have to keep talking English now ? <laugh>
