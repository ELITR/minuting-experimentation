'Kay . 
<laugh> 
Don't destroy my giraffe . 
<laugh> 
Drop it . 
<laugh> Bright colour . Fancy colour . Forward . 
You have to go t 
Oh 
it's a side view . 
<laugh> 
True . 
No no no no no . 
Just looking . 
Mm mm mm . Next . 
It's true . 
P_ 
yeah , just a P_ . 
<cough> 
Where's where's the button for two  ? 
Okay . 
Doesn't matter . 
No . 
<other> Okay . <other> 
<other> 
Okay , 
I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff . 
'Kay . 
The method I used was  
Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted uh from elderly and young people . 
So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . 
Findings I made . 
The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy . 
The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , 
okay , 
like the L_C_D_ screen that's <other> quite innovative 
so that should be great meeting for this . 
And the third thing is it should be easy to use . 
I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use . 
The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff . 
Yeah . Like that . 
The round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber . 
It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things . 
Th 
Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . 
They liked square shapes with round edges . 
And hard materials like wood , um titanium . 
They 
those kind of materials they liked . 
This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff . 
And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like 
this or something . 
It's it's a bit like a banana . 
And the colour should be yellow , or something . 
And for the elderly people just plain old . 
Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs , 
or was it two colours ? 
Different colours , yeah . 
We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . 
I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares . 
Simple but 
easy to use . 
<other> So that's it . 
That is my  
Yeah , 
like the older o older colours I can maybe  
Yeah . 
<other> Colours th the elderly people  
Uh  Look something like that  . Autumn colours like red , brown . 
They liked the wood a lot . 
So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour . 
And a bit bit old school style renaissance , medieval kind of things . 
Those kind of  
Yeah , those kind of things . 
So you see the big difference 
between the young people ? Fresh , exciting . 
And the old people , old and boring . 
So  
Sorry ? 
Yeah 
I think it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape . 
Because otherwise we have to  get different shapes , 
and colour  way easier than yeah the shapes . 
In material yeah rubber , rubber is , 
like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones 
and the old people like <other> plain wood . 
So we have to decide if we're going to use 
real hard rubber , or soft rubber . Or something something between that . 
Yeah  soft rubber 
which you can you can feel in it . 
Or  
No . 
Or or wh 
what's something harder . 
No no no 
but but you have to 
like like like a a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in , 
or something harder . 
Yeah , something like this , yeah . 
Yeah it's quite hard 
but you can press it in . 
It's feels kind s spongy . 
Something . <other> 
No . 
N n n 
<other> Are you going to invite Sponge Bob , maybe he can  
<other> Yeah I think that's the better thing to do . <other> 
 
Yeah 
w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like  
Yeah 
three quarter of the of the  
Yeah 
the buttons won't get that small when the L_C_D_ screen is  
 
Mm-hmm . 
Larger I think . 
Yeah 
becau because you have  
Yeah okay , true , true , true true . 
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
But it won't get that small 
because you have how much ? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen . 
One to zero , the two digit ,  
You have to you have to  
Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time . 
Yeah true , 
but  
Yeah , 
we have we have the zoom option , 
right ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
No . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Use a pen You you c 
you can lose the pen . 
Yeah  the fingers , yeah . 
Yeah 
but that that can be  with plain soft tissue . 
Yeah , 
you can buy those at  
<other> 
Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries 
which you can recharge through the docking station . 
So 
if the badg the batteries are dead 
then you can re you can uh change them . 
Yeah yeah yeah 
like those . 
Yep . 
<other> 
Yeah , normal plain 
you  
No 
normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah . 
Print plate . 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
You always have a print plate . 
You always have a print plate , 
right ? 
Always , 
so  
I dunno what w what we have to decide about that . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , okay . 
But  
Yeah okay , 
but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate , 
so that that's not of any discussion , I think . 
Mm , I don't I dunno I don't think that's  
Yeah yeah okay 
but I d I I don't know if nor o s it's quite a simple L_C_D_ . 
Yeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen . 
I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ . 
Yeah , okay , true true . True . 
Yeah . 
We have different colours . 
So 
the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ? 
No I don't think , 
I think it's more round than square . <other> 
So it meets 
I think it meets more the young people than the older people . 
Yeah , that's our target . Yeah . 
Lower than forty years , I think 
it was . 
Oh yeah 
that that <other> I think  
I thought that was a quite good 
Yeah . 
You can put it on your table with the L_C_D_ screen , 
you don't have to put it  get it in your hand , 
you can put it next to you 
and then dive it in 
and  . Yeah . 
So  
You can't you You can't 
oh , 
you c you can draw it on your paper 
and then load it on the 
And load it on the the user the server . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , 
you have to go back . 
Yeah uh uh . 
Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ? 
With the minus and the plus . 
I think it's easier than  
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
For sound and channel . 
Yeah . 
I think it's it's easier to have it something like  Oh a button uh minus here , plus over here . A minus here , plus over here . 
And on here . 
The other buttons and on here <other> the top . 
The options and then you have something like uh the P_ over here , 
and the sound . 
Something uh  
Something like  
<other> Sh 
Plus minus plus uh <other> 
minus . 
Yeah 
I think you're going to s you're going to use it with one thumb . 
Who's the usability engineering ? 
She is .  
<laugh> Oh . 
Um  
Oh   
I have that those s numbers . 
Or a good watch . 
B 
Channel selection . Per hour one hundred and sixty eight . 
Volume selection four times an hour 
Uh  
Yeah , 
that depends on on on the remote . 
I think  
because I have two televisions at home . 
One is horizontal , 
one is vertical , 
so it depends . 
Yeah . Depends . 
Yeah , lower . 
True . 
<laugh> It's got to change . 
Yeah is it is user interface . 
Component . 
Yeah 
I think it's it's easy for that , 
where are you , but then it says I'm here . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , a microphone , yeah . 
 
Um I think where it isn't seen 
the most . 
Inside . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
I i 
between the round of the R_ . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
bu but  
I think the left s under corner should be the best . 
Where isn't  i it isn't most in sight . 
I think . 
No . Actually doesn't . 
 I think  I thought the , like you said , like scroll <other> next to the remote isn't that handy . 
I think it's better to just  up what you'd like to do on the screen . 
If you want to go back you have to back button go back , 
if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu . 
Yeah ? You do like it ? 
Yeah I think it is is faster . 
Becau 
I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options , 
but if you don't have a lot of option then  
Y 
Uh-huh . 
Yeah , okay , true . 
Okay . 
 Okay , no problem . 
Okay . 
Um . No , 
colours are clear , 
shape is clear , 
material is clear . 
And a standard , 
yeah 
we don't  
no 
we have different colour . 
How many colours are we going to  
Black . Yeah , black I think is is the standard . 
Dark grey , something like this this colour or something . 
Yeah like like yeah . 
Or or silver . 
I think it's better to have silver nowadays . 
I think you see more silver than black . 
Yeah the the silver black are our main colours . Yeah . 
I think we have silver , black 
and between those <other> is like I dunno s five colours between them or something . 
Yeah yeah yeah 
it'll be a banana yellow , we have . 
R red . 
Green , wood , brown . 
Yeah . 
True . 
Yeah , I understand . 
Yeah o of course . 
The fruity colours and the autumn colours , like red and brown ,  dark red and brown . 
No  . 
S 
tough . 
We'll be available . 
No . 
Finished .
