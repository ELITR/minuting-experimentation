Okay , 
welcome everyone to our next meeting . 
I'm busy writing 
and busy leading the meeting , 
but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda 
I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side . 
Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened . 
Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes 
which I just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder , 
which was quite some typing . 
Um today we once again have uh three presentations , if I'm right , 
and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . 
And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that . 
Okay , well 
I'd say let's start with the first presentation . 
Um in the same order as last time ? 
Okay . 
Well , 
take it away . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well , 
business colours I thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image , 
so yeah , it needs colour , 
but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour . <other> 
It must be recognisable . 
Okay , 
thank you . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Thanks . 
Now our third 
team member with his presentation . 
Oh 
y <other> 
So for the older people , a more traditional uh form . 
Yeah , 
I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh 
the shape of it . 
 
But maybe then both groups won't buy it . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah we think so too . 
Hmm . 
So we need a spongy feeling . <other> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
And we won't include a a pen , or something to point , 
hey , 
we we want to do it with our fingers , 
right ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
but I think people want to use a remote with with their fingers 
because th they're used to that 
and  
And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh . <laugh> 
Okay well 
maybe , if I can interrupt you , 
maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision . 
So we can discuss these points . 
 those points um energy question mark . 
How how should we uh supply the thing with energy 
and how  
are we going to do it with separate docking station 
and then put  in it . 
Uh chip on print and case . 
Those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here , 
but I hope you have ideas about them . 
Yeah . 
So that's the the the first point . 
We already decided that on the previous meeting . 
Mm-hmm . 
Simple rechargeable uh batteries . 
Yeah 
but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ? 
You still have a print plate . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah well 
it's a good question . 
<laugh> It just was in there 
and I didn't have any information about it , 
but  
Mm-hmm . 
Well 
you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess . 
Mm-hmm . <other> 
Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But that's what we want ,  . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah yeah 
you have a fancy design , then , right away . 
So  
Okay so  
Yeah 
but I wrote it down . <laugh> 
What about the user interface , 
there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think 
you have some ideas on that  . 
You you showed your drawing . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Everybody's searching in his data . 
Yeah well 
I think we have we don't have to decide about that now 
how 
where we will put the buttons 
just the 
concepts . 
Yeah well 
we just heard about the new uh technology , huh ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah 
maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh 
over there . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well 
maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out 
because I think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it , 
because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote , huh , the the speech control . 
Well 
maybe where the one hand  
But are we talking about the button , or about the microphone ? 
Yeah 
because a microphone is very small thing , 
but you can make it look like it's big 
so as its its really an important function of the remote . 
<laugh> 
So well uh 
type , supplements , 
anything . 
Yeah , well 
we already s discussed that , huh , the the L_C_D_ 
and  
Mm-hmm . 
And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side 
which you can touch 
and  
Yeah . 
Okay . Well 
there's our five minutes uh warning . 
Um any more uh questions about about the design or the user interface or different components , everyone ? 
Everybody think they can can 
work for that ? 
Is there a standard colour ? 
Yeah . 
But still silver and black are  
well 
silver is new but also traditional , 
so uh  
Yeah 
w what about a yellow thing , 
I mean it 
could be ugly , 
but it's definitely fancy . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah 
I would think about colours like uh red , yellow , green , blue , 
just  
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Maroon . 
Yeah . 
Okay , so  
Who's pinging ? 
You are pingin 
Okay . 
<laugh> I thought we 
Okay , so 
uh that wraps it up ? 
Everybody knows uh what to do ? 
Well 
I wrote it down here . I wrote it down here what to do um . 
The next meeting is once again in thirty minutes . 
Um here are the individual actions , 
and especially notice that uh the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board , 
and of course to all four of us uh specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach . 
Well 
I I'd say just wait uh for email and uh find out . 
I don't know . <laugh> 
Okay well 
that was what I had to say , uh , 
final thoughts from anyone , 
or ? 
We're finished . 
Okay , well 
thank you very much .
