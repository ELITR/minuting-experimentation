A:  welcome everyone to our next meeting . 
A:  but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda 
A:  I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side . 
A:  Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened . 
A:  Um today we once again have uh three presentations , if I'm right , 
A:  and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . 
A:  Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes 
A:  I'd say let's start with the first presentation . 
A:  Um in the same order as last time ? 
C:  Components design , 
C:  first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um <other> you know from what uh the remote control's formed . 
C:  Uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . 
C:  the case was is made from rubber , I suppose . 
C:  because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control 
C:  the uh titanium was also an option . 
C:  But uh it's a very expensive material . 
C:  Uh rubber is , I think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh 
C:  Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber . 
C:  Uh titanium uh you have to paint it 
C:  and with that uh it's possible to scratch it 
C:  Um <other> I h I had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved . 
C:  it's t two dimensional . 
C:  I think it's uh it's best to draw 
C:  I thought of an idea like this . 
C:  So it also looks nice when it's on your table . 
C:  uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table , 
C:  but it's c it's stands . 
C:  Um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already . 
C:  Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen , 
C:  And um it should be made of strong plastic 
C:  and it should be bright . 
C:  uh this should uh be uh our uh button component . 
C:  Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , 
C:  And they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . 
C:  Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip 
C:  but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it 
C:  with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition 
C:  there should be some more uh investigation on that side . 
C:  I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours . 
C:  I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber . 
A:  but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour . <other> 
C:  We could make a little R_ and R_  on the top of the machine . 
C:  I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls 
C:  but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium . 
C:  Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely 
abst_sum - abstract: After the project manager opened the meeting, the industrial designer discussed his preference for making a remote which is single-curved, made of rubber, contains an LCD, has a docking station to recharge the batteries, and uses a simple chip.

C:  uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station 
B:  I thought a little bit about the interface . Uh how it should look . 
B:  And uh <other> uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen , 
B:  Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . 
B:  And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device 
B:  and it answers you . 
B:  And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker . 
B:  This uh and there's an easy way to uh program that 
B:  Um perhaps it's useful , 
B:  perhaps for because people um lose the remote , 
B:  they can yell uh remote where are you and  calls or something . 
B:  And then I have to go out of the presentation 
B:  because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like 
B:  And perhaps we could uh implement that . 
B:  I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw  . 
B:  I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume . 
B:  and then the buttons above and uh below 
B:  the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . 
B:  I think it's not really on scale and and so forth . 
B:  Um an options button . 
B:  It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing . 
B:  Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , 
B:  so that it's better in your hand or something uh . 
B:  But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that . 
B:  Uh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do 
B:  And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings . 
B:  And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote , 
B:  so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things . 
abst_sum - abstract: The user interface designer discussed how speech recognition could be useful to users who often lose their remotes, the layout of the interface, and the option to include a scroll device on the side of the remote to access a menu containing extra features.

D:  I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff . 
D:  The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy . 
D:  The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , 
D:  like the L_C_D_ screen that's <other> quite innovative 
D:  And the third thing is it should be easy to use . 
D:  I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use . 
D:  The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff . 
D:  The round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber . 
D:  It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things . 
D:  Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . 
D:  They liked square shapes with round edges . 
D:  And hard materials like wood , um titanium . 
D:  And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like 
D:  It's it's a bit like a banana . 
D:  And for the elderly people just plain old . 
D:  I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares . 
abst_sum - abstract: The marketing expert discussed the results of trend-watching reports and his preference for a banana-like remote for younger people and a traditional remote for older people.

D:  It's it's a bit like a banana . 
D:  And for the elderly people just plain old . 
abst_sum - abstract: The trend-watching reports indicated that products should be fancy, innovative, easy to use, in fruity colors, in soft and spongy materials, and in hard materials in autumn colors with square shapes with round edges if appealing to elderly people.

D:  Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs , 
D:  or was it two colours ? 
D:  We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . 
D:  I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares . 
B:  You could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea . 
A:  I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh 
C:  Changing just the shape of the uh remote control ? 
B:  Perhaps you could find something in the middle . 
C:  round corners , but s but square , yeah . 
A:  But maybe then both groups won't buy it . 
C:  and the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small . Um . 
D:  w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like  
C:  but I think it should be larger . 
C:  Yeah , three quarters . 
D:  Larger I think . 
B:  Looks a bit like a Game Boy now . <laugh> 
B:  So it's a bit square , but it's also a bit uh round . 
D:  Uh  Look something like that  . Autumn colours like red , brown . 
D:  So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour . 
D:  between the young people ? Fresh , exciting . 
D:  And the old people , old and boring . 
D:  like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones 
D:  So we have to decide if we're going to use 
D:  real hard rubber , or soft rubber . Or something something between that . 
C:  Soft rubber . 
D:  like like like a a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in , 
D:  Yeah it's quite hard 
D:  but you can press it in . 
B:  So we should first decide about shape , I think . 
C:  but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll <other> you'll always get some  
B:  You always touch it , 
D:  because you have how much ? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen . 
D:  Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time . 
A:  And we won't include a a pen , or something to point , 
A:  we we want to do it with our fingers , 
C:  Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use  
B:  Yeah o yeah  , if they think it's handy to use a pen . 
A:  And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh . <laugh> 
D:  but that that can be  with plain soft tissue . 
C:  And the case , yeah we already discussed the case , 
C:  we wanted to make it from rubber 
B:  but but a hard rubber like this ? 
B:  Or softer rubber 
C:  Uh hard rubber I think . 
D:  We have different colours . 
D:  the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ? 
D:  I think it's more round than square . <other> 
B:  But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps . 
D:  I think it meets more the young people than the older people . 
A:  But that's what we want ,  . 
C:  and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ? 
D:  I thought that was a quite good 
C:  Uh got a single curved uh rubber 
C:  what's the standard colour ? 
D:  we have different colour . 
B:  You should you should have a black one 
B:  because uh I think black is standard . 
D:  Dark grey , something like this this colour or something . 
D:  I think it's better to have silver nowadays . 
D:  Yeah the the silver black are our main colours . Yeah . 
A:  w what about a yellow thing , 
D:  it'll be a banana yellow , we have . 
D:  Green , wood , brown . 
C:  But if you use uh silver , uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy . 
A:  I would think about colours like uh red , yellow , green , blue , 
D:  The fruity colours and the autumn colours , like red and brown ,  dark red and brown . 
B:  And and do we have to have a normal black one , or uh  
abst_sum - abstract: The team discussed case shapes, color options, types of rubber, and dimensions.

A:  maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision . 
A:  So we can discuss these points . 
A:   those points um energy question mark . 
A:  are we going to do it with separate docking station 
A:  Uh chip on print and case . 
B:  I think energy were batteries 
C:  The docking station . 
D:  Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries 
A:  We already decided that on the previous meeting . 
D:  which you can recharge through the docking station . 
D:  if the badg the batteries are dead 
D:  then you can re you can uh change them . 
B:  <other> but it should be th I think normal batteries , 
D:  normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah . 
B:  Um what was with the chip on print ? 
C:  Chip on print with a with a <other> simple uh a sim not a simple but a  
A:  but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ? 
A:  You still have a print plate . 
D:  I dunno what w what we have to decide about that . 
C:  chip on print , I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got , uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button . 
C:  But when you got a L_C_D_ screen , with no uh with not <other>  the buttons are not always on the same place , 
D:  but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate , 
A:  you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess . 
D:  Mm , I don't I dunno I don't think that's  
D:  Yeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen . 
D:  I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ . 
C:  but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume . 
C:  So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_ 
A:  Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen . 
A:  there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think 
B:  what we should also have on , I just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh 
B:   if if you touch options , you can't go back to this uh right away now . 
D:  Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ? 
C:  If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . 
D:  I think it's it's easier to have it something like  Oh a button uh minus here , plus over here . A minus here , plus over here . 
D:  The other buttons and on here <other> the top . 
B:  I think I would put a plus and a min uh here . 
B:  And then the P_ in the mid in the middle 
C:  We'll leave that to the usability engineering then . <laugh> 
B:  But I'm going to look if I've got some examples 
C:  So not how much  n not how often it's used , but  
B:  W what's what's usual or normal . 
D:  because I have two televisions at home . 
D:  One is horizontal , 
D:  one is vertical , 
C:  it does it doesn't really matter , 
A:  I think we have we don't have to decide about that now 
B:  And the speech uh shall we implement that ? 
B:  But then you should also find a place  
B:  You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . 
C:  you can make a very sensitive microphone , 
A:  maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh 
C:  But that's not import I think that's not im very important 
B:  You could p you could put it in a logo of the company . <laugh> 
D:  between the round of the R_ . 
C:  but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh  
B:  just 'cause other remotes don't have that . 
A:  because a microphone is very small thing , 
A:  but you can make it look like it's big 
A:  so as its its really an important function of the remote . 
A:  we already s discussed that , huh , the the L_C_D_ 
C:  <other> Interface type . 
D:  I think it's better to just  up what you'd like to do on the screen . 
D:  If you want to go back you have to back button go back , 
D:  if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu . 
B:  the the young people do like uh scroll uh 
B:  and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh  
D:  I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options , 
C:  you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . 
A:  And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side 
abst_sum - abstract: The team then made decisions regarding energy sources, components, and the remote interface.

A:  and especially notice that uh the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board , 
abst_sum - action: The industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board

A:  And we won't include a a pen , or something to point , 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will not include a pen.

C:  Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , 
C:  uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station 
D:  normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah . 
D:  Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries 
A:  We already decided that on the previous meeting . 
D:  which you can recharge through the docking station . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will use rechargeable batteries which recharge in a docking station.

D:  but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate , 
C:  Chip on print with a with a <other> simple uh a sim not a simple but a  
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will use a chip on print.

C:  and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ? 
D:  I thought that was a quite good 
C:  Uh got a single curved uh rubber 
abst_sum - decisions: The case will be single curved.

C:  we wanted to make it from rubber 
C:  Uh got a single curved uh rubber 
abst_sum - decisions: The case will be made of rubber.

None
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will contain a microphone for speech recognition.

C:  So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down , 
A:  And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side 
C:  you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will have a scrolling device.

B:  Perhaps you could find something in the middle . 
C:  round corners , but s but square , yeah .

D:  I think it's more round than square . <other> 
B:  But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps . 
abst_sum - problems: What shape the remote should be.

D:  So we have to decide if we're going to use

D:  but you can press it in . 
B:  but but a hard rubber like this ? 
B:  Or softer rubber 
C:  Uh hard rubber I think . 
abst_sum - problems: Whether to use hard or soft rubber.

A:  And we won't include a a pen , or something to point , 
A:  we we want to do it with our fingers , 
C:  Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use  
B:  Yeah o yeah  , if they think it's handy to use a pen . 
abst_sum - problems: Whether to include a pen to use with the touchscreen on the remote.

D:  Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries 
A:  We already decided that on the previous meeting .

B:  <other> but it should be th I think normal batteries , 
D:  normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah . 
abst_sum - problems: What sort of batteries to use.

D:  I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ . 
D:  Yeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen .
