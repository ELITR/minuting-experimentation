Hello . 
Designer . <laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> Yes . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Just the look like , 
the button part I'll explain . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Now the um  
we decided upon including certain features on our remote . 
Now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal  it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared . 
Now uh we have included the switch on and off button . 
Now we have included another feature that is the mute button 
on the side of the model . 
Then we have included one to nine buttons 
for controlling the programmes  the different channels . 
We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . 
And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . 
Now our  our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button . 
Menu button . 
Yes , menu  
At the centre 
we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour 
and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness 
of this uh picture . 
We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . 
Now this is uh a special , special feature which we have included . 
Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible 
so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . 
It will take the user to the previous and the next channel 
so this is a swapping button . 
No , swapping is if if example you're  you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button . 
Yes . 
And at the end , it  this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly .
