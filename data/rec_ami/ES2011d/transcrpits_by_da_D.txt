Um evaluation criteria . 
I've got a presentation . 
So I need  where's the cable ? 
Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start . 
Um . 
Right . 
This doesn't  
okay . 
Um the method is  we  well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . 
And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , 
and this is  everything's listed down . 
Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . 
These are all things we looked at at the start , 
um and criteria that have to be met . 
We have to use a table , 
I'll show you that later , 
together to decide whether it meets the standards . 
And <other> we we have therefore in total um  We have five  we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . 
And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . 
I would like to show you the table we have to use . 
Um . 
No . 
This is the table . 
Can you see this here ? 
Um so the que the questions I've given you  c could you write that down ? 
True is one and and false is seven . 
And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . 
Um . 
I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow . 
I dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told . 
Yeah it's in the um  it's in the project documents . 
It's called evaluation criteria . 
And it's under evaluation . 
Yeah . 
You've found it all ? 
So it was um  
Yeah true's one . 
Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ? 
<other> 
Yeah okay . 
<laugh> Um , 
yes 
it's  if it's fancy you put one , 
if it's really unfancy it's seven . 
<other> Yeah , something . 
<laugh> 
They shouldn't really be questions . 
Should be more like  
Are the batteries easy to insert ? <laugh> 
Yes ? Very very true . Okay . 
Okay . 
Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard . 
Do we  
um is it necessary ? 
We'll just do um  
<laugh> 
Yeah . Okay . 
I don't feel any  <laugh> 
right um  
Right so one point one ? 
We'll just go in a circle . 
Right . 
Ooh I don't know . 
Right . One ? 
Five . 
Two . 
Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four ? 
Is that what the company does ? 
Yeah ? 
Oh no . It adds to thirteen . One five five two . 
One five five two is thirteen , over four for now . 
I think that's um  
next ? 
Really ? <laugh> 
Two . 
Uh-oh . 
Right . 
One point three is  
Yeah . 
I really  
Well uh  <laugh> 
Yeah yeah . 
It was one is true and <other> false is seven . 
I should've kept the table up . 
Right , well I'm glad this came out . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> No . 
<laugh> Oh that's quite funny <laugh> . 
Okay .  
Okay . So , starting again , one point one ? 
Two . 
Okay , one point two ? 
Two . 
Okay . Um , one point three ? 
Ha . <laugh> 
Two point one ? 
Yeah . 
Oh dear , 
okay . Sorry . 
Two and one . 
Sorry about that . 
T two point two , which is one point five . 
Okay . 
Three point one . 
Is that correct on my slide ? 
Yeah ? 
One , four , three , three , 
three point two ? 
Three point three . 
Four point one ? 
Two . 
Four point two . 
Two 
and four point three . 
One , two . 
Right so I put one on that . 
Okay I'll um I'll just do the calculations now 
if you want to continue . 
Or is it tedious ? 
I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone . 
I didn't know how else to do it . 
Okay . 
Well the worst ones were three point one . 
Do  
does every ones have the slide ? 
Three point one . 
Slide show . 
Material <other> technologically innovative , 
okay . Um , 
do you want to change it ? 
What are the suggestions ? 
I don't know , 
anyone ? <other> 
Yeah that  it's three point one was not that good . 
Four point one . 
The shape . 
Four point two ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . That looked really good . 
Are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ? 
<laugh> I think that broccoli is my favourite actually . 
Uh despite the  
Yeah .  
Yeah 
and just have the colour match or something . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<whispers> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Um  
Think the critical ones came out to be  yeah that one . <makes tapping sounds> . 
Batteries easy to insert for some reason , 
which can be easily  
I think that's not a problem any more . 
No . 
I think everyone's under three anyway . 
So I think it's  
yeah those are the only two points . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Do you want this and we can all  
<other> No . 
It's alright yeah ? 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah we didn't  we  uh it all c sort of blended quite well . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Which isn't very user-friendly though . <laugh> 
I though it was brilliant no ? <laugh> 
No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think . 
I think it depends on the role 
no ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um 
a whole system , 
'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the  
Yeah , yeah . 
No . <laugh> 
But I think that <other> it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing . 
Yeah , like if everyone's given the same input  
I don't have a clue , anyway . 
Um what's next ? 
Looks like  
oh no that's not um  
It's quite  
Yeah . 
Yeah it's all very new , 
no ? 
It's all very new . 
Sorry . 
<laugh> 
What what's the end ? 
Are we are we supposed to um  
you supposed to write a report ? 
Or we ending ? 
Is that the end ? 
 
End of meeting . 
You have to tell her , 
she  
<laugh> Okay we have to fill in all this stuff . 
Stuff stuff stuff . 
Yeah . 
Well there's al eight , nine . 
Ooh . 
Oh ooh .
