You could change the vegetable , or fruit . 
Yeah . 
It's been a l 
It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , 
and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . 
Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay 
and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow . 
And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was  or design yet actually , would be the um thing  the locator . 
How how  so  
Okay 
so that's just  
So you have to have a button on your on your  you have to attach the button to the  
Yeah we have  that that has yes yet to be designed . 
Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset . 
You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango . <laugh> 
So . Tada . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own  
 
Is it meeting three minutes ? 
No it's not minutes . 
Okay . 
Okay . Cool . 
True's one and false is seven . 
So it's actually a scale . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Does it feel fancy ? 
<laugh> No . <laugh> 
<other> Yeah . Okay . 
<laugh> 
One . 
Hmm . 
Um three . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
So it's a one was true and seven was false ? 
 Okay , so you guys really didn't like it ? 
I was like , why did you guys design it that way if you hated it ? <laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
One . 
Uh three . 
One . 
Uh two . 
<laugh> 
Uh one . 
Yeah . 
Uh one . 
Uh . One . 
One . 
One . 
Two . 
One . 
Which one is that again sorry ? 
Three point one ? 
I think  
What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ? 
And like then it  you could hold it in your hand better . 
Yeah . 
The flat one . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I didn't  
yeah . 
But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat  
But it's still too big I think , in your hand . Yeah . 
Yeah like certain ones  you'd have to limit the fruit selection , 
like you could probably do a strawberry still . 
I think the broccoli would be out . 
You could do  , 
although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , 
like  sorta like a joystick . 
I don't know . So  
Uh . 
<laugh> Rhubarb . 
<laugh> These obscure fruits . 
<other> I think we needn't  
Huh ? 
Oh okay . 
Yeah . That could work . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . I dunno . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously . 
Or like  
I dunno , 
some of 'em you can kind of think  see as like  
like you could  if it was only this  you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that . 
But you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable . 
So like maybe that's just too big 
because  
Yeah it's sorta like a joystick . 
 I dunno . 
I guess  
Yeah . 
Dif 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Like uh we could do  
I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Alright . 
We could tr 
I don't know . 
Cool . 
Well  
Yeah the broccoli I guess wins . 
<laugh> We were a bit off task . 
Um so uh I can't think of any  
So we'll have to like  
<other> 
Mm . 
Yeah I dunno . 
You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , 
but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like , 
but you could do like  
Yeah that's true . 
Yeah . 
Yeah that's true . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
I did . 
The prototype making was very creatively stimulating 
and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria <other> . 
I think you were fine . 
You did a good job leading . 
<laugh> 
Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like <laugh> I don't know , all had ideas about it but  
<other> yeah . 
No . <laugh> 
Hmm . 
I felt like my  
I dunno if it was just my role , 
but l but uh I di I thought that my  the information that was available to me was kind of just like  
or maybe it was just the idea that we had . 
But there's kinda  
it was kinda like okay , I don't really think  I dunno what I'm doing here . 
So I didn't really think it was helpful . 
So I kind of just made up my own stuff 
and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations , 
so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead . 
But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally , <other> think it's kinda stupid . 
Yeah but uh  
Yeah . 
It didn't really  
yeah . 
<laugh> 
So like a f 
Yeah I think so . 
Yeah I mean , it  
Yeah I kinda thought that um  
I felt like I would go and like try to use my information , 
or like I'd make this stupid little presentation 
and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated 
because  <laugh> 
I dunno 
I felt like I was off-task all the time . 
But um  
Yeah . 
I wanna s 
I I'd like to see what what it looks like on the  
Yeah I think I'd like to um <other>  
I dunno . 
Like it was  the  
I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down , 
but like they're kinda clumsy I guess when you're  like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like . 
Yeah 
I dunno . But they're they're okay . 
<other> Uh I think , and I think that uh 
all this technology like  I guess some people must be interested in using it 
but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes , 
or like  I dunno . 
Hm . 
I guess it would be  
it's gotta be worth it to  
I  
'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful , 
'cause can't really imagine , dunno . 
How about a p <laugh> a  <laugh> ? 
<laugh> Um I dunno . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
M meeting adjourned . 
<laugh> 
I think it would be a good idea , I like it . <laugh> 
<cough>
