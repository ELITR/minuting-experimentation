Okay 
well um . 
So our design looks something like this . 
This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . 
This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . 
And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . 
So you can change the colour , according to your  to suit your living room or whatever . 
And it comes  
yeah , I can change the vegetable . 
This one's broccoli <laugh> . 
So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . 
This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . 
This is a mango . 
The  
it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits . 
You don't have orange , you have mango . 
Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but  <laugh> 
So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . 
And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well the locator is just chip that's inside there . 
And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere 
Yeah 
we didn't design that . 
But it would be coordinating with that of course . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes . 
But it's really not very clear , 
because you got single curve and double curve and  d I dunno what that means . 
One side is curved and then the other side is curved . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
No 
I think that's alright . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Hmm ? 
<laugh> Feels like play-dough . 
I'm gonna say yes . <laugh> 
<other> I imagine they're somewhere on the front . 
We have a little case that you slip 'em in . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
'Kay 
Five . 
<laugh> 
Five . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
It's four if you wanna do that . 
It adds to sixteen , so that's four . 
Oh I thought she said five . 
Six . 
<laugh> 
Huh ? 
Wait a minute . 
I thought it was the other way round too . 
Sh 
Yeah 
I I was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top <other> . 
I'll just I'll just reverse them all . 
It's no problem . 
<laugh> I thought you guys hated it . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Say two . 
Two . 
One . 
Uh two . 
Yeah I put it down as one point four for some reason . 
Mine has all kinds of problems . 
Uh three . 
Wait why did I put three ? 
I meant one on mine too . 
Three point one . 
I have four . 
Three . 
One . 
Two . 
Three . 
Two . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
I think the wheel would probably be  mm . 
<laugh> 
I think the base would definitely be larger , 
'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . 
They're kinda smallish . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Not that I can think of . 
Rhubarb . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
So it's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits . 
We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
That  
everyone gave that a one or a two . 
Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote . 
No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door , 
yeah um like on a normal remote . 
So it would probably either in the f 
no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , 
but it'd be on one of the sides probably . 
<laugh> Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape . 
Um , I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape . 
I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too . 
<laugh> 
Sure . 
<laugh> Sponginess . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
I think it was good . 
We knew what we were doing . 
It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute . 
<laugh> Well you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff . 
No no I never touch Macs either . 
I just use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Well the problem is if you don't  like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it . 
So I have all these documents I can't use now . 
But yeah I mean I guess it's okay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
I never use it . 
Yeah . 
My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works . 
<laugh> Yeah it probably does . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah well mine was mostly made up 
except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control . 
As if you'd wanted to . 
<laugh> 
Well I think it's interesting how it all went together , 
like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap , 
and you have how people want it to be spongy , and  
It seems planned you know . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
If I hadn't been told that fruit was  
They're pretty cool . 
They're kinda hard to write with though . 
<laugh> 
They're nicer than the pen that I'm using , 
because like your stuff actually shows up here , rather than having to look at the screen and write . 
But even so , I dunno . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh yeah . 
Well they drop off if you like move too much . 
But I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones . 
Maybe we are . 
I don't know . <laugh> 
Well the thing is , like I actually worked in a company , 
and I had a role and I had to go to meetings . 
And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting . 
Like usually I missed meetings deliberately . 
There's just  
there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting , like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company . 
It's mostly like rehashing old stuff . 
And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know . 
It's like the  
there's just really not a lot of information that goes through . 
It seems like way overkill . 
Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence . 
I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I think I've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings . <laugh> 
<laugh> It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention . 
Especially if you have food . 
All of us ?
