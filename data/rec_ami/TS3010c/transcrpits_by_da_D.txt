<other> 
Mm . Ah . Hey . <laugh> Ah . 
Now I have my screen back too . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Very interesting . 
Large . 
A lot  a lot of buttons buttons . 
Yeah . 
Yes . 
Okay . <laugh> 
<other> 
 Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
Yep . 
Yeah . 
But , thi i uh  
This is with an L_C_D_ ? No , 
not . 
<other> 
Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ? 
'Cause it  
I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better . 
And that might uh bring back the costs uh  
Huh . 
'Kay . <laugh> 
My turn ? 
<other> Mm . So  
So  
Yeah . 
So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching . 
Uh , I did some trend-watching . 
It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends . <other> 'Cause if you don't , you won't sell . 
So , well how we did do that ? 
Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . 
They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan . 
Of course , well known for their uh trend  uh trends . 
And well , uh what did you find ? 
Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . 
Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products . 
And um , material ? That should feel  have uh a spongy feeling . 
And to get a feeling for what it is , uh here is an image of it . 
Then the old and rich . 
They like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes . 
And um , they also like uh familiar material , uh especially wood . 
Now , another picture . 
To get a feeling for this . 
<laugh> 
Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . 
We uh aim at the younger market . 
So , we should also be uh look at their uh trends . 
However , with trends it's always if there's  it's now . 
It it it might last one year , and next year it be  uh can be totally different . 
And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year . 
So , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , 
as it might be totally different next year . 
So , that's uh one thing to keep in mind . 
Yeah . 
Any questions ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Can make several uh concepts . 
We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand .
