Okay . 
<other> Well , let's start . 
Oops . 
<laugh> 
What are we doing ? 
<laugh> Okay . Okay . Not doing . 
Uh  
Very good . 
<laugh> Okay . 
<laugh>  we have presentations . 
So first , it's your turn . 
<laugh> Yeah . Isn't it amazing . <laugh> 
Industrial Designer . 
Interface concept . 
<laugh> 
<other> Can you go back one page ? 
For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? 
We don't have buttons for the menu . 
Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel  . 
Okay . 
But  uh  
You have to put it on the  
Yeah . 
Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows . 
Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Not too much colours . 
No , it's not flower power . 
S okay . 
Okay . 
Thank you . 
So , you're next . 
<other> <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
No , isn't . 
But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . 
Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push . 
But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel . 
If you don't  
Hmm , yes . But then . Yeah , then you go one down one up . 
When you scroll . 
but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . 
So you may not be uh  
No . 
The television must do that . 
So  
Yeah 
but young people have to have all their uh room . 
Yeah 
And mostly they are smaller . 
So  
Most the times that are not advanced televisions . 
Okay . 
That's important . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . 
<other> It's very important . 
Yeah , more expensive . 
But how much ? 
Oh . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Well , thank you . 
Next . 
<laugh> 
No . It's clear . 
So now , it's uh  <pause filling noise> 
Ah , let's see . 
Now , w we have to decide 
<other> 
Well , we have to decide on the concept . 
So , we have to look at  'S next . Components and user interface concept . 
So  
Now , we have to make some concept . 
Maybe one of you can paint it on the board . 
First , uh user interface . 
Yes , a concept on uh  <laugh> 
Just  
<other> 
Yeah , 
but maybe we can paint it . Uh , what do we want ? 
I'll paint . Okay . 
Well  
Something like this ? Or  
Shapes or  What do we need ? 
Yes , okay . 
Okay . 
And you have to . 
Yeah . 
<laugh>  
So , it has to be soft ? 
Okay . 
And uh , the buttons ? 
Buttons . 
<laugh> No , it won't . 
But , well there one for the sound and one for the channels . 
Uh , two scroll uh wheels . 
That's th that's more difficult . 
It's better in  
But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu . 
Yeah , but <laugh> again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? 
You don't know . 
So , there's no menu . 
No . 
So you can't use it . 
Okay , 
we make two concepts . 
One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ . 
Good concept . 
But  
That's one . 
It's one . 
Two . Number two . 
<laugh> 
No . 
<laugh> But when you handle it , you put it on and off . 
It's not good to use . 
<laugh> Yeah , but <laugh> I'll zap . 
<sound imitating device noise> Fuck . Out . <laugh> 
No , it's not good . 
<other> Now , second concept . 
One with L_C_D_ , one without L_C_D_ . 
Then uh  
Paint it . <laugh> 
One with two scroll buttons and one with without . 
Yeah . 
Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu . 
And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ . 
<other> Unbelievable . 
Do I have to do everything . 
Blank . 
You have  <sound effect> 
Not so difficult . 
Uh , that's the menu . 
There for the L_C_D_ screen . 
You have to  
For the menu . 
Mm-hmm . 
One that way . 
And one that way . 
So  
Then it depends on the cost . 
S On and off . 
When it's not too big . 
Just like a a phone . 
Yes , okay . 
<laugh> 
Very good . 
Is it better ? 
When you uh  the menu , you have to go there there there there . 
Yeah , okay . That's that's the outside . 
But now the  
First the buttons . 
Sorry ? 
Mute . And the other . 
<laugh> Yeah . Not so difficult . 
But how do you wanna solve it ? 
Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy . 
Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down . 
Yeah . 
A joystick . 
Yeah . 
But is it uh  
Does that break , a joystick ? 
Or a small one just like in a laptop . 
Mean , it's better . 
But how expensive it is ? <laugh> 
<other> Oh . Why do I pay you for ? <laugh> 
Um , well <other> um  
<other> Better ideas . <other> 
For the young peoples I think scroll button's good . 
So  
Think we have to keep them . 
Yeah , but is it  
That's not expensive than uh  Joystick is better . 
A small one . 
No 
just like in a 
a laptop . 
Small , round . 
Then it's not so big . 
Oh the sh 
Yeah , 
but then you can  
So  
Maybe , if it's possible , <other> it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . 
A small one . 
So , please look at it . 
<other> 
Yeah we  I think you get it . 
So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it . 
Yes . 
Your problem . Not mine . 
Okay . 
So , do we have other concepts ? 
Then for the components , we use a normal battery . 
Then it's  Ch cheapest way , I think . 
No , no kinetic . 
Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . 
So we use a normal battery . 
Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ . 
Scroll . 
Yeah . 
And uh , we  If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to 
Yes , okay . 
So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ 
and  
But , it has to be small . 
I think . 
Y y <other> Yeah but  
If you have pistol , it  L_C_D_'s not easy . 
If you use a phone . 
 k Yeah , but but then you have it . 
Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . 
And the screen is  
Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen . 
Yeah . 
No . No , no . 
Yeah , but then you look forward . 
And then you can y 
N well , if you have to look at it . 
Then it goes like this . 
If th n well  <laugh> 
Yes , of course . 
That's good good . 
But the  um , 
it may not break . 
Okay . If that's possible . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Yeah of course . 
Okay . 
Then this is the design . 
And the buttons are on the next page . 
So , depends on the cost . 
<other> um we have one minute . 
So , 
I think . 
No . 
More . Seven . 
Next meeting . Thirty minutes . 
So hurry up . 
You two stay here . <laugh> 
Paint it . 
Now you have to . 
So  
I think it's clear . 
Check your mail . 
So  
It has to be ready in the next meeting . 
So  <other> 
Next meeting is called the detailed design . 
Everyth everything has to be ready . 
Thanks for your attention . <laugh> <other> 
So
