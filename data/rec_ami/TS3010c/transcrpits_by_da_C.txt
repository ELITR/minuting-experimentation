Ah , pinball . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
 
<makes kissing sound> 
Huh . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . 
And you will see it . 
<other> 
I'm next , okay . 
<pause filling sound> 
Yes . No . 
Here we go . 
Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want , 
our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . 
And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . 
First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . 
Like , totally yellow , totally red . 
Uh , so it's visible . 
Uh , the shapes are curved and round , 
like uh you also said . 
Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . 
But to give him the shape of your hand , so you  it's easier to use or something like that . 
But that's just an idea . 
And then , I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . 
The battery , there are few options . 
Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . 
So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket . 
Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . 
When you uh shake it a few times , it it's loaded . 
Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice  have it curved . 
And maybe like it's hand-shaped . 
Uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . 
Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic 
uh because uh  it won't have to burst uh like in the  in one time . 
And also rubber 
because the younger people like that , 
what we see in the research . 
Uh the push-buttons . 
We have one new thing uh discovered . 
It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . 
Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . 
When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up 
and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel . 
And also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it's also uh easy to use . 
Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . 
And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . 
You can do it with your thumb . 
And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons 
uh if you  push uh channel one , you can see channel one . 
The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . 
There are also uh simple chips . 
They are uh cheaper . 
Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , 
and I think there are a lot of those uh things , and people won't buy it any more . 
They have seen enough of it . 
And you have also advanced um chips . 
But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . 
And the costs will increase a lot more . 
And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , 
and the chip who is more expensive . 
And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the  for remote control , 
that we then use the primary colours . 
Like , you get a yellow uh remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera . 
You have any more questions about this ? 
I think the main thing is we look at the costs . 
And not too basic , 
not a basic remote control , who everybody already has . 
Not with an L_C_D_ . 
No . 
Yeah . 
But then , what I say , the costs will uh get a lot higher . 
Th then you'll see it on the television . 
<laugh> 
but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control . 
Yeah 
Yes . 
But that won't be a problem . I think . 
No , 
but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls . 
And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . 
And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . 
Uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . 
And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news . 
<laugh> I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . 
But I don't know uh how much higher . <laugh> 
That's true . 
But then we'll  
I think we must discuss who  uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . 
 
With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control . 
Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ . 
I can uh look on my uh  <other> 
Uh  
Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . 
A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . 
The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip . 
Doesn't say . <laugh> 
That's from my manufacturing division . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Yes ? 
<laugh> 
Changing covers . <laugh> 
Nope . 
Uh , uh-uh . 
How w how we how we make it ? Uh  
<laugh> 
Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all  
Yeah , but if I paint with  
<laugh> 
More like something  
M like  
Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it . 
Uh  <laugh> 
I have to . 
I'm not a designer . 
It's more  three D_ . 
Like , um when you have 
a part here . 
This is the remote control . 
And then you have something like th this under it . 
So , it's easier to get it like this . 
<laugh> <sound imitating blowing gun smoke from a gun> It's like a gun . <laugh> 
And it has to be soft , yeah . 
So , you can squeeze in it and  
Sorry ? 
Buttons on top of it . 
And here . 
The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb . 
<laugh> 
But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . 
One till uh uh zero till nine . 
And the b 
<other> 
Yeah ? 
Or two buttons . 
If uh  
'Kay c If we do  
If we use one , then we'll have just a switch on it , 
and you'll just switch it , 
and now it's the sound to switch back 
with the menu uh button . 
And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . 
Just not like all the other ones , with uh this thing , and uh here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow . 
Because uh , from h hundred uh  remote controls , ninety nine have it . 
Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu . 
<laugh> 
I don't know . 
It's like some sort of uh teletext option , but we don't have teletext . <laugh> 
And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher . 
'Kay . 
But you all like this kind of thing . 
Uh  
With the scroll button . 
And and this one has to be soft . 
And this has to be harder , 
because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst . 
Or some kind of rubber around it . 
<laugh> Yeah . Yeah . 
<laugh> Ah that's nice . 
<laugh> Here . Trigger . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Paint it ? 
With the scroll thing on , like this ? 
So ? 
<laugh> Draw it . <laugh> 
But is it easy to use ? 
When you have it on your left side , 
and  
Separate , more separate , h yeah . 
Yeah . 
On the left a scroll button , and on the right a scroll button . 
But would it be easy to use then ? 
<laugh> 
If it's like  <sound accompanying deictic reference> you have a big uh  
I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for . 
They were like round curves , 
uh different uh  
Okay , okay , okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle . 
With the switch button . 
No 
like uh  
Oh , you mean like that . 
Uh , then you can also have like uh th um  
Yeah , and joystick , I think . 
Yeah like in a laptop , s uh s some sort of thing . 
A little bit bigger , 
with easier thi 
I don't know . 
<laugh> 
Or no scroll uh things . 
Just a shape . 
And  
 No , no . It won't work . 
Yeah . Uh-huh . 
Or a remote control more like joystick . 
A small one like this , like a Nintendo uh k 
Playstation thing . 
No , no , no . 
I mean the the shape of the remote control . 
Just like a Playstation thing . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
No , that's okay , 
I got  
Uh  <laugh> 
they're not uh in details . 
It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ? <laugh> 
<laugh>  Then I have to come with it . 
I got my personal costs . 
I I don't I don't know the costs . 
<laugh> 
Then I'll uh make something up . 
Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery . 
Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , 
more expensive . Yeah . 
Okay . 
Depends on the scroll . 
If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . 
If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip . 
And that's  
Uh the most expensive . 
Yeah . 
If we  
Yeah . 
If we  
No okay scroll-wheel . 
So , I have this . 
So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip . 
Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? 
And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ? 
Just use your thumb . 
If you  
Yeah . I use my thumb . 
Yeah . 
If you have a joystick on  
No , 
if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller . 
<other> 
And you move up , f forward , down , left . 
Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . 
It's not just uh <sound accompanying figurative reference> straight . 
That's how we use it . 
That's why they make joysticks like that , I think . 
Yeah ? 
'Kay . Here's our designer . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , why not . 
It's for the younger people . 
It's something new . <laugh> 
Now we put uh rubber around it . 
Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . 
And the uh the hand shape is also rubber . 
Huh . 
This is something new . 
Costs are okay . <laugh> 
Oh , that's us together . 
<laugh> 
Yes . 
Bye bye . 
'Kay .
