Hmm . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Oh . 
Mine . Oh , great . 
Uh  
<other> Yes , well uh 
let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . 
Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , 
uh show you some samples , uh 
uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . 
And uh my personal preferences . 
<other> Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . 
The bu uh 
the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . 
The channels buttons , one to nine , 
and uh off uh uh 
zero to nine , 
and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . 
Uh the volume and channel quadrants , 
uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . 
And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . 
Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples . 
Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's  that they're all pretty uh uh high uh  
Yeah . Yeah . 
Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long . 
Um , power buttons are mostly at the top 
uh left or right . 
Um , well we see the the the same uh arrows . 
Like there . 
And uh  
Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . 
And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . 
Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , 
but we don't use that . 
But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . 
Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ . 
So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that . 
Um  
Yeah . So , that's  
Uh , well  
Yeah . 
I thought that was our uh idea . 
So , uh how  
Like this . 
Or or this . 
And that the menu button is okay . 
<other> Yeah , okay . 
Uh , so the  
The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean . 
Yeah . 
Uh , well that's something to uh think about . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . 
But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . 
Uh , round edges . 
The logo at the bottom . 
And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . 
So , it's good . 
Uh , recognisable . 
K so , I think . 
Uh , no . Not too much . 
But uh  
No , no , no . 
But this has to be has to be trendy 
and uh  and   <laugh> 
Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion . 
That was that . 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
No . 
Mm , yes . 
What ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then ? 
Yeah , okay . 
But but how  
How  
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . 
Like uh  <makes sound of gun firing> 
<laugh>  
<laugh> 
Just to uh  <laugh> 
Oh , like a <makes sound of gun firing>  
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
But if you put  push the the menu button  
Yeah , wh what  
Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm , yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
It's uh  
Or you can uh turn it inside . 
But that's  
No , that's true . 
<laugh>  . 
Okay . 
<laugh>
