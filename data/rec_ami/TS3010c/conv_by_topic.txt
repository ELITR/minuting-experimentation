A:  Okay . <other> Well , let's start . What are we doing ? Oops . <laugh> 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  Ah , pinball . 
A:  <laugh> Okay . Okay . Not doing . Uh  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm . Ah . Hey . <laugh> Ah . Now I have my screen back too . <laugh> 
B:  Oh . 
A:  Very good . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Okay . <laugh>  we have presentations . So first , it's your turn . <laugh> Yeah . Isn't it amazing . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:   
B:  Mine . Oh , great . 
C:  Huh . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . Very interesting . 
B:  Uh  
D:  <other> 
C:  <makes kissing sound> 
B:  <other> 
A:  Industrial Designer . Interface concept . 


B:  <other> Yes , well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences . <other> Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Um  Yeah . So , that's  
A:  <other> Can you go back one page ? For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? 
B:  Uh , well  
A:  We don't have buttons for the menu . Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel  . 
B:  Yeah . I thought that was our uh idea . So , uh how  
A:  Okay . But  uh  You have to put it on the  
B:  Like this . Or or this . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  And that the menu button is okay . 
A:  Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows . 
B:  <other> Yeah , okay . Uh , so the  
D:  Yes . 
B:  The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one . 
B:  Yeah . Uh , well that's something to uh think about . <laugh> 
A:  Okay . 
C:  Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  Okay . <laugh> 
B:  Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . 
C:  <other> 
B:  Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think . 
A:  <laugh> Not too much colours . 
B:  Uh , no . Not too much . But uh  No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh  and   <laugh> 
A:  No , it's not flower power . S okay . 
B:  Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  That was that . 
A:  Thank you . 


A:  So , you're next . 
C:  I'm next , okay . <pause filling sound> Yes . No . Here we go . 
D:  <other> 
A:  <other> <laugh> 
C:  Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want , our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . 
D:   Okay . Mm-hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red . Uh , so it's visible . Uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said . Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . But to give him the shape of your hand , so you  it's easier to use or something like that . But that's just an idea . And then , I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . 
A:  <other> Oh . 
D:  Huh . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  That's from my manufacturing division . 
D:  'Kay . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  My turn ? 
C:  Yes ? 
A:  Okay . <laugh> Well , thank you . 


A:  Next . 
C:  <other> 
D:  <other> Mm . So  So  
D:  Now , another picture . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  To get a feeling for this . Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . We uh aim at the younger market . So , we should also be uh look at their uh trends . However , with trends it's always if there's  it's now . It it it might last one year , and next year it be  uh can be totally different . And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year . So , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be totally different next year . So , that's uh one thing to keep in mind . 
C:  Changing covers . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . Any questions ? 
C:  Nope . 
B:  No . 
A:  No . It's clear . 


A:  So now , it's uh  <pause filling noise> Ah , let's see . Now , w we have to decide <other> Well , we have to decide on the concept . So , we have to look at  'S next . Components and user interface concept . So  Now , we have to make some concept . Maybe one of you can paint it on the board . First , uh user interface . 
C:  Uh , uh-uh . How w how we how we make it ? Uh  
A:  Yes , a concept on uh  <laugh> Just  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> Yeah , but maybe we can paint it . Uh , what do we want ? 
C:  Yeah , but if I paint with  
A:  I'll paint . Okay . Well  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Mm . 
A:  Something like this ? Or  
B:  Mm , yes . 
A:  Shapes or  What do we need ? 
D:  Can make several uh concepts . 
B:  What ? 
A:  Yes , okay . 
D:  We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  More like something  
D:  Yeah I I I uh  yes . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  M like  Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it . Uh  <laugh> I have to . I'm not a designer . It's more  three D_ . Like , um when you have 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  And you have to . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  a part here . This is the remote control . And then you have something like th this under it . So , it's easier to get it like this . <laugh> <sound imitating blowing gun smoke from a gun> It's like a gun . <laugh> 
B:  Mm . <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  <laugh>  
D:  Yeah . A g <laugh> Mm .  . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  So , it has to be soft ? 
C:  And it has to be soft , yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  So , you can squeeze in it and  Sorry ? Buttons on top of it . And here . 
A:  And uh , the buttons ? Buttons . 
C:  The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb . 
A:  <laugh> No , it won't . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then ? 
C:  But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . One till uh uh zero till nine . And the b 
A:  But , well there one for the sound and one for the channels . 
B:  Yeah , okay . But but how  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <other> 
B:  Yeah . How  
C:  Yeah ? Or two buttons . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  And i if we go to uh  <other> 
A:  Uh , two scroll uh wheels . 
C:  If uh  'Kay c If we do  If we use one , then we'll have just a switch on it , and you'll just switch it , and now it's the sound to switch back 
D:  <other> 
B:  Mm . 
A:  That's th that's more difficult . 
D:  But if we have uh a me Yeah . If we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ? 
A:  It's better in  
C:  with the menu uh button . And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . Just not like all the other ones , with uh this thing , and uh here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow . Because uh , from h hundred uh  remote controls , ninety nine have it . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu . 
D:  Uh-uh . 
A:  Yeah , but <laugh> again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? You don't know . So , there's no menu . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  I don't know . It's like some sort of uh teletext option , but we don't have teletext . <laugh> 
A:  No . So you can't use it . 
C:  And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher . 
A:  Okay , we make two concepts . One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ . 
C:  'Kay . But you all like this kind of thing . Uh  
A:  Good concept . But  
C:  With the scroll button . And and this one has to be soft . And this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst . Or some kind of rubber around it . 
A:  That's one . 
D:  Uh-uh . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  It's one . Two . Number two . 
B:  And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . Like uh  <makes sound of gun firing> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . Yeah . <laugh> Ah that's nice . <laugh> Here . Trigger . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh>  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  No . <laugh> But when you handle it , you put it on and off . 
B:  Just to uh  <laugh> 
A:  It's not good to use . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Yeah , but <laugh> I'll zap . <sound imitating device noise> Fuck . Out . <laugh> 
B:  Oh , like a <makes sound of gun firing>  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  No , it's not good . <other> Now , second concept . One with L_C_D_ , one without L_C_D_ . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Then uh  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Paint it . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Paint it ? With the scroll thing on , like this ? 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  One with two scroll buttons and one with without . Yeah . Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu . And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ . 
C:  So ? <laugh> Draw it . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> Unbelievable . Do I have to do everything . Blank . You have  <sound effect> Not so difficult . 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  But if you put  push the the menu button  
A:  Uh , that's the menu . There for the L_C_D_ screen . 
B:  Yeah , wh what  Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose . 
A:  You have to  For the menu . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . One that way . And one that way . So  Then it depends on the cost . S On and off . 
D:  <other> 
C:  But is it easy to use ? When you have it on your left side , and  
A:  When it's not too big . Just like a a phone . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  M uh yeah , maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um more separate , yeah . Like , you have the menu button in between uh  
C:  Separate , more separate , h yeah . 
A:  Yes , okay . 
C:  Yeah . On the left a scroll button , and on the right a scroll button . But would it be easy to use then ? If it's like  <sound accompanying deictic reference> you have a big uh  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Very good . Is it better ? When you uh  the menu , you have to go there there there there . 
C:  I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for . They were like round curves , uh different uh  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , okay . That's that's the outside . But now the  First the buttons . 
C:  Okay , okay , okay . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Think we have we have now two buttons missing . The uh um  The mute button . 
A:  Sorry ? 
D:  We have two buttons missing . The mute button . And um , the  to to uh  have to uh  numbers 
A:  Mute . And the other . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Okay . <laugh> But , uh  
A:  <laugh> Yeah . Not so difficult . 
C:  Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle . 
A:  But how do you wanna solve it ? 
C:  With the switch button . 
A:  Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy . Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down . 
C:  No like uh  Oh , you mean like that . Uh , then you can also have like uh th um  
A:  Yeah . A joystick . 
C:  Yeah , and joystick , I think . 
A:  Yeah . But is it uh  Does that break , a joystick ? Or a small one just like in a laptop . 
C:  Yeah like in a laptop , s uh s some sort of thing . A little bit bigger , with easier thi 
A:  Mean , it's better . But how expensive it is ? <laugh> 
C:  I don't know . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> Oh . Why do I pay you for ? <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Um , well <other> um  <other> Better ideas . <other> 
D:  Okay . 
C:  Or no scroll uh things . Just a shape . And   No , no . It won't work . 
A:  For the young peoples I think scroll button's good . 
C:  Yeah . Uh-huh . 
A:  So  Think we have to keep them . 
C:  Or a remote control more like joystick . 
A:  Yeah , but is it  That's not expensive than uh  Joystick is better . A small one . 
C:  A small one like this , like a Nintendo uh k 
A:  No just like in a 
C:  Playstation thing . 
A:  a laptop . Small , round . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Then it's not so big . 
C:  No , no , no . I mean the the shape of the remote control . Just like a Playstation thing . 
A:  Oh the sh Yeah , but then you can  You have to use t with one hand . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  So  
D:  <other> 
A:  Maybe , if it's possible , <other> it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . A small one . So , please look at it . 
C:  <other> No , that's okay , I got  
D:  And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? Uh , it costs extra ? 
C:  Uh  <laugh> they're not uh in details . It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ? <laugh> 
A:  <other> Yeah we  I think you get it . So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it . 
C:  <laugh>  Then I have to come with it . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yes . 
C:  I got my personal costs . I I don't I don't know the costs . 
A:  Your problem . Not mine . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> 
C:  Then I'll uh make something up . 
A:  Okay . So , do we have other concepts ? Then for the components , we use a normal battery . 
B:  Mm , yeah . 
A:  Then it's  Ch cheapest way , I think . 
C:  Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery . Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah . 
A:  No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . So we use a normal battery . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Okay . 
D:  Yes . 
A:  Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ . 
C:  Depends on the scroll . 
A:  Scroll . 
C:  If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip . And that's  
A:  Yeah . And uh , we  If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to 
C:  Uh the most expensive . Yeah . 
A:  Yes , okay . So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll . Okay . 
C:  If we  Yeah . If we  No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip . 
A:  Okay . So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and  But , it has to be small . I think . 
C:  Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ? 
A:  If you have pistol , it  L_C_D_'s not easy . Y y <other> Yeah but  
C:  Just use your thumb . 
A:  If you use a phone . 
C:  If you  Yeah . I use my thumb . 
A:   k Yeah , but but then you have it . Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . And the screen is  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen . 
C:  If you have a joystick on  No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller . And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It's not just uh <sound accompanying figurative reference> straight . 
D:  <blowing sound> 
A:  Yeah . No . No , no . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <other> That's how we use it . That's why they make joysticks like that , I think . 
D:  Uh  
A:  Yeah , but then you look forward . And then you can y 
D:  Uh , yeah , but  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah ? 
A:  N well , if you have to look at it . 
D:  If you  
C:  'Kay . Here's our designer . 
D:  If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Then it goes like this . 
C:  Yeah , why not . 
A:  If th n well  <laugh> 
C:  It's for the younger people . It's something new . <laugh> 
A:  Yes , of course . That's good good . But the  um , it may not break . 
B:  It's uh  
C:  Now we put uh rubber around it . 
A:  Okay . If that's possible . 
D:  Um , Yeah . 
C:  Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber . 
D:   
A:  Okay . 
D:   I can't see the  . 
B:  Or you can uh turn it inside . 
D:  But , uh the easy of  <other> uh , th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it . 
B:  But that's  
C:  Huh . 
B:  No , that's true . 
D:  Uh , for us it's about to sell it . Uh  
A:  <laugh> Yeah of course . Okay . 
C:  This is something new . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . 


A:  So , <other> um we have one minute . 
C:  Costs are okay . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh>  . 
D:  <laugh> One . 
A:  I think . No . More . Seven . 
D:  No . You have more . You have still ten . 
A:  Next meeting . Thirty minutes . So hurry up . 
C:  Oh , that's us together . 
A:  You two stay here . <laugh> Paint it . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Okay . 
A:  Now you have to . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  So  I think it's clear . Check your mail . So  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yes . 
A:  It has to be ready in the next meeting . So  <other> 
D:  What ? 
B:  Cookie . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Next meeting is called the detailed design . So  Everyth everything has to be ready . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Thanks for your attention . <laugh> <other> 
C:  'Kay . 
D:  See you at the next meeting . 
C:  Bye bye .
