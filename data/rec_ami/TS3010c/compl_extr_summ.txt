B:  let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . 

B:  the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . 

B:  zero to nine , 

D:  Large . 

B:  Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long . 

B:  Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . 

A:  For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? 

B:  I thought that was our uh idea . 

B:  And that the menu button is okay . 

A:  Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows . 

B:  The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean . 

B:  Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . 

B:  Uh , recognisable . 

A:  <laugh> Not too much colours . 

B:  Uh , no . Not too much . 

B:  But this has to be has to be trendy 

B:  Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion . 

C:  Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want , 

C:  Uh , the shapes are curved and round , 

C:  Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . 

C:  The battery , there are few options . 

C:  Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice  have it curved . 

C:  Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic 

C:  And also rubber 

C:  Uh the push-buttons . 

C:  You can do it with your thumb . 

C:  The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . 

C:  And you have also advanced um chips . 

C:  And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , 

C:  And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the  for remote control , 

D:  This is with an L_C_D_ ? No , 

A:  But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel . 

C:  And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news . 

C:  but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls . 

C:  <laugh> I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . 

D:  And that might uh bring back the costs uh  

C:  I think we must discuss who  uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . 

C:  With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control . 

A:  Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . 

C:  Not with an L_C_D_ . 

A:  But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . 

C:  but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . 

A:  but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . 

C:  Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control . 

D:  Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ? 

C:  But I don't know uh how much higher . <laugh> 

D:  I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better . 

C:  Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . 

D:  So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching . 

D:  Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . 

D:  Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . 

D:  Then the old and rich . 

D:  We uh aim at the younger market . 

D:  Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . 

D:  However , with trends it's always if there's  it's now . 

A:  Well , we have to decide on the concept . 

A:  Maybe one of you can paint it on the board . 

D:  Can make several uh concepts . 

C:  This is the remote control . 

A:  So , it has to be soft ? 

C:  And it has to be soft , yeah . 

C:  Buttons on top of it . 

C:  The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb . 

C:  But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . 

D:  If we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ? 

C:  with the menu uh button . 

A:  But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu . 

C:  Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu . 

A:  Yeah , but <laugh> again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? 

C:  And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher . 

A:  we make two concepts . 

C:  And and this one has to be soft . 

B:  And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . 

A:  It's not good to use . 

C:  Or some kind of rubber around it . 

A:  One with two scroll buttons and one with without . 

A:  Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu . 

B:  Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose . 

A:  Then it depends on the cost . 

D:  M uh yeah , maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um 

C:  I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for . 

A:  When you uh  the menu , you have to go there there there there . 

D:  We have two buttons missing . 

A:  Mute . And the other . 

C:  Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle . 

A:  But how do you wanna solve it ? 

C:  Uh , then you can also have like uh th um  

A:  Or a small one just like in a laptop . 

A:  Does that break , a joystick ? 

A:  But how expensive it is ? <laugh> 

A:  For the young peoples I think scroll button's good . 

A:  That's not expensive than uh  Joystick is better . 

C:  I mean the the shape of the remote control . 

A:  Maybe , if it's possible , <other> it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . 

A:  Then for the components , we use a normal battery . 

A:  Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . 

A:  Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ . 

C:  If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . 

A:  And uh , we  If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to 

C:  Uh the most expensive . 

A:  So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ 

C:  Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? 

A:  If you have pistol , it  L_C_D_'s not easy . 

C:  if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller . 

C:  Now we put uh rubber around it . 

A:  Then this is the design . 

A:  Next meeting . Thirty minutes . 

A:  You two stay here . <laugh> 

A:  Check your mail . 

A:  It has to be ready in the next meeting . 

A:  Next meeting is called the detailed design . 

D:  And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? 

C:  they're not uh in details . 

A:  So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it .
