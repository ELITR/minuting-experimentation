Hmm . 
<other> Good morning . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <cough> 
Mm . 
B did you send us an email about this ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah , we we received an email about this uh d designs . <laugh> 
<laugh> Ah it's Okay . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
you see the email ? 
You  email . 
The v very  
no , no 
the first one . 
It's inside . 
No , no . 
The third one . 
Oh , you didn't get anything . 
It's strange . 
<laugh> <other> Mm . <other> 
I got an email about the dis about the discussion . Yeah . 
I dunno from who . 
<laugh> From the account manager . 
You have received the same email , right ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , so each of us has a role to do . 
In each  
We already have our role . 
<laugh> 'Kay , we can  
So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . 
Okay , alright . <laugh> 
<other> Yeah , yeah . 
I'm doing the interface . 
Are you using the  you are doing the in  
Ah <other>  
Okay . 
Mm ? 
Um working on i . <laugh> User interface . <laugh> 
Yes . 
You see the second mail ? 
Yeah , it's inside . 
Go down . 
Appendix . 
See there's a role for everybody . 
Even for the marketing . 
But look at your role , your marketing role . 
Yeah , 
that's your role . 
Mm . 
Yes . 
Mm-hmm . 
Need to collect information . <laugh> 
Um . 
<cough> I I'm part of design , perhaps . 
Uh , what is most important in a  in a remote control ? 
What is the most important function aspect ? 
Uh . 
<laugh> That's alright . 
Yeah , it should be easy to work with . 
Yeah . 
Uh . We  maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface . 
You just tell the television I want  which channel . 
Or or you can say for example , um  <other> I want uh to list all the programme tonight . 
Y you know  , instead of  uh remote control it's doing the  some searching for you , 
so you don't have to look for the channel you want . 
Just say maybe I just want to press  I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight . 
Or a button for all the magazines , all the information  documentary tonight . 
And then you list a few , 
and I will choose from the list . 
So instead of pressing the channel number , I am choosing the programmes directly . 
Yeah , that's one way of uh making it useful . 
No , 
because  
no , 
it's not very  a lot . 
Th this information exists . 
For example you can get um <other>  
You can use uh  well for example  anything . <other> 
The <other> the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it's more natural . Yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yes , possible . 
Yeah . But  
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah , yeah . 
But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um <other> there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . 
So it's more powerful . 
Yeah . 
No . 
No , 
because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs . 
They they are  they are  they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . 
We don't care . 
We just say that this are some content . 
We just want to retrieve the content 
and then classi sort them by the types of programmes . 
Some of the websites they already provide this service , 
so we can just use the service available . 
Download it uh to the  to this remote control . 
And then there's  there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . 
The most there are only seven buttons . 
So I just choose the category one 
and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , 
so <other> you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , 
you just have six buttons , seven buttons . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Ah , yes . 
So  . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , so you don't have to display here , 
just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? 
Good idea <other> . 
Okay . 
I think I think that will be revol revolutionary <laugh> . 
Because all the T_V_ uh the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons 
and then you dunno what to choose in the end . 
Yeah . <laugh> Alright . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . 
<laugh> Five minutes . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , but we are designing just remote control . 
Okay . 
Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , 
or you just want to put the function in ? 
<laugh> Go on , draw something  . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Where is it ? 
Ah , okay . 
Where where is it ? 
Here . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Okay , alright . 
So so the most functional des mm 
the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . Right ? 
We agree on that , right ? 
Uh , uh first one is to uh <other> buttons i or it could be anything with  buttons . Uh to choose uh content s or channels . 
So we have both . 
The user can choose w which one they want , right ? 
By content or by channel . 
Choose by contents or by channels . 
And then what did we say just now ? Other than this . 
Okay , 
so technically how  the problems that  how to do it is to  how to get the content . 
Challenge . 
Okay . 
Content . 
Okay , 
so these we have to work it out . 
So this one of the problem . 
And uh <other>  
The main thing . 
Okay . Alright . 
Alright , okay . 
So we are  
we'll discuss it  
we will get some information in the next meeting , 
so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer  ? 
That's the first aspect . 
Right . 
We will  get information 
and then we'll come back in . 
 . 
Yeah , we'll come . 
Alright . 
Alright , okay . 
Thank you , 
mis <laugh>
