<laugh> 
<other> Good morning . <laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , from the account manager . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , I think so . 
<other> 
I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we  in our mail we received from the account manager . 
Uh 
No , 
I'm doing the interface . <laugh> 
Yeah I I'm I'm  
Well , maybe we have  
okay so I  industrial design . 
It was a little confusion about my uh  
but it's alright . 
Yeah . 
User . 
Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done 
and what are your ideas about the  
Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . 
So we have to <laugh> plan how how it would be developed and uh 
how we can make it work <laugh> . 
<other> 
Yeah , I dunno I  
<laugh> Yeah . 
<other> Well I I think that Norman and I would think about um the technical points 
and um we should discuss it in the next meeting , or 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Well , you have to make it work . 
<laugh> That's the <laugh> that's the big thing . 
Yeah . 
We can think about an interface with uh well  
Yeah , yeah . 
I  
I think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh I dunno 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
On the content . 
Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea 
but I I think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to  
Yeah yeah . 
Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the  Well channel programme or contents or  in an easy way , so  
Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen 
and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f 
<laugh> 
Yeah , yeah . So <other>  
I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh right so  
<laugh> Please , Norman , draw uh  
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Yeah , by content or by channel , 
it's a good idea . 
And uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel 
but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so  
I think that's the  the things to do 
and uh to uh reflect about it 
and uh discuss it in the next meeting . 
Okay . 
Thank you everybody . <laugh> 
Okay . <laugh>
