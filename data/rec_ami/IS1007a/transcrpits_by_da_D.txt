Good morning . 
Or you can put it in the shared folder . 
No , I didn't get it . 
This one . 
No . 
No ,  . 
<laugh> 
I think it's for your guys to <other> how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . 
Yeah 
<other> I think  assign your uh roles . 
For each person , yeah . 
Uh , I'm into marketing . 
 yeah 
nothing much in the project . 
Marketing in this design . 
A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface . 
Yeah , this is  . 
Yeah , that's right , 
first  .

There's a trend watching . 
Yeah . 
I mean working remotes we already have . 
This will be something different from the other remotes  remote controls .

The lighting in the room changes . 
I mean , we have a option in the remote control . 
If we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote . 
Oh , I'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel . 
The lapel . 
Yeah , that one . 
Just plug it . 
Yeah , that's right .
