C:  <other> Good morning . <laugh> 
B:  <other> Good morning . 
D:  Good morning . 
A:  <laugh> So , we are asked to to make uh uh a new remote control for television . And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . So people can  can use it without any any problem . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:   . 
C:  <other> 
A:  I don't know .

C:  Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh 
B:  Mm . B did you send us an email about this ? <laugh> 
A:  Uh , not yet , but if you want  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , we we received an email about this uh d designs . <laugh> 
A:  Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Ah it's Okay . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Or  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Or you can put it in the shared folder . 
B:  Yeah , you see the email ? You  email . The v very  no , no the first one . It's inside . 
D:  No , I didn't get it . 
A:  Uh  
D:  This one . No . 
B:  No , no . The third one . Oh , you didn't get anything . 
D:  No ,  . 
B:  It's strange . <laugh> <other> Mm . <other> I got an email about the dis about the discussion . Yeah . 
A:   . You get email ,  . <laugh> 
B:  I dunno from who . <laugh> From the account manager . You have received the same email , right ? Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , from the account manager . Yeah . 
D:  I think it's for your guys to <other> how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , I think so . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


B:  Yeah , so each of us has a role to do . 
D:  Yeah <other> I think  assign your uh roles . 
A:  S 
B:  In each  We already have our role . 
A:  For each for each one . 
D:  For each person , yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 'Kay , we can  
A:  So there are  so we have three  f yeah . We have functional design , conceptual design , and detail design . 
B:  So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . Okay , alright . <laugh> 
A:  So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? 
C:  <other> I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we  in our mail we received from the account manager . 
B:  <other> Yeah , yeah . 
C:  Uh 
B:  I'm doing the interface . 
A:  You are doing th 
C:  No , I'm doing the interface . <laugh> 
A:   . 
B:  Are you using the  you are doing the in  
C:  Yeah I I'm I'm  Well , maybe we have  okay so I  industrial design . It was a little confusion about my uh  but it's alright . 
B:  Ah <other>  
A:  <other> 
B:  Okay . 
A:  Okay , I'll for industrial design . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . And and you  Norman ? 
B:  Mm ? Um working on i . <laugh> 
C:  User . 
B:  User interface . <laugh> 
A:  And  And  
D:  Uh , I'm into marketing .  yeah nothing much in the project . 
A:   doing the marketing . Nothing related here to the  
D:  Marketing in this design . A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface . 
B:  Yes . 
A:  <other> 
B:  You see the second mail ? Yeah , it's inside . Go down . Appendix . 
D:  Yeah , this is  . 
B:  See there's a role for everybody . 
D:  Yeah , that's right , first  . 
B:  Even for the marketing . 
D:   us user define . 
A:  Next  . 
B:  But look at your role , your marketing role . 
D:  There's a trend watching . 
A:  I don't know . I  . 
B:  Yeah , that's your role . 
topic_description:	project specs and roles of participants_None


C:  Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the  
A:  <other> About the design or  Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? 
C:  Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  So we have to <laugh> plan how how it would be developed and uh 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  how we can make it work <laugh> . 
B:  Yes . 
D:  I mean working remotes we already have . This will be something different from the other remotes  remote controls . 
C:  <other> Yeah , I dunno I  
A:  What we we have to keep in mind the  these characteristics . And of course it should not be very costly . 
D:  Yeah , that's right . 
A:  So  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  <other> Well I I think that Norman and I would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting , or 
B:  Need to collect information . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  About the  about what ? 
B:  Um . <cough> I I'm part of design , perhaps . 
topic_description:	discussion_None


B:  Uh , what is most important in a  in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ? Uh . 
A:  You mean the external  or  
C:  Well , you have to make it work . <laugh> That's the <laugh> that's the big thing . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah of g of course . 
B:  <laugh> That's alright . Yeah , it should be easy to work with . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah  . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  We can think about an interface with uh well  
B:  Uh . We  maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface . You just tell the television I want  which channel . Or or you can say for example , um  
A:  You won't  
B:  <other> I want uh to list all the programme tonight . Y you know  , instead of  uh remote control it's doing the  some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . Just say maybe I just want to press  I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight . Or a button for all the magazines , all the information  documentary tonight . And then you list a few , and I will choose from the list . So instead of pressing the channel number , I am choosing the programmes directly . Yeah , that's one way of uh making it useful . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . 
B:  No , because  no , it's not very  a lot . Th this information exists . For example you can get um <other>  
A:  S <other> Like s uh you you you say we can use speech . 
B:  You can use uh  well for example  anything . <other> The <other> the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it's more natural . Yeah . 
C:  I  I think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh I dunno 
D:  I'm a  okay . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  I mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control . If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with  trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . 
A:  In the hand . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Yes , possible . Yeah . But  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  And I could talk to the T_V_  television itself . I need not have an  
A:  Except if if you are far from the T_V_ . 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  I mean we have some  or something , different technology but  
A:  This is <laugh> it's  
B:  Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um <other> there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . So it's more powerful . 
C:  On the content . 
D:  Mm-hmm , yeah . 
C:  Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea but I I think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to  
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah . No . No , because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs . They they are  they are  they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . We don't care . We just say that this are some content . We just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes . Some of the websites they already provide this service , so we can just use the service available . Download it uh to the  to this remote control . And then there's  there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . The most there are only seven buttons . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so <other> you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . 
C:  Yeah yeah . 
A:  Mm . Yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons . 
C:  Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the  
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  This is  good idea . 
B:  Yeah . Ah , yes . So  . 
C:  Well channel programme or contents or  in an easy way , so  
B:  Yeah . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? Good idea <other> . 
C:  Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f 
B:  Okay . I think I think that will be revol revolutionary <laugh> . Because all the T_V_ uh the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . Yeah . <laugh> Alright . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah , yeah . So <other>  I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff 
B:  Okay . 
A:  So we have five minutes to  
B:  Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . <laugh> Five minutes . 
A:  Ah you can y you can you can use it if you  so , can we 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of  
B:  Okay . Okay . 
D:  So , I mean , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh <other> some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . The lighting in the room changes . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  S 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , but we are designing just remote control . 
A:  You  it  . 
D:  I mean , we have a option in the remote control . If we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote . 
B:  Okay . 
C:  Oh right so  
B:  Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? <laugh> Go on , draw something  . 
A:  Yeah . If if you you you can if you want you can use th the  . 
C:  <laugh> Please , Norman , draw uh  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh , I'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel . 
B:  Mm . Where is it ? 
D:  The lapel . 
A:  Or before the before the the design that says  . 
B:  Ah , okay . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Where where is it ? Here . 
D:  Yeah , that one . Just plug it . Yeah , that's right . 
A:  Norman . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  Be before before writing you can uh sit and that says  what we what we said then after that you can you can use the  . Yeah . 
B:  Mm . Okay , alright . So so the most functional des mm the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . Right ? We agree on that , right ? Uh , uh first one is to uh <other> buttons i or it could be anything with  buttons . Uh to choose 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Okay . Yeah . 
B:  uh content s or channels . So we have both . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? 
C:  Yeah , by content or by channel , it's a good idea . 
B:  By content or by channel . Choose by contents or by channels . So  And then what did we say just now ? Other than this . 
C:  And uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents . 
A:  Mm . 
B:  Okay , so technically how  the problems that  how to do it is to  how to get the content . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  Challenge . 
C:  I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so  
B:  Okay . Content . Okay , so these we have to work it out . So this one of the problem .

B:  And uh <other>  
C:  I think that's the  the things to do and uh to uh 
B:  The main thing . Okay . Alright . 
C:  reflect about it and uh 
B:  Alright , okay . So we are  we'll discuss it  we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer  ? That's the first aspect . Right . 
C:  discuss it in the next meeting . 
B:  We will  get information and then we'll come back in . 
C:  Okay . 
B:   . 
C:  Thank you everybody . <laugh> 
A:  Okay . <laugh> So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? 
B:  Yeah , we'll come . 
A:  And we'll discuss the other other aspects . 
B:  Alright . Alright , okay .
