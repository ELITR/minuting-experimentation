<laugh> 
Are we  
we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better ? 
Okay , that's fine . 
Am I supposed to be standing up there ? 
Okay . 
Yeah , I've got  <laugh> 
Yes . 
<laugh> 
Okay . <other> 
Hello everybody . 
Um I'm Sarah , 
the Project Manager 
and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . 
Okay , this is our agenda , um <other> 
we will do some stuff , 
get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . 
Um then we'll go do tool training , 
talk about the project plan , 
discuss our own ideas and everything um 
and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , 
as far as I can understand . 
Now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know . 
Um , we want it to be original , 
something that's uh  people haven't thought of , 
that's not out in the shops , 
um , trendy , 
appealing to a wide market , 
but you know , not a hunk of metal , 
and user-friendly , 
grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . 
Okay , um , first is the functional design , 
um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , 
um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , 
um what effects the product has to have 
and how it's actually going to do that . 
Um , conceptual design , 
what we're thinking , 
how it's gonna go 
and then the detailed design , 
how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work . 
Okay , right . 
We're gonna practice with the pens 
and draw our favourite animal on the white board , 
I'll go first , 
and um sum up the characteristics of that animal . 
So  
Okay , I'll leave space for everyone else . Um  
What's missing ? 
We're running out of blue . 
Okay . 
I'm not gonna ask you to guess , 
I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger . 
And I see them as majestic , and independent , and proud . 
Now , who would like to go next ? 
'Kay . 
Is that your lapel then ? 
There you go . 
<other> 
Okay , thank you . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Okay . 
Well , as you can see , the quality of the work today is um  
 <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Gonna be a bird . 
Is it gonna be  
<laugh> it's gonna be a bird . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
That's lovely . 
Okay <laugh> it's fine . 
<laugh> 
Technical help . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> Okay , yeah . 
A seagu 
right , 
not a seagull <laugh> . 
<laugh> Eagle . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
That's lovely . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
That was fun , 
right . 
Um finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros , 
which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds , at all . 
Any ideas ? 
D fifteen ? 
Seventeen . 
Okay , that's expensive . 
I think so , I think so , 
I'll be able to um pull it up , 
or I could put it in the shared folder or something . 
Really ? 
Mm . 
I think  
Yeah , 
um production cost's at twelve fifty , so 
half of the selling price is taken up by building it . 
Um , and profit aim is fifty million Euros , 
which is uh  
Yi yes , 
um yeah , I presume so . Um  
Mm-hmm . 
No , 
yeah . 
So  
yes , yes , 
I don't think we have to  
I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , 
um making that a key point , 
just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that . 
Okay . 
What are your experiences with remote controls ? 
I mean I've got  we got um  we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up 
so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , 
but that kept losing the signals 
so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . 
I think it was quite a cheapie as well , 
so that might have had something to do with it , 
but that was quite good , the fact that you could  You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you . 
Mm . 
Yeah , 
the main  that's the main stuff anyway , I mean 
 and you don't want to  
I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do 
and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that . 
Yeah . 
<other> Um . 
When they're  
when you've got the main things on the front of it 
and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it . 
'Cause it doesn't make  when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at , 
it's obvious what you're doing , um . 
What about the older generation ? 
What about granny and grandads ? 
Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , 
but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that . 
I don't think they tape things , 
I don't think they use  
Mm , yeah , the age gap . 
Mm . 
I don't know , 
I d 
I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system . 
I find it really confusing , 
I kept getting lost <other> in the phone , 
I di I've not got a new one 
but uh my friend got a new one 
and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , 
but that's just me . 
Yeah . 
Teletext has got that option as well . 
Yeah . 
Or what about kind of a dual function ? 
In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things 
and also  and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that . 
Mm-hmm . 
I think that's a cost thing , 
I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about  
Yes , no that's important . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Um , right , okay 
we've got half an hour before the next meeting , 
so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . Um 
I think that's probably about it 
and then we'll come back and liaise again 
and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation . 
Sure . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
I would  
it would probably . 
I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . 
They're kind of moulded 
and look a bit different , 
and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , 
which looks a bit smarter , 
so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about . 
Okay , so let's break it up there . 
Okay ? 
So , see you in half an hour . 
I think so , yeah .
