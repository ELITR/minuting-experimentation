So we've got both of these clipped on ? 
She gonna answer me or not ? 
Right , both of them , okay . 
God . 
Jesus , it's gonna fall off  . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
A kind of dog ? 
Sorry ? 
Uh . 
Mm-hmm . 
Please , please leave me a space at the bottom , 
I'm little , 
you can get to the top , with standing on a chair . 
<laugh> 
I think it's outstandingly good . <laugh> 
Crocodile ? 
<laugh> 
O 
<laugh> 
Beauti that's  
<laugh> Okay . 
Um , I'm very impressed with your artistic skills , 
mine's  are dreadful . 
Oops this is now coming apart , 
let me just put the top in . 
I hope that clicks in , 
I'll just  I'll hold it on , okay . 
Oops , oh dear , 
what happened there ? 
Hopefully that'll stay on , 
two-handed version . 
Okay , uh  
Again this is off the top of my head , 
I was gonna do a big cat too , um . 
Oh dear , 
it doesn't look what like what I want it to be <laugh> . 
Uh . 
It's not a vampire bat honestly <laugh> . 
Uh and somewhere there's a body behind . 
That's my dreadful  
that's the worst yet , 
that's  
it's meant to be an eagle <laugh> 
you can tell it's a flying animal <laugh> 
could have been a seagull , 
I never thought of a seagull . 
An eagle , um again I'm thinking on my feet goodness . 
I suppose they're all so independent , 
I'd put that one down again . 
<other> Da dum um . 
Indepen independent , right , 
did you say they're good at golf ? 
Are they ? 
Oh . Oh right , okay , 
I'm not good at golf . 
I'd say they're quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing . 
And uh , birds of prey aren't they , 
oh dear , 
intrepid . I'll put that , intrepid . 
There we go , 
hope that pen's gonna be okay . 
Whoops . 
Seventeen . 
Seventeen Pounds . 
Should we be making notes of this ? 
We can just refer to this later can't we ? 
Yeah , okay . 
Okay . 
Right . 
So 
so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , 
we d or 
or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ? 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
In our first year ? 
Mm-hmm . 
You've got market range international 
and you did say earlier it's got to be a  um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups 
just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone 
 user-friendly to everyone . 
Okay . 
Big target group <laugh> . 
No . 
Mm . 
Alright . 
Mm-hmm . 
Right . 
Mm-hmm . 
My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , 
not doing any tampering with it and programming , 
using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . 
But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , 
I don't think I could go any further with it than that , 
so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
And symbols that you don't necessarily understand , 
symbols you're meant to understand that you don't . 
Oh yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Actually that just raises a point , 
I wonder what our design people think , 
but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , 
I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , 
so you've got a little L_C_D_ display . 
With menus , yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ? 
Right . 
Right . 
So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , 
that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , 
Mm-hmm . 
Right . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ? 
Obviously it displays less on the screen , 
it displays less on the screen 
but as long as they can read it that's the main thing . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control 
so that when you flip over the top , your screen is  you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over . 
Yeah ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , like smaller . 
And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , 
it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ? 
Something that's easily moulded and produced . 
Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys . <laugh> 
Ah right . 
Okay . 
Sure b 
y yeah . 
But  yeah , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know <other> 
th that was my main point , 
we don't have to use metal , 
I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper , 
I presume it would . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
Right . 
Okay . 
'Kay . 
Do we go back to our room ? Yep ?
