<laugh> 
Probably . Technical pa I would think . 
Ha . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I don't wanna say . Louder . <laugh> Yeah . 
Can also be on the side . 
<laugh> No , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been  not be damaged or anything , and it'd be accessible all the time to voice . 
Yeah . 
Compliments to the artist . 
Uh <laugh> . 
<other> 
Well , the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we've we've talked about on the previous meetings . 
Now it goes into this next phase as the financial uh marketing uh  
<laugh> 
Well we haven't come to mine yet , so <laugh> 
we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion , yes . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> Well , it just depends on if we're gonna add a <other> o 
on this pr provisionary cost analysis , we do not have a L_C_ display . 
L_C_ display is gonna be very expensive , 
it's gonna be  
It's not  it doesn't say . 
We don't have the price up there , 
okay , so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote , now we're up around about twelve , twelve and a half as to what uh the company had initially uh requested . Um  
Display in . 
But as far as production um I'm putting up a question 
because we're talking about profit also , 
and in mine you'll see uh <other> the problem with uh our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera 
because that  has to be taken in into consideration . 
Uh this is just production cost , it is not uh advertising cost , it's not transportation cost uh  
<other> And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh  the cost of the unit for the company . 
So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit , we're gonna have to go a long ways . 
<other> Yes . 
Slightly . 
It's gonna be very hard to reduce . 
That's not bad . <laugh> 
If we can go to to my display . 
And we'll come back to yours 
just to give everybody an idea of the market . 
So now I'm gonna scare everybody out of this project . <laugh> 
If I'm still here . 
 
Yep 
The four gives me  
it's gotta be uh TrendWatch . 
No . 
It shouldn't be 
if it's not  it's not the right one . 
No , no we g no , that's the same one . 
You have to go back and find another one . 
Whatever name it popped up under . 
Uh functional , try functional , 
it might not be it either , but we'll see . 
Yep , that's it . 
So we'll go screen by screen . 
Although <other> 
since uh we need to have some type of idea on a market uh we had independent study that says it  this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . 
Okay ? 
Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million 
which is approximately the same as the independent study . 
So if we continue , 
we'll look at the findings . 
Next screen . 
<other> Which means that uh if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year , 
which is actually a tremendous amount . 
No kidding , yeah . 
So , 
if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro , 
okay , we're already in that that price , okay , 
with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav  gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers . 
Twenty-five percent of the market to get to two million units . 
At two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit . 
Okay ? 
So , obviously we w w 
I just did a run down the evaluation of the form , 
the fan uh the fancy stylishness of the  of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these . 
Now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production . 
Or we project this over two years , 
but being that the market changes very very quickly , maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now . 
So , now we have to come up with a decision . 
Can the company sell two million units ? 
Can it sell it for fifty Euros ? 
 
S Upscale technology . 
<laugh> Well . 
There are several companies that have gone that way . 
Weight , the feel of the product , but  
There are several that have gone through with the watches , too . 
You can customise a watch , 
you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production , 
you can change it uh  
There's a lot of online that's  that is doing this now . 
And when you're rotating , you'll look behind and look this way uh 
 it's possible to do with this , 
maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could <other> you know , feasibili feasibility uh lower the price of the unit . 
Well , obviously . 
Mm that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea , 
to see  get get their  
I think we pretty much covered everything . 
Well , then it may not be . 
Like people don't like wood . <laugh> 
 very specific . 
Hmm . 
Right before the Eur <laugh> the World Cup . <laugh> World soccer . World Cup soccer , 
they need those things that they have their hands g occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control . 
<laugh> 
<other> Or any major sports . 
Yeah , I'm the one who takes the heat . 
<laugh> If it's a flop , it's the marketer . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yes . Yes . 
Stress . <laugh> 
Celebration . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> Very good . 
Thank you very much . 
<cough> <laugh> Bye-bye . 
Yep , okay , see you later on . <laugh>
