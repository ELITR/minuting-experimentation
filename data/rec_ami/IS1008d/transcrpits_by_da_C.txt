Yeah . 
Thanks . 
Mm , okay . 
I've done a presentation , 
but it pretty much covers work that we've both done , 
so if I'm missing anything , Christine can just correct me . 
<laugh> 
It's not the biggest PowerPoint presentation in the world , but  
Three . 
Um . 
<other> No it's  
think it's the last one . 
No , 
then this is <laugh> 
the la yeah , that one , final design . 
It is named appropriately , you just couldn't see the name . 
<laugh> Um okay , can I have the mouse ? 
Thanks . 
Alright , so 
from  when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , 
the material that we chose was wood , 
and uh the colour would be customisable , 
'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . 
Um , 
so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , 
and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , 
if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off . 
<laugh> Um , so 
<other> to unveil our lovely product . 
This is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see . 
So if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display . 
<laugh> Um , this is actually hard to do . 
The yellow button you have is the on off button , 
so it's really big , hard to miss . 
You have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . 
So up  volume up , down  volume down . 
The green are the channel changing . 
<other> S And it's one of those very light , very touchable displays . 
And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , 
and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_ , 
and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . 
So this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time . 
So . 
<other> Oh yes . 
Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing 
and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . 
So that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control . 
Yeah . 
But it shouldn't be under the flip either , 
because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice . 
But if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ? 
I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , I can just use my voice . 
Yeah . 
And you don't wanna let go of either one . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
I mean it doesn't have to be on the flip , 
it can be on the side somewhere . 
Yeah . 
So , I mean I can pass this around if anyone wants to  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah , exactly . 
Yes . 
And maybe the shape of the buttons , 
the little egg shapes aren't the most economical , but  
Yeah . I mean this is plasticene . 
There's only so much you can do . 
We could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well . 
<other> But  
And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , 
because they don't feel like they have enough control over it . 
So I mean maybe this is excessively heavy , 
but I think it needs to have some weight , 
it needs to feel like you're still holding something . 
<other> So that's pretty much it for our presentation actually . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
No we do , but it's not filled in . 
It's number thirty . 
Oh , yeah , yeah , 
you're right , sorry , yes . 
Um-hmm . 
Yes . 
<laugh> 
That's  no , I think it's the same one . 
Functional . 
It looks like it , 
there's  <other> 
S Yeah . 
Um-hmm . 
Mm . 
<other> I was thinking the same thing , yeah . 
Directly . 
Um-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
You can do a shipping centre somewhere , 
or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs . 
Yeah . 
That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable , 
'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see maybe what other people have done , what the range of possibility as , 
whereas if you're in a store , you can't  unless you're a highly imaginative person , you may not really know what it is you want , 
whereas on the web , if you have a bunch of pictures , it can sort of trigger ideas and  
Yeah . 
The weight and feel . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yes . 
Mm-hmm . 
What turnaround time do we have ? 
'Cause I mean production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use  
it's not a trivial task . 
No no . 
We definitely shouldn't do it in our factory . <laugh> 
What ab 
<other> Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently . 
<laugh> 
The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of . 
No , but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up . 
Yes , but I'm not everybody . 
I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need . 
We have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , 
but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell . 
Yeah , of course . 
I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short  
well you have no redesign  not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and  
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , that's a good idea . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> That's actually good place to advertise it too . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
It's just something to to keep in mind , 
'cause it's really really important . 
A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped , 
when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy . 
<laugh> Really ? 
<laugh> That I didn't know . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
<laugh> Exactly . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Thanks 
<laugh>  <laugh> 
Bye .
