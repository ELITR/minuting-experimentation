No , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . 
Yeah , you have to you have to close that window . 
'Cause that's the save one isn't it , so  
And then find it . 
<other> 
<other> 
You pass it round to have a look . 
<laugh> Mm very nice . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> So it is , yeah . 
Cherry would be alright actually . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Copyright , yeah . 
What's this this one ? 
What's that one there ? 
Oh , okay . Right . 
<laugh> 
Uh-huh . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
I'll see if I can find them . 
Have  
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Right . 
<other> 
<other> So if you had to do a presentation or  will you just work it on the prototype ? 
That's the pr 
Okay . 
 we should  plug it in . 
Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one . 
We could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype . 
Well do we'll do it on the prototype , 
so do two , 
see how much it is . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
I think you just do one , don't you , for the  
I think I think it's just it's just a one . Else  
I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons  made in a different material , rather than per button . 
I don't know though . 
Hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
You've just gone off the window into another one . 
It's on the bottom row . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
we have to have it  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first , 
and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ? 
Okay . Right um , 
I have a little thing . 
So , we've all got a note of  it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on . 
Yeah , 
I just had a presentation to do . <loud exhale> 
Mm-hmm . Mm . <other> 
Right okay um , 
This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here . 
And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , 
and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . 
And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , 
and also finance , I guess . 
<other> And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , 
so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four . 
So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . 
Um so , We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . 
Um  The  whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . 
Whether it's easy to use . 
Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . 
And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product . 
And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently , 
so <laugh> I'll go over here . <loud exhale> 
Right . 
So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . 
So if we do a sort of a one  
So  
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
<other> 
Of  but I think  
What  Is one false , or is t one true ? 
I forgot . 
One's true , and okay . Seven's fal 
Four is neutral , okay . 
So  
Right . 
Okay . Right . 
I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space . 
So , false is seven , true is one , and  
So uh say about a two for fancy , 
you think ? 
Okay . 
Okay , well d you do an average at the end , I don't know . Um  
Uh-huh . 
This this is just this is just for like the look . 
Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . So  
Yeah , 
so that  
so sh should we go for a a two on that ? 
'Kay . 
And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? 
D yeah . 
Okay . 
So , what about the pr The prototype as it is , 
we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we . 
But not the kinetic . 
Alright , so  
So it doesn't  
It's pretty  
The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the  
<other> 
Okay . Yeah . 
Right , okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
S 
I'm just gonna check my email . <laugh> 
I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product . 
Okay . But I  
Okay . 
Yeah . 
<other>  , I just read the email again 
and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is , I think , 
so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design . 
I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or . 
So , I mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 
'cause we've got both the both the um the speech  
Yeah . 
Yeah . Um , for for innovation , so we've got the speech the speech thing , and  
Do you reckon a two ? 
<other> Okay . Two . 
And the next one is  
I'll have to get it back up now . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Um  
Say about a three maybe ? 
It's a two . 
Yeah , this is  
This  
Yeah . 
<other> So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that . 
So  sort of  Is it sort of a recognisable product . 
Does it fit in with our other other products , 
which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
What do y 
Yeah . 
Uh-huh . 
So  
Two or three ? 
Yeah . 
Two or three . <laugh> 
<laugh> How  
Two . Okay . 
Right . 
Yeah . 
<other> Yeah we s yeah , 
I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be  
I'm just gonna do this in my head . 
One point eight isn't it or something . 
<laugh> I think , anyway . 
So yeah , pretty close to a two . 
So  
So it's  I mean it's pretty good at the moment , 
but it's gonna get worse , isn't it . 
But we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad . 
<loud exhale> 
Yeah . 
Do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the the finances <loud exhale> 
I'm not sure . 
Yeah . 
 it's come on already . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Different different colours , yeah . 
Yeah , I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case . 
<other> Lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but  
And then  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour 
'cause it's just two supplements , you know . 
One original colour and then sort of two supplements , I think maybe . 
Okay . 
So we only ne we only need two for that . 
'Cause I mean these these are moulded . 
The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas uh of rubber , isn't it . 
Right . 
Yeah , that  
<laugh> 
Okay , so tha 
So shall we do a  Well , um  
Yeah . 
Yeah , so  
Uh  
So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be <other> a different shape . 
Like we got a cherry one . 
Maybe other ones could be something else shaped . 
<other> I don't know . 
That would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different  <other> seeing as we've got , you know , we've made it a a special form , so 
 And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one . 
And it would sort of , you know , keep it quite fancy as well , 
I don't know . 
Well you could  
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<other> Yeah , I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something , maybe . <laugh> 
Okay . 
So , we've  what have we what have we rid of . 
We got rid of the plastic . 
Is it  
The rubber . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But uh  
So I mean , we've got  we got rid of the rubber case , 
but we've now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . 
So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe . 
So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And what about the sort of innovation ? 
Do you think  
<other> Okay . 
<other> And then , the corporate identity . 
Yeah . 
Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity , I don't know . <laugh> 
I mean , it's maybe not . I mean  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Okay , well I mean  
We cou 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Hey , what what what's the company colour ? 
Did you get told what the company colour is or  
Oh right . 
Hmm . 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . <other> 
Okay . 
Uh-huh . 
'Cause you've got sort of  
we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to . 
Another colour . 
Or would that be t 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Shall we save the point two for profitability then ? <laugh> 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
I mean it's the sort of thing that , I mean , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . 
So , if it's dead obvious , then that's fine . 
But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying a bit more attention . 
So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important . 
'Cause you  
Yeah . 
So  
Yeah , 
I mean so we've dropped the cost , but  
Same sort of function ? The criteria ? 
It's alright . 
<laugh> Just made a load of money . <laugh> 
Well , but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons . 
<laugh>  le lemon sh 
I think  
well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something . <laugh> 
Or something like that . Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Did  did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? 
Or was it the other way around ? 
Right , okay . 
Yeah . 
So that  
so we've saved 
<laugh> 
Saved two Euros on that . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Well , we're aiming for um one for all of them . 
M but it really has to fit into the budget , 
so  I guess we just have to adjust things to get it i in the  
Which is fair enough . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I think 
most  
Yeah . 
Yep . 
<other> I don't know . 
What's on the agenda ? 
Uh-huh . 
<laugh> 
Finish your meeting now . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Oh . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary . 
Yeah . 
Well , we were finding out various things in <other> in be in-between the meetings , 
and they didn't  the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one , you know , 
sort of  we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , 
and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that . 
You know , you'd sort of  you'd probably present it at one or something like that . 
Yeah . 
Uh-huh . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , the thing itself . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
But  think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . 
I mean it depends what sort of business you're in , I guess . 
I mean this one seems  . From the website it looks  it's quite innovative , 
but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we 
that's , you know , fifteen quid . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
 I mean if you look at their products on their website here , Real Reaction , I mean it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge . 
And  
Yeah . Yeah . 
 we did find a new idea , 
I mean sort of a kinetic remote control . 
I've never seen one of them before . 
 batteries , I think . So  
Mm yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
That went okay , yeah . 
Mm-hmm , yeah . 
<other> 
<other> I don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything  
Well , I mean I don't think it  I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products . 
I mean , they've got all these sort of , you know , high definition D_V_D_ and portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens , 
and uh I'm thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in . 
Surely they they should produ 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
It worked . 
Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but  <laugh> 
I think there's a little there's a little um chi 
There's a little there's a little chip , 
I think you must plug it into something 
and it produces a  
I don't know . 
Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something , 
and  Page after page . 
Yeah . 
Kinetic powered remote control . Um , 
what was the other one ? 
Vo yeah . 
<yawn> 
Voice recognition , yeah . S 
Almost . 
<laugh> To fill in these fill in these questionnaires 
Oh no . 
<laugh> 
Hmm ? 
I think that we've got two questionnaires 
and a report on the last meeting .
