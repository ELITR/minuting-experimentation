A:  So is  Why not save that . 
D:  No , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . 
A:    Do you want to replace existing file , no . <nasal sound> I actually tried to transfer it to My Documents , but  
D:  Yeah , you have to you have to close that window . 'Cause that's the save one isn't it , so  And then find it . 
A:   spreadsheet . 
D:  <other> 
A:  <other> Yeah , but I've ta uh right , I'll just re-do it . That's the easiest way . <rhythmic exhalation> 
D:  <other> 
A:  <loud exhalation> Right . 


C:  Well we've made our prototype anyway . We can have a good look at that . <laugh> 
D:  You pass it round to have a look . 
C:  <other> Mm-hmm . Y no , it's a slightly curved around the sides . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Mm very nice . 
C:  Um , it's almost curved like up to the main display as well . And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit  the panel that you pull down . And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . And we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
B:  We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top . <laugh>  <laugh> 
D:  <other> So it is , yeah . Cherry would be alright actually . Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah , it's a bit more fun , isn't it ? And it's kinda not really at a kind of  you think apple , you think computers , like Apple Mac . 
B:  Yeah , yeah , we might get a  
D:  Mm-hmm . Copyright , yeah . What's this this one ? What's that one there ? 
C:  Yeah , and cherries are fun , summery . Ah , that's the mute . 
D:  Oh , okay . Right . 
B:  For the M_ . <laugh> 
C:   <other> It  it'd probably have to be labelled mute . But um , we didn't have anything small enough to write . 
D:  <laugh> Uh-huh . 
B:  They're thinking  
D:  Okay . 
B:  For the first time , well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons . 
D:  Mm-hmm . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Uh , we just chose simple shapes for all them . Um , the important ones are the volume ones . So we made them a bit bigger . The mute could possibly be a bit smaller . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Hum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you've got the volume in orange on design there , and the the channel is in blue . 
C:  <other> <cough> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  R right . Um , all these things have cost implications . And so when I done my thing on cost <laugh> a  I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button . 
C:  Yeah , and we chose a V_ plus and V_ minus . 
A:  So  However , I've now  . <laugh> But um , <other> yeah so uh but there would be a cost implication on that , and uh  as I suppose that <other> so whether <other> wanted to put in all these colours , would be uh open to debate , I suppose . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  I'll see if I can find them . 
B:  Yeah , sis 
C:  Well the colours wouldn't  like that's  they wouldn't be too important , but we didn't have any white Play-Doh . <laugh> So that's where the colour buttons came from . <laugh> 
D:  Have  
A:  <laugh> An important consideration . <laugh> Right , okay so um  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> And the second one underneath would be the idea for the  
B:  Yes , we'll have the slide-away . 


A:  Right , okay . So we've got um detail design meeting . 
B:  Bottom . 
A:  Right . So  So , we've got <other> prototype presentation , which we've just done , evaluation criteria , um and finance , so I guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various uh aspects that we're looking for uh from um our previous meeting . So other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer , but um obviously obviously it would . <laugh> But other than that , we got the red apple . We got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons , and <other> the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance . <other> And the <other> and the cost implication . The only snag about this is that uh 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  <cough> 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yes , yes . 
D:  Right . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  <other> the cost is probably kind of important . So um , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture . Um , 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  <other> 
A:  and whether it would uh  
D:  <other> So if you had to do a presentation or  will you just work it on the prototype ? 
C:  Uh , that's it . <laugh> 
B:  This this is a  yes , this is our presentation of the prototype . 
D:  That's the pr Okay . 


A:  Right , so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost  aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half  uh twelve and a half Euros . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  So , there's no redesign . So that should uh  Right , so , seems to me that the thing that I have to do is is quickly find that uh  
B:  Could we get this on the board just so we can see  or do you mean do you have the figures there ? 
D:   we should  plug it in . Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one . 
A:  Right . Okay . 
B:  'Kay , Alice . So , sh 
D:  We could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype . 
A:  Right .  . 
B:  'Kay this should be then . 
A:  <other> Okay , so , by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved case . We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements . So , we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and  
B:  Mm-hmm . <other> Have a push button interface . 
A:  Okay . W the button supplements . Well , originally , I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple . But  So the so the real w the real question then would come in . Do you make all the buttons  
B:  Um  Um  
D:  Well do we'll do it on the prototype , so do two , see how much it is . 
A:  O Well , so we've got one special button form , which was the apple . Everything else is gonna be a standard . We've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that , so , I was  <other> originally , I was thinking  rubber wasn't special , but according to this , maybe it is . <other> So  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . And then we'd have  
D:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
A:  And the r I mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there . 
D:  Yeah . I think you just do one , don't you , for the  
A:  W <other> I don't know <laugh> is <laugh> is <laugh> is the sort of answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore  I mean , what's the op The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore  
D:  I think I think it's just it's just a one . Else  
A:  Whereas it would be  the special colour would be for the  So you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic . 
D:  I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons  made in a different material , rather than per button . 
A:  <other> Mm . I would <other> <stammering sound>  Every design change is uh  <stammering sound> I dunno , um  <laugh> Okay , um , if 
D:  I don't know though . Hmm . 
A:  we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , I guess . We'd have one special colour and one special button form . And 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  when I plugged that in last time   remember it has to be under twelve and a half . As far as I know , that um <other> that took care of the uh of the various supplements . And if  What happened ? <laugh> 
D:  Mm-hmm . You've just gone off the window into another one . It's on the bottom row . 
C:  Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box . Yeah . 
A:  Now , right . <laugh> Okay , so , but the point would be that if we uh if 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  we just did special  Sorry , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there . Okay 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  . So 
B:  So that's nine point one there so we've got some  
A:  it  Well , is it s is  no , it's nine point seven I've got . Okay . So 
B:  'Kay . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Just give us a bit of  
A:  , that would <other> that would work out fine if uh uh 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  as assuming your correction are are <other>  assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we we had uh planned to put on  . Uh-huh 
D:  Mm-hmm . <other> 
C:  S 
B:  I  switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor . 


D:  Mm-hmm . Mm . <other> Right okay um , This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here . And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess . 
C:  <cough> 
D:  <other> And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four . So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . Um so , We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . Um  The  whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . Whether it's easy to use . Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product . And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently , so <laugh> I'll go over here . <loud exhale> 
B:  Okay . 
D:  Right . So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . So if we do a sort of a one  So  
B:  Okay , well we have a single curve , which was  maybe like the feel of the product's quite good . So uh  
D:  Yeah . Okay . 
B:  Um , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Um , <other> sorry that'd be considered fancy . 
D:  <other> 
C:  Yeah , I'd maybe give it a a two . 
D:  Of  but I think  What  Is one false , or is t one true ? I forgot . One's true , and okay . Seven's fal Four is neutral , okay . So  
C:  One's true . And a four is neutral . 
B:  So maybe  maybe a two . 
C:  Yeah , 'cause we haven't got the double curve , so we can't like say it's completely true . <laugh> But it's pretty close . We've got almost everything we can . 
A:  Go for one . <laugh> Yep . Okay 
D:  Right . Okay . Right . I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space . 
A:  . Yeah 
D:  So , false is seven , true is one , and  So uh say about a two for fancy , you think ? Okay . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  , why not not , m m maybe nearer three . Two 
D:  Okay , well d you do an average at the end , I don't know . Um  
A:  three . Well , it's just that uh saying something  <other> remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got uh various other things you could have , and we're not going for these options . Mm-hmm 
D:  Uh-huh . This this is just this is just for like the look . Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . So  
A:  . <other> Okay 
C:  Yeah , I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit . 
D:  Yeah , so that  so sh should we go for a a two on that ? 
A:  . No 
D:  'Kay . And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? 
B:  Um ,  deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition . 
D:  D yeah . Okay . So , what about the pr The prototype as it is , we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we . 
B:  Um  But not the kinetic . 
D:  But not the kinetic . 
B:  Like the power . 
A:  . 'Cause you can't afford that  w we took that out too . Didn't 
B:  No , we c ca yeah , we can't afford both . 
D:  Alright , so  
A:  you ? Or  Well 
D:  So it doesn't  It's pretty  The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the  
B:  No may is  maybe about neutral plus it it it's got something , but it hasn't got  
C:  Maybe a three . 
D:  <other> Okay . Yeah . 


A:  , wait a minute . In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . So , it's very much dependant on what you do with your options . And 
C:  I would give it more than a four . 
B:  Right . Okay . 
D:  Right , okay . 
A:  if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then  because that <other> the other functions we've got in are are more at the <other>  The special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if 
B:  'Kay . 
A:  you go for that , th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . Now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors  speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . And 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker , and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two , which would be  come from the button supplements category . Um 
B:  Um  
D:  S I'm just gonna check my email . <laugh> I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product . 
C:  How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . And then it stand the test of time better . 
A:  , interface type um , well plastic rather than rubber . <other> That that that would make the significant difference . You could either <other> you could have it  If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get  you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two . So you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . And that would enable you to to do it . Yeah 
D:  Okay . But I  
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Okay . 


B:  So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so  
A:  . Ye 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Well 
D:  <other>  , I just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is , I think , so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design . I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or . 
A:  , okay , but  It's 
C:  Well , I suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it . 
A:  rubber as it is , yes . We 
D:  So , I mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we've got both the both the um 
A:  got  we've we've got thirteen point seven and we've got it in at the moment and if  and basically , we're going to reduce down from that . But the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too  <other> <other> 
D:  the speech  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Um , for for innovation , so we've got the speech the speech thing , and  
A:  Mm-hmm . I would've said about a two as well . Oh 
D:  Do you reckon a two ? 
C:  Yeah , two or three . I'd be happy with a two . 
D:  <other> Okay . Two . And the next one is  I'll have to get it back up now . <laugh> 
A:  . The 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  next on Well , I can just sing about . Easy to use . I would've said yes . I would go for a one on that at this point in time . Um 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah , I would say so as well . 
A:  , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . Well , yeah it certainly has some . <other> 
B:  Um  
C:  Yeah , it's got the cherry and the sponginess . 
A:   . Yep 
B:  It does , yeah . 
D:  Um  
A:  . I 
D:  Say about a three maybe ? 
A:  don't know . Yep 
B:  <other> Yeah , m um  Yeah , it was just doing it quite well . Um , I think we're gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it's um  
C:  Maybe two ? 
A:  . Yeah , I woulda said two would seem reasonable . The 
D:  It's a two . 
A:  product is a recognisable real  r uh  reaction product ? <other> 
D:  Yeah , this is  
B:  Uh  the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons , and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying 
D:  This  
A:  Oh 
C:  Yeah , that's a bit rough at the minute . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  where it comes from . 
D:  <other> So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that . So  sort of  
A:  . <other> 
B:  Okay . <other> 
D:  Is it sort of a recognisable product . Does it fit in with our other other products , which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  S Okay 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Uh , well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine . 
D:  What do y 
B:  Also it's kind of  spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than  kinda sleek and new age . Um , it depends which way you look at it . 
D:  Yeah . Uh-huh . 
A:  . So we're going for a two 
D:  So  
B:  Maybe a kind of three ? Uh d 
A:  ,  three ? Sure 
D:  Two or three ? 
C:  Yeah , two or three . Well , the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing . It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper . But um , 
A:  . Right 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  I think the logo would definitely be recognisable . And it does have attributes that other products do . Two ? Aye . Go for it . 
A:  , okay . <laugh> 
D:  Two or three . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Two . Right , come on . That's that decided . Right . So  So 
D:  <laugh> How  Two . Okay . Right . 
A:  we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then  About 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  What does  what do all them numbers mean then ? Do we add them up and rate  or anything ? 
D:  <other> Yeah we s yeah , I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be  I'm just gonna do this in my head . One point eight isn't it or something . <laugh> I think , anyway . 
A:  a two . Two 
B:  <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  . Yep 
D:  So yeah , pretty close to a two . 
B:  Yeah , so it's  
D:  So  So it's  I mean it's pretty good at the moment , but it's gonna get worse , isn't it . But we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad . 
A:  . Two 


B:  So should we get  So are  definite  Was it  thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if  has . Okay , so we need to  
A:  b two b two  , yeah . Yes 
D:  <loud exhale> 
A:  . Well 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  , you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements . Okay 
A:  , okay . So , you can see there that the  If you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . You've got the 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  sample sensor and and sample speaker , which is your big item . That's 
B:  Oh actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , which gets us um  
A:  right . Which 
D:  Mm . 
A:  gets you  <other> Yes 
B:  In  right within the budget range . 
A:  . Alright 
C:  Yeah , I think that'd be fine . Because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway . 
B:  So that's eleven point seven , and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements . 
D:  Yeah . Different different colours , yeah . Yeah , I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case . 
A:  . Okay 
B:  Possibly , yeah . Um  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  , so  So 
B:  And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . So we'd lose a little bit on the  maybe kind of  
A:  we're going for plastic , yes ? Yep 
D:  <other> Lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but  
A:  . Well 
B:  Oh yeah , and that would now be  Yeah , that's that's within the budget . Um  
D:  And then  
B:  Do we actually have  Do we just have one special  uh  special forms down here ? 
A:  , uh w uh there was debate as to how you would count them . You got special colour . Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour . Well 
B:  <other> Um  
C:  Yeah , I think we should just imagine white buttons . 
B:  <other> And we we've we've got  we've got enough for another  we've got nought point eight left , so we've got enough for another  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  , we've got special form . Now that would be one button , and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button . 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special  So so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same . The other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium . Alright 
B:  Yeah , um  But the  but  but but the  I think maybe the special colour , we've got three now just because  the volume buttons are different , I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour . Yeah , which I think we should  Yeah , they'll still be fine for the for the price . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  . So , special colour , you want three in there . Okay . <other> 
D:  Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements , you know . One original colour and then sort of two supplements , I think maybe . 
A:  That makes sense . Okay 
B:  Okay , uh that's probably it . 
D:  Okay . So we only ne we only need two for that . 'Cause I mean these these are moulded . The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas uh of rubber , isn't it . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  . Okay . Yeah , I would agree with that , I think . So special colours , two . And 
D:  Right . 
A:  we've got special form <cough> is the one apple . The rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be  You were making these buttons down the bottom , I was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? Was that the idea ? Uh-huh 
B:  Ne uh  
C:  Yeah , the volume ones should stand out a bit . 
B:  Maybe that'll be a second supplement . Then there's a spe a second special form . 
D:  Yeah , that  
A:  . I would have thought that's probably about r <laugh> well . <laugh> <fricative noise> Right 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Um  Well you got you got twelve . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Okay , so tha 
B:  So I think that should still be okay . Yeah , that's twelve point three , so we're still 
A:  . Yep 
B:  within budget on that . Um  
A:  , that makes sense . Yep 


B:  So  decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , but generally speaking , we've kept the other attributes to the  
A:  . I woulda said so . Yeah . So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two . Real 
B:  That's without <other>  
D:  So shall we do a  Well , um  
B:  Yeah . <laugh> And specially it definitely could fits the the real product  What was the  what's the company name ? 
C:  Real Reactions ? 
A:  Reaction produ I'm not quite sure , what does that mean ? <laugh> Yep 
B:  R yeah . Yeah , yeah . I mean it still seems definitely fit that p so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , so  
B:  c type company , then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on  
D:  Uh  
A:  <other> I would s You 
D:  Okay . So , we've  what have we what have we rid of . We got rid of the plastic . 
A:  , we've  the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ? We've  Well 
D:  Is it  The rubber . 
B:  That  yeah , that was uh  that was just about all . I think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface , which is by far the cheapest . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Um  
D:  But uh  
B:  So maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we've lost some  maybe lost something on the innovation side ? I dunno . And  that is like the most standard type of button . 
D:  So I mean , we've got  we got rid of the rubber case , but we've now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe . So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them . 
B:  Yeah . And everything else has stayed pretty much the same , so  
A:  , ease has certainly stayed . Yeah 
B:  Yeah , plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  . And 
D:  Yeah . And what about the sort of innovation ? 
B:  to use . Um , well we've still got the kinetic energy . Um  
D:  Do you think  <other> Okay . 
A:  the speech feature . How 
B:  Yeah , the speech feature . 
A:   Right , so we're meant to finish up in five minutes . <laugh> 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Same sort of function ? The criteria ? It's alright . <laugh> Just made a load of money . <laugh> 
B:  'Kay . 
C:  <laugh> Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? 'Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel . 
A:  drats , I've botched that , haven't I . Right 
C:  So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ? 
D:  Well , we're aiming for um one for all of them . M but it really has to fit into the budget , so  
C:  Right . 
D:  I guess we just have to adjust things to get it i in the  Which is fair enough . <laugh> 
B:  And we seem to have  least something in each criteria . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  We haven't completely left anything out , so  
D:  Yeah , I think most  
B:  <other> As an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we've just about achieved 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  everything . 
D:  Yep . 


C:  So do we have anything else to discuss ? 
D:  <other> I don't know . What's on the agenda ? 
A:  , okay um  What's happened here ? Right , okay um  Mm <other> . Right , okay um ,   Right . So we got  So 
B:  We've got the closing . 
A:  we've done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the  We've done the redesign . So we're now on to project process . Now satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . So , we're actually now uh , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it . So 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh-huh . 
A:  what did you  and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain . <laugh> So , um  So 
D:  <laugh> Finish your meeting now . <laugh> 
B:  We should just go through this quickly and then  
C:  Huh . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:   I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which I will do . So 
D:  Okay . Oh 
A:  , uh I think I have to finish that page . Right 


A:  , okay , so  Project 
D:  . <laugh> 
A:  evaluation . So , um  Creativity . Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves <other> well enough ? Well um  Individual 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Um , yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary . 
A:  meetings . How do you mean ? In 
D:  Yeah . Well , we were finding out various things in 
A:  you on your own . Um 
D:  <other> in be in-between the meetings , and they didn't  the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one , you know , sort of  we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that . You know , you'd sort of  you'd probably present it at one or something like that . 
A:   Mm ,   The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would  normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that . Then you go away . You find out information . You then come back . You then discuss it . You then go and change things around , and then go back . So  <other> 
D:  Yeah . Uh-huh . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , I suppose and then  be going out and finding more information each time and then diff things will be relevant . 
A:  Whereas , this time , you're really getting it from a database source , so it's not uh well uh <other>  Anyway , so , what do you want to put down ? <laugh> I've put , seemed okay . Creativity , seemed okay . Um um flow of information on on any given subject  given subject um sometimes disjointed . <other> Um 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . I mean a remote control isn't the most um 
D:  Yeah , the thing itself . 
C:  kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing . 
A:   Have 
C:  I can't think of a better example at the minute . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:   could have used a different example  pel to increase  create  Creativity 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Is this go  It kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then 
A:  . You 
B:  something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so  I 
D:  Yeah . But  think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . I mean it depends what sort of business you're in , I guess . I mean this one seems  . From the website it looks  it's quite innovative , but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we that's , you know , fifteen quid . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:   one of those things . Like uh , companies can have like a range of products and  
A:  th I uh d But 
D:  Hmm . 
B:  Yeah . Well , sh  we look at the last slide , see if it's got anything else .  I think there's one one more to go . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  , so we've got uh New 
D:  Yeah .  I mean if you look at their products on their website here , Real Reaction , I mean it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge . And  
A:  ideas found , did we find any , no . Alright 
B:  It was quite good with this um  the white board , having that and the digital pens . Like , that's something that made it a little easier . 
A:  . Leadership , teamwork . Does 
D:  Yeah . Yeah .  we did find a new idea , I mean sort of a kinetic remote control . I've never seen one of them before .  batteries , I think . So  
B:   voice recognition , especially not  could  
A:   You've 
D:  Mm yeah . 
A:  got voice recognition computers , that's not remote controls . Mm-hmm 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Well it's a different application of it . 
A:  . Okay , so 
B:  Yeah , so it's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  how do you reckon teamwork went ? To 
B:  Um  
D:  That went okay , yeah . 
B:  Yeah , I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them . 
D:  Mm-hmm , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> 
A:  uh go uh reasonably well . Okay . Bit 
D:  <other> I don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything  
A:   bit arbitrary . <laugh> Mm-hmm 
D:  Well , I mean I don't think it  I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products . I mean , they've got all these sort of , you know , 
A:  . <laugh> 
D:  high definition D_V_D_ and portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens , and uh I'm thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in . Surely they they should produ 
A:  So , we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means , E_ G_ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . And and new i new ideas found was the the other thing . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Well leadership's a bit of a funny one , isn't it . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <other> But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the Project Manager . You were the leader . <laugh> So our experience of leadership wasn't really 
A:  <other> Now 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  as much as yours . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  , I'd much rather be in marketing <laugh> but  <laugh> <sound indicating fatigue> I certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as I would have liked . However , um  Alright uh means , so whiteboard um  so really , it's uh equipment . Oh . Right 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> <laugh> Yeah . It worked . Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , very nice . <laugh> But I mean , I d I don't  I'm not sure I see the value in these . I mean , they record what you're writing , and then what do you do with it ? Where do you get the recording ? Do you plug  the computer or something ? 
D:  I think there's a little there's a little um chi 
B:  So it's not just for us , it's for the experiment as a whole , so  
D:  There's a little there's a little chip , I think you must plug it into something and it produces a  
B:  Should we quickly look at the last slide ? Sh   
C:  Right . I think you watch a video of it kind of . 
D:  I don't know . Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something , and  Page after page . 
A:  . New ideas found , so one or two .  
D:  Yeah . Kinetic powered remote control . Um , what was the other one ? 
C:  Voice um recognition thing . 
D:  Vo yeah . 
A:  um and uh voice 
D:  <yawn> 
A:  uh , was it voice activated um  recognition 
D:  Voice recognition , yeah . S 
A:  . Right 
D:  Almost . <laugh> To fill in these fill in these questionnaires 
C:  Pretty much . <laugh> 
D:  Oh no . 
A:  , so , uh are the costs within budget , yes . Is the project evaluated , yes . Uh 


A:  , don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . Then celebration . <laugh> Yeah 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:   . Is that everything ? 
D:  Hmm ? I think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting . 
A:  . Uh , so we don't re So really  I tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , and it didn't seem to have saved anywhere . Mind you , the the figure last was was different , but it should be poss
