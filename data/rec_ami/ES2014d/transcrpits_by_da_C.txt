Well we've made our prototype anyway . 
We can have a good look at that . <laugh> 
<other> Mm-hmm . 
Y no , it's a slightly curved around the sides . <laugh> 
Um , it's almost curved like up to the main display as well . 
And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit  the panel that you pull down . 
And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . 
And we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
it's a bit more fun , isn't it ? 
And it's kinda not really at a kind of  
you think apple , you think computers , like Apple Mac . 
Yeah , and cherries are fun , summery . 
Ah , that's the mute . 
 <other> It  it'd probably have to be labelled mute . 
But um , we didn't have anything small enough to write . 
Yeah . 
Uh , we just chose simple shapes for all them . 
Um , the important ones are the volume ones . 
So we made them a bit bigger . 
The mute could possibly be a bit smaller . 
<other> <cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , and we chose a V_ plus and V_ minus . 
Well the colours wouldn't  like that's  they wouldn't be too important , 
but we didn't have any white Play-Doh . 
<laugh> So that's where the colour buttons came from . <laugh> 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
Uh , that's it . <laugh> 
Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
S 
Um ,  . D 
wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well ? 
You know how you turn that one to a zero , 
wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things , 
so you need both of them ? 
I think the voice recognition . 
But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery . 
<cough> 
Yeah , I'd maybe give it a a two . 
One's true . 
And a four is neutral . 
Yeah , 
'cause we haven't got the double curve , 
so we can't like say it's completely true . 
<laugh> But it's pretty close . 
We've got almost everything we can . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit . 
Maybe a three . 
I would give it more than a four . 
How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? 
Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . 
If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . 
And then it stand the test of time better . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well , I suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
two or three . 
I'd be happy with a two . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I would say so as well . 
Yeah , 
it's got the cherry and the sponginess . 
Maybe two ? 
Yeah , 
that's a bit rough at the minute . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Uh , well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine . 
Yeah , two or three . 
Well , the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing . 
It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper . 
But um , I think the logo would definitely be recognisable . 
And it does have attributes that other products do . 
Two ? 
Aye . 
Go for it . 
<laugh> 
What does  what do all them numbers mean then ? 
Do we add them up and rate  or anything ? 
<laugh> 
 we'll probably have to re-rate it . 
Ah it's on . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , I think that'd be fine . 
Because that was just a trend , 
and we do have rubber buttons anyway . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , I think we should just imagine white buttons . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
the volume ones should stand out a bit . 
<laugh> 
Real Reactions ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
I don't see how we could make it any more . 
Um , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing . 
<other> 
But then what colour would you make the R_s ? 
No , 
I just  
We got the logo off the web browser . 
<cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Um , I don't think they would really need to be . 
I think if they were just all small round blue buttons , it'd be fine . 
Needs to be an enter button , 
but could just be the same as well . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion , 
go to a three ? 
'Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel . 
'Cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all . <laugh> 
Alright . 
Did we decide what that was , which button it was ? 
On the volume ones ? 
<laugh> Right . <laugh> 
Um , can I just check if that's a cherry or an apple ? 
Did we decide against the apple because of Apple Mac ? 
And did we make it a cherry officially ? 
<laugh> 
So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ? 
Right . 
So do we have anything else to discuss ? 
Huh . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . 
I mean a remote control isn't the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing . 
I can't think of a better example at the minute . 
<laugh> 
Well it's a different application of it . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Well leadership's a bit of a funny one , isn't it . 
<other> But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership 
because you are the Project Manager . 
You were the leader . 
<laugh> So our experience of leadership wasn't really as much as yours . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , very nice . <laugh> 
But I mean , I d I don't  I'm not sure I see the value in these . 
I mean , they record what you're writing , 
and then what do you do with it ? 
Where do you get the recording ? 
Do you plug  the computer or something ? 
Right . 
I think you watch a video of it kind of . 
Voice um recognition thing . 
Pretty much . <laugh> 
<laugh>
