So is  
Why not save that . 
  Do you want to replace existing file , no . 
<nasal sound> 
I actually tried to transfer it to My Documents , but  
 spreadsheet . 
<other> Yeah , but I've ta uh 
right , I'll just re-do it . 
That's the easiest way . <rhythmic exhalation> 
<loud exhalation> 
Right . 
R right . Um , 
all these things have cost implications . 
And so when I done my thing on cost <laugh> a  I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button . 
So  However , I've now  . <laugh> But um , <other> yeah 
so uh but there would be a cost implication on that , 
and uh  as I suppose that <other> so whether <other> wanted to put in all these colours , would be uh open to debate , I suppose . 
<laugh> An important consideration . 
<laugh> Right , okay so um  
<other> And the second one underneath would be the idea for the  
Right , okay . 
So we've got um detail design meeting . 
Right . 
So  
So , we've got <other> prototype presentation , which we've just done , 
evaluation criteria , 
um and finance , 
so I guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various uh aspects that we're looking for uh from um our previous meeting . 
So other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer , but um obviously obviously it would . 
<laugh> But other than that , we got the red apple . 
We got the buttons 
and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons , 
and <other> the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance . <other> And the <other> and the cost implication . 
The only snag about this is that uh <other> the cost is probably kind of important . 
So um , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture . 
Um , and whether it would uh  
Right , so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost  aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half  uh twelve and a half Euros . 
So , there's no redesign . 
So that should uh  
Right , so , seems to me that the thing that I have to do is is quickly find that uh  
Right . 
Okay . 
Right .  . 
<other> 
Okay , so , by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved case . We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements . 
So , we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and  
Okay . W the button supplements . 
Well , originally , I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple . 
But  
So the so the real w the real question then would come in . 
Do you make all the buttons  
O 
Well , so we've got one special button form , which was the apple . 
Everything else is gonna be a standard . 
We've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that , 
so , I was  <other> originally , I was thinking  rubber wasn't special , 
but according to this , maybe it is . 
<other> So  
And the r I mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there . 
W <other> I don't know <laugh> is <laugh> is <laugh> is the sort of answer , 
is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , 
and therefore  I mean , what's the op 
The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , 
but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , 
and therefore  
Whereas it would be  the special colour would be for the  
So you would only have the one special button that was rubber , 
whereas the rest would be hard plastic . 
<other> 
Mm . 
I would <other> <stammering sound>  
Every design change is uh  <stammering sound> I 
dunno , um 
 <laugh> Okay 
, um , if 
we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , I guess . We'd 
have one special colour and 
one special button form . And 
when I plugged that in last time   remember it has to be under twelve and a half . As far as I know , that um <other> that took care of the uh of the various supplements . And 
if  What 
happened ? <laugh> 
Now 
, right . <laugh> Okay 
, so , but the point would be that if we uh if we just did special  Sorry 
, you 
were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there . Okay 
. So 
it  Well 
, is it s is  no 
, it's 
nine point seven I've got . Okay 
. So 
, that would <other> that would work out fine if uh uh as assuming your correction are are <other>  assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . And 
there's nothing else as far as I can see that we we had uh planned to put on  . Uh-huh 
. Well 
, hold on . Um 
, if we Okay 
, that gives us twelve point seven But 
remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the   Oh 
, I see , so 
just take out the special colour for the apple and  And 
go for battery instead . That 
would give you one less . But 
you reckon that i 
I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries . Mm-hmm 
. <other> 
But which do you think  or which do we think is the more important of the options ? In 
a sense , at the moment , we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two . At 
least . Remember 
that was a minimum requirement . The 
other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to um make it  originally , we're gonna make it a simple product . Mm-hmm 
. Makes sense .  
. Sorry 
, do 
you want that back up ? Right 
. Okay 
, but 
remember the main  the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost . <other> 
Go for one . <laugh> Yep . Okay 
. Yeah 
, why not not , m 
m maybe nearer three . Two 
three . Well 
, it's just that uh saying something  <other> remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got uh various other things you could have , and 
we're not going for these options . Mm-hmm 
. <other> 
Okay 
. No 
. 'Cause 
you can't afford that  w 
we took that out too . Didn't 
you ? Or  Well 
, wait a minute . In 
thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . The 
problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . And 
one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . So 
, it's very much dependant on what you do with your options . And 
if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then  because that <other> the 
other functions we've got in are are more at the <other>  The 
special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas 
down at uh just special colours uh is point two . Now 
you're trying to lose one point two , so 
it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors  speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . And 
and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker , and 
then you're looking to uh take out uh point two , which 
would be  come from the button supplements category . Um 
, interface type um , well 
plastic rather than rubber . <other> That 
that that would make the significant difference . You 
could either <other> you 
could have it  If 
you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get  you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and 
you'd be looking to take out point two . So 
you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or 
your special colour at the bottom . And 
that would enable you to to do it . Yeah 
. Ye 
Well 
, okay , but  It's 
rubber as it is , yes . We 
got  we've we've got thirteen point seven and 
we've got it in at the moment and 
if  and basically , we're going to reduce down from that . But 
the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too  <other> <other> 
Mm-hmm 
. I 
would've said about a two as well . Oh 
. The 
next on Well 
, I can just sing about . Easy 
to use . I 
would've said yes . I 
would go for a one on that at this point in time . Um 
, incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . Well 
, yeah it certainly has some . <other> 
 . Yep 
. I 
don't know . Yep 
. Yeah 
, I 
woulda said two would seem reasonable . The 
product is a recognisable real  r uh  reaction product ? <other> 
Oh 
. <other> 
<laugh> 
S Okay 
. So 
we're going for a two ,  
three ? Sure 
. Right 
, okay . <laugh> 
Two . Right 
, come on . That's 
that decided . Right 
. So  So 
we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and 
then  About 
a two . Two 
. Yep 
. Two 
b two b two  , yeah . Yes 
. Well 
, you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements . Okay 
, well I put it back on . <other> 
<other> 
Yes 
, I would've thought so . Okay 
, so what was it , control 
uh F_ eight , wasn't it ? Oh 
. Oh . How kind . <laugh> Right 
, okay . So , you 
can see there that the  If 
you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . You've 
got the sample sensor and and sample speaker , which is your big item . That's 
right . Which 
gets you  <other> Yes 
. Alright 
. Okay 
, so  So 
we're going for plastic , yes ? Yep 
. Well 
, uh w uh there was debate as to how you would count them . You 
got special colour . Well 
originally I was assuming we had the red apple , and 
therefore , that was the special colour . Well 
, we've got special form . Now 
that would be one button , and 
the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button . 'Cause 
our plan really was to have one button only with a special  So 
so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same . The 
other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium . Alright 
. So 
, special colour , you want three in there . Okay 
. <other> 
That makes sense . Okay 
. Okay 
. Yeah , I would agree with that , I think . So 
we've got special form <cough> is the one apple . The 
rest are all standard , although 
you could argue that should maybe be  You 
were making these buttons down the bottom , I was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or 
were you ? Was 
that the idea ? Uh-huh 
. I 
would have thought that's probably about r <laugh> well . <laugh> <fricative noise> Right 
. Yep 
, that makes sense . Yep 
. I 
woulda said so . Yeah 
. So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two . Real 
Reaction produ I'm 
not quite sure , what does that mean ? <laugh> Yep 
<other> I 
would s You 
mean of  Well 
you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , because 
at the moment you're making a red apple . So 
next year you could make  next year's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon . Yeah 
, l a lemon lemon or something . And 
that amount 
 Yeah 
, we've 
 the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ? We've 
, ease has certainly stayed . Yeah 
. And 
the speech feature . How 
it would play out , yeah . Oh 
. Well 
, but you've got the company logo on there , which 
would effectively be a stick-on badge . So 
you're  in a sense , you're comparing the product without the company logo . And 
then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on . Don't 
think so . But 
but i but in the sense that , as you saw with um the Windows logo badge , it doesn't really matter . There's 
virtually n The 
way that you frame , you know , the Windows badge on there , it really doesn't matter what colour it is ,  
so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . Fact 
, they've got black and white or black and silver . So 
basically , even if you had a silver  <other> the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product . And 
that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it . You 
could put in another  Well 
, in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons . Well 
, we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour . So 
you were talking about uh um  We're 
assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . Which 
m may or may not be the case . Well 
, yeah . Bu 
but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ? Yeah 
, well 
 Alright 
. Okay . So 
we just add that to profitability in effect .  
 Right 
, so we're meant to finish up in five minutes . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm 
. So 
we're okay this way around . Until 
the design team comes in and says , get off . But 
you are the design team . <laugh> So 
what bit are we on to ? Yeah 
. I 
th I th <other> Oh 
. Right , okay . <laugh> 
Oh 
drats , I've 
botched that , haven't I . Right 
, okay um  What's 
happened here ? Right 
, okay um  Mm 
<other> . Right 
, okay um ,   Right 
. So we got  So 
we've done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the  We've done the redesign . So 
we're now on to project process . Now 
satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . So 
, we're actually now uh , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it . So 
what did you  and 
remembering that nobody's just over the curtain . <laugh> So 
, um  So 
 I 
suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which 
I will do . So 
, uh I think I have to finish that page . Right 
, okay , so  Project 
evaluation . So 
, um  Creativity 
. Did 
you feel you got a chance to express yourselves <other> well enough ? Well 
um  Individual 
meetings . How do you mean ? In 
you on your own . Um 
 Mm 
,   The 
only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would  normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that . Then 
you go away . You 
find out information . You 
then come back . You 
then discuss it . You 
then go and change things around , and 
then go back . So 
 <other> 
Whereas , this time , you're really getting it from a database source , so 
it's not uh well uh <other>  Anyway 
, so , what 
do you want to put down ? <laugh> 
I've put , seemed okay . Creativity 
, seemed okay . Um 
um flow of information on on any given subject  given subject um sometimes disjointed . <other> Um 
 Have 
 could have used a different example  pel to increase  create  Creativity . You 
have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so  I 
th I uh d But 
the other thing is that uh they're  I'm guessing that they're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project . I 
mean , m my wife at the moment , for instance , is uh acting as a computer um 
<other> for um  <other> you 
 normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and 
find out information to see how to get it fixed . So 
what she's doing is she's <laugh> having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can uh ask whatever question . And 
then you  or 
the idea is that the  whichever uh person's at the other end can point them in the right direction , show 
them where to  either 
give them directly  give them help , or 
secondly , point them in the right direction , either 
at the library , or uh or or come back , or go and see Joe Bloggs , or whatever . So 
uh , and that was a project I suspect similar to this , because 
they they were actually trying to debug the uh computer software to enable um  to enable it to work . And 
of course , you had the machine crashing and 
various things going wrong . So  Alright 
, so 
we've got uh New 
ideas found , did 
we find any , no 
. Alright 
. Leadership 
, teamwork 
. Does 
 You've 
got voice recognition computers , that's 
not remote controls . Mm-hmm 
. Okay 
, so 
how do you reckon teamwork went ? To 
uh go uh reasonably well . Okay 
. Bit 
 bit arbitrary . <laugh> Mm-hmm 
. <laugh> 
So , we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means , E_ G_ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . And 
and new i new ideas found was the the other thing . <laugh> 
<other> Now 
, I'd much rather be in marketing <laugh> but 
 <laugh> <sound indicating fatigue> I 
certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as I would have liked . However 
, um  Alright 
uh means , so whiteboard um  so really , it's uh equipment . Oh . Right 
. New 
ideas found , so one or two .  
um and uh voice uh 
, was it voice activated um  recognition 
. Right 
, so , uh 
are the costs within budget , yes 
. Is 
the project evaluated , yes 
. Uh 
, don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . Then 
celebration . <laugh> Yeah 
. Uh 
, so we don't re So 
really  I 
tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , and 
it didn't seem to have saved anywhere . Mind 
you , the the figure last was was different , but 
it should be poss
