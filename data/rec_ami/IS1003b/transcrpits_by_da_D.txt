Okay . 
Okay . 
No no no . 
One . 
I I think I'm a  . 
In one . 
It's mine . 
Mm yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay , so . 
The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control . 
Uh I I will focus on user interface design . 
Um so move to the next slide . 
As we know our 
remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very  has very soph sophisticated functions , 
as we show from this picture . 
There's a lot of functions . 
Over , I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control . 
So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ? 
Um , let's move to next slide . 
Um . Yeah . So 
I  
so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface . 
A very good example is Google . 
As we know uh Google it's a very successful 
because his um powerful function , 
but with very easy to use user interface . 
Um so 
move to next s slide . 
So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller <laugh> 
which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . 
So  
That's the end of the talk <laugh> the end of the presentation . 
Uh  
With sophisticated functions , 
but with very  
yeah powerful . 
Yes . 
Yep . 
Yeah . 
But if we have very very good user interface 
it take less time for user to learn how to use it . 
Yeah , 
that's my job . <laugh> 
That's my job . 
It's not the easiest I've got to . 
Yep . 
Powerful and easy to use . 
Yeah , that's the point . 
So what , the wireless remote control ? 
There's a wire <laugh> with remote control ? <laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Wireless remote control <laugh> . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Design a wireless remote control . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Functions . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , I think possible . 
Because we can  We can uh mix uh several function in one button . 
So lets you  then you have less buttons . 
But I'm not sure  
No 
you you can have a switch menu , 
so you can 
well 
for example  
Yeah , I think so . 
Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . 
Then for um you can have a switch menu , 
so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions . 
Then you you put the switch button , 
then it 
switch to another category of functions . Yeah . 
For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ 
and also you can control your uh recorder . 
So there's a different functions , 
but i if you you  there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . 
So we can has less buttons . 
But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny  look fancy , not funny . 
Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know . 
<laugh> 
Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , 
but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some  for other peoples , so . 
Yeah , personalised colour . Because you know  
Yeah , 
because maybe some people prefer a red remote control , 
some people prefer black remote control . 
Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options , 
so user can select which colour they prefer , so . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Control . 
Mm-hmm . <laugh> 
Mm . 
Okay . 
But there's balance between function and the cost . 
Yeah . Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hm . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
And cheap . 
A low cost . 
Yeah , 
there's that box in uh o of it . 
A pi 
There's that box in the T_V_ , 
so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ . 
Ok 
It's It's not so uh popular now . <laugh> 
Mm . 
Global , 
okay . 
So I I so  
As as for the colour , what what do you think ? 
Yellow ?  T_V_ remote control ? <laugh> 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay , okay . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
Okay <laugh> . Okay . <laugh>
