D:  The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control . 
D:  remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very  has very soph sophisticated functions , 
D:  so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface . 
D:  A very good example is Google . 
D:  So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller <laugh> 
D:  which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . 
C:  So you propose to to have the 
C:  remote control which will be powerful . 
D:  With sophisticated functions , 
C:  and very easy to use . 
A:  it's maybe difficult to have both , 
A:  I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple 
D:  But if we have very very good user interface 
D:  it take less time for user to learn how to use it . 
B:  but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright .

abst_sum - abstract: The User Interface Designer discussed  some characteristics and functions to consider in designing the remote and introduced an idea for giving the remote international appeal by merging it with a system such as Google.

B:  As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . 
B:  I propose a nifra infrared base <laugh> 
B:  I think it's cheaper than laser , so <laugh> . 
B:  what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , 
B:  I have some kind of pictures 
B:  and you have the other subcomponent 
D:  There's a wire <laugh> with remote control ? <laugh> 
B:  I think it should be wire <laugh> wireless re remote con <laugh> 
B:  and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . 
C:  So you think that uh <laugh> a cable between the remote control <laugh> and the T_V_ <laugh>  won't be a good idea . 
C:  maybe it will be cheaper <laugh> I dunno 
C:  but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? 
C:  Do you think it will be cheaper ? 
C:  <laugh> Could you answer please ? <laugh> 
B:  Have to think about the question , 
C:  but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem . 
C:  Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research 
C:  If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ? 
C:  I think it's would be easier to have <laugh> a link between the remote control and the television ,

abst_sum - abstract: The Industrial Designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and presented options for components and materials which would keep costs low.

A:  So just trying to answer all the questions , 
A:  We had one hundred subjects , 
A:  um , we observe their remote control use in a lab 
A:  and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , 
A:  Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , 
A:  Yeah , the the look is is bad for them 
A:  Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . 
A:  And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so  doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , 
A:  because it's too many buttons and so on . 
A:  And uh users are actually zapping a lot , 
A:  ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . 
A:  remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . 
A:  Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . 
A:  And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . 
A:  R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um  doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . 
A:  Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . 
A:  If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , 
A:  And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , 
C:  And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? 
D:  Yeah , I think possible . 
D:  Because we can  We can uh mix uh several function in one button . 
C:  but do you think it will be easy to use ? 
C:  Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . 
D:  you you can have a switch menu , 
C:  but it has to be intuitive . 
D:  For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ 
D:  and also you can control your uh recorder . 
D:  But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny  look fancy , not funny . 
D:  Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know . 
B:  I think the solution is to have many colours of  you know instead of having one grey standard  
C:  but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control . 
D:  Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options , 
C:  so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot . 
C:  so it's better to use internet then teletext .

C:  the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , 
C:  because now everybody has internet at home , 
C:  and also the remote control will only be used for television , 
C:  you won't had <other> um buttons to just to manipulate  yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that . 
C:  So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . 
C:  which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex 
C:  And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . 
A:  So has to be yellow . 
C:  As we say , we put the fashion in electronics ,
