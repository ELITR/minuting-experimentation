So , 
I will open our functional design meeting . 
So , 
I will play role of the secretary . As also Program Ma Manager . 
So , 
we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and um 
What's your talk ? 
Marketing Experts . <other> 
And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , 
the decision on the remote control functions , 
and we will close the meetings after . 
Mm so um 
I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer . 
Um , so you're participant two ? 
No 
you're  
No , 
I'm participant one . <laugh> 
Okay , never mind . 
'Kay , 
did you save your presentation ? <laugh> 
Isn't that technical functions ? 
<laugh> Name's Jordan . 
So 
so I'll  I let David Jordan do his presentation . 
Uh . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
So you propose to to have the 
remote control which will be powerful . 
So powerful , 
many functions 
and very easy to use . 
You mean this one ? 
Yeah 
you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose . 
Oh 
you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ? 
Yeah um 
such as maybe the  
Go on , go back 
and  
So , 
you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use . 
Okay . 
So , 
next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things . 
So you you're  
Um . Okay . 
So , 
Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer . Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ? 
Yeah . 
Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? 
Twelve , nearly thirteen , 
yeah . The cost  
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
What is this ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
So you think that uh <laugh> a cable between the remote control <laugh> and the T_V_ <laugh>  won't be a good idea . 
<laugh> No 
it wou 
maybe it will be cheaper <laugh> I dunno 
, I just may maybe you making a solu 
<laugh> Yeah , 
but  
<laugh> 
Yeah 
but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? 
<laugh> I'm just asking you . 
Do you think it will be cheaper ? 
<laugh> Could you answer please ? <laugh> 
<other> Okay . 
Yeah , 
but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem . 
As it's  
yeah . 
I think it's more your problem . 
Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research 
or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . 
<laugh> Okay , 
 I'm sorry . 
So  
<other> So 
just think of um the usability . 
Yeah . 
Just think of the problem . 
If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ? 
I think it's would be easier to have <laugh> a link between the remote control and the television , 
yeah . 
<other> So I will let you to do your presentation , so . 
<laugh> 
You mean the loo the look , the outside ? 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
<other> <other> 
<other> What is R_S_I_ ? 
Ah um okay . <other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm okay . 
And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? 
Sure ? Yeah ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
but do you think it will be easy to use ? 
Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . 
Yeah , 
I think the  
Yeah , 
but it has to be intuitive . 
Yeah , okay . 
Okay , 
but  
Yeah , 
but  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , 
but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control . 
If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more . 
Yeah , it will cost little bit more . 
And also f 
Yeah , 
but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases , 
and we don't really want the price to be too too high , 
because we wanna be able to produce it . 
So , 
we want something fancy , 
as uh previously said , Florent , 
something very easy to use , powerful 
and also as uh it's written here , 
seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , 
so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot . 
And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , 
they want to zap between channels on T_V_ . 
So  
I think you have quite lot of points to to think about 
and to discuss it with uh the other members . 
So , 
is it okay for your presentation ? 
Nothing else to to add ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Mm so  
So , 
I had some 
new information about the product requirements , 
so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . 
So 
the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , 
as it's something that's  
It's is uh  
No 
yeah , 
because now everybody has internet at home , 
so it's better to use internet then teletext . 
So , 
you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , 
and also the remote control will only be used for television , 
so 
for y for you your designing , you're not  you won't be uh  
you won't had <other> um buttons to just to manipulate  yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that . 
It's  <other> 
because if we want to 
to do remote control 
which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex 
and it will increase the pli the price 
and we can't do that . 
We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . 
Is it okay ? 
So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . 
And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . 
I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product . 
So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um 
of the uh of real reaction 
and uh also  
Yeah . 
As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , 
so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use . 
Require lot of requirements , 
but  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches . 
<laugh> 
Maybe not , 
but mayb 
So . 
So everybody is okay with the new requirements ? 
I think it has to be yellow . 
Yeah . 
Maybe you can change the colour , 
but the image of the society has to be recognised . 
Why you go  
It has to be fashion . 
So you have to  
Yeah . 
It has to be a fashion 
and really be uh the image of the society . 
Just when you enter you say oh , oh , it's real reaction . 
Think it's a re reaction remote control , so . 
And also it has to be attractive , of course , 
because if you want to sale  to sell the remote control . 
It's okay ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I think it would be simpler . 
Okay . So  
I will close the meeting , 
um just after that we'll have lunch break . 
And you will have in thirty minutes individual work . 
Uh  Y you  
You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um  pon 
yeah , 
and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept . 
And Florent to work my subject . 
And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . 
It's okay ? 
I think the um session is closed . 
And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder . <laugh> Not in mine . 
Should be better . <laugh>
