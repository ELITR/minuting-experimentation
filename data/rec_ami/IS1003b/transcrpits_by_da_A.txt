Mm-hmm . 
Marketing Expert . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
No sure . 
Uh 
it's David Jordan . Course . 
Mm-hmm . 
No , no . 
Uh this one doesn't want to be moved , I think . 
So , 
I dunno , 
it's maybe difficult to have both , 
I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
 
Yeah , 
and then  
Yeah . 
Oh it should  okay , yeah . 
The user should know . 
Yeah , 
that's gonna be the trick . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
So that's the point . 
 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
True . 
Okay . 
What the cost is ? 
Twelve , twelve a half . 
That might just  So . 
Okay . 
What's the average price of this technology then ? 
But this is what you would like to ask the user first 
and I don't think the user would be ready to have a  
I don't think  well , yeah , I don't think he would , 
but in a sense  
The wire ? 
Yeah . True . 
Uh 
that's my job . 
That's the  
Now the  
Yeah . 
Well 
that's actually one of the point , 
yeah ? 
True . 
This you will see in my presentation then . 
Yeah . 
Which is participant four . 
So just trying to answer all the questions , 
if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . 
We've made a study , 
so could you go to next slide . 
Sorry for the functional recurrence . 
So that's the standard method for marketing , 
okay . 
We had one hundred subjects , 
um , we observe their remote control use in a lab 
and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , 
and see what was okay or not for them . 
Okay . 
So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . 
Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , 
okay , 
so that's  
Yeah , the the look is is bad for them 
so uh 
it's your job , David , maybe . 
Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . 
So this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more . 
So 
it's it's interesting information , I think . 
And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so  doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , 
because it's too many buttons and so on . 
So 
we should change this as well . 
And uh users are actually zapping a lot , 
so they're using the device intensively , 
that's something to take into account as well . 
And um , you know , 
ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . 
And uh this is one of the main point for me . 
But I'll come back to it later . 
'Kay . 
Could you go next slide ? 
Uh , so as you said uh , 
remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . 
So 
this is from the experiments we've done , 
so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think . 
Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . 
And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . 
R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um  doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . 
Okay ? 
So , 
those numbers are less important then the previous one , 
but still it has to be taken to count . 
So 
last slide . 
Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . 
If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , 
okay . 
And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , 
this would definitely be a good way of selling more . 
Okay . 
So  
Yeah , 
remember 
the user is not happy to read the 
manual . 
It's  
 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
this is something we sh 
But this was first step and  
This was the first step , yeah . 
Specially distribution , yeah . 
Uh  
Yeah , 
but this is what we would ask to the users , so . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
remember it's twelve Euros . 
Hmm . 
Yeah , it's done , 
just  yeah . If we would  if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it . 
So . 
Lame , 
or  
Mm-hmm 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
So has to be yellow . 
I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway . 
It's maybe more in browsing . 
Yeah . 
Hm-mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Min 
Yeah . 
Regarding the first line , what  So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext . 
And that's it . 
It's already changed for  
Mm-hmm . 
Industrial Designer . 
Yep . 
Okay . 
Yeah .
