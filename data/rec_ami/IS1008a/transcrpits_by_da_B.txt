<laugh> Uh sure 
my name is Agnes 
and I'm an user  usability user interface designer . 
Um I was wondering  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Well , no , not exactly . 
I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that . 
So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work , 
and so it's sort of  it's a loop that feeds in , 
but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Which will also feed into the marketing , 
because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users . 
So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit . 
Um , and then 
I guess build the plan based on all of that , 
because I think you need to take all the factors into account . 
Yeah , of course <laugh> . 
Yeah , we can C_C_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around . 
Sure . 
No problem . 
So , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or 
 okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm , 
yeah , that would be useful . 
Sure . 
Okay . 
Thanks . 
Thank you .
