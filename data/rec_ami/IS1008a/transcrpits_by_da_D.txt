<other> My name is Ed 
and I do accounting . 
E_D_ . 
Mm . 
<other> No <laugh> . 
Accounting , yes . 
Marketing is uh , is me <laugh> . 
<laugh> Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product . 
We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from  with this . 
<other> Uh for the moment not yet . 
<laugh> Good question <laugh> . 
No , 
this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there . 
We'll have to  simply we'll have to work on it together . 
Certainly by the next meeting . 
<laugh> 
I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do <laugh> . 
We have to define exactly what our product is , from uh  
From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee , 
is that right ? 
Remote controls , 
'cause I had two different things . 
I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , 
and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so <laugh> 
we'll start with the remote control for television then . 
So we're have to design something that is very user friendly . 
Something uh visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product , 
because I think everybody's experienced with uh remote controls , 
and some remote controls are are worth uh throwing out the window . 
Uh th most of them ar 
I don't know 
we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use , 
'cause a lot of times uh spend uh half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it . 
<laugh> 
Well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh , what they're building , their designs , their ideas , 
uh also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into . 
It should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh  the competition , 
uh th I agree it has to be something  it has to be something new , 
it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , I like this . 
Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , 
and then it's gotta be simple to use . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much uh we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for , 
that's up that's up to us to decide , eh ? <laugh> 
<other> Very good . 
Very good . 
No .
