Oops 
That's as far as it goes <laugh> . 
Do you also do marketing ? 
And I'm Christine , 
and my role in this uh scenario is to be the industrial designer . 
But I'm not really one . 
What is the goal of the project ? 
<laugh> 
Um no , I I have not begun working on the design , 
and um I uh 
I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control , 
I thought we were designing a new monitor . 
Um the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a um uh some sort of a seven inch um monitor , 
and um I understood that that was the project goal . 
So um I'm glad I didn't d do any work um ahead of time 
because uh I clearly didn't understand the project goal . 
Um I just did s see that we were starting a new project together 
and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , 
and um that's about uh that's  
and I I read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps . 
<other> Uh for the industrial design ? 
Um well , I would th think that depends on how much money you give us . 
Um because uh , you know , you can uh you can make it uh  <other> you have different choices with different financial models . 
<other> Well , you know um , 
I kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's uh very attractive  that um people see and recognize uh its goal , and uh they immediately wanna have it uh have one of their own . 
So it would  really would need to um  <other> 
something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well , 
so um d uh 
you know , I don't care what it does , just so it looks cool . 
<other> Well , uh I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now um 
and so I'll have to wait and see how those uh how those go . 
If they uh go quickly then uh it could be a month . 
If um if I run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> And when would you like that ? 
<other> Uh well if uh if we have enough time uh then d do you think um two weeks is a  is close enough ? 
Uh <other> are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ? 
<other> 
Okay , I'll get back to you on that . 
<other> 
Would you mind um at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides ? 
Thank you .
