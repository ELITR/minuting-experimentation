<cough> So 
we uh  we will wait for Anna , a few minutes . 
I think it should work like this . 
So I will try to get my presentation running . 
Mm . 
It's no matter . 
No problem . 
Ah 
yes . 
I don't know . 
Just try . 
On this normal  
Good . 
Doesn't appear on the screen here . 
Oh . 
Okay . 
Thank you . <other> Uh . 
Yes 
and you can put can clip it uh on your  
Somewhere . 
So , <laugh> 
good morning , everyone . 
Um  
Welcome at uh  at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project . 
I hope you all have been uh updated about it . 
Good . 
So 
w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here . 
Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other . 
See what our roles are in this project . 
So , um  
We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh  to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans 
uh as I can say 
um so 
w we will also try to uh to get acquainted to this tools 
so 
they are also new to me 
I don't know whether you worked with them before . 
Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan . 
You all know I hope <laugh> how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design . 
Uh then we will uh discuss 
uh , well , how it should be 
and uh  wh what uh what our new product should look lite  like . 
And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting . 
So . Um 
basically this is about a uh a new c remote control . Um  
We  
When you design a new product you of  uh you of course want it to be original . 
Be uh  
we want to be distinguished , 
mm ? 
People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think , well that's the product I I need . 
So it needs to be trendy . 
I mean trendy is what people want , 
so then I w they will buy our product . 
But then , uh , it also should work uh user friendly 
and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that . 
So , 
the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase . Um  
You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase 
and uh then we will meet again 
and uh discuss this functional design . 
And the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this , the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design 
in which the the final project should get its definite shape . 
Alright , 
but first we will do some uh tool training . 
In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh notebooks and w uh n note blocks 
and we have here a a  a  a white-board . 
And um well it should work uh  
I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . 
I didn't find out yet how it work , 
but maybe one of you did , so  Um  
Yes . 
Do  Do we have to say something about that ? 
I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh . 
Yes well 
we will then find out ho how it works . 
Um . Well , 
this seems to me , yes , some computer program 
but I didn't find it yet . 
So , 
we'll come to that later . 
So , uh 
now we will try out the white-board we have here . 
So , 
I would suggest uh  
Well , 
yes , 
um we uh we should try to t to draw on it 
and then well it should be smart some way . 
I  <laugh> I'm not really sure how this works , but  
Yes , 
a good idea Mael . 
Okay . 
'Kay . 
You  you  
D doesn't it work ? 
Maybe someo 
Maybe  maybe Anna , maybe you can start . 
Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right . 
So um  
L 
Why don't you draw uh <laugh> your favourite animal on on th on the white-board . 
Oh , I see uh  
Yeah . Yes . Mm . 
So draw it . 
We will try to guess what it is . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
It's like a cat , 
so I guess it's a cat . <laugh> 
What is this now ? 
So , 
that's the cat . 
Oh . 
It's a dog . 
So 
but that's also kind of cat , 
isn't it ? 
B bo both predators . 
So , 
thank you . 
Uh d did you uh work out cord ? 
Okay . 
Yes . Yes , yes this is  Yes definitely a horse . Yes . 
Oh very good . So  
I suppose it  
Yes . 
Can  you can meet them in Africa , I think . 
Yes . Very good . So  
Ma Matthew ? 
So  
Maybe  
I hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh Mael . 
This looks likes a cat who has been driven over . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yes , the moustache . 
That's  that's definitely a cat . 
<laugh> It's quite , you know  relaxed situation . 
Yes . 
<laugh> 
Yes , okay . <laugh> 
Th thank you , Matthew . 
<laugh> 
Yes , this is certain uh  some contribution to our project . <laugh> 
So . Let's see . 
Which animal has not been drawn yet . 
So 
you've all drawn land animals , 
so why not draw an animal from the water . 
<laugh> Mm . <laugh> 
Yes . 
<laugh> 
So  
Oh , 
yes , why not ? 
<laugh> Good idea . 
<laugh> 
Why not . A swordfish . 
<laugh> 
I hope it still works . 
So  
W Well , 
this uh this tool seemed to work . 
<laugh> Let's continue to uh  to the real stuff . 
Um our project uh finance uh thing . 
Uh when we are  and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros , 
so when designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael , keep in mind uh uh uh  People uh 
want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project uh pr um 
product . 
Yes . 
Okay . Um 
more interesting for our company <laugh> of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro . 
So 
we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh <other> um things . 
Uh we will try to uh 
to get at a international market 
uh so um 
it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America , 
maybe some uh Asian countries . 
Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . 
Yes , of course . 
Uh um I mean 
we still have to uh to make a profit , 
huh ? 
You all have to be paid . 
Excuse me ? 
Yes , indeed . 
So uh well 
I think w when we are working on the international market , uh in principle it has enough customers 
uh so 
when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim , I think . 
So , 
that about finance . 
And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control 
and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , 
it has to be trendy , 
it has to be user friendly . 
Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control . 
Yes , well 
i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control . 
We wer we were thinking television . Uh . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yes , yes . 
Th th that's very handy 
I  I always miss it 
and  on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have a lot of channels . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
A and I'm Nanne . 
So  
Yes . 
So . Um  
S 
S s 
Are there some other very important things to to do  well , 
to specify in this first phase of of the project . 
So 
the browse function , as you m mentioned . 
Yes . Yeah . 
Yes . 
Mm , well uh 
I I think  
Uh w y you two should  should , I think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm mm mm . Keep k keep in mind i it's a  it's a twenty five Euro unit , 
so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out , I think . 
So 
twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control . 
Yes , 
but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons uh that will be on it . I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting . 
Uh I would like to get this wrapped up 
and go to an end of this meeting . 
So  
So 
you know now the basic  the basic things . 
well 
just  just for the next meeting , um 
well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design , 
keep it general , 
I mean  so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions . 
So  
Um you will be working on  on technical function design , so  
And uh you  and you and uh uh uh well , think about requirements , 
eh ? 
Does it need internet , 
or or do do we stay at 
basic basic television uh interface . 
So , uh 
I think we should now all go work uh uh at this 
and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication . 
So 
next meeting will be in uh  in thirty minutes uh . 
K keep it in mind .
