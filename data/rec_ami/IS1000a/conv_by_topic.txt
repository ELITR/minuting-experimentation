C:  <cough> 
B:  So , um  We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh  to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans uh as I can say um so w we will also try to uh to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me I don't know whether you worked with them before . Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan . You all know I hope <laugh> how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Total . 
B:  Uh then we will uh discuss uh , well , how it should be and uh  wh what uh what our new product should look lite  like . And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting . 
topic_description:	opening_None


B:  So . Um basically this is about a uh a new c remote control . Um  We  When you design a new product you of  uh you of course want it to be original . Be uh  we want to be distinguished , mm ? People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think , well that's the product I I need . So it needs to be trendy . I mean trendy is what people want , so then I w they will buy our product . But then , uh , it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  So , the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase . Um  You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design . And the same holds for the uh 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  ph two phases uh after this , the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape . 
topic_description:	project specs and roles of participants_None


B:  Alright , but first we will do some uh tool training . In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh notebooks and w uh n note blocks and we have here a a  a  a white-board . 
C:  Whitebo 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  And um well it should work uh  I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . I didn't find out yet how it work , but maybe one of you did , so  Um  
D:  Under documents in the shared folder . Okay . 
B:  Yes . Do  Do we have to say something about that ? I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh . 
D:  Yeah , I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share . And uh , yeah . 
B:  Yes well we will then find out ho how it works . 
D:  Yes . 
B:  Um . Well , this seems to me , yes , some computer program but I didn't find it yet . So , we'll come to that later . So , uh now we will try out the white-board we have here . So , I would suggest uh  
D:  Each of us is going . 
B:  Well , yes , um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way . I  <laugh> I'm not really sure how this works , but  
D:  Okay , shall I start ? 
A:  Mm . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , you can start it you know . 
B:  Yes , a good idea Mael . 
A:  I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down . 
D:  So , i 
C:  No they will record through that . There's a sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make . 
A:  Mm . Mm . But for us it's just like a normal whiteboard . 
B:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  'Kay . 
C:  <cough> 
D:  But it's  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Actually , I think I cannot go with uh  
B:  You  you  D doesn't it work ? Maybe someo Maybe  maybe Anna , maybe you can start . Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  I have to draw . 
B:  So um

C:  You should go for the next one it seems to me . 
B:  W Well , this uh this tool seemed to work . <laugh> Let's continue to uh  to the real stuff . 
topic_description:	drawing exercise_None


D:  Yeah , exactly , yeah . 
A:  . Mm-hmm 
D:  Wow . 
B:  Um our project uh finance uh thing . Uh when we are  and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros , so when designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael , keep in mind uh uh uh  People uh 
C:  Twenty four . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project uh pr um 
D:  Per remote control , yeah ? Per project . 
B:  product . 
A:  . Mm 
B:  Yes . Okay . Um more interesting for our company <laugh> of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro . So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh <other> um things . Uh we will try to uh 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  to get at a international market uh so um it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America , 
C:  Ah yeah , the sale man , four million . 
B:  maybe some uh Asian countries . Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . 
D:  <other> So it's half of the selling price , if I am good in mathematics . 
B:  Yes , of course . Uh um I mean we still have to uh to make a profit , huh ? 
D:  Of course . 
C:  They have to sell at least four million to make a profit <laugh> 
A:  . Mm . 
B:  You all have to be paid . 
A:  <other> Mm 
C:  Ah we have to make  we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit . Fifty mill 
B:  Excuse me ? 
D:  Oh you're g very good in mathematics . <laugh> Four million . 
A:  . Yes . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yes , indeed . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  So uh well I think w when we are working on the international market , uh in principle it has enough customers uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim , I think . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  So , that about finance . 
topic_description:	project budget_None


topic_description:	discussion_None


B:  And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly . Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control . 
A:  <laugh> Mm-hmm 
C:  Of course it should have a on off button . <laugh> 
A:  . Mm-hmm 
B:  Yes , well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control . 
A:  . Mm . Yeah 
C:  Yeah , s and it depends what application you are using it for . You might need uh  
A:  . Mm 
B:  We wer we were thinking television . Uh . 
A:  . Mm 
C:  We are targ targeting the television set . So , you need to record the channels . <other> You need to browse the  browse the channels in upward downward way , 
A:  . Mm . Yeah 
B:  Mm-hmm . Yes , yes . Th th that's very handy I  I always miss it and  on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have a lot of channels . 
A:  . Mm 
C:  Uh  And  
A:  . Mm . Mm 
C:  Uh , and  
D:  And uh just before starting the detailed discussion , maybe we You are the marketing guy ? Or  th So you are the marketing . And you are in the u use user interface uh design . So just  yeah I wanted to to be sure . And I I'm the the industrial designer okay . Because I I don't know you very well , actually , but yeah . Okay . Mael . Happy to meet you . <other> Okay . It's very uh  
A:  . I'm marketing 
C:  Marketing . 
A:  . Yep 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yes . 
C:  Yeah . Sure . 
A:  . Mm-hmm 
C:  <other> 
B:  Yes .

A:  . Anna 
B:  A and I'm Nanne . So  
D:  Uh so yeah uh  Just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh  not face to face . 
B:  Yes . So . Um  S 
D:  <other> So mm  
C:  So . 
B:  S s 
A:  . Mm 
topic_description:	project specs and roles of participants_None


D:  <other> So I 
B:  Are there some other very important things to to do  well , 
C:  So  
B:  to specify in this first phase of of the project . So the browse function , as you m mentioned . 
A:  . Mm . Yeah . Oth yeah 
C:  And uh , you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel and then  you uh  Today we have uh um teletext and all those things . Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that , so  
B:  Yes . Yeah . Yes . 
A:  . Mm 
D:  Like what ? Like internet on the on T_V_ ? 
C:  Yeah I_P_O_ or . Now we are looking for 
A:  . Mm 
C:  television things or I_P_ . For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  . Mm . But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet 
C:  Yeah . Ah it's  it's  it's  it's coming up , actually . The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up . 
B:  Mm , well uh I I think  
D:  <other> Actually , yeah w <other> 
B:  Uh w y you two should  should , I think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality . 
C:  Let's  Let's take  
D:  Of course , and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements . Um then if they need internet , then we would be able to to p to propose something with uh uh T_V_ over I_P_ . But before  
A:  . Mm . Yeah 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . But  Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use 
B:  Mm mm mm . Keep k keep in mind i it's a  it's a twenty five Euro unit , so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out , I think . So twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control . 
A:  . Mm . Mm 
C:  Oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know , <laugh> you  you sell their product as well as your product with them , you know . <laugh> 
A:  . Mm 
D:  Yeah , but w w we want to design a new one . <laugh> Mm . <laugh> 
A:  . So try and get T_V_ manufacturers to 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> No , it's okay , yeah I understand . So we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things and then um  
D:  Yeah . The  Yeah , the main is browsing . Yeah . 
B:  Yes , but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons uh that will be on it . I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Uh I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  So  
C:  Okay , we are alread mm . Mm . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  So you know now the basic  the basic things . And 
C:  Yeah . 
A:   Mm-hmm 
C:  L 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


B:  well just  just for the next meeting , um well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design , keep it general , I mean  so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions . So  
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Um you will be working on  on technical function design , so  
C:  Yeah , sure . 
B:  And uh you  and you and uh uh uh well , think about requirements , eh ? Does it need internet , or or do do we stay at 
A:  . Mm-hmm 
C:  Stam . 
B:  basic basic television uh interface . 
A:  . Yeah 
B:  So , uh I think we should now all go work uh uh at this and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication . 
A:  . Mm-hmm . Yeah 
C:  Okay . 
B:  So next meeting will be in uh  in thirty minutes uh . K keep it in mind . 
D:  Perfect .
