Okay . 
<other> Je croix que c'est dommage de le  
it will be sad to destroy this prototype . 
It really looks like a banana . 
It is a banana . <laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Okay . 
Hi . 
So we are here for the detailed design meeting . 
<other> So <other> 
we will uh  
I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . 
Then uh I've  
I will also take notes during this meeting 
and I will send you uh a summary then as usual . 
We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues 
that make good work . 
<laugh> And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . 
Then we will uh evaluate the product . 
And uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with  it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . 
So 
d 
let's start with the cost aspect 
so so 
I look at the aspect discussed last time , 
that is to say uh to have a standard battery , 
<other> to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it 
to be 
uh to feel spongy , 
<other> and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera . 
And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros . 
So 
which is uh good , 
because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros . 
So 
for the financial aspect it's okay , 
we can uh  we can continue with this product uh as if , 
<other> and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert . 
Yeah . 
You have a presentation ? 
Participant four , yes . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Maybe you can presen <laugh> 
okay . 
Maybe  <laugh> hold it . 
<laugh> So I think it's uh very uh very nice . 
What do you think ? 
Yeah . So 
it's between one and seven ? 
Seven is the highest uh ? 
I will give a six . 
Maybe we all have to agree on a common  
Yeah . 
<other> 
No problem . 
So 
this is your  
One is most  . 
Well , 
we can choose what we want . 
Okay , 
let's say that seven is the best . 
Okay . 
So so 
do note the grade we have five , six for me , 
five . 
And what what's your choice ? 
How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? 
How much would you  
you don't answer to this uh questionnaire ? 
Five point five average . 
Okay . 
Well , 
does it  
Okay , techne technological aspect . 
Yeah , we have the wheel . 
We also have the rubber material , 
which make it uh like new also . 
I think I would give a five . 
Four ? 
Okay . 
No . 
So 
what's your uh grade ? 
Four ? 
So we have four , four f and five ? 
Yeah , four . Four , yeah , let's put four . 
Doesn't it  <other> 
Yeah , I think so . Yeah . 
I would give a  I would give a seven as well . 
It's very easy to use . 
So 
six point five . 
Okay . 
Oh yeah , 
its its f its fruit fruit shape . 
I would say seven . 
And is very very nice design . 
Yeah . Seven , okay . 
<laugh> 
I think you can't miss it . 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
we have <other> the <other> 
we don't sesh especially have the lightning 
but  
So 
it's yellow . 
It's okay . 
I think it's very easy to <laugh>  
I would say seven . 
It's hard to miss it . 
Yeah , 
it's rubber , made of rubber , 
I think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control . 
Yeah . 
But it is uh  it is surrounded by rubber material . 
So maybe we can put a six . 
Six is okay ? 
Yeah . 
Tadada . 
We have to sum up everything . 
<other> Six is a good  
Yeah , 
the be . 
Okay , so 
six is a  
So it's a good evaluation , I think . 
It's very promising . 
Huh . 
So this prototype is quite nice . <other> 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
<other> 
So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive , I think . 
I think the  
Yeah . 
So , 
I think , we can summarise . 
So 
we have seen the prototype . 
It's very nice according to the work of our two designer . 
The the the financial aspect were okay . 
We we have the cost below uh our threshold 
and so we could sell at twenty five Euros 
and make i make profit . 
The the evaluation give satisfying result as well . 
So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting . 
So 
the cost is in the budget , 
the evaluation is okay , 
so I th I think we can now uh open champagne 
and make a huge party . 
I don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff . 
<laugh> Okay so 
congratulation . 
<other> Nice product . 
Yeah . 
I think it was a good collaboration uh . 
Aspect . 
Sorry ? 
I think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well . 
All it depends on who watch this meeting . 
<laugh> We don't know . <laugh> 
Okay , so 
good guys <laugh> , 
so see you for next uh successful project . <laugh>
