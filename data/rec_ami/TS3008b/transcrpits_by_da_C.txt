<laugh> 
My mouse is not working anymore . 
<laugh> He's uh  
when I put it in , is is going to beep beep beep . 
<laugh> 
Huh . 
Okay , 
how can I get this on the whiteboard ? 
Okay , 
I've done that . 
Yes . 
'Kay , we're going to um uh talk about working design . 
Um , the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy , 
it activates a chip uh in the remote . 
It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television . 
Mm , it's a nowadays very uh known , a known uh uh technology . 
Um , the known technology can make a cost very low . 
Uh , it's a wild uh 
 a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world . 
And and the components are very uh very cheap . 
Um , 
Uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights , they're needed and they're uh everywhere available . 
Uh , again , it's a fair price . 
It's a common uh technology uh , like I told um  
Uh , the circuit board , it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control . 
Uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires , 
it's  it is uh  
can be made as fast as printing paper . 
It's uh  <laugh> it's all very uh  
Yeah , they're making it uh all the time . Uh , 
and it's not uh very specialised uh technology . <laugh> 
I haven't come to here , but um I've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls . 
They were not uh very uh trendy or just uh just a remote control like everyone knows . 
So I don't know uh why I should put it here . 
Uh  <laugh> 
Yes , 
but uh I uh haven't made it because uh of the time . 
<laugh> What ? 
<laugh> No . 
Yes . 
Um , no , it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology , yeah . 
Remote control is nothing special nowadays . 
Um  
I don't think so , 
because of the  all the televisions uh  there are a few  maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions , 
but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote ? 
No . 
<cough> 
But you can put them under the same button . 
But you can put a play and stop and and rewind . 
Yes , but we  
Huh . 
Yes , but there are there are  
But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? 
There are uh a dozen of uh  dozens of of remote controls that have  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yes , but you could put 
on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages . 
If you have seven pages , you can go up and down . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
Maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick . 
But  
No , it's o just signals uh  and the television d uh does the rest . 
No . 
The most standard batteries . 
But i in a way we have to be uh uh special . 
Maybe th m 
<laugh> 
For the remote control . <laugh> 
That's to be uh a formed for your hand . 
More like a joystick then . 
But that's that's fun for the first time , and then the second  
Or you can  
Yeah . <laugh> 
With recharger . 
Yes , but is that handy ? 
But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years , three years , with with t two batteries . 
And then you  
Yes . 
Or  
<other> But you pay for it . 
Maybe like this pen . 
It has to feel nice in your hand .
