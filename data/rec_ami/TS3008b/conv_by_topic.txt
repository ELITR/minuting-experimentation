B:  Here we go again . 
C:  <laugh> My mouse is not working anymore . <laugh> He's uh  when I put it in , is is going to beep beep beep . 
B:  <laugh> Oh . 
D:  Oh . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  Oh , I got a nice little screen here over here . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> I got like this big black border uh on every side . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Mm , okay . 
D:  <other> I'll I'll fix it . Yeah , whatever . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  Everybody ready ? 
B:  Yeah , it's okay . 
A:  Welcome at the functional design meeting , again presented by Maarten . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> 
A:  Uh this is the agenda , the opening . Uh , we've got three presentations . And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me . And we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions . We have uh forty minutes . 
D:  Yes . 
A:  Oh , well this is the <laugh> the closing already . So uh  well we start off with the th the first presentation then . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh , I think um in uh  we have to do it in uh in right order . Maybe the  
B:  Okay . 
D:  I don't know what the right order is . So  
A:  Well , it  
B:  No . 
C:  Huh . 
A:  Oh that . It won't  doesn't  Maybe we should start with the the technical functions . 
topic_description:	opening_None


C:  Okay , how can I get this on the whiteboard ? 
A:  Yeah ? Well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder . You've already done that ? 
B:  In project . 
C:  Okay , I've done that . 
B:  No can that open . 
C:  Yes . 
A:  Well let's close this one . We'll just uh open a new one . 
B:  Open it there . 
A:  Uh , well . Yes . Uh-oh . New thing . Oh yeah , uh I have to say something . Uh , due to some uh technical problems I haven't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes . But I'll uh make sure that uh happens next time . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Okay . <laugh> About the get  
A:  And I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


C:  'Kay , we're going to um uh talk about working design . 
C:  I haven't come to here , but um I've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls . They were not uh very uh trendy or just uh just a remote control like everyone knows . So I don't know uh why I should put it here . Uh  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Okay . But it's the technical side of the remote control . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yes , but uh I uh haven't made it because uh of the time . But  <laugh> 
A:  Oh . Okay . Well , we'll we'll have to skip that part then . 
C:  <laugh> What ? 
B:  Okay . 
A:  But you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control ? It's gonna be easy ? 
C:  <laugh> No . Yes . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  But nothing restricted for user interface ? 
A:  Yeah . M 
B:  With technical  
C:  Um , no , it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology , yeah . 
B:  I don't know . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  'Kay . 
C:  Remote control is nothing special nowadays . 
A:  R regardless of what type of functions we want to implement . Doesn't really matter . 
B:  Okay . 
C:  Um  
B:  But I kind of uh  
C:  I don't think so , because of the  all the televisions uh  there are a few  maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions , but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote ? 
A:  Okay . Yeah ,  okay . 
B:  Yes . Uh  
A:  Okay . Well , we'll see . We'll see later on . 
topic_description:	industrial designer presentation_None


C:  Um , the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy , it activates a chip uh in the remote . It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television . Mm , it's a nowadays very uh known , a known uh uh technology . Um , the known technology can make a cost very low . Uh , it's a wild uh  a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world . And and the components are very uh very cheap . Um , Uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights , they're needed and they're uh everywhere available . Uh , again , it's a fair price . It's a common uh technology uh , like I told um  Uh , the circuit board , it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control . Uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires , it's  it is uh  can be made as fast as printing paper . It's uh  <laugh> it's all very uh  
A:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah , they're making it uh all the time . Uh , 
A:  Okay . 
C:  and it's not uh very specialised uh technology . <laugh> 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


B:  Well , the technical functions . Um , well I don't know if you got the same uh pictures as I got , but uh I got these two , and I think they're  we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user . 
A:  No . 
C:  No . 
B:  <other> th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements , I don't s uh know who's doing t 
A:  Well , uh will there be some uh user requirements later on ? <other> The ones I  I've uh received from the account manager . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , but it  I think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control . 
A:  Well , we'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on . 
B:  Yeah , well y we can put functions in it when uh  yeah , when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it . 
A:  Uh-huh . Okay , but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote .  we should we should choose one uh  we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v Yeah ? Well , what  that's what you want  trying to say . 
D:  Yes , I agree . Yeah . 
B:  Well , yeah w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and  we have to choose for novice user . But I don't know . It's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use . 
A:  Okay . Okay . Yeah , well <other> some of these  Uh , yeah . Well , some of that will  Yeah , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements . 
B:  Yeah , probably , yeah . 
D:  Yes . 
A:  So  
B:  Yeah ? 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh , well , that's all I have to say , I think . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah , that was it . 
D:  <other> Alright . 
topic_description:	interface specialist presentation_None


B:  Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . I think that's just basic what we need . And from that on we can  user requirements what we need more . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Uh  Yeah , I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy  the trends in the markets , and I don't know if there uh are any um  uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that . 
D:  Yes . <other> I haven't really found a conclusion like that . 
B:  M you can just <other> you can k <laugh> you can keep it in mind that . I don't know . Uh , I th I thought the the  with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh  yeah , more trendier design , I think . I think . 
D:  Yeah . Design . Sounds interesting . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  Well , then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market . 
D:  <other> Yes . 
B:   . 
D:  Yeah . It's alright . Um  
D:  So , <other> what I was thinking  oh , wrong side . We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . Group features for a higher usability , uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting . Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh  there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh  yeah , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there . <laugh> And um , if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options , group them in the button , not too uh  
A:  Okay . 
D:  <other> Yeah . Small buttons , so they won't be very um , how do you say  
A:  Visually presents . 
D:  Yes , won't be very present , thank you . And a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh  consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . That was kind of what I found . 
topic_description:	marketing expert presentation_None


D:  Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements . Um  yes . The working method um <other> there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . Uh , I've lined them up here . Uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . I uh have found some interesting things . We do we do got a market . Um , <other> three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results . <other> Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . That's quite a lot . Um , <other> relevant options are , of course , power buttons . Although , only used once per hour . Uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . Furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . That doesn't say we got  we can leave ninety percent off . But it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated . Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . And um <other> an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . And uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . 
topic_description:	user requirements_None


A:  Okay . Well , then we  I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important . Uh , well some of the uh new requirements <other> make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant , I think . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  <other> Okay . <other> Yes . <laugh> 
A:  Because um uh s decided to put  They have decide to put two additional requirements forward . Well , now I see four . That's kinda strange . 
D:  Two ? <laugh> 
A:  Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off . It's impossible , I think . So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and don't make a lot of special  put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or  You know , it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much . So we have to think of that . The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely . 
B:  Well  
D:  <other> No uh , I agree , I agree . 
B:  No way . 
D:  Not too much , no . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> Okay . 
A:  I don't know . I think that uh that's what they're trying to say . Uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . But , well , they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger  
D:  <other> Mm-hmm . <other> I don't really agree actually , to be honest . It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . It's only like thirty percent of the total market . Mayb yeah ? 
A:  Yeah , but it is  it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that . Our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , <other> you know , a new customer group . That's the one we haven't covered yet . So I think that's what the problem is . We haven't got remote controls for uh  Well I think , yeah . 
D:  <other> Okay . Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit . Not too much then , bu alright . 
A:  Yeah , I think so . Maybe if it's  no no , but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either . Uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . Okay , <other> something else nice to know . 
D:  Yes . 
B:  But what's our slogan ? 
A:  Sorry ? Yeah , <other> you will have to look that up . <laugh> 
B:  The slogan uh  <laugh> 
D:  <other> Yeah , I'll have a look . 
A:  <other> 
D:  We put the fashion in electronics . 
A:  I think it's something about the  Oh , okay . <other> I thought it w might be , let's make things better or something , but  
B:  Puts fashion in electronics . <laugh> <laugh> Sense simplicity . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Sense and simplicity . <laugh> 
topic_description:	new requirements_None


A:  Okay well , <other> let's go back to the the agenda . So we've now had to  the three presentations . We know about the new project requirements . That means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . Well , if I can uh make a start , I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be , and I already talked about the  maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . I think we're we're looking for some  Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . Y well , that  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , to be honest , if um our uh aim group is uh till forty , not older than forty , maybe that's not very uh  yeah , we don't really need to have a simple remote control . I think we can implement more functions then , because um <other> basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology and therefore will be a more  
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , but wha 
A:  Yeah , yeah . M yeah , that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , I think they are are c are contradicting each other , because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just T_V_ , but they s do aim at a younger  Well , ma 
B:  But  
D:  Yes . <other> 
B:  Yeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used . So why should j we put this function in ? I think more  I think uh people  younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions . 
D:  Yeah . <other> Well , I think  
C:  <cough> 
A:  But I think uh you  we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have  Y Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player . You can uh , know , you  you can <other> make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . We don't want that . I think that was  that became clear . We don't want . But w maybe we should put some func uh , I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to , 
D:  Yes . 
A:  you know , they want to uh 
D:  Yeah , control . 
B:  Yeah , but uh you said  Yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making . 
A:  control , remotely . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  No , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the  The new project requirements told us not to  But maybe w Yeah . I think we maybe should <other> 
B:  It's n Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other  maybe for other equipment on it . But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind , or n what d what do you guys think ? 
D:   
C:  But you can put them under the same button . 
D:  Not much more than that . Yep . 
A:  Yeah , if  as far as possible . 
D:  Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever . So t 
A:  But what do you think ? Do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that  to control other devices ? No , you don't think so ? Yeah , the new requirements say so . 
B:  No . 
D:  <other> 
B:  No , new requirements say no . So  
C:  But you can put a play and stop and and rewind . 
A:  Well , maybe it's  maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control . You know , a lot of D_V_D_ players have some tricky settings with  
D:  <other> Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , but  
C:  Yes , but we  
D:  Y yes . 
B:  I i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control , they use their own th th <other> with lot more functions . 
A:  <other> Yep , exactly . That's that's wha 
D:  But but for for example , V_C_R_ , that's better example in this case . I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever , just play , stop , rewind and uh fast forward . 
A:  No no , you don't <other>  No no , you don't need it . No , no . 
B:  No , no . Exactly . 
C:  Huh . 
A:  Okay , but we have to think uh  w we have to think D_V_D_ I th uh , I guess , so um but uh from my experience it's kinda <other> a lot of D_V_D_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . Uh , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . It's c sometimes a bit difficult . Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh  Well , I was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then . 
D:  Yeah , I know , but uh  
B:  Mm , yeah . 
D:  <other> Yes . 
B:  Yeah , but just  <other> keep it simple and look more at th 
A:  And uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one . If you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote . Okay . It's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table , and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more . 
B:  No . It's only for television . So  
C:  Yes , but there are there are  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , nothing more . Exactly . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Alright . 
A:  Um , but what televis 
C:  But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? There are uh a dozen of uh  dozens of of remote controls that have  
A:  Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy . <laugh> And simple . Well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . So we should put uh zap buttons on it . Um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> The user interface is easy . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  And the basic  yeah , basic functions , yeah . 
D:  <other> Yes , definitely , yeah . 
A:  Uh , 
B:  It's too much integrated in the other . 
A:  Okay , a t a teletext button should be there . But just one big teletext button , on and off . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Probably . 
D:  Yeah , and maybe two or three other options , but not  nothing more than that . I think stop function is very useful . If you have a uh a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader , 
A:  Oh , okay . 
D:  then I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up , but  
A:  Yeah , but uh I think that becomes too difficult , it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then . 
D:  <other> Well , I use it very regularly , the action . I re I use it <laugh> quite often . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but I've never heard of it in the first place . And 
B:  Will you look  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  we have to  well t yeah , and t and teletext is becoming outdated . We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably . Yeah . I don't know . I think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote . I don't know what you th guys think . 
B:  Look at the market . Well  
D:  Might be . Might be . 
B:  Yeah , I  uh , it's    Sunday I always use it for the uh yeah , for the soccer uh  
A:  Yeah , but do you like to have a  such a s stop button ? Or do you think it uh  I think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function . 
B:  Well , uh when you uh uh  when you look uh  for example um , a couple of weeks ago I looked at the  for the flights , and there are a lot of flights in one page , so if if th 
A:  Yeah . Okay , it goes  Yeah , but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now . That's why <laugh> it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements . 
C:  Yes , but you could put 
B:  Yeah , but  <other> 
C:  on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages . If you have seven pages , you can go up and down . 
A:  Well yeah uh , lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using  I think we should just put one teletext button on it . Then we meet uh the new requirements . 
C:  Yes . 
B:  True . 
A:  we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design , I guess . 
B:  A simple  yeah . 
A:  Okay . Um , well , what functions do we have to decide on ? Or do we  uh I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want . We have the zap and uh the volume . Should we do m make them very big ? The the the zap button . D d 
D:  I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present , yep . 
C:  Yes . 
A:  Th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also . 
B:  But trendy , yeah . I don't know . 
A:  Or maybe you should place them on a  uh , in a special way ? 
C:  Maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick . 
A:  Yeah , something or uh <other> somethin special way to to zap through the  it has to <other> s it has to be <other>  yeah , and quick . You have to use it very quickly . 
B:  Original . It was uh  
D:  Yep . <other> If you grab the remote , your hands should be on top of the plus . 
B:  True . 
A:  Yeah , and it  the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid  at a rapid pace . 
D:  Yes . 
A:  Oh , what should we decide on then ? I think in a in a case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already , but it w shouldn't be a problem then . 
C:  But  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  No , it's o just signals uh  and the television d uh does the rest . 
A:  Yep . 
B:  Maybe uh  
A:  No , okay , but we don't have to  uh , when we don't want to uh control other devices , I think it makes it even more simple . 
C:  No . 
B:  Uh maybe we  uh uh the batteries maybe . If you use large batteries or small batter batteries . 
C:  The most standard batteries . 
A:  I think I think that we should use uh d yeah , not not uh the b the watch kind   th the most uh  Well , it has to be simple , and I wi 
D:  I think double A_ . 
B:  Yeah ? <laugh> 
D:  Yep . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  The most ordinary uh batteries . 
A:  Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house , you know . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  Yep . 
A:  Oh . How much time do we ha we have left uh ? M m m more than thirty minutes ? Uh ten twenty minutes . <ff sound indicating unimportance> Well , uh these these shouldn't  
D:  <other> I think about twenty minutes . 
C:  But i in a way we have to be uh uh special . 
B:  Early break . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah , okay . But that's that's  Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can  what the extra touch can be . Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or  Well , it was something about how we lose them . Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing . 
C:  Maybe th m 
D:  <laugh> I think that's n that's more for a for an age range or uh <laugh> ten to twelve or whatever . <laugh> 
B:  To find him . That's maybe  yeah . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> I don't know . I don't know . Nah , um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things . It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone , and it is i  has something nice . Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it , or maybe it should <other>  or an  or the like the the can opener . Maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control . I think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special . It's gonna cost twenty five Euros . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , yeah , that's good one , yep . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  <other> Ye I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not a rare combination . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , but the  well , it's already been done . 
B:  Yeah , but that's  yeah . 
A:  Nah . <laugh> Yeah , that's true . But  and I think it's gonna be uh very uh  it has to be sturdy or something , so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something .  it has to be used something special , and you really  <other> it has to , you know y not s people , when they buy it , they have to think , well this one lasts for a long time . We're really gonna use them . Not some thing you you throw away next week , you know . 
D:  Yes . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yep . No , that's true . 
A:  So maybe uh that's i I think that's <other> when uh when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , uh it's very important to find something like this . So there's a very important task for you . And maybe we can all think about it . Uh , also for you maybe , when t you  it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and uh and al as in a friend  use friendly as well , you know . So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing . 
B:  Be original , yeah . Mm-hmm . And use friendly , yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <other> Must brain-storm . 
A:  Uh-huh . 
D:  Yeah , a swapable front or whatever . 
A:  Yeah , or just different colours would be uh  I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control . It could be be  Yeah , you never know , but  
B:  Well  
C:  For the remote control . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Why not ? 
D:  Yeah . <other> 
B:  More money for us . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  But it  and I think we have to make it quite big . 
B:  Yeah . Quite big . Yeah , you think ? 
D:  Yes , definitely , definitely . 
A:  Yeah ,  people  
C:  That's to be uh a formed for your hand . 
A:  So , and and also because uh it is expensive . If you want it to be something , you know , it's ha doesn't have much functions  want to be  you don't want to get it l make it  
D:  <other> Yes , it  it it should be f <other> be visible nearly anywhere in the room . As I uh as I said during my presentation , fifty percent uh o 
A:  Mm-hmm . And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table . I I think you m might wanna put it uh <other>  yeah , that it it it it stands up . Yeah , you have to put it on its  So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table .  no no ,  put stuff inside it . But , it's like like a statue or something   
B:  A standard or something . 
D:  Yeah . A face ? Or uh yeah , yeah . Yeah . 
C:  More like a joystick then . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , yeah , I see what you mean , yep . 
B:  It's like you have uh four phones . Something like that . 
A:  Yeah yeah , but  yeah , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in  
D:  If you do that , but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros . <laugh> I in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . That's probably stupid , but uh as I found here uh , fifty percent , was it fifty ? Uh fifty percent 
A:  That it's it's fashionable . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:   I  I don't  Oh , yeah . 
C:  But that's that's fun for the first time , and then the second  
D:  fifty percent often loses remote control . 
A:  Yeah , but but when you  <laugh> when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it  
D:  No uh , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in . 
A:  <other> Oh , okay . 
B:  On the television . Oh , like this . 
A:  <other> Uh , that's kind of nice . 
D:  If an  a button in in that uh  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Or you can  
A:  And then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it uh chargeable . <laugh> 
B:  A char <laugh> chargeable . Yeah . 
D:  <other> Yeah , you can ma make rechargeable one , yeah . Why not . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , that w yeah , but  yeah , the pro No , well I think that it might be t p Well , nee but we don't  Yeah . Maybe you , but <laugh> we don't know much about production cost , but when you  you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control , then the then the money  there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know ,  rechargeable units . 
B:  Why not . 
C:  With recharger . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  It should only cost twelve and a half Euros , of course . Aye ? 
A:  Yeah , but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and  <laugh> So , it's not gonna be that expen 
B:  Production . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah , okay . <laugh> 
B:  It should be possible . I think it's a good idea . 
A:  Uh I I think it's a great idea . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  S some kind of be I've never seen that before , and you make it uh um be uh , you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays . 
B:  To make a base or something ? 
D:  Yes . Yes , definitely . Yeah . 
C:  Yes , but is that handy ? 
A:  Well , I  well it's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . That's one  . And uh you can always find your remote control up  
B:  It's it's it's it's 
C:  But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years , three years , with with t two batteries . 
B:  it's not the purpose to be handy , it's 
A:  Uh , okay . Well , maybe yeah , you could  when that's  when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , but you will  you do need uh also an  uh , also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know . Does it makes it kinda  
C:  And then you  Yes . Or  
D:  Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course . I don't know . 
B:  Mm . Yeah , but that's not  it's ugly , I think . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . Okay . Yeah . Yeah , but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it . 
B:  No . 
D:  On the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make a nice bay . I mean , it looks trendy and still <laugh> still put a bleep function in it , but um I think the bay is definitely uh  
A:  <laugh> Yeah . I think it's a good idea . And make it , you know , we we um  Well , we uh  it's  it isn't a t a most uh costly uh remote control . We can save on the on the functions . We just <other> put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make , or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up , it's also nice . And if you put it away , I think it's uh w we have to  we uh  that's uh  it's not a easy market . We have to something special . And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control , and we can't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions , because we aren't gonna put  
D:  Sure , why not . Yep . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  True . Yeah . 
D:  Definitely . With eye candy , ear candy , whatever . Yeah , definitely . 
A:  Yeah . And then uh when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this   and then you also you got the stand-up thing . Yeah . I think I think it's a good idea . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , it must be must be a gadget to have . 
A:  Yeah . Oh , if it  let's  well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing . And the first thing we  the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . If that's too expensive , we won't do that . But it would be nice . 
D:  Definitely , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah , we c 
D:  <other> It would be nice , yes . 
A:  It's the idea . I know that batteries last long nowadays . And and what people just think about , well , I'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty . And you know then when you haven't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo   I've experienced that that  
D:  Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so <laugh> yes . 
A:  Yeah , okay . So , easy functions . Well , we will we will  I think we'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi 
B:  Or just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down . 
D:  Yeah , why not . 
A:  Yeah . But it's also annoying .  'cause as long as it stays  as it ke keeps working , you're not very motivated to do something about it . Then it beeps all the time and  . You don't want to have  ever have those problems , and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable  . And you don't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people don't like it . Uh , i i in the in the ma Yeah , but it w I mean , if if they pay for it because they think , oh , that's a great idea , I'm gonna use it . And when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , I'll never put him in the recharger , I think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . Then when they look  get m I I I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of  they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control , they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh , I think it's brilliant . Yeah , I've never  it's so simple , but I've never seen it . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Hmm . 
B:  Yeah .  true . 
D:  No , that's true . Why not . 
C:  <other> But you pay for it . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Bleep bleep bleep , oh there it is , yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  No . Nearly . 
B:  And you can leave it just there . 
A:  M maybe we should really <laugh> do this .  <laugh> Okay now , well , how much time have we got left ? These clocks aren't uh synched . Oh , now I've put uh  well ,  it is twenty p Okay , so we have ten minutes or something ? 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  <other> 
B:  <laugh> Yes . <laugh> Yeah , I'll  
D:  Something like that , yeah . 
topic_description:	discussion_None


A:  Yeah , but we're uh we're done . I think . 
B:  Uh fifteen minutes . 
A:  We've decided on the functions . Well , there is some  oh . There is a closing sheet . We have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work . 
B:  <other> 
D:  Oh . 
A:  Oh <other> okay , I'll make sure  I'll  I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes , the the s the next minutes won't be a problem , but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too , but maybe it won't work , but you'll see . I think these are more important than the first ones , so  
D:  <other> We'll see . 
B:  Can you make an uh uh a part of f folder for the minutes maybe ? That not not everything in one one uh folder . 
A:   . 
D:  Maarten , five minutes . 
A:  Oh , five minutes . Yeah , because uh I I d I did uh  the first minutes I did were were were a bit scratchy , you know . Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout , which I could uh , know , use for the other ones  well , but uh I d think uh I forgot to do  put done under the first one , and when you go write a second uh it's get  it's not working <laugh> when you try to write second uh paper or something . And then you    you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know . Becau I d uh , it was not my uh pen . 
B:  Yeah . Maybe . 
D:  No , that's true uh , yeah . 
topic_description:	closing_None


D:  Should we by the way draw um 
A:   this kind of looks you like . 
D:  on our nice whiteboard , um a little uh idea of  yeah . 
A:  Of the shape . 
B:  Or the sh 
A:  Yeah , probably , it would be nice . 
D:  I dunno . Has anyone got um <other> a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ? I don't , for one . 
B:  <other> Do you get an idea of the shape ? 
C:  Maybe like this pen . 
D:  A bit bigger I guess , but  <laugh> 
A:  No , bigger . 
B:  A little bit bigger , yeah but  
D:  The shape is nice , it's um something different , and we want we want that . Yeah . 
C:  It has to feel nice in your hand . 
A:  Well , I I <other> I have to say , I have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all , or I think some  maybe we should  no , that will be too costly . We shou we could also , that was a  would also be an idea , but I don't think it  I don't know if it exists already , you should like make Alessi or something design it . 
B:  <laugh> Oh , uh look  uh look at the pictures . 
D:  <other> Okay , yeah . 
A:  That would also be nice . But that's gonna  then you c then you don't 
D:  Yeah , but <other> twelve and a half Euros ? Uh  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , but then you don't have t yeah it  that's not something i that's in the production cost   a one  it's a one time , you know  s was  it's a single cost . Yeah , m but but then you can  nah , I don't thin I think that it would be more expensive , because I've bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive . 
D:  <other> Yeah . Yeah , that's true . 
A:  Would be a nice idea though . I don't know . I think it uh has to be a r  it has to have round forms or something . Like something like that or so or so 
D:  Something like that is very ergonomic . 
A:  And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it . It's also round . 
D:  So  
A:  Put it in there uh  wire on it . 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  Maybe uh , I don't know , some some lights , a big but well .  
B:  Yeah , flash lights at the side . At the side , or something like that . 
A:  Volume and programme , yeah . 
D:  Yes , volume and programme should be there I guess , because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part . 
A:  And some of the extra funct Some of the extra functions over here . Numbers . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , and the numbers on top , I guess . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  And and lights ? How we're g well , maybe uh s a ring of  no , no , you have to   Maybe on the side of it . 
D:  Maybe ro roun rounds uh uh l sorry . 
B:  Yeah , side of it . Just two LEDs or something on the side . Yeah . 
A:  Along the side uh strip of  yeah . 
D:  Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons .   
A:  Yeah , but I also meant the the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote . 
D:  Oh . Okay . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , theys have to be  
B:  Well , uh probably at the side . You know look at the front , but  
A:  Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Exactly . When you you see it from the side , then it would look just  like that . 
B:  Yeah , exactly , and then there is  yeah . 
A:  And then you have a strip of uh lights or something . 
B:  Yeah , something like that , yeah . 
D:  Okay , yeah . 
A:  Well , uh I think it's nice , for one thing .  maybe put something on top of it <laugh> or , you know , like that's  looks funny . I don't know . 
B:  <laugh> No . <laugh> No . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Or some bump . Maybe some  Yeah ? 
D:  I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then . 
B:  Bumper or something . 
A:  We'll have to think about it .
