A:  Welcome at the functional design meeting , again presented by Maarten . 
A:  Uh , we've got three presentations . 
A:  And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me . 
abst_sum - abstract: The project manager opened the meeting.

C:  'Kay , we're going to um uh talk about working design . 
C:  It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television . 
C:  Uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights , they're needed and they're uh everywhere available . 
C:  Uh , the circuit board , it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control . 
abst_sum - abstract: The industrial designer reported on working design, explaining how a remote control works and describing its main components.

B:  Well , the technical functions . 
B:  and I think they're  we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user . 
B:  <other> th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements , 
B:  w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and  we have to choose for novice user . 
B:  Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , 
B:  uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , 
B:  uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . 
B:  Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . 
B:  and I don't know if there uh are any um  uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that . 
B:  Uh , I th I thought the the  with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh  
abst_sum - abstract: The user interface designer talked about what functions should be included.

B:  and I think they're  we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user . 
abst_sum - abstract: He suggested they should focus on either expert or novice users.

B:  Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , 
B:  uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , 
B:  uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . 
B:  Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . 
D:  three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . 
abst_sum - abstract: The basic functions should include an on/off switch, buttons for channels one to nine, volume, mute and buttons for next and previous channel.

B:  and I don't know if there uh are any um  uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that . 
B:  Uh , I th I thought the the  with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh  
abst_sum - abstract: He suggested that a trendy design should not have many buttons.

D:  Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements . 
D:  there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab 
D:  and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . 
D:  So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . 
D:  Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results . 
D:  Furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . 
D:  Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . 
D:  Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , 
D:  And a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh  consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . 
abst_sum - abstract: The marketing expert reported on user requirements, including how users rated the importance of different features.

D:  So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . 
D:  Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results . 
D:  Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . 
abst_sum - abstract: He stressed that a trendy design is important, that users zap a lot, and that remotes often get lost.

A:  Well , then we  I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements 
A:  Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . 
A:  Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off . 
A:  So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , 
A:  The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . 
A:  New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . 
D:  It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . 
A:  Yeah , but it is  it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that . 
A:  So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either . 
A:  Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . 
abst_sum - abstract: The project manager informed the group of new requirements.

A:  Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet .

A:  Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . 
abst_sum - abstract: The remote is only for TV, should not include a teletext feature, and should feature the company colour and slogan.

A:  That means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . 
A:  Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . 
A:  I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to , 
A:  No , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the  The new project requirements told us not to  
A:  But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind , 
B:  No , new requirements say no . 
A:  Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh  
A:  Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy . 
D:  I think stop function is very useful . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but I've never heard of it in the first place . And 
A:  I think we should just put one teletext button on it . 
D:  I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present , 
A:  No , okay , but we don't have to  uh , when we don't want to uh control other devices , I think it makes it even more simple . 
B:  uh uh the batteries maybe . If you use large batteries or small batter batteries . 
D:  I think double A_ . 
C:  But i in a way we have to be uh uh special . 
A:  Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can  what the extra touch can be . 
A:  Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing . 
A:  Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it , 
A:  so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something . 
A:  So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing . 
D:  a swapable front or whatever . 
A:  Yeah , or just different colours would be uh  I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control . 
D:  <laugh> I in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . 
A:  Yeah , you have to put it on its  So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table . 
D:  If you do that , but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros . 
A:  And then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it uh chargeable . <laugh> 
A:  but when you  you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control , then the then the money  there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know ,  rechargeable units . 
A:  Well , maybe yeah , you could  when that's  when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , 
D:  On the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make a nice bay . 
D:  I mean , it looks trendy and still <laugh> still put a bleep function in it , 
A:  well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . 
A:  And and what people just think about , well , I'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty . 
abst_sum - abstract: The group discussed what functions and features the remote should have, and whether to include DVD/VCR controls, a teletext button, stop button, changeable covers, and a base/recharger with locator function.

D:  Has anyone got um <other> a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ? 
C:  Maybe like this pen . 
C:  It has to feel nice in your hand . 
A:  you should like make Alessi or something design it . 
D:  Yeah , but <other> twelve and a half Euros ? Uh  <laugh> 
A:  I think it uh has to be a r  it has to have round forms or something . 
D:  Something like that is very ergonomic . 
A:  And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it . It's also round . 
A:  Maybe uh , I don't know , some some lights , a big but well . 
D:  Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons .   
A:  but I also meant the the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote . 
A:   maybe put something on top of it <laugh> or , you know , like that's  looks funny . 
D:  I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then . 
abst_sum - abstract: The group also discussed making the remote a rounded, ergonomic shape, and using flashing lights to help locate it when lost.

A:  I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes , 
A:  the the s the next minutes won't be a problem , 
A:  but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too , 
abst_sum - action: The project manager will write up the minutes, and put the minutes from both this meeting and the previous one in the project folder.

A:  We have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work . 
abst_sum - action: The marketing expert, industrial designer and user interface designer will have thirty minutes after lunch to work on their individual presentations.

A:  Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . 
A:  Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy . 
C:  But i in a way we have to be uh uh special . 
A:  Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can  what the extra touch can be . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will have a simple, trendy design, with some kind of special feature that makes it stand out.

A:  Well , maybe yeah , you could  when that's  when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , 
A:  well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . 
abst_sum - decisions: If the budget allows it the remote will include a base unit with a locator function, which will also act as a recharger.

A:  Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off . 
A:  So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , 
A:  I think we should just put one teletext button on it . 
abst_sum - problems: Even though the new project requirements stated that teletext was outdated, the group felt they should still include one teletext button.

A:  I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to , 
A:  No , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the  The new project requirements told us not to  
A:  But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind , 
B:  No , new requirements say no . 
A:  Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh  
abst_sum - problems: The group were still unsure whether to include some DVD/VCR functions on the remote.

C:  But i in a way we have to be uh uh special . 
A:  Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can  what the extra touch can be . 
A:  Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it ,

D:  a swapable front or whatever . 
A:  Yeah , or just different colours would be uh  I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control . 
abst_sum - problems: The group had difficulty deciding what special feature they should include to make their product stand out.

D:  <laugh> I in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . 
A:  Yeah , you have to put it on its  So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table .

abst_sum - problems: The group were not sure whether to include a base/recharger for the remote.

abst_sum - problems: They were not sure how much a recharger would cost to make.
