Okay . 
Everybody ready ? 
Welcome at the functional design meeting , again presented by Maarten . 
Uh this is the agenda , the opening . 
Uh , we've got three presentations . 
And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me . 
And we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions . 
We have uh forty minutes . 
Oh , well this is the <laugh> the closing already . 
So uh  well we start off with the th the first presentation then . 
Uh , I think um in uh  we have to do it in uh in right order . 
Maybe the  
Well , it  
Oh that . It won't  doesn't  
Maybe we should start with the the technical functions . 
Yeah ? 
Well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder . 
You've already done that ? 
Well let's close this one . 
We'll just uh open a new one . 
Uh , well . 
Yes . 
Uh-oh . New thing . 
Oh yeah , uh I have to say something . 
Uh , due to some uh technical problems I haven't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes . 
But I'll uh make sure that uh happens next time . 
And I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Okay . But it's the technical side of the remote control . 
Oh . 
Okay . Well , we'll we'll have to skip that part then . 
But you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control ? 
It's gonna be easy ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . M 
Okay . 
R regardless of what type of functions we want to implement . Doesn't really matter . 
Okay . Yeah ,  okay . 
Okay . 
Well , we'll see . We'll see later on . 
No . 
Well , uh will there be some uh user requirements later on ? 
<other> The ones I  I've uh received from the account manager . 
Yeah . 
Well , we'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on . 
Uh-huh . 
Okay , 
but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote . 
 we should we should choose one uh  
we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v 
Yeah ? 
Well , what  that's what you want  trying to say . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah , well <other> some of these  
Uh , yeah . 
Well , some of that will  
Yeah , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements . 
So  
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Well , then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market . 
Okay . 
Visually presents . 
Okay . 
Well , then we  I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements 
and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important . 
Uh , well some of the uh new requirements <other> make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant , I think . 
Because um uh s decided to put  They have decide to put two additional requirements forward . 
Well , now I see four . 
That's kinda strange . 
Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . 
Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off . 
It's impossible , I think . 
So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , 
and don't make a lot of special  put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or  
You know , it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much . 
So we have to think of that . 
The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . 
So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely . 
I don't know . 
I think that uh that's what they're trying to say . 
Uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . 
New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . 
So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . 
But , well , they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger  
Yeah , but it is  it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that . 
Our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , <other> you know , a new customer group . 
That's the one we haven't covered yet . 
So I think that's what the problem is . 
We haven't got remote controls for uh  
Well I think , yeah . 
Yeah , I think so . 
Maybe if it's  
no no , but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . 
So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either . 
Uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . 
Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . 
Okay , <other> something else nice to know . 
Sorry ? 
Yeah , <other> you will have to look that up . <laugh> 
<other> 
I think it's something about the  
Oh , okay . <other> 
I thought it w might be , let's make things better or something , but  
Okay well , 
<other> let's go back to the the agenda . 
So we've now had to  the three presentations . 
We know about the new project requirements . 
That means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . 
Well , if I can uh make a start , 
I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be , 
and I already talked about the  maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . 
I think we're we're looking for some  
Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . 
Y well , that  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
M yeah , that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , I think they are are c are contradicting each other , 
because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just T_V_ , but they s do aim at a younger  
Well , ma 
But I think uh you  we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have  
Y 
Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player . 
You can uh , know , you  
you can <other> make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . 
We don't want that . 
I think that was  that became clear . 
We don't want . 
But w maybe we should put some func uh , 
I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to , 
you know , they want to uh 
control , remotely . 
No , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the  The new project requirements told us not to  
But maybe w Yeah . I think we maybe should <other> 
Yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other  maybe for other equipment on it . 
But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind , 
or n what d what do you guys think ? 
Yeah , if  as far as possible . 
But what do you think ? 
Do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that  to control other devices ? 
No , you don't think so ? 
Yeah , the new requirements say so . 
Well , maybe it's  
maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control . 
You know , a lot of D_V_D_ players have some tricky settings with  
<other> Yep , exactly . 
That's that's wha 
No no , you don't <other>  No no , you don't need it . No , no . 
Okay , but we have to think uh  w we have to think D_V_D_ I th uh , I guess , 
so um but uh from my experience it's kinda <other> a lot of D_V_D_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . 
Uh , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . 
It's c sometimes a bit difficult . 
Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh  
Well , I was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then . 
And uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one . 
If you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote . 
Okay . 
It's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table , 
and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more . 
Okay . 
Um , but what televis 
Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy . 
<laugh> And simple . 
Well , we we will come to that , 
but ju first on the on the functions . 
So we should put uh zap buttons on it . 
Um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels . 
Uh , 
Okay , 
a t a teletext button should be there . 
But just one big teletext button , on and off . 
Probably . 
Oh , okay . 
Yeah , but uh I think that becomes too difficult , 
it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then . 
Yeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but I've never heard of it in the first place . And 
we have to  
well t yeah , and t and teletext is becoming outdated . 
We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably . 
Yeah . I don't know . 
I think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote . 
I don't know what you th guys think . 
Yeah , but do you like to have a  such a s stop button ? 
Or do you think it uh  
I think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function . 
Yeah . 
Okay , it goes  
Yeah , but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now . 
That's why <laugh> it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements . 
Well yeah uh , 
lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using  
I think we should just put one teletext button on it . 
Then we meet uh the new requirements . 
we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re 
we have to choose for the the simple design , I guess . 
Okay . Um , 
well , what functions do we have to decide on ? 
Or do we  
uh I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want . 
We have the zap and uh the volume . 
Should we do m make them very big ? The the the zap button . 
D d 
Th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also . 
Or maybe you should place them on a  uh , in a special way ? 
Yeah , something 
or uh <other> somethin special way to to zap through the  
it has to <other> s it has to be <other>  
yeah , and quick . You have to use it very quickly . 
Yeah , 
and it  the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid  at a rapid pace . 
Oh , what should we decide on then ? 
I think in a in a case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already , but it w shouldn't be a problem then . 
Yep . 
No , okay , but we don't have to  uh , when we don't want to uh control other devices , I think it makes it even more simple . 
I think 
I think that we should use uh d 
yeah , not not uh the b the watch kind 
  th the most uh  
Well , it has to be simple , and I wi 
Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house , you know . 
Oh . How much time do we ha we have left uh ? 
M m m more than thirty minutes ? 
Uh ten twenty minutes . 
<ff sound indicating unimportance> Well , uh these these shouldn't  
Yeah . Yeah , okay . 
But that's that's  
Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can  what the extra touch can be . 
Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or  
Well , it was something about how we lose them . 
Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> I don't know . I don't know . 
Nah , um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things . 
It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone , and it is i  has something nice . 
Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it , 
or maybe it should <other>  or an  
or the like the the can opener . Maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control . 
I think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special . 
It's gonna cost twenty five Euros . 
Yeah , but the  well , it's already been done . 
Nah . <laugh> Yeah , that's true . 
But  
and I think it's gonna be uh very uh  it has to be sturdy or something , 
so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something . 
 it has to be used something special , 
and you really  <other> it has to , 
you know y not s people , when they buy it , they have to think , well this one lasts for a long time . We're really gonna use them . 
Not some thing you you throw away next week , you know . 
So maybe uh that's i I think that's <other> when uh when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , uh it's very important to find something like this . 
So there's a very important task for you . 
And maybe we can all think about it . 
Uh , also for you maybe , when t you  it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and uh and al as in a friend  use friendly as well , you know . 
So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing . 
Uh-huh . 
Yeah , or just different colours would be uh  I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control . 
It could be be  
Yeah , you never know , but  
But it  
and I think we have to make it quite big . 
Yeah , 
 people  
So , and and also because uh it is expensive . 
If you want it to be something , you know , it's ha doesn't have much functions  
want to be  you don't want to get it l make it  
Mm-hmm . 
And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table . 
I I think you m might wanna put it uh <other> 
 yeah , that it it it it stands up . 
Yeah , you have to put it on its  So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table . 
 no no ,  put stuff inside it . But , it's like like a statue or something   
Yeah yeah , but  yeah , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in  
That it's it's fashionable . 
 I  I don't  
Oh , yeah . 
Yeah , but but when you  <laugh> when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it  
<other> 
Oh , okay . 
<other> Uh , that's kind of nice . 
And then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it uh chargeable . <laugh> 
Yeah , that w yeah , but  yeah , the pro No , well I think that it might be t p Well , nee but we don't  Yeah . 
Maybe you , but <laugh> we don't know much about production cost , 
but when you  you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control , then the then the money  there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know ,  rechargeable units . 
Yeah , but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and  <laugh> So , it's not gonna be that expen 
Uh I I think it's a great idea . 
S some kind of be 
I've never seen that before , and you make it uh um be uh , you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays . 
Well , I  well it's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . That's one  . 
And uh you can always find your remote control up  
Uh , okay . 
Well , maybe yeah , you could  when that's  when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , 
but you will  you do need uh also an  
uh , also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know . 
Does it makes it kinda  
Yeah , yeah . Okay . Yeah . 
Yeah , but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
I think it's a good idea . 
And make it , you know , we we um  
Well , we uh  it's  
it isn't a t a most uh costly uh remote control . 
We can save on the on the functions . 
We just <other> put some simple button in , 
make it big and sturdy , nothing more , 
and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make , 
or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up , 
it's also nice . 
And if you put it away , I think it's uh w we have to  we uh  that's uh  
it's not a easy market . 
We have to something special . 
And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control , 
and we can't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions , 
because we aren't gonna put  
Yeah . 
And then uh when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this   and then you also you got the stand-up thing . 
Yeah . I think I think it's a good idea . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Oh , if it  let's  
well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . 
And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing . 
And the first thing we  the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . 
If that's too expensive , we won't do that . 
But it would be nice . 
It's the idea . 
I know that batteries last long nowadays . 
And and what people just think about , well , I'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty . 
And you know then when you haven't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo   I've experienced that that  
Yeah , okay . 
So , easy functions . Well , we will we will  I think we'll work that out , 
zapping , numbers on it , bi 
Yeah . But it's also annoying . 
 'cause as long as it stays  as it ke keeps working , you're not very motivated to do something about it . 
Then it beeps all the time and  . 
You don't want to have  ever have those problems , and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable  . 
And you don't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people don't like it . 
Uh , i i in the in the ma 
Yeah , but it w I mean , if if they pay for it because they think , oh , that's a great idea , I'm gonna use it . 
And when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , I'll never put him in the recharger , I think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . 
Then when they look  get m I I 
I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of  they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control , they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh , 
I think it's brilliant . 
Yeah , I've never  it's so simple , but I've never seen it . 
M maybe we should really <laugh> do this . 
 <laugh> Okay now , well , how much time have we got left ? 
These clocks aren't uh synched . 
Oh , now I've put uh  well ,  
it is twenty p 
Okay , so we have ten minutes or something ? 
Yeah , but we're uh we're done . I think . 
We've decided on the functions . 
Well , there is some  oh . 
There is a closing sheet . 
We have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work . 
Oh <other> okay , I'll make sure  I'll  
I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes , 
the the s the next minutes won't be a problem , 
but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too , 
but maybe it won't work , but you'll see . 
I think these are more important than the first ones , so  
 . 
Oh , five minutes . 
Yeah , because uh I I d I did uh  the first minutes I did were were were a bit scratchy , you know . 
Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout , which I could uh , know , use for the other ones  well , 
but uh I d think uh I forgot to do  put done under the first one , 
and when you go write a second uh it's get  it's not working <laugh> when you try to write second uh paper or something . 
And then you    
you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know . 
Becau I d uh , it was not my uh pen . 
 this kind of looks you like . 
Of the shape . 
Yeah , probably , it would be nice . 
No , bigger . 
Well , I I <other> I have to say , I have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all , 
or I think some  maybe we should  
no , that will be too costly . 
We shou we could also , 
that was a  would also be an idea , 
but I don't think it  I don't know if it exists already , 
you should like make Alessi or something design it . 
That would also be nice . 
But that's gonna  then you c then you don't 
Yeah , but then you don't have t yeah it  that's not something i that's in the production cost   a one  it's a one time , you know  s was  it's a single cost . 
Yeah , m but but then you can  
nah , I don't thin 
I think that it would be more expensive , 
because I've bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive . 
Would be a nice idea though . 
I don't know . 
I think it uh has to be a r  it has to have round forms or something . 
Like something like that or so or so 
And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it . It's also round . 
Put it in there uh  wire on it . 
Maybe uh , I don't know , some some lights , a big but well . 
 
Volume and programme , yeah . 
And some of the extra funct 
Some of the extra functions over here . Numbers . 
And and lights ? 
How we're g well , maybe uh s a ring of  
no , no , you have to   
Maybe on the side of it . 
Along the side uh strip of  yeah . 
Yeah , 
but I also meant the the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote . 
Well , theys have to be  
Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Exactly . 
When you you see it from the side , then it would look just  like that . 
And then you have a strip of uh lights or something 
Well , uh I think it's nice , for one thing . 
 maybe put something on top of it <laugh> or , you know , like that's  looks funny . 
I don't know . 
Or some bump . 
Maybe some  
Yeah ? 
We'll have to think about it . 
I think we're we're done . 
We can save this one . 
Mm mm .  
Yeah , that was what uh  
Mm , we'll hear about it .
