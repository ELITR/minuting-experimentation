<laugh> 
Okay . 
No . 
In project . 
No can that open . 
Open it there . 
Okay . 
<laugh> About the get  
<laugh> 
Okay . 
But nothing restricted for user interface ? 
With technical  
I don't know . 
'Kay . 
Okay . 
But I kind of uh  
Yes . 
Uh  
Well , the technical functions . 
Um , well I don't know if you got the same uh pictures as I got , 
but uh I got these two , 
and I think they're  we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user . 
<other> th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements , 
I don't s uh know who's doing t 
Yeah , but it  I think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control . 
Yeah , 
well y we can put functions in it when uh  yeah , when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it . 
Well , yeah 
w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and  we have to choose for novice user . 
But I don't know . 
It's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use . 
Yeah , probably , yeah . 
Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , 
uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , 
uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . 
Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . 
I think that's just basic what we need . 
And from that on we can  user requirements what we need more . 
Uh  
Yeah , I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy  the trends in the markets , 
and I don't know if there uh are any um  uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that . 
M you can just <other> you can k <laugh> 
you can keep it in mind that . 
I don't know . 
Uh , I th I thought the the  with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh  
yeah , more trendier design , I think . I think . 
Yeah ? 
Uh , well , that's all I have to say , I think .

Yeah . 
Yeah , but wha 
But  
Yeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used . 
So why should j we put this function in ? 
I think more  
I think uh people  younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions . 
Yeah , but uh you said  
Yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making . 
It's n 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
No . 
No , new requirements say no . 
So  
Yeah , but  
I i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control , they use their own th th <other> with lot more functions . 
No , no . Exactly . 
Mm , yeah . 
Yeah , 
but just  <other> 
keep it simple 
and look more at th 
No . 
It's only for television . So  
Yeah .
