Oh . 
Oh , I got a nice little screen here over here . 
<laugh> I got like this big black border uh on every side . 
<other> I'll I'll fix it . 
Yeah , whatever . 
<laugh> 
Yes . 
I don't know what the right order is . So  
Mm-hmm . 
Yes , I agree . Yeah . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
<other> I haven't really found a conclusion like that . 
Yeah . 
Design . 
Sounds interesting . 
<laugh> 
<other> Alright . 
<other> Yes . 
Yeah . It's alright . 
Um  
Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements . 
Um  yes . 
The working method um <other> 
there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab 
and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . 
Uh , I've lined them up here . 
Uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , 
about willingness to spend money on remote control , 
about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . 
I uh have found some interesting things . 
We do we do got a market . 
Um , <other> 
three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . 
So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . 
Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results . 
<other> Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . 
That's quite a lot . 
Um , 
<other> relevant options are , of course , power buttons . Although , only used once per hour . 
Uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , 
and the more um , yeah , 
other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . 
Furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . 
That doesn't say we got  we can leave ninety percent off . But it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated . 
Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . 
And um <other> an important thing here , 
the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . 
And uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . 
So , <other> what I was thinking  
oh , wrong side . 
We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . 
Group features for a higher usability , 
uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting . 
Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , 
because they are used very rarely and well , 
it uh  there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh  yeah , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there . 
<laugh> And um , if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options , group them in the button , 
not too uh  
<other> Yeah . 
Small buttons , so they won't be very um , 
how do you say  
Yes , won't be very present , 
thank you . 
And a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh  consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . 
That was kind of what I found . 
<other> Okay . 
<other> Yes . 
<laugh> 
Two ? <laugh> 
<other> No uh , I agree , I agree . 
Not too much , no . 
Yeah . 
<other> Okay . 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
I don't really agree actually , to be honest . 
It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . 
It's only like thirty percent of the total market . 
Mayb 
yeah ? 
<other> Okay . 
Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit . 
Not too much then , bu alright . 
Yes . 
<other> Yeah , I'll have a look . 
We put the fashion in electronics . 
<laugh> Sense and simplicity . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well , to be honest , if um our uh aim group is uh till forty , not older than forty , maybe that's not very uh  yeah , we don't really need to have a simple remote control . 
I think we can implement more functions then , 
because um <other> basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology 
and therefore will be a more  
Yes . <other> 
Yeah . 
<other> Well , I think  
Yes . 
Yeah , control . 
<laugh> 
 
Not much more than that . 
Yep . 
Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever . 
So t 
<other> 
<other> Yeah . 
Y yes . 
But but for for example , V_C_R_ , that's better example in this case . 
I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever , 
just play , stop , rewind and uh fast forward . 
Yeah , I know , 
but uh  
<other> Yes . 
Yeah . 
Alright . 
<other> Yes , definitely , yeah . 
Yeah , 
and maybe two or three other options , but not  nothing more than that . 
I think stop function is very useful . 
If you have a uh a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader , 
then I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up , but  
<other> Well , I use it very regularly , the action . I re I use it <laugh> quite often . 
<laugh> 
Might be . Might be . 
I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present , 
yep . 
Yep . 
<other> If you grab the remote , your hands should be on top of the plus . 
Yes . 
I think double A_ . 
Yep . 
The most ordinary uh batteries . 
Yep . 
<other> I think about twenty minutes . 
<laugh> I think that's n that's more for a for an age range or uh <laugh> ten to twelve or whatever . <laugh> 
Yeah , yeah , that's good one , yep . 
<other> Ye I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not a rare combination . <laugh> 
Yes . 
Yep . 
No , that's true . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
a swapable front or whatever . 
Yeah . <other> 
<laugh> 
Yes , definitely , definitely . 
<other> 
Yes , it  it it should be f <other> be visible nearly anywhere in the room . 
As I uh as I said during my presentation , fifty percent uh o 
Yeah . 
A face ? 
Or uh yeah , yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah , I see what you mean , yep . 
If you do that , but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros . 
<laugh> I in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . 
That's probably stupid , 
but uh as I found here uh , fifty percent , 
was it fifty ? 
Uh fifty percent 
fifty percent often loses remote control . 
No uh , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in . 
If an  a button in in that uh  
<other> Yeah , you can ma make rechargeable one , yeah . Why not . 
It should only cost twelve and a half Euros , of course . Aye ? 
<laugh> Yeah , okay . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yes . Yes , definitely . Yeah . 
Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course . 
I don't know . 
On the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make a nice bay . 
I mean , it looks trendy and still <laugh> still put a bleep function in it , 
but um I think the bay is definitely uh  
Sure , why not . Yep . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Definitely . 
With eye candy , ear candy , whatever . Yeah , definitely . 
Yeah . 
Definitely , yeah . 
<other> It would be nice , yes . 
Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so <laugh> yes . 
Yeah , why not . 
Hmm . 
No , that's true . 
Why not . 
Bleep bleep bleep , oh there it is , yeah . Yeah . 
No . Nearly . 
<laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
<other> 
Something like that , yeah . 
Oh . 
<other> We'll see . 
Maarten , five minutes . 
No , that's true uh , yeah . 
Should we by the way draw um 
on our nice whiteboard , um a little uh idea of  
yeah . 
I dunno . 
Has anyone got um <other> a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ? 
I don't , for one . 
A bit bigger I guess , but  <laugh> 
The shape is nice , 
it's um something different , and we want we want that . 
Yeah . 
<other> Okay , yeah . 
Yeah , but <other> twelve and a half Euros ? Uh  <laugh> 
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah , that's true . 
Something like that is very ergonomic . 
So  
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yes , volume and programme should be there I guess , because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part . 
Yeah , 
and the numbers on top , I guess . 
Maybe ro roun rounds 
uh uh l sorry . 
Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons .   
Oh . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay , yeah . 
<laugh> 
I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then . 
Yeah . 
<other> Yes , we are . 
<other> Alright . 
Yes , I guess it's lunch time . 
<other> I don't know . 
Half and hour ? 
I thought our next uh next individual round was half an hour . 
I don't know about the lunch break . 
Well
