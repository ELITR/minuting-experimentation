A:  Okay . 
B:  Hmm . E excuse me I forgot my 
C:  Alright , okay , yeah . 
B:  copy .  
A:  <cough> 
C:  He's gonna get his pen . 
D:  Oh right . Okay . 
C:  Um <other> Will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news ? 
A:  Yeah , there's good news ? Oh . 
C:  Uh <laugh> <cough> we have budget problems . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  Oh . 
C:  I'm afraid you're all sacked . Oops . I don't even have this on . <other> 
A:  Cutbacks . <laugh> Hmm . 
C:  <laugh> <other> Okay , have you got a presentation to make ? No . Okay so it's just your your show . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  No , not mine yet . 
A:  Oh . 


A:  Um maybe we should bring  so that the camera can see  . Yeah . 
C:  <other> 
D:  Okay . Sure . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay . 
D:  We made three for you . 
C:  Three ? Oh . 
D:  Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st 
C:  Tomato ? What tomato ? <laugh> I don't recall a tomato . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Look . Oh yeah , well yeah , we had v some red left over . So . Okay , so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . The yellow there is the um the slogan , yeah , that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , um but mainly it's speech recognition . 
C:  Ah I see , okay . <cough> Mm-hmm . Logo . Okay , brilliant . Okay . Okay , so the buttons would be like , you know individual users , or  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah and <other> yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . Mm I'm not sure about that . Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier . <other> Yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want . 
C:  Alright , okay . Right . That's groovy . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:   
C:  <cough> Well I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it . 
B:  Uh can I have  
D:  Yeah , sure . Um that one is  Oh no , it's delicate . 
B:  Oh sorry s <other> 
C:  At Oh dear . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> 
D:  That's that's already got its stand that one . That's it stand . It does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . Um the black on the back is the slogan . 
C:  Alright , okay . Okay , brilliant mm . Okay , nice and obvious there <laugh> , if it's standing up , I guess , yeah . 
D:  Uh yeah , that   Well , we did think of that . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , if it's standing up it's it's on there , but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing . These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . We n were weren't sure about putting them there , because um i it's it kind of could get bashed . 
C:  Oh right , okay , brilliant . Like that from its centre . Where you're , yeah , uh were you're holding it kind of  
D:  Yeah . Well , if you hold it , you can  you all can hold it , is  it does actually feel quite ergonomic , if you've got small hands . <laugh> Um , obviously I don't think that's real sized  . It would have to be a bit bigger . Okay . Um that's a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . <laugh> Okay . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah , okay . Yeah , scale model , yeah . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Um and <other> um then the buttons . Yeah kind of self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . Tried to keep it simple . Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom . <laugh> We used those  . And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . It's not in the traditional place , but um it's quite an obvious place . 
C:  <laugh> Alright , excellent . Okay . No . It's out of the way as well , I suppose , so . Excellent . 
D:  So <other> there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too . 
A:  Oh yeah , yeah . 
C:  Yep . <laugh> 
A:  This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Okay , <other> so so Barney the banana  . 
A:  A a more friendly type of  Right , right . It's to uh induce more television watching I suppose or  
C:  Ah excellent , just what we need . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Say it for the camera . 
C:  <laugh> Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana . <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Right , right . 
C:  Cool  yeah . Well , nice to have uh options at least . 'Kay and  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yep . <laugh> 
D:  <other> So are there any um improvements or issues or  <laugh> 
A:  It won't stand . 
C:  Oh there are issues , oh there are issues . 
A:  <other> Just let it lie down , it wont stand . <other> 
D:  <laugh> 


C:  Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance . 
A:  <cough> 
D:  Oh . 
C:  Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria . Um <other> unfortunately 
A:  <other> 
C:  the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Oh . 
C:  So we have to rea Sorry , I've accidentally highlighted somehow  Um . <other> There we go . 
A:  What's on the uh on the left ?  Okay . 
C:  Oh god , why is it doing that ? 
D:  Ooh . 
C:  There we go . <other> So basically , um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . 
D:  Mm-hmm . More like a traditional remote control . 
C:  Um . Yeah , I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape , so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out . And by doing so  Oh no , hold on . Doesn't save us quite as much . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
C:  I don't know what's going on with this again . 
A:  W why is the uh double curved two of them ? 
C:  Oh , good point . 
B:  And double curve on both sides ? 
C:  Um . 
B:  Curve <other> . Yeah , this is double-curve , no ? This is double-curve . It  This one is single curve . 
C:  That's <other> sort of curve in and out . 
A:  Is i Mm . 
B:  'Cause this is single curve , this is curved on both sides . So double-curve . 
C:  No , I think it means double curved as in um like uh  a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . Okay , I might be wrong though . 
D:  Like an S_ shape . Okay . 
B:  Like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side . Hmm . Hmm . 
C:  I don't think that counts as a curve , I think that's just a shape . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  <other> 
C:  A curvature is like the  this case . 
B:  Maybe . 
A:  <other> 'Cause that's the uh the biggest expense there , right .  got two of them  
D:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah , and why why I've got it two , I don't know , I can't seem to select any more however . 
A:  Okay . Well we can work around that um  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Right . No . 
A:  <other> Cut things out . But you think it should be one . 
C:  It's meant to be one , yeah , I don't know why I put two in there , but um  Hold on till I find it , I think this shift button might be stuck again . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  No maybe the shift button's stuck in . <laugh> Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us  
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . Should  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Oh that's fine . 
A:  Yeah , so we're  <other> 
C:  Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty . 
D:  Cool . Cool . 
C:  Um <other> 
D:  So we could even add something . 
C:  We cou Oh not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately . What ? 
A:  We should fire the accountants . Fire the accountants . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Ah yeah , we could add things . 
C:  <other> 
A:  Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys . Does that work ? No mm <other> . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , I know , that just extends it as well . I don't know . 
B:  Uh you can do one thing  . You just select one box outsi yeah , this box . Then move it with the help of this  Okay . <other> Just uh just uh  Okay , just a minute . 
C:  It  One of the buttons is sticking , I don't know  . 
B:  Okay . No input , like this . <other> Shift . No it's not . Yeah , it's not working . Should we ask Meli Should we ask our technical expert Melissa ? 
C:  No , it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck , or something . 
A:  Is it the other shift button maybe ? 
C:  <other> <laugh> No that's fine . Um we've worked out what it would be anyway . 
A:  <other> Did you try both shift buttons ? It could be the other side . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> 
C:  Cancel . Piss off . 
A:  That's too bad . 
C:  Oh well , never mind . Um <cough> . Right , so that's finances and I dunno what we  what could we reckon we could add ? Um 
D:  Well maybe we could add something , but maybe if  What do you th We're trying to save money , so . Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . But if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it . Maybe  I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front , because it's not in an ideal place right now . 
C:  Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . So  Yeah . Yeah yeah . Well that's that's uh  Okay , so project evaluation . We have under twelve <other> Euros fifty . 


C:  Project process , how do we think that went ? Are we happy ? 
A:  Oh . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  Yeah I think we have a a winning product . 
C:  <laugh> <other> Okay . <other> Evaluation . Oh we've been writing this up for m months . 
D:  I think it went quite smoothly . 
C:  Uh room for creativity , were we happy with that ? 
D:  W I think we were very creative . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  No , I mea I think it means sort of individually . 
D:  Oh right , okay . 
C:  Yes , no , maybe ? Okay . Groovy . So uh we're just gonna . Uh yeah , okay . Teamwork ? Leadership , sorry .

D:  Yeah , everyone got enough input , I think . 
C:  Uh and well means , yeah . The technical stuff was brilliant . <laugh> Let's buy more . <other> Uh Right . Um I don't know what , new ideas found , means , to be honest . 
A:  <other> <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , we   <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> These pens are are neat though . 
B:  <other> Yeah , these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that . We discussed all the new ideas , but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals , we couldn't use these  , but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this . These are new ideas we And new shapes , everything . At le <other> Yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm 'kay . Groovy . So just general thumbs up for all of us then . That kind of unfortunately is too quick . <laugh> Uh <other> . I suppose yeah . Um .

B:  Uh <laugh> is the project evaluated , that is mine . 
C:  <other> Doesn't tell me . <cough> Oh you're doing that . <other> 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  We evaluated ourselves , we thought we were great . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <cough> 
A:  Uh . 
D:  Mm , love to eat that now . Kind of a green banana now .

A:  It's fun to touch . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <other> So . Yeah . 
C:  Okay , I didn't realise you had that bit . <other> 
B:  <laugh> So . 
D:  Oh could you pass the tomato please . Sorry . Thank you . 


C:  <laugh> 
B:  So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . How we are going to  <other> means uh at what standard what standard  whether it meets our standards or not . How mu What rating we will give to these products . So of course this is  will be a team work , w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . Then trends , whether it is as  fashion trends or not ? Means <cough> because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . Then marketing strategy of the company . As we have already discussed that our company is quite  in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s 
D:  Mm-hmm . Sorry  . Sorry , carry on . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . So <laugh> but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . So  Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . I'm having this scale this scale , so we have to do it on a board . 
C:  Okay . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:   
D:  Okay . 
C:  Alright , okay . The board working again , is it ? 
B:   the user requirem I think . 
A:  <other> 
C:  <other> 
A:  Do we have the uh the marker for the board ? 
B:   
C:  <other> Uh . 
D:  Um . 
B:  <other> Thank you . 
A:  There it is . 
C:  <laugh>  
B:  So . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . First of all uh comes user requirement . So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . I I will  first I would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ? 
D:  Mm-hmm . Um <other> I think  Yeah , it did . It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . Um so . Does it work ? Yeah . So . 
B:  S 
C:  Yeah . When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_ , so yeah , of course we haven't actually got a working model yet . 
B:  <other> So what do you think you will personally give . Seven . Uh . 
D:  I would say seven . <other> Seven is good , yeah , isn't it ? I can't  True or false ? No sorry tr one is true . 
C:  One , yeah . 
B:  <other> Uh one is  means highest ranking , okay . But I think highest ranking is seven , or one ? 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  No it's it's like true is one end , and false is the oth 
A:  No that's false . 
B:  Okay , right right . So it's one for from your point of view . And what do you say our Industrial Expert ? 
D:  Okay , so one . Yep . 
A:  <other> Uh . It's hard to know . I I give it a two . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh d you can you can tell on on the like  I think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i Interface Expert . But you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ? 
A:  Okay . Um yeah , I think i it might even exceed it um . But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Um  I'm gonna give it a two . Two . 
B:  Two . And what about uh you , Brian ? You will go for one . <other> Okay . Uh for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , and  Uh yeah , lower end . And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look . But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . No , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only . So we are showing our preference for particular fruits , two or three kinds rather , and  Yeah . <laugh> So . 
C:  Oh , I'll go for a one . <other> Basic requirements but of the pro of the project . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah th <other> <laugh> 
D:  Mm <other> yellow . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh-huh . 
C:  Come on that was the tha <laugh> <other> <other> 'Kay . 
D:  Uh-huh . Okay . 
C:  <laugh> Being fruitist . <other> <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Is that no is that not trends ? 
B:  Uh no , uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that , because whatever companies  they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . Some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . So you can   what shape a person will like . So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . And by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also . 
C:  <other> <other> 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm-hmm . Uh-huh . But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um  you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates . I think , you know , if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have  That you're going to choose from , a company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs . We were coming up with one product . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh maybe . Okay but I will I will personally  won't give it  beyond three . So we can  
D:  No , I mean uh <other> obviously your opinion , I'm just trying to  
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> 
D:  Okay . 
C:  <other> He's a tough cookie . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe . Three or four ? Uh , no sorry , it should be  
C:  <other> 
A:  <other> 
C:  Six . Five or six . 
D:  What are we doing ? 
B:  No sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , we are doing a very wrong thing . Yeah , yeah , we are taking everything , and that's  I have taken it very wrongly . Yeah uh three four four two six seven seven sev Yeah one pe exactly . So we can say one or two .  because it is one point eight uh  two , so we will do two . Yeah . So where were the trends . 
A:  What are we doing ? 
D:  Adding them up ? 
A:  We're gonna average them ? Okay . So seven fourths . About one point f one point eight . 
D:  Oh . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  <cough> 
C:  Oh I see . 
A:  Yeah round it up to two . So trends . 
D:  Okay , yeah . 
A:  Can you explain what you want us to write there ? 
B:  Sorry ? 
A:  How it  how conforms to the current trends ? 
B:  Yeah , again the the fashion trends , this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the <other> uh as a fruit shape or something . Uh . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  <other> 
D:  Okay . Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um , well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , so I would actually give it a three . Tha three or four , I'm not sure . Three . Go for three . That's fine . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> Okay . Yeah . Uh  
A:  'Kay . As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . So I give it a a four . I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for 
D:  Mm . 
A:  for technology . 
C:  Yeah , I am sort of pret uh  <other> Just the fruit does me in , I mean uh it might 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit , so um <other>  Uh also uh I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it . Um so yeah I'd say about four as well . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Okay . Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now  our fashion trend shows that people like everything  all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them  or showing some association with them . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  So and in this way our product is good . And the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy . So that is also ef that also  Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . And yes . It is cus spongy also . So they can play with it , it's quite good . So then I think , maybe I can give it two . So four five ten thirteen thirteen  . So we can  Is it fine ? So what about company strategy ? 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  <other> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:   
A:  Well it was yellow . <other> 
D:  Um . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , the company strategy , okay . Um <other> there was lot of discussing , that was good . Um I feel I got my say . Um so I'd give the company strategy a <other> two . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  Well , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy . Is that the question ? 
D:  Okay . Is it ? Okay . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  <other> Um . 
D:  Okay , so <other> one or two . One . Okay , just leave it , it's fine . 
A:  Yeah . I'll go with two . 
B:  So what about you , Brian ? 
C:  Um yeah , a three . Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a  a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by  
D:  Mm . 
B:  Yeah , and me also , like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . So since our product meets all these requirements , so I would also prefer to give it rank one . So four six six 
A:  <other> So one and a half . 
D:  Yeah , one . 
B:  half . So we can say two or one   Okay . So th seven seven . 
A:  A two .  
B:  Uh overall we are getting two  something , but we can round it as two . 
A:  Yep . 
D:  Okay . 
C:  Cool , groovy . <other> 
B:  Yeah . So I think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good . So we can launch it . Yeah . 
A:  S 
C:  Cool . Brilliant . <other> 
D:  Woo-hoo .
