Okay . 
Mm . Very fun . 
Oh right . Okay . 
Mm . 
Okay . Sure . 
We made three for you . 
Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato 
and the other one is st 
Look . 
Oh yeah , well yeah , we had v some red left over . 
So . Okay , 
so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , 
or as mm few buttons as possible , 
mainly speak recognition . 
The yellow there is the um 
the slogan , yeah , 
that we need to incorporate , 
it's very simple . 
If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , 
um but mainly it's speech recognition . 
Yeah . 
Yeah and <other> 
yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . 
Mm I'm not sure about that . 
Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier . 
<other> Yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want . 
Yeah , sure . 
Um that one is  
Oh no , it's delicate . 
That's that's already got its stand that one . 
That's it stand . 
It does also lie flat , 
but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . 
Um the black on the back is the slogan . 
Uh yeah , that   
Well , we did think of that . 
Yeah , if it's standing up it's it's on there , 
but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . 
So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing . 
These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . 
We n were weren't sure about putting them there , because um i it's it kind of could get bashed . 
Yeah . 
Well , if you hold it , 
you can  you all can hold it , 
is  
it does actually feel quite ergonomic , 
if you've got small hands . 
<laugh> Um , obviously I don't think that's real sized  . 
It would have to be a bit bigger . 
Okay . 
Um that's a speaker at the top , 
so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition . 
Um and <other> 
um then the buttons . 
Yeah kind of self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . 
Tried to keep it simple . 
Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom . 
<laugh> We used those  . 
And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . 
It's not in the traditional place , 
but um it's quite an obvious place . 
So <other> there we go 
and and um we have the banana-based one too . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
<other> So are there any um improvements or issues or  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh . 
Oh . 
Ooh . 
Mm-hmm . 
More like a traditional remote control . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Like an S_ shape . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Cool . 
Cool . 
So we could even add something . 
<laugh> 
Well maybe we could add something , 
but maybe if  
What do you th 
We're trying to save money , so . 
Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . 
But if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it . 
Maybe  
I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front , 
because it's not in an ideal place right now . 
Mm . 
I think it went quite smoothly . 
W I think we were very creative . 
Oh right , okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Excellent leadership . <laugh> 
Yeah , everyone got enough input , I think . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Well um . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<other> Yeah , maybe . 
 
Oh , you got a presentation , 
sorry . 
Yeah . 
Mm , love to eat that now . 
Kind of a green banana now . 
It's  
this as well , 
sorry , 
we forgot to mention 
it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we've got . 
<laugh> I've got . 
 
Yeah . 
Oh could you pass the tomato please . 
Sorry . Thank you . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Sorry  . 
Sorry , 
carry on . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Um . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Um <other> 
I think  
Yeah , it did . 
It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . 
Um so . 
Does it work ? 
Yeah . So . 
I would say seven . 
<other> Seven is good , yeah , isn't it ? 
I can't  
True or false ? 
No sorry tr one is true . 
Yeah . 
Okay , so one . 
Yep . 
Mm <other> 
yellow . 
Uh-huh . 
Uh-huh . 
Okay . 
Is that no is that not trends ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Uh-huh . 
But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um  you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates . 
I think , you know , if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have  That you're going to choose from , a company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs . 
We were coming up with one product . 
No , I mean uh <other> obviously your opinion , 
I'm just trying to  
Okay . 
What are we doing ? 
Adding them up ? 
Oh . 
Okay . 
Okay , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um , 
well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , 
so I would actually give it a three . 
Tha three or four , I'm not sure . 
Three . Go for three . 
That's fine . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Um . 
Yeah , the company strategy , okay . 
Um <other> there was lot of discussing , that was good . 
Um I feel I got my say . 
Um so I'd give the company strategy a <other> two . 
Okay . 
Is it ? Okay . 
Okay , so 
<other> 
one or two . 
One . 
Okay , just leave it , it's fine . 
Mm . 
Yeah , one . 
Okay .
