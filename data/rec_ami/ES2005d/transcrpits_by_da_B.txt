<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<other> Yeah , these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that . 
We discussed all the new ideas , 
but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals , we couldn't use these  , 
but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this . 
These are new ideas we And new shapes , everything 
. At le <other> 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
So  
So <other>  
Uh Brian , have you have you finished ? 
Uh mine needs also this . 
At last mine is also the presentation . 
<other> Yeah , yeah . 
S 
<laugh> 
Uh <laugh> is the project evaluated , that is mine . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<other> So . Yeah . 
<laugh> So . 
So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . 
How we are going to  <other> 
means uh at what standard what standard  
whether it meets our standards or not . 
How mu 
What rating we will give to these products . 
So of course this is  will be a team work , 
w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . 
So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this . 
We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . 
Then trends , whether it is as  fashion trends or not ? 
Means <cough> because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . 
So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . 
Then marketing strategy of the company . 
As we have already discussed that our company is quite  in the market , 
not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s 
Yeah . 
So <laugh> 
but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , 
uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . 
So  
Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . 
I'm having this scale this scale , 
so we have to do it on a board . 
 the user requirem I think . 
 
<other> Thank you . 
So . 
<other> So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . 
First of all uh comes user requirement . 
So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . 
I I will  
first I would like to have your views , 
what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ? 
S 
<other> So what do you think you will personally give . 
Seven . Uh . 
<other> 
Uh one is  means highest ranking , 
okay . 
But I think highest ranking is seven , 
or one ? 
Okay , right right . 
So it's one for from your point of view . 
And what do you say our Industrial Expert ? 
Uh d you can you can tell on on the like  
I think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i Interface Expert . 
But you can give your views based on technology , 
whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ? 
Two . 
And what about uh you , Brian ? 
You will go for one . 
<other> Okay . 
Uh for me personally it is everything fine , 
it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , 
but there is one thing which limits the customers , 
like we are having only two , three designs , 
like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , 
and 
 Uh yeah , lower end . 
And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look . 
But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . 
No , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only . 
So we are showing our preference for particular fruits , 
two or three kinds rather , 
and 
 Yeah . 
<laugh> So . 
Uh no , uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that , 
because whatever companies  they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , 
like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . 
Some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . 
So you can   what shape a person will like . 
So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . 
And by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also . 
Uh maybe . Okay 
but I will I will personally  won't give it  beyond three . 
So we can  
Yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe . 
Three or four ? 
Uh , no sorry , 
it should be  
No 
sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , 
we are doing a very wrong thing . 
Yeah , yeah , we are taking everything , 
and that's  
I have taken it very wrongly . 
Yeah uh 
three four four two six seven seven sev 
Yeah one pe exactly . 
So we can say one or two . 
 because it is one point eight uh  two , so we will do two . 
Yeah . 
So where were the trends . 
Sorry ? 
Yeah , again the the fashion trends , 
this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the <other> uh as a fruit shape or something . 
Uh . 
<other> 
Okay . Yeah . 
Uh  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , 
like , these products are in fruit shape , 
because that wha people now  
our fashion trend shows that people like everything  all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them  or showing some association with them . 
So and in this way our product is good . 
And the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy . 
So that is also ef that also  
Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . 
And yes . 
It is cus spongy also . 
So they can play with it , it's quite good . 
So then I think , maybe I can give it two . 
So four five ten thirteen thirteen  . 
So we can  
Is it fine ? 
So what about company strategy ? 
 
Okay . 
So what about you , Brian ? 
Yeah , and me also , 
like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy 
like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . 
So since our product meets all these requirements , so I would also prefer to give it rank one . 
So four six six 
half . 
So we can say two or one   
Okay . 
So th seven seven . 
Uh overall we are getting two  something , 
but we can round it as two . 
Yeah . So I think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good . 
So we can launch it . Yeah . 
So 
yeah . <laugh> Great . <laugh>
