<laugh> Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana . <other> 
Cool  yeah . 
Well , nice to have uh options at least . 
'Kay and  
Oh there are issues , oh there are issues . 
Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance . 
Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria . 
Um <other> unfortunately 
the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros . 
So we have to 
rea Sorry , 
I've accidentally highlighted somehow  
Um . 
<other> There we go . 
Oh god , 
why is it doing that ? 
There we go . 
<other> So basically , um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . 
Um . 
Yeah , 
I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape , 
so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out . 
And by doing so  
Oh no , hold on . 
Doesn't save us quite as much . 
I don't know what's going on with this again . 
Oh , good point . 
Um . 
That's <other> sort of curve in and out . 
No , 
I think it means double curved as in um 
like uh  a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . 
Okay , I might be wrong though . 
I don't think that counts as a curve , I think that's just a shape . 
A curvature is like the  this case . 
Yeah , 
and why why I've got it two , I don't know , 
I can't seem to select any more however . 
<laugh> 
Right . No . 
It's meant to be one , yeah , 
I don't know why I put two in there , 
but um  
Hold on till I find it , 
I think this shift button might be stuck again . 
No maybe the shift button's stuck in . 
<laugh> Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us  
Oh that's fine . 
Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty . 
Um <other> 
We cou Oh not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately . 
What ? 
<laugh> <other> 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , I know , that just extends it as well . 
I don't know . 
It  One of the buttons is sticking , I don't know  . 
No , it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck , or something . 
<other> 
<laugh> No that's fine . 
Um we've worked out what it would be anyway . 
Yeah . 
Cancel . Piss off . 
Oh well , never mind . 
Um <cough> . 
Right , so that's finances 
and I dunno what we  
what could we reckon we could add ? 
Um 
Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . So  
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah .
