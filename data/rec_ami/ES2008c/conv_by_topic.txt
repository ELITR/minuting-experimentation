A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm yeah . 
A:  Okay . <other> I g yeah . Time is it ? 
D:  <other> Fourteen twenty six . 
A:  Okay . Lovely to see you all again . Um <other> it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . Um okay <other> our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations um and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  So opening . Um these are our minutes from r the functional design . We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different um functions of it . Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . <other> And s um in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece <other> and a long-life battery or a charging station . Okay , now three presentations . I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials <other> um and then the conceptual specification of user interface <other> and finally trend watching . 
B:  That would be me . 
C:  Yep . 


B:  Alright . Well . 
A:  Mm . 'kay . Function F_ eight it . There we go . 
B:  Alright . Um I'm very excited by this one actually guys I uh had a lot of fun doing it . Components design . This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of . <other> Um . 
B:  Um I'd appreciate anyone's input , but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing . <other> 
D:  Is double-curved like  would be like two hands kind of thing ? 
B:  I'm not sure . I haven't received any specific 
D:  <other> Okay . 'Cause I'm imagining like double-curved is like , you know , like two sides that curve and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical-ish kind of looking thing , but I've no idea . 
B:  visuals of this yet . This is what I'm sort of  <other> Yeah . I'm not sure , but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures . 
D:  Sounds good . 
A:  Yeah , I wonder  
B:  I know if we do have a double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it . But the titanium , they were quite  they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme , so that could be quite interesting . Space-age remote . 
C:  <other> <laugh> 
A:  Mm-hmm . <other> Just an interesting marketing kind of element . 
B:  Just all things to keep in mind . Yeah . <other> That's about all I have to do , guys . I hope I didn't go through that too quickly . 
A:  Uh just a real quick question um the weight of these different elements , have you  no idea , okay . 
B:  Yeah , n no idea , no idea . Um I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , and that a tita titanium is very light , I know , um but other than  that's really basic , I mean , that's all I have gotten so far . <other> Alright ? 
A:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .  Okay . 
B:  Any other questions ? 
C:  Uh-huh . Don't think so . 
B:  No ? Okay . 
A:  Mm 'kay . 
B:  I have save this in the uh shared projects , if anyone wants to look and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well , if anyone needs any more information . Uh  
A:  Thank you , perfect . 
D:  Thanks . 
A:  Um if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um  underneath our  oh , uh in your book , then don't worry about that . 
B:  Just in my notebook , but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me or something . Alright ? Uh I guess I can  


A:  'Kay now we're um concepts concepts of user interface . <other> 
D:  <cough> 
A:  Yeah , um . This one's so much tighter than the other one . 
B:  <laugh> I know . 
A:  Okay . Nope . There we go . Here you are . 
C:  Jess . 
B:  G oh , geez . 
C:  Alright , so I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device . Um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface . We want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable . Um other  we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose . Uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include  that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people . We have a number of different choices for a design concept um and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of um , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work , how how  what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features . And of course we also have to make it look cool . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  So basically , that's what we don't want . <laugh> M we don't want lots of buttons , uh complicated features . We want something that looks nice and simple . 
D:  <other> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm . 


A:  Okay , now we're moving on to market . Marketing . 
D:  <other> Should I plug that in ? 
A:  <other> 
D:  <other> 
C:  Is that going on ? Okay . 
D:  Maybe it's just not  Is it on ? 
C:  Uh that should be alright , actually . 
D:  Ri What F_ do you have to press , five ? 
A:  Eight . 
D:  I just keep pressing lots of 'em . Well , I don't know how relevant all of this gonna be . <laugh> If anything , the  that they gave me . Alright . 
B:  No signal . 
A:  Oops , it's not plugged in , quite in well enough . There we are . 
B:  Oop , there we go . 
A:  Mm 'kay . 
D:  Oh yeah . 


B:  <laugh> Mm . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  That  there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though . 
D:  Yeah . <other> I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them , that pretty much sums it up . So yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay , do we have any  s some questions for this , let's see um . 
D:  Yeah , what can I possibly enlighten on ? 


A:  Okay um we have we've about fifteen minutes left , so I'm I'm gonna 
B:  Oh we probably have to get going , don't we ? 
D:  Uh-huh . 
A:  continue with my pres presentation . Um I've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this  these kinds of things , so I'll just bring that up and show you all 
B:  <other> 'Kay . 
A:  before we move on . <other> Um  


D:  If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables , I'll let you know . 
B:  Could  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 


A:  Okay , um <other> components concept . Energy , chip on print . 
D:  <cough> 
B:  Uh-hu oh , oh yes . Right , I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get  
A:  G 
B:  be necessary but um  
A:  That's th th this is the agenda they gave me . So can you just explain what that is real quick ? 




A:  Mm-hmm . Okay , um finishing the meeting now . Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach . 
B:  <laugh> Ooh . <laugh> 
C:  Cool . <laugh> 
D:  Wow . 
A:  Um did we decide on a chip ? Let's go with a simple chip ? Okay . 
B:  Simple chip . 
C:  Yep . 
A:  We are done . Thank you everyone . 


A:  Oh I di these are already in our shared folder , so . 
B:  Okay , cool . 
C:  <laugh> Clay . I wasn't expecting that . <laugh> 
B:  Clay . <laugh>
