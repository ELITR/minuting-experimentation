Mm yeah . 
Okay . 
That would be me . 
Alright . 
Well . 
Alright . 
Um I'm very excited by this one actually guys 
I uh had a lot of fun doing it . 
Components design . 
This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control 
and what should we make our specific remote control out of . 
<other> Um . So , 
we need to examine each element separately , 
but we're designing a full thing , 
so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . 
The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . 
These are all things that we had sort of addressed before , 
but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here 
as we figure out what they should be made of 
and what they should look like . 
The case , 
uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , 
um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . 
I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , 
just keep that in mind , 
but these are the options that we have from manufacturing 
and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , 
but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic . 
That would be our case . 
Um buttons , 
for buttons we have um pushbuttons , 
which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , 
but we also have scror scroll wheels , 
which can have integrated pushbuttons , 
or we could go all high-tech 
and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen . 
<other> Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , 
depending on what our other needs are . 
And then battery I think is where things get most exciting . 
We're talking about long-life batteries here . <other> 
Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , 
but we also have these options of um <other> using a kinetic battery , 
like are used in high-tech watches , 
where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up . 
Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . 
Or a solar battery , 
although there are slight um <other> complications with solar batteries 
as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery . 
Or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . 
Not quite sure what that is , 
but that's the description that I received , 
so that's what I'm passing on to you . <other> 
So those are our options . 
Um personal preferences that I was thinking through  
here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . 
So if we're going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . 
Maybe titanium , 
maybe some wood . 
We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials , 
but that's sort of what I have in mind . 
And we wanna go for simplicity . 
Probably pushbuttons , 
but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything 
any ideas on that ? 
I mean I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons 
which are exactly like what they're describing , 
so that might be something we wanna look into . 
And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . 
<other> Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , 
because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light . 
But this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , 
and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , 
I think that that m would be a very interesting thing . 
But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip 
to keep our costs down . 
Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ . 
So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t 
technological if they don't need to be , 
'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down . 
That's what I have for options . 
Um I'd appreciate anyone's input , 
but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing . <other> 
I'm not sure . 
I haven't received any specific 
visuals of this yet . 
This is what I'm sort of  
<other> Yeah . 
I'm not sure , 
but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures . 
I know if we do have a double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it . 
But the titanium , they were quite  they're marketing quite hard to us 
as being used in the space programme , 
so that could be quite interesting . 
Space-age remote . 
Just all things to keep in mind . 
Yeah . 
<other> That's about all I have to do , guys . 
I hope I didn't go through that too quickly . 
Yeah , 
n 
no idea , no idea . 
Um I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , 
and that a tita titanium is very light , I know , 
um but other than  
that's really basic , 
I mean , that's all I have gotten so far . <other> 
Alright ? 
Any other questions ? 
No ? 
Okay . 
I have save this in the uh shared projects , if anyone wants to look 
and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well , if anyone needs any more information . Uh  
Just in my notebook , 
but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me or something . 
Alright ? Uh 
I guess I can  
<laugh> I know . 
G oh , geez . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ? 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Right 
Right . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
'Kay . 
Well  
Are you are you tak 
Yeah . 
No , 
I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on . 
Oh , 
good point . 
Yeah . 
No signal . 
Oop , 
there we go . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
That  
there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though . 
<laugh> 
If it's latex  if it's latexy  
Um , mean  
An uh I  if  th <other> 
my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , 
but that it's covered with the latex , 
which is spongier and softer on your hands . 
It's  
there's something to be said , I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to  R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things 
and and  
Yeah , 
something grippable , 
I mean we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy , maybe . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's  that seems doable . 
<other> could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? 
We could colour-co-ordinate them , 
li 
The buttons could be fruit-shaped . 
<laugh> Oh well 
it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot 
isn't it ? 
Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . 
 be  <laugh> 
yeah . 
<laugh> It'd be harder to f bu uh buttons I think . 
It'd be harder to press button . 
Um  
I  
Yeah , that's ts how I tend to do it . 
No 
just thumb-sized . 
Jus 
Yeah . 
That's true . 
Right . 
I 
When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod , that's how I do it , hold it and press the four . Yeah . 
Yeah , 
or in 
and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel . 
Yeah 
It  
wel well <other> 
yeah , 
it would  
I mean each version of it has been a little bit different , 
but  
Oh yeah , 
you had one of the in-between ones , 
when they weren't doing that anymore . 
Ts 
and you press the centre button , 
that's that's your all-purpose select button right there . 
Since it's the one in the centre that's not marked , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh uh 
t 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I think an <other> L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice . 
Yeah . 
Right . 
Um  
Oh 
we probably have to get going , 
don't we ? 
<other> 'Kay . 
Could  Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours , 
yeah . 
<laugh> 
Exactly . 
And you could co-ordinate with your house <laugh> or whatever . 
All these options . 
Ooh . 
Oh . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Mm . Options . 
<laugh> 
Uh-hu oh , oh yes . 
Right , 
I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get  
be necessary 
but um  
Alright , 
so um 
decisions , what the 
 okay 
deci decisions on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery . 
Um I dunno , 
what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? 
Am I  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Right , 
I haven't gotten any  
yeah , 
any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery , 
but um but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip , then it'll even out , I think . 
Um circuit boards . 
Um yeah , 
I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . 
They're <other> they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , 
and di I think they're quite easily printed on by machine , 
which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . 
I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . 
I wasn't really given any options , 
I was just given that this is how they're done . 
Um yeah , 
I can't can't really tell you . 
I can I can tell you a whole lot about how it works . 
But I don't know any decisions on  
Yeah . 
I'm sorry , 
I did f 
Yeah . 
Right . 
Well okay , 
here's the here's the thing on the chips that I that I got . 
Um simple , regular , advanced chip on print . 
The chip on print includes an infrared sensor , 
so we don't have to worry about that . 
Um , <other> 'kay , 
the pushbutton  
if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , 
but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , 
and an L_C_D_ requires advanced . 
Do we want a scroll wheel , 
or do we just want pushbuttons ? 
Oh . <other> 
Yeah , 
th it'd be 
it'd be handy for going through 
if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
F 
or for all those secret functions ? 
When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . 
Right . 
So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending  
and maybe we could table that decision for later . 
I don't know . 
Okay . 
Well , 
let's think about that while we talk about the case . 
Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . 
Okay . 
Uh yeah , 
everything I've <other>  
N oh wha what I've 
what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that <other> there's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . 
Not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that . 
The inside is hard . 
I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , 
I think that that's done for us . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Oh 
and we want a curved case , 
yeah ? 
Or a double-curved ? 
Yeah , okay . 
We don't really know what the difference  
Good point . 
Yeah . 
I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information 
but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton , 
but it's gotta be some more expensive , 
so 
I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case 
because  
Yeah . 
Oh . 
Alright . 
So 
what are what are our buttons gonna be ? 
On off  
So like one through five , or  
No . 
Mm . 
Yeah , up down . 
<laugh> 
Ooh . <laugh> 
Simple chip . 
Okay , cool . 
Clay . <laugh>
