Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
<other> I g 
yeah . 
Time is it ? 
Okay . 
Lovely to see you all again . 
Um <other> it's our conceptual design meeting 
and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five 
and so we have forty minutes for this one again 
and so we'll go just after three o'clock . 
Um okay 
<other> our agenda , 
we're gonna do an opening , 
I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , 
then we'll have your three presentations um 
and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , 
and finally we'll close . 
So 
opening . 
Um these are our minutes from r the functional design . 
We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , 
because we have international appeal 
and we said it's for all age groups , different um functions of it . 
Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . 
<other> And s um 
in 
specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece <other> and a long-life battery or a charging station . 
Okay , 
now three presentations . 
I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials <other> um and then the conceptual specification of user interface <other> and finally trend watching . 
Mm . 'kay . 
Function F_ eight it . 
There we go . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , I wonder  
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Just an interesting marketing kind of element . 
Uh just a real quick question 
um the weight of these different elements , have you  
no idea , okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
 
Okay . 
Mm 'kay . 
Thank you , perfect . 
Um if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um  underneath our  
oh , uh in your book , 
then don't worry about that . 
'Kay 
now we're um concepts concepts of user interface . 
<other> 
Yeah , um . 
This one's so much tighter than the other one . 
Okay . Nope . 
There we go . 
Here you are . 
Mm . 
<other> Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
I do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on . 
Um and so 
like favourite channels is is applicable , 
but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's  um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . 
Like 
I I know I use that often enough . 
Well 
if it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote , I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a  
Okay . 
Okay . 
'Cause that would be more specifically a digital box , 
mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Okay , 
now we're moving on to market . Marketing . 
<other> 
Eight . 
Oops , 
it's not plugged in , quite in well enough . 
There we are . 
Mm 'kay . 
<laugh> 
S 
sweet . 
<laugh> 
Okay , 
do we have any  s some questions for this , 
let's see um . 
Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ? 
Like 
could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? 
It would be easier on the hands . 
It's kind of  and then it  
we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that , 
I dunno . 
But  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
F for sure , 
or maybe like 
um couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something . 
Could they be smelly ? 
I don't know . 
Or carrot shaped , 
mm . 
<other> Like large button , 
that's what I was thinking of , 
yeah . 
Might  
would you think you you  do you think you'd be able to hold it ? 
'Cause I think the reason they're long is  
yeah . 
Harder to push . 
I usually hold it in one hand . 
Maybe  
But then the buttons would have to be very small . 
Don't you think ? 
But I mean in order to get to all of them , 
you know . 
They would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
It's a scroll , yeah , it's a wheel . 
The one I have doesn't have the four on i like around it , I don't think . 
Mm . 
Okay um 
we have we've about fifteen minutes left , 
so I'm I'm gonna 
continue with my pres presentation . 
Um I've one more slide before we close , 
but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this  these kinds of things , 
so I'll just bring that up and show you all 
before we move on . <other> Um  
Yeah , 
and then like the the covers could be spongy latex 
wherea 
but the actual model could be titanium . 
Ah hmm hmm hmm . 
Okay , um <other> 
components concept . Energy , chip on print . 
G 
That's th th this is the agenda they gave me . 
So 
can you just explain what that is real quick ? 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> I think it's awesome . I think it's really cool . 
<other> 
Okay . 
If they're if they're really options . 
Okay . 
Um okay , 
then we'll move on to the case . 
Um oh 
bu 
I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe . 
It would be nice for changing the volume , 
but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . 
'Cause you don't have control over numbers 
or  
We have five minutes left for the meeting , so . 
So , 
have a scroll for volume ? 
F 
Um . 
I think w 
well 
 I think when we go on to the une userface , we're gonna have to decide  the interface we're gonna have to decide um whether we're gonna have a scroll or not . 
Okay , 
let's do case . 
I'm a little um I'm a little hesitant about it , 
because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside . 
Um  
Yeah , 
I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Ge o 
Okay . 
So 
we uh we do want latex . 
Okay . 
Latex . 
Um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours . 
Fruity colours . <other> 
Okay um 
let's go to the ufe user interface 
then we'll come back to the chip I suppose . 
Well , 
we don't really know what the difference is , 
right ? 
Yeah . 
Um okay , 
interface , the type and the supplements . 
So 
push or scroll , 
right ? 
Or both ? 
Mm-hmm . 
And if we had a sc an on-screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things . 
I think that  
yeah . 
For channel surfing I think a scroll  an actual  like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , 
I dunno . 
Mm-hmm . 
Is that okay with you ? 
How you feeling ? 
Mm-hmm . 
It might be cool enough . 
Okay , so 
we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons , 
and then supplements , 
how are we gonna do that ? 
Um I assume that's what else we're gonna  like h ha the um the additional buttons we can use . 
So we're gonna have like a menu button , 
so that we can access on-screen things then ? 
Okay , 
um so 
we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through . 
Pre-set channels 
and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero , 
right ? 
Well , 
but in order to pre-set a cha 
oh 
I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay , um 
finishing the meeting now . 
Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , 
um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , 
and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . 
You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach . 
Um did we decide on a chip ? 
Let's go with a simple chip ? 
Okay . 
We are done . 
Thank you everyone . 
Oh 
I di 
these are already in our shared folder , so .
