Yep . 
<other> <laugh> 
Uh-huh . Don't think so . 
Jess . 
Alright , so 
I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device . 
Um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface . 
We want it to be simple 
and we want it to be fashionable . 
Um 
other  
we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose . 
Uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , 
so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are 
and make sure that we include  that we've included all of those 
and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people . 
We have a number of different choices for a design concept um 
and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of 
um , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work , 
how how  
what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . 
Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , 
making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features . 
And of course we also have to make it look cool . 
So basically , 
that's what we don't want . 
<laugh> M we don't want lots of buttons , uh complicated features . 
We want something that looks nice and simple . 
Here's a a fairly simple device . 
This is an an iPod from Apple . 
Um I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons . 
It's very minimalistic in its design . 
Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen . 
Um <other> the thing I like about this is that 
it's very very quick to access the main features . 
Uh you can just about make out uh that the button  three buttons are uh previous track , next track and play pause . 
They're the main the main features of the iPod , the things you will use a all the time . 
Um then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen 
and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want . 
So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . Um 
<other> here's a another example . 
This is uh  it's an interesting idea 
and I think i it looks pretty cool . 
Um it's certainly got novelty value . 
Uh it's nice and colourful , it's nice and bright . 
Uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around . 
The buttons are are different shapes 
and and you can sort of  
yeah 
if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which 
and basically , yeah 
it's ith it's fun . 
So 
I <other> I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . 
So you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels . 
I mean most people , when they watch T_V_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ 
and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . 
So , 
you have buttons for your favourite channel , 
changing the volume , 
which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_ , 
and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored . 
Um other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the T_V_ , 
uh I don't know what else you do with a T_V_ . 
Um but these are these are all necessary functions . 
Uh you can't have a t 
there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , 
so we need to find a way of including these somehow . 
Um and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the iPod . 
So 
we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , 
or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television 
and can b be controlled through the device . 
And that would allow you to access access the advanced features 
uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often . 
I think that's <other> that's one way to go , 
yes . 
Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display , 
it's it's nice , 
because it's  it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair . 
There are disadvantages , 
an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , 
'cause we're we're <other> I <other> 
well 
we're  
I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device . 
Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , 
'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark , 
but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display . 
The alternative is to have a <other> an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . Uh 
a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes 
where you you press the buttons 
and it comes up with your  this thing of watch lo what's on each channel . 
I mean that that's also a good idea . 
It's 
it can it does have it's problems as well , 
if you've got a small T_V_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room , it's hard to read the little text that comes up . 
Uh but that's a that's a design decision that we can make . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that that would be one of the features , yes . 
But it's it's it's 
something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c uh communication is one way , 
so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least I don't think you can . 
Um I'm not sure . 
Is that going on ? Okay . 
Uh that should be alright , actually . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
 
A kind of thing that  
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . Yeah . 
<laugh> I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? Uh like uh I dunno , like uh carrots or something . 
<laugh> Maybe , 
or  
Kind of like a potato . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Depends . 
When you when you use a remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ? 
Or your fingers ? 
Or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone , 
so you you hold it in one hand , 
and you press the buttons with your thumb . 
Yeah <other> . 
Maybe . 
But if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it's it's not so much a problem , perhaps . 
So you hold it in one hand 
and you press you press the buttons with your thumb 
and  
And you find that works quite well ? 
Is that  
The button on an iPod , is it  what is it , 
is it just four buttons 
or is it li more like a scroll thing ? 
Right . 
Oh , I see , right , yeah . 
Oh , okay . 
Yeah , that's quite a good design . 
Yeah . 
I think it could be difficult in practice , 
yeah . 
Also z yeah , 'cause you would be z looking down at the L_C_D_ screen , than back up at your T_V_ 
and people don't wanna do that . 
Like , to make it different fruits . <other> <laugh> 
Yeah , it's possible . 
I think maybe th the packaging , 
it should be like a lemon 
and the the packaging is like the peel . 
So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it , 
and the remote control's inside . 
Don't know . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , um I think it's good , 
as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is , 
but as far as I know , the technology is good . 
Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think . 
Uh it's fairly fairly standard . 
Um I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . 
I mean it might be nice for changing the volume . 
Uh but  
I don't think it would really work . 
Yeah , 
you really need buttons for changing a channel . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I think  yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , 
but it's not necessary . Um  
Yeah . 
'Kay . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Um  
Yep . 
Um  And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 
'cause then we can have a a simple chip 
and it's simpler , 
it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button . 
So in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons . 
Yeah , yeah , 
it's uh <other> it's it's fairly simple . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Uh what do you mean by supplements , exactly ? 
Um  
Yep . 
Yeah . 
Um in  
Yeah . On off , 
uh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu . 
Yeah , yeah 
about  
yeah like  yeah , a bit like radio presets . Um  
Uh we wouldn't even need the numbers . 
I think maybe numbers seems  is kind of old-fashioned . 
Yeah , yeah , 
you can just  
and you need some kind of , I dunno , sort of up down kind of button , 
but the volume control could double for that , for example . 
Cool . <laugh> 
Yep . 
<laugh> Clay . I wasn't expecting that . <laugh>
