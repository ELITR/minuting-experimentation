B:  Okay . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Hello . <laugh> 


A:  Okay . So um . So that was the opening . The first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . If everyone could go around and explain their role and um , and their name . 
D:  <cough> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Okay . My name's Poppy . I'm the Industrial Designer for this project . Um , I'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase . Also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product . 
A:  Nice to meet you Poppy . 
C:  <laugh> My name's Tara and I'm the User Interface Designer . I will also be responsible for the functional design phase , the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Okay . <laugh> 
A:  Alright . 
D:  Hi , I'm Genevieve . I'm the Marketing Expert . I'm an expert at marketing . Um , I'll be telling you guys about the user requirement specifications for our new product . Um , I'll be doing some trend-watching in the conceptual design , and product evaluation for the design phase . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Alright I'm Heather and I've I said I'm your Project Manager , um Well you can pretty much read what it is that I'm doing . But um um  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . And uh tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today , um um as well as planning the project , how we're going to , uh , create this product , and , um , discuss , um , our aims and objects of this , uh  Which brings us to our next subject , is , um , um , as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control . 
B:  <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer . And , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , can't see the numbers as well , or , um , perhaps an ergonomic design . 
B:  Okay . So this is a television remote control ? Yeah . 
A:  Yes , it's a television remote control . Right . I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now . So , alright . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  Um , yeah . Um , the way that we're going to go about this is , um , we'll have a time where we can , um come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use . Same with conceptual design and detailed design . So , um , making sure that it , it's usable , that as a , um  and that it's , it's feasible to create , and uh , to come up with a concept of it want , what we want it to look like . Um , tool training . Is , is everyone , um   Okay . Great . Great . Um 
B:  Yeah . Got those notes . 
D:  Yeah . Thank you . 
A:  One thing that , uh , we're going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project . Um , one of them is our whiteboard . And , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , I , I'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal . Um , why that , why that should be your favourite animal . So , um , I , I'm assuming that we should do that now .

C:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Okay , let's stand up and support you <laugh> <other> 
A:  My favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay , 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  right now it is an elk . alright , so  
C:  An elk ? <laugh> A vicious  <laugh> 
B:  <other> Okay . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  And it goes like  Yeah it's got like big antlers , yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Looks kinda like , like it has holly growing out of its head . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Do you have elk where you come from ? 
A:  Yes . Yeah we have moose and we have deer .

B:  Okay . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Do you have  
C:  We have sheep . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Sheep . Yeah , cows . 
A:  <laugh>  'Kay , um . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> 
B:  That's a great elk . <other> Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Uh-oh , we have a good artist . <other> <laugh> 
C:  That is really good . I'm quite  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Thanks . This is my  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh , very shapely . 
A:  Okay . That's a sketching of my my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature , that um , that um  In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs and it uh  But it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has um strong antlers , and uh 
B:  Brilliant . 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , uh , it can really defend itself . 
B:  Mm . Very nice . Okay . 
A:  Yeah . Right . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Right , I'm gonna take minutes while , um , you guys express your favourite animals . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Okay , I'll go next . I am a big animal lover . I like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . <laugh> 
D:  <other> Oh . 
A:  Oh . 
B:  It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing , but never mind . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <other> 
B:  Not as artistic as Heather's drawing . Bit more cartoon style . But I like cats because they're so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . Um , but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , um , running around outside as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , and generally just , they just seemed so cool and <laugh> they just know what they're doing . Uh I reckon they're sort of , they got it sorted . They know what they want . <laugh> Basically , that's why I like cats . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> <laugh> Very good . <laugh> 
A:  Great . 
B:   I'll rub that out . There you go . <laugh> 
C:  Okay . I think my favourite animal would be a dog , but I'm not really sure <laugh> how to draw one . I , I've never drawn a dog , I don't think . I'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause I draw them sometimes <laugh> and they're really easy to draw . Um , 
B:  Ooh . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> I forget her name . 
C:  right it's gonna be a really funny dog , 'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog . 
D:  Tara 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  or Tara . 
B:  Well there are loads of different types of dogs , so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> It's a cartoon dog I think . A s I don't ev Oh , oh well . <laugh> It's a scary cartoon dog . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> 
C:  That  This , that does not look like a dog . <laugh> I'm sorry . <laugh>  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> <laugh> We can pretend . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> It looks kinda like a person . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> That's Pinocchio . 
C:  <laugh> How do you draw a dog ? I suppose it has a lon Oh my god . Right . Yous know what it's supposed to be . <laugh> It's a dog . <laugh> . Um , I like dogs because , um , they're so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , and they're just such friendly animals . And , like they're more of a companion than cats . <laugh> I've nothing against cats . Cats don't really like me , so I can't like them . <laugh> But they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals , <laugh> that don't look like that . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Okay . Yeah , that's true . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> Alrighty . I feel like a robot . <laugh> Okay . Um , well I guess I had the most time to think about it . I'm going to draw a butterfly , because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . It was like , well it was a little pointier than that . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  At first I thought it was a dead leaf . And then it landed on the wall next to me . But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . And then it kinda  there was a green , I think it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this . 
C:  <other> 
A:  It's kinda like a peacock . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , it kinda was actually , 'cause it was  This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and I'm like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March . So I thought that was pretty cool . And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . I wish I'd had my camera . So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . Yeah . There you go . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Very nice . <laugh> 
A:  Great . 
D:  <other> Uh , what do we  Oh . 
A:  Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ? 
D:  Yes I do . <laugh>  
A:  Yea <laugh> Right . 
D:  <cough> 


A:  So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um  or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , um , wanna make this um  selling price of twenty five Euros . And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um 
B:  Okay . 
A:  we can  like the price to create it will be significantly less . Um , we'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million Euro . I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . Um , and make it for an international market . Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . Things like that , depending on which country you are . Another thing for the design team to think about . Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents . 
D:  Okay , so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? Twelve fifty . 
A:  I'm bad at math . 'Kay . <laugh> Um , so now that , um , that is underway , um 
D:  Okay . 
B:  <laugh> <cough> 


A:  it is discussion time . 


A:  Right . Okay we have five minutes left . So , just to cover  We have one more thing . Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . Um , our next meeting will be in half an hour . So you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present . Or not present but bring to the meeting . Um , I_D_ , whatever that stands for . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Interface ? Oh , industrial . 
B:  Industrial Designer . That's me . <laugh> 
A:  Industrial Designer . I have to remember these things . Um . You'll be beginning your , your working design . Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . Um , <other> maybe how this can be achieved , and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert . Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . And I'll see you in half an hour , okay ? 'Kay . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Marketing Expert . <laugh> 
B:  Okay . Thank you . 
C:
