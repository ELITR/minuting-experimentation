Alright , that did nothing . 
Okay . 
Welcome to the meeting everyone . 
Just gonna attempt to make this into a slide show . 
Sorry guys . 
I did . Twice . 
This'll just take a moment . <laugh> 
Or it won't . 
Okay we'll have to deal with it like this then . 
Alright . Um . 
This is the first meeting uh for developing our , our new product . 
 I'm Heather , I'm your Project Manager . 
Okay . So um . 
So that was the opening . 
The first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . 
If everyone could go around and explain their role and um , and their name . 
Nice to meet you Poppy . 
Alright . 
<laugh> 
Alright I'm Heather 
and I've I said I'm your Project Manager , 
um Well you can pretty much read what it is that I'm doing . 
But um um  
Yeah . 
And uh tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today , 
um um as well as planning the project , 
how we're going to , uh , create this product , 
and , um , discuss , um , our aims and objects of this , 
Which brings us to our next subject , 
is , um , um , 
as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control . 
Um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , 
um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer . 
And , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , can't see the numbers as well , 
or , um , perhaps an ergonomic design . 
Yes , it's a television remote control . 
Right . 
I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now . 
So , alright . 
Um , yeah . 
Um , the way that we're going to go about this is , um , we'll have a time where we can , um come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project 
and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use . 
Same with conceptual design and detailed design . 
So , um , 
making sure that it , it's usable , 
that as a , um  
and that it's , it's feasible to create , 
and uh , to come up with a concept of it want , what we want it to look like . 
Um , tool training . 
Is , is everyone , um  
 Okay . 
Great . Great . 
Um 
One thing that , uh , we're going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project . 
Um , one of them is our whiteboard . 
And , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , I , I'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal . 
Um , why that , why that should be your favourite animal . 
So , um , I , 
I'm assuming that we should do that now . 
'Kay . 
<laugh> With our microphones still attached to our bodies . 
Okay . <laugh> 
'Kay , what's my favourite animal ? 
Do come up . <laugh> 
This is a team-building time 
where , um , <laugh> , 
okay cool , um  
My favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay , 
right now it is an elk . 
alright , so  
And it goes like  
Yeah it's got like big antlers , 
yeah . 
Looks kinda like , like it has holly growing out of its head . 
Yes . 
Yeah 
we have moose and we have deer . 
Do you have  
<laugh>  'Kay , um . 
<other> 
<laugh> Thanks . 
This is my  
Okay . 
That's a sketching of my my elk , 
and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature , 
that um , that um  
In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs 
and it uh  
But it can really overcome harsh terrain , 
and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has um strong antlers , 
and uh 
it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , uh , it can really defend itself . 
Yeah . 
Right . 
Right , 
I'm gonna take minutes 
while , um , you guys express your favourite animals . 
Oh . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Great . 
<laugh> 
I forget her name . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> It looks kinda like a person . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
It's kinda like a peacock . 
<laugh> 
Great . 
Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ? 
Yea <laugh> 
Right . 
So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , 
um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , 
um  or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , 
um , wanna make this um  selling price of twenty five Euros . 
And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um 
we can  like the price to create it will be significantly less . 
Um , we'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million Euro . 
I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . 
Um , and make it for an international market . 
Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . 
Things like that , depending on which country you are . 
Another thing for the design team to think about . 
Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents . 
I'm bad at math . 
'Kay . <laugh> Um , 
so now that , um , that is underway , um 
it is discussion time . 
So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um suggestions that you may have so far , 
a um your personal experiences with remote controls , and um , um , areas you see that , uh , could be improved in your experience with them . 
Does anyone have any initial thoughts ? 
Mm-hmm . 
So what's something we could , uh , do to remedy that ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . It's a great idea . It's a great idea . 
<laugh> 
Alright . 
Anything about , um , the look of the , uh , remote control that you might have ideas about . 
Maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , um , something more interesting like  
Any ideas will do that you have at this point . 
<laugh> Can hold it . 
Yeah . 
Well if it's a trendy original , um , aspect we're going for . 
I mean , you're the designers , you c , you can um decide what kind of , um , direction you wanna go in , 
but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . 
Um , that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous . 
Right . 
Okay we have five minutes left . 
So , just to cover  
We have one more thing . 
Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . 
Um , our next meeting will be in half an hour . 
So you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present . 
Or not present but bring to the meeting . 
Um , I_D_ , whatever that stands for . 
Industrial Designer . 
I have to remember these things . Um . 
You'll be beginning your , your working design . 
Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . 
Um , <other> maybe how this can be achieved , 
and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag 
Marketing Expert . 
Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . 
And I'll see you in half an hour , 
okay ? 
'Kay .
