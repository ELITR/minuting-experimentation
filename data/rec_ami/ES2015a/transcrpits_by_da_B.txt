Okay okay <laugh> 
Okay . <laugh> 
Hello . <laugh> 
Okay . 
My name's Poppy . 
I'm the Industrial Designer for this project . 
Um , I'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase . 
Also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product . 
Okay . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Okay . 
So this is a television remote control ? 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Got those notes . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Oh , 
 to go first . 
<laugh> Oh , 
are we all doing it individually ? 
Okay , 
let's stand up and support you <laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<other> Okay . 
<laugh> 
Do you have elk where you come from ? 
You do . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Sheep . Yeah , 
cows . 
That's a great elk . 
<other> Yeah . <laugh> 
Brilliant . 
Mm . 
Very nice . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Okay , I'll go next . 
I am a big animal lover . 
like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . <laugh> 
It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing , 
but never mind . 
<laugh> 
Not as artistic as Heather's drawing . 
Bit more cartoon style . 
But I like cats because they're so independent , 
and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . 
Um , but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , 
and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , um , running around outside 
as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , 
and generally just , they just seemed so cool and <laugh> they just know what they're doing . 
Uh I reckon they're sort of , they got it sorted . 
They know what they want . 
<laugh> Basically , that's why I like cats . <laugh> 
 I'll rub that out . 
There you go . <laugh> 
Ooh . 
<laugh> 
Well there are loads of different types of dogs , so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog . <laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> We can pretend . <laugh> 
<laugh> Okay . 
Yeah , that's true . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Very nice . <laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
<other> 
Okay . 
I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . 
It's always , where is the remote control ? 
So maybe if you could have some kind of 
tracking <laugh> device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . 
I dunno , 
some kind of alarm . 
You can press a button on your wall ,  signal , 
'cause it always gets lost . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that you don't use half of them . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
that's , that's  
Yeah , it is . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
<laugh> A novelty . 
Are we going into kind of novelty factors here . 
Like , I've seen phones like a  
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . 
Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable  
But we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either . 
So , hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Industrial Designer . 
That's me . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Thank you .
