<other> 
Alrighty . 
I feel like a robot . 
<laugh> Okay . Um , 
well I guess I had the most time to think about it . 
I'm going to draw a butterfly , 
because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . 
And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , 
and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . 
It was like , well it was a little pointier than that . 
At first I thought it was a dead leaf . 
And then it landed on the wall next to me . 
But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . 
And then it kinda  
there was a green , I think it was a green ring , 
and there was like red going out like this . 
Yeah , it kinda was actually , 
'cause it was  
This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , 
and I'm like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March . 
So I thought that was pretty cool . 
And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . 
I wish I'd had my camera . 
So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . 
Yeah . 
There you go . 
<other> Uh , what do we  
Oh . 
Yes I do . <laugh>

Okay . 
I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing . 
 
Um  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something . 
That's useful . 
So you just have like the number buttons , power button , T_V_ video button .

Could be shaped like a conch , 
you know . 
Be like a shell-shaped remote . <laugh> <cough>
