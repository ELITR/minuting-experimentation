Hm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yep . 
Sure . 
What was it ? Function ? 
F_ eight ? 
Well . 
<laugh> 
How do I get it  
Oh right right right . 
That one ? 
Okay . 
Alright . Well , 
this is my report , 
which is going to be based pretty much on a survey 
that I was sent . 
Oh gosh , 
I've no idea . <laugh> 
G 
Okay . 
Sorry 
I actually need 
to see something else on my screen . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
And then ? 
Again ? 
No 
I want something else on mine . 
Is that possible ? 
Okay 
but now you don't have that . 
<laugh> Sorry guys . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> So 
is there no way I can give you the slideshow and 
yeah . Yeah . 
Oh well . 
Yeah . 
It's okay . 
Okay . Um so 
first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research , 
by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted . 
And then some internet research . 
And I was sent a report 
that was  
I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . 
And so I will show you some of the results from that , 
which I think will be helpful . 
Um okay 
here are some of the findings . 
They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . 
And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . 
Which is a fairly significant number I would say . 
And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . 
So I think that earlier we were onto something 
when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , 
I think that's definitely important . 
Um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . 
Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . 
And if anyone could clarify what that means ? 
Zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ? 
Okay . <laugh> 
Um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . 
And there was something else , 
they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . 
And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all . 
Of course channel selection is used the most frequently . 
And then teletext was the next . Volume and then power . 
And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . 
So 
I think we could definitely eliminate 
or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button . 
Um the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , 
and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . 
They said it take  
thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . 
And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_ . <laugh> 
What is it ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
And so bas 
okay . Um 
as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they're all for it . 
From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . 
And it kind of just went down incrementally . 
The groups at  
the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , 
so maybe we could discuss this 
and think  
and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups . 
And so 
in conclusion . Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct . 
We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , 
since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . 
Um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . 
So you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room . 
Uh we need to simplify the remote 
and reduce the number of buttons , 
get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose . 
And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition . 
And that's it . 
<cough> 
Oh yeah . 
Sorry 
did you guys get time to write everything that you needed ? 
'Kay . 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it , 
but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money . 
Like 
I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know . 
Yeah . 
Gets old yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> Rolls away 
yeah . 
<laugh> Not really . <other> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah not yet 
but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Power . 
Yeah . <cough> 
<cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
Right . 
Uh-huh . 
Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote . <laugh> Special order . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Could be good . 
<laugh> Yeah , yeah . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh>
