A:  the last meeting we went over um <other> who was responsible for what . 
A:  I'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , uh and coming up with the final presentation . 
A:  Um Corinne is our Marketing Expert . 
A:  Um <other> Ryan is our User Interface Designer . 
A:  And Manuel is the Industrial Designer . 
A:  <laugh> Um we decided our remote , 
A:  uh we want it to be a universal remote 
A:  Um we want to be modern , um fun , different . 
A:  Uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find , 
A:  so we gonna have that locator function . 
A:  Um and we want to be different . 
A:  Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . Ball-shaped phone . The keyboard shape . 
A:  Um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . Something we could use with one hand . 
abst_sum - abstract: The project manager recapped the events and decisions of the previous meeting.

D:  this is my report , 
D:  which is going to be based pretty much on a survey 
D:  first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research , 
D:  by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted . 
D:  And then some internet research . 
D:  I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . 
D:  And so I will show you some of the results from that , 
D:  They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . 
D:  And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . 
D:  And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . 
D:  I think that's definitely important . 
D:  Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . 
D:  And if anyone could clarify what that means ? 
D:  Zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ? 
D:  Um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . 
D:  they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . 
D:  And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all . 
D:  Of course channel selection is used the most frequently . 
D:  And then teletext was the next . Volume and then power . 
D:  And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . 
D:  I think we could definitely eliminate 
D:  or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button . 
D:  Um the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , 
D:  and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . 
D:  thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . 
D:  And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_ . <laugh> 
D:  as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they're all for it . 
D:  From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . 
D:  And it kind of just went down incrementally . 
D:  so maybe we could discuss this 
D:  and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups . 
D:  in conclusion . Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct . 
D:  We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , 
D:  since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . 
D:  Um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . 
D:  Uh we need to simplify the remote 
D:  and reduce the number of buttons , 
D:  get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose . 
D:  And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition . 
A:  Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want , 
A:  what we should focus on . Uh  
abst_sum - abstract: The marketing expert presented research on user preferences and tendencies with remote controls.

D:  They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . 
D:  And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . 
D:  And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . 
D:  I think that's definitely important . 
D:  Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . 
D:  And if anyone could clarify what that means ? 
D:  Zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ? 
D:  Um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . 
D:  And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all . 
D:  Of course channel selection is used the most frequently . 
D:  And then teletext was the next . Volume and then power . 
D:  And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . 
D:  I think we could definitely eliminate 
D:  or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button . 
D:  Um the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , 
D:  and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . 
D:  thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . 
D:  And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_ . <laugh> 
abst_sum - abstract: The research indicated that users want remotes to be more attractive, to match the behavior of the user, to be easier to locate when misplaced, and not to cause RSI.

D:  as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they're all for it . 
D:  From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . 
D:  And it kind of just went down incrementally . 
D:  so maybe we could discuss this 
D:  and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups . 
abst_sum - abstract: The research also indicated that younger users were interested speech recognition.

C:  Having just listened to what Corinne just said , 
C:  I'll draw on some of the things as well . <other>  Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say . 
C:  I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design . 
C:  Um <other> the method I used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control . 
C:  And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . 
C:  Um I had some things sent to me . Not very much . 
C:  To look at similar devices . 
C:  Um we discussed a universal one . 
C:  But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , 
C:  um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . 
C:  You have to set them , reset them to everything . 
C:  Um and that would only add buttons . 
C:  Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons . 
C:  So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s . 
C:  here here's just two pictures of remote controls . 
C:  But one is uh user-centred . 
C:  And you can straight away see there's less buttons . 
C:  And the other one is  engineer-centred 
C:  where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um  
C:  and on what the  have said and the market research and stuff  probably looking at something that should be user-centred . 
C:  Fewer buttons , 
C:  simpler to use , 
C:  maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe 
C:  some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . 
C:  the major findings  market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . 
C:  So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . 
C:  our product I think should be user interface orientated . Um  
C:  Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control , 
abst_sum - abstract: The user interface designer spoke on the option to have a universal remote, presented two differently designed remotes available on the market, and described some features a user-centered remote should include.

B:  Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically 
B:  which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance 
B:  I'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board . 
B:  This is the basic basic premise of a remote control . 
B:  Um the basic function is to send messages to another system . 
B:  An energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , 
B:  Um there's uh also some sound systems 
B:  but infrared is the better or the more more used system . 
B:  that can compose messages . <other> Often in the form of infrared bits . 
B:  A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . 
B:  Um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . 
B:  We'll start with an energy source . 
B:  which is usually a battery 
B:  This energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself <other> . 
B:  Uh which can be buttons , whatever , 
B:  which in fact controls a chip . 
B:  Um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . 
B:  And  Of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . 
B:  The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , 
B:  so that you know that it's working basically . 
B:  The the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . 
B:  What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . 
B:  Um as we've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment . 
B:  <cough> The user interface . That's something we can also discuss . 
B:  We cannot change the chip 
B:  Or if we just do the usual button thing . 
B:  Or we have a touch pad or something like that  
B:  And of course the energy source . Batteries . Solar cells . 
B:  Of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact <cough> available cheap enough , developed enough . 
A:  the more complex we make it of course , the more expensive  
A:  younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote . 
A:  possibly it might be worth the investment . 
C:  I think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work . 
C:  'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o  if it's on your phone . 
C:  And you need to sort of take into light languages and then <other> different dialects I suppose as well . 
A:  I  myself I find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition . 
A:  Like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something . Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end , 
A:  and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over . 
D:  Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it , 
D:  but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money . 
D:  I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know . 
A:  It's a , it's a gimmick factor that they like at first , 
abst_sum - abstract: The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and then the team discussed the option to include speech recognition in their design.

A:  I was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements . 
A:  Um the remote's only gonna be for the television , 
A:  which is good 
A:  because we already decided 
A:  Um no teletext . Um  
A:  the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , 
A:  which is we put the fashion in electronics . 
A:  And our corporate colours are grey and yellow . 
A:  And we could probably get away with black too but  
abst_sum - abstract: The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to abide by.

A:  Um from all all three of your uh presentations , I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . 
A:  We want something that looks good . 
A:  Um we want something that's simple . 
A:  We want something that you can find easily . Um  
A:  And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of uh give or take . 
A:  probably , I would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . 
C:  I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . 
C:  if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you wanna call it . 
C:  But if you don't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , 
C:  and that just sort of sends out a beep <other> to find where it is or something . Just by infrared . 
A:  That'd be , that'd be good if we were going with our our ball . 
A:  Or or with  you know I guess with any form that that would be good . 
A:  that could be the charger . 
A:  we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote . 
A:  However , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . Um  
A:  With the locator button . 
A:  It looks like you're already on your way for uh working with the components . 
A:  User interface concept , we want it to be something simple . 
A:  Um  Minimal number of buttons . 
C:  I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed . 
C:  The ball is probably not a good idea . 
A:  Um  Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group ? 
A:  if we were shooting for young guys then it's um a certain look to the remote . Or girls or older people ? 
C:  I don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching . 
D:  but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that . 
A:  we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it . 
A:  yellow it's nice and bright , 
A:  with the buttons being grey or black . 
A:  And our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom 
A:  maybe we could flare it or something . 
A:  of course this will look like a bone then . 
C:  it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going . 
A:  mobile phones um they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small . 
A:  Um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time . 
A:  <other> Maybe we could go with a square or something . Um  
A:  with minimal number of buttons . 
A:  I guess you've got you know one through nine . For typing in your channels . 
A:  Uh you've got volume , up and down . 
A:  Channel up and down . 
D:  Power . 
A:  Um a mute . 
A:  A menu button , maybe . 
A:  if we want the remote to do other things like um  or I guess the T_V_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into T_V_s , we just have that under one standard menu button 
A:  press the menu button , 
A:  scroll up and down to select it . 
B:  Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad . 
B:  Would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this . 
A:  Like a wheel on your mouse . 
B:  if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function , 
B:  where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down . 
B:  Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here . 
B:  Then you hold it in your hand like this . 
B:  And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the  or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side . 
C:  the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here . 
B:  You can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open . 
C:  on a sort of side view . Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better . 
B:  causes a problem um for left or right-handed people actually . So . 
C:   instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person . 
D:  Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote . <laugh> Special order . 
A:  it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person . 
C:  I mean I'm just just thinking maybe if it was um circular um with the sort of  that sort of <other>  the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , 
B:  If we have a smaller a smaller device that actually fits into the big one . 
B:  Mm . Then there's maybe another point of making it a two-in-one kind of thing . 
B:  and just a couple of functions in there . Like your zap zapping device is just u channels up-down , uh volume , and on-off . 
B:  You give it the full functions in here , 
B:  Means the big one has to be sufficiently big . 
B:  And perhaps heavy , 
abst_sum - abstract: The team then discussed the option to include a recharger with a locater button in their design, the appearance of their remote, buttons, how to make an ergonomic remote, and the option to have a two-piece remote.

A:  Manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use . 
abst_sum - action: The industrial designer will work on components.

A:  let's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two-piece . 
A:  So one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand . Um  
abst_sum - action: The team will explore the option of a two-piece remote.

A:  <other> And Ryan you work on um how how well they'll work with the us with the user . So both of those concepts . 
abst_sum - action: The user interface designer will explore how well a rounded, ergonomic remote and a two-piece remote work with the user.

A:  you're watching trends 
abst_sum - action: The marketing expert will examine trend watching reports

A:  Um the remote's only gonna be for the television , 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will only be used for televisions.

A:  Um no teletext . Um  
abst_sum - decisions: The team will not work with teletext.

A:  the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , 
abst_sum - decisions: The corporate color and slogan must be incorporated into the design.

A:  Um we want something that's simple . 
A:  User interface concept , we want it to be something simple . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will be simple.

A:  We want something that looks good . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will look appealing.

A:  We want something that you can find easily . Um  
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will be easy to find.

A:  Um  Minimal number of buttons . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will have a minimal number of buttons.

A:  yellow it's nice and bright , 
A:  with the buttons being grey or black . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will be yellow with black or gray buttons.

A:  And our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom 
abst_sum - decisions: The corporate slogan will appear on the bottom of the remote.

A:  Uh you've got volume , up and down . 
A:  I guess you've got you know one through nine . For typing in your channels . 
A:  Channel up and down . 
D:  Power . 
A:  Um a mute . 
A:  A menu button , maybe . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will have buttons for numbers, volume up and down, channel up and down, power, mute, and a menu.

B:  Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad . 
B:  Would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this . 
A:  Like a wheel on your mouse . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will include a scroll action.

C:  I mean I'm just just thinking maybe if it was um circular um with the sort of  that sort of <other>  the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , 
A:  So one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand . Um  
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will be rounded in shape such that it fits comfortably in the hand.

C:  I think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work . 
C:  'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o  if it's on your phone . 
A:  I  myself I find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition .

A:  and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over . 
abst_sum - problems: The reliability of speech recognition.

A:  younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote . 
A:  possibly it might be worth the investment . 
C:  I think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work .

A:  probably , I would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . 
abst_sum - problems: Whether to include speech recognition.

B:  causes a problem um for left or right-handed people actually . So . 
C:   instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person . 
D:  Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote . <laugh> Special order . 
A:  it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person . 
abst_sum - problems: How to accommodate left-handed people with an ergonomic design that fits right-handed people.
