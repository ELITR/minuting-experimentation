Du 
<other> 
Uh we yes s I've lo <other> 
I've done the role that I was asked to do anyway . 
<laugh> I think . 
<laugh> 
Slide show . 
Just press the arrow keys I think . 
Usually goes to it . 
Is is it j just just 
just using it 
yeah . 
A repetitive strain injury . 
Just repetitive strain injury . 
I think . That's what I guess . 
Yeah . 
Having just listened to what Corinne just said , 
I'll draw on some of the things as well . <other>  Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say . 
'Kay so 
I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design . 
Um <other> the method I used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control . 
And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . 
I mean that's an obvious thing to say , 
but it's not attached to the device that you want to control . 
Um I had some things sent to me . Not very much . 
To look at similar devices . 
Um defined in some them . 
And then the personal preferences that I will suggest . 
Um we discussed a universal one . 
Um like 
it's just been brought up again then . 
But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , 
um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . 
I'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself , 
but you have to  i 
they're a nightmare to use . 
You have to set them , reset them to everything . 
Um and that would only add buttons . 
Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons . 
So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s . 
Um or maybe just one that you could we could design 
and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design . Um  
Okay 
here here's just two pictures of remote controls . 
They're just simple T_V_ remote controls . 
But one is uh user-centred . 
That is the one on the left . 
And you can straight away see there's less buttons . 
And the other one is  engineer-centred 
where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um  
 which appeals more to the product that we want , 
and on what the  have said and the market research and stuff  probably looking at something that should be user-centred . 
Fewer buttons , 
simpler to use , 
and if ten percent um is hidden away  
if ten percent is what's used , 
maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe 
under  
some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . 
And the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across . 
Um and finally , um uh 
sort I've sort of covered that , 
our product I think should be user interface orientated . Um  
Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control , 
a universal remote might be too complex . 
Um 
and as what it , 
the major findings  market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . 
So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . 
And that's it . 
On something on the image of it . 
Uh the f 
the actual design . 
I think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work . 
'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o  if it's on your phone . 
And you need to sort of take into light languages and then <other> different dialects I suppose as well . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And wou I don't know if would 
would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff . 
If you were watching something would you sort of be wanting  
Yeah . 
I think  
As well it'd be j the gimmick factor for the younger people . 
But practically I don't think it's   
Yeah . 
It'll wear off . 
Do you wanna put your cord back in ? 
I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . 
Is that  
if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you wanna call it . 
Um that you you should put it back in . Your remote . 
But if you don't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , 
and that just sort of sends out a beep <other> to find where it is or something . Just by infrared . 
That shouldn't be too complex I would've thought . 
Yeah it would be quite good . 
The ball could sit on a  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I'll yeah I'll have a look , 
try  look at the actual appearance in the next break . 
I th I 
I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed . 
The ball is probably not a good idea . 
And even something that's held like that might be difficult . 
So that I think it still has to be a variation . 
On maybe a a rect on a rectangle 
but maybe not necessarily as boring , as plain as a rectangle . 
D 
I don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching . 
I  find anything more on that . 
Yeah . 
Bottom perhaps 
yeah . 
You  
I mean 
it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going . 
They've gone from big brick block things , which is  a remote control is , to sort of slinky small things . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yes <other> 
To the thumb 
yeah . 
Maybe the buttons could like uh decrease in s 
the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here . 
Yeah . 
Behind . 
Definitely . 
 just like o 
on a sort of side view . Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better . 
So you know 
you just sort of have your hand 
Yeah . 
Right on the  
and your thumb would be up here type thing . 
Yeah that's also true . 
 instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person . 
But I mean  the older so 
Right-handed , 
yeah . 
<laugh> 
I mean I'm just just thinking maybe if it was um circular um with the sort of  that sort of <other>  the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , 
whereas this is just a one-handed thing 
that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb . 
So you'd have your , 
you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there . 
And then your thumb would do  
you'd have all the buttons sort of round here . 
And that I think could work . On any hand . If you just had it like wrapped round there . Left or right . 
<other> Minimise its size . 
It could be you know really quite small . 
Yeah . 
Zapping functions . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yep . 
Yeah . 
How well it'll work 
yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah .
