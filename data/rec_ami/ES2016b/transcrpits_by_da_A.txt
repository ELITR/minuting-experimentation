<other> Oh . 
Okay . 
Thanks for coming to this meeting . 
S 
how we doing on our remote ? 
We have some  we have some ideas and some uh 
ideas for what people want . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Alright 
let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . 
See if I can't get things uh moving along here a little bit better . 
Um I'll go over what we went over last time , 
which shouldn't take long . 
Then I believe each of you have a presentation . 
Um I've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote , 
what they want . 
Um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do , 
um and how it's going to do it hopefully . 
And uh then we'll have the closing . 
<other> Um which we'll have forty minutes for . 
Uh let's see , 
the last meeting we went over um <other> who was responsible for what . 
I'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , uh and coming up with the final presentation . 
Um Corinne is our Marketing Expert . 
She's gonna figure out what what um the consumer wants . 
Um <other> Ryan is our User Interface Designer . 
And Manuel is the Industrial Designer . 
So you're gonna come up with the ideas Ryan , 
and you're gonna pick 'em apart . 
<laugh> Um we decided our remote , 
uh we want it to be a universal remote 
uh that everyone would want . 
Um we want to be modern , um fun , different . 
Uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find , 
so we gonna have that locator function . 
Um and we want to be different . 
Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . Ball-shaped phone . The keyboard shape . 
Um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . Something we could use with one hand . 
Um and that was our last meeting . 
So um 
why don't um  
Do each of you have a presentation ? 
Okay . 
I'll hand it off to you 
and um  
Does anyone  
do you wanna go first ? 
So we can maybe see what uh what the people want . 
To go to the next one ? 
Yeah 
you click on that guy . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Hit F_ eight again . 
I think . 
Yeah . 
You want it to be on both screens , 
or just just yours ? 
Yeah 
but I think you have to hit escape . 
And then you can  
Yeah . 
Oh 
hit F_ eight again . 
I know . 
I did the same thing . <laugh> 
And then it should come up here shortly . 
'Kay . 
I think  
oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen ? 
Mm . 
I'm not sure . 
You could maybe minimise that screen 
and then 
have them both up at the same time I think . 
'Kay . 
Very nice . 
Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want , 
what we should focus on . Uh  
Wait 
can I look at that real quick ?  . 
What was your last conclusion on that one ? Focus on 
uh the i 
the image of it . 
'Kay . 
Good . Good . 
<laugh> 
So 
we could  the the 
the more complex we make it of course , the more expensive  
But people have said that they would  
well 
younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote . 
So 
possibly it might be worth the investment . 
I agree . 
Well  
I  myself I find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition . 
Like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something . Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end , 
and you say one for this , 
and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over . 
I find myself , especially if I'm in a crowd of people , looking really silly . 
So 
maybe if you're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then 
you know , 
you <other>  
Volume up . Volume down . Change the channel , you know channel up , channel down ? 
I I don't know . 
Mm-hmm . 
It's a , it's a gimmick factor that they like at first , 
and  
Okay . Um  Let's see here . 
Yeah I guess so . 
Trade you . 
Now 
I was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements . 
Um the remote's only gonna be for the television , 
which is good 
because we already decided 
 y your your research showed that uh not only is a universal remote more complicated , it's more cost , more costly . 
And your re uh research showed that you know most of the people don't even use it . 
I think uh you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons . 
So if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem . 
Um no teletext . Um  
So we don't have to worry about that . 
Um but we do have to use the 
the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , 
which is we put the fashion in electronics . 
And our corporate colours are grey and yellow . 
And we could probably get away with black too but  
So those are the three um the three new requirements 
that that I was told we need to use . 
Um from all all three of your uh presentations , I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . 
We want something that looks good . 
Um we want something that's simple . 
We want something that you can find easily . Um  
And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of uh give or take . 
It's gonna cost more . 
S 
the young the younger people say that they like it . 
But um it's 
probably , I would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . 
So maybe we should just do away with speech recognition . 
Um  And that way we can focus on our form . 
That'd be , that'd be good if we were going with our our ball . 
Or or with  you know I guess with any form that that would be good . 
You know 
that could be the charger . 
For 
you know 
we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote . 
And that would be  
or solar . 
Or 
you know  
However , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . Um  
With the locator button . 
Um and if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it . 
Um like 
if 
we still have the how to hold on to it 
<other> It's gonna roll away . 
Um  So 
I guess after the meeting <other> we'll have some questionnaires . 
And uh and some summaries for for what's going on . 
Um then we'll take lunch . 
Then we can come back and uh work on our individual work . 
Um  I'll do the minutes . 
Uh let's see . 
It looks like you're already on your way for uh working with the components . 
Um chips , the what chips we need 
and what uh 
you know 
how to power it and whatnot . 
User interface concept , we want it to be something simple . 
Um  Minimal number of buttons . 
I guess our , I guess our main um main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look , you know . 
Did you have time earlier to to work on that . 
Did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ? 
'Kay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Um  Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group ? 
That way we could l I mean if it were , 
if we were shooting for young guys then it's um a certain look to the remote . Or girls or older people ? 
Um  
Would that  
you think that would help us find um a specific form ? That we would would wanna pick out ? 
<laugh> 
'Kay . So um 
we know that the remote's gonna have to be  <other> 
we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it . 
Um yellow and <other> 
you know 
yellow it's nice and bright , 
with the buttons being grey or black . 
And our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom 
or the 
you know . Um  
Maybe we could sketch a  
so basically 
all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort . 
You know . Um 
maybe we could flare it or something . 
You know . 
So it's more  
of course this will look like a bone then . 
<laugh>  go ahead and erase this . Um  
Hope everyone memorised that uh  <laugh> 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah 
everybody's got a mobile phone right ? 
Except for me now . <laugh> Uh  
But they are all , 
you know , 
mobile phones um they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small . 
Um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time . 
But then again you don't want you know like the first mobile phone 
that was this big 
and you had a handbag to carry it around in . Um  
So 
we've got 
basically what remotes look like now is kind of what we're what we're stuck with . Um  
<other> Maybe we could go with a square or something . Um  
Um you know 
with minimal number of buttons . 
I guess you've got you know one through nine . For typing in your channels . 
Uh you've got volume , up and down . 
Channel up and down . 
Power . 
Usually at the top . 
Um a mute . 
That's that's pretty much all you need I think . Um  
A menu button , maybe . 
So you know . 
If you , 
if we want the remote to do other things like um  or I guess the T_V_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into T_V_s , we just have that under one standard menu button 
where you go in , 
press the menu button , 
scroll up and down to select it . 
Um  
'Kay 
so  
Um  
Mm-hmm . 
Like a wheel on your mouse . 
Sort of . 
<other> 'S a good idea . 
Mm-hmm . 
Look g 
yeah . 
Looks good . 
To the thumb . 
Yeah . 
Yeah <other> 
is everyone  who in here's right-handed , left-handed ? 
You guys all right-handed ? 
Yeah . 
So 
I'm left-handed 
but I , so I can say that most things are designed for right-handed people . 
<other> Like the written language . <laugh> Or English . 
Maybe . 
Ow . 
I would say 
I mean 
it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person . 
Um but that's that's good . 
That's  w I think we've got a kind of a good plan there . Um  At least for what buttons we're gonna use . Um  
So we've got uh  
I like the scroll , the scroll action 
and the   . 
Yeah . 
Kinda like holding a  
Yeah . 
So two remotes in one . 
But then would be easier to lose one or the other . 
<laugh> It actually is your coffee table . 
<other> Okay . Well 
we need to finish up here . Um  
So for the next  So for the next um  before the next meeting w uh sh shall we work on  
you're watching trends 
to see what what kind of new information we've got going on . Um  
Manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use . 
Let's go with our our uh rounded 
kind of fit in your hand  
let's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two-piece . 
So one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand . Um  
<other> And Ryan you work on um how how well they'll work with the us with the user . So both of those concepts . 
And uh okay 
I think we made some good progress here . 
<other> see you in  
I dunno . 
I gu I guess we'll take lunch in about uh half an hour . 
<other> Or I guess we'll be taking lunch shortly 
and then then in about half an hour after that we'll probably have another meeting . 
Okay .
