Mm-hmm . 
Abdul al-Hasred is my name . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Also have to say  
Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ? 
No ? 
Yeah . 
You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed . 
Says  
Yeah . 
It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions . 
But I guess it could be  
I guess it's possible . 
I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command . 
Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , 
so if they already have it as uh as a chip 
then we we could use it . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
I have a question about that actually <laugh> . 
Um , what is the purpose of the light ? 
Is  
But  
But in th in the dark uh  
Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ? 
But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it . 
You can see the buttons better , of course . 
Yeah . 
But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to  when you move it to detect your movement . 
Yeah , 
but you need another sensor for that , right ? 
Yeah <other> 
no it's too expensive . 
<other> 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Extra . 
Yeah , okay . 
Mm . 
Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , 
yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Okay 
. So uh my one , it uh should be in the shared folder . 
So . 
It was last time I saw it . 
Okay . 
So , 
<other> just move to the next slide . 
<other> So basically <cough> want very simple , right ? 
That's the major idea , as simple as possible . 
So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . 
And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . 
And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler . 
Um . <other> So . 
Yeah . 
Well this these uh these remotes are quite big , 
so go to the next page , 
so . 
We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle . 
So , from the bottom or whatever is there , uh the uh the numbers and then the top , uh until the ten also , this middle part , 
and on the left one is exactly the same . 
So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , 
yeah ? 
These are the basic thing . 
So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . 
Yeah , 
if you have , for example <other>  
I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . 
It could be on the right side , for example . 
Yeah . 
Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have . 
And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because 
you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things . 
Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way . 
So that they're separate a bit , 
yeah . 
Uh and it's easy to press the other  the big buttons , but uh , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . 
Mm . 
Yeah , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user . 
Alright , you won't  yeah . 
Usually what  I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that . 
Yeah . 
That you want to protect a bit . 
And I think it's uh it's reasonable . 
So , I don't think  
Yeah , this is just the the wheel . 
We could use the  
some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want . 
Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel 
and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case . 
Yeah , 
I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well , wou wou 
I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , 
it it would work , right ? 
Yeah . 
You can throw it to the television . 
Hey 
that's a cool one . 
We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off . 
When it d uh takes a shock . 
Yeah . 
How do we make it look cool is the question . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess . 
The banana is also ergonomic . 
Is there any fruit that is spongy ? 
<laugh> Yeah . 
You can make it um  
It's not hard , the metal . 
Plastic . <laugh> 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Two of the button , 
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve , 
yeah , 
and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side . 
So you can have it on on two sides 
and it'll be cool , 
no ? 
You can put also vibrator inside . 
Ah-ha . 
You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> I hope the students of management die , 
but anyway . <cough> 
Now who are recording this meeting ? 
The only th 
Yeah . 
Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure . 
But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be  
I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to  
I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move , 
right ? 
So , it's going to be bend a lot . 
So if we try to push the buttons , it  
You think it's possible ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Well , 
usually hold  <other> 
'Kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , 
right ? 
Uh  <other> 
Yeah but 
okay . 
Sa let's say that th o <other> 
It has to be  
basically you can only take two sides , 
one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb . 
<laugh> Basically . 
Or you could use use this one , 
but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel . 
This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ? 
Should have the two sides . 
So if  the left , we have  
the op 
Wheel  
Wheel buttons . 
Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . 
So you cannot see them . 
Yeah . 
So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be  
Y 
Yeah I know , 
but uh if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Maybe . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yes master . 
No . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
No . 
Maybe you can make  
uh <laugh> uh mm 
okay .
