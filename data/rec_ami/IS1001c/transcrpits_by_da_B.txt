Uh , I_D_ you want ? 
Yeah . 
I only v have three slides , so . 
I just look at the mm  um just this . On some web pages to find some documentation 
and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously , 
you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button 
and in our case we are using a um a wheel control . 
So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip , which is uh very very standard , and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . 
And um <other> 
yeah we can change directly . 
In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . 
The push button are usually extremely cheap , 
but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . 
And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not  if if we could combine something with the push button . 
Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
I I th <other> 
But I don't think that uh we should  
We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money . 
But  
Um that's all <laugh> 
yeah . 
I haven't chec 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah 
but I think it's yeah  
Sorry , 
I haven't written my personal references . 
Um <other> 
the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , 
and if we could reduce that . 
We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button . 
Just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber  
Yeah . Actually . 
As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light . 
Yeah . Again . 
I don't think that this is really expensive , 
but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be  
<other> First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light 
and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device  
Yeah , a little bit . 
A little bit . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
To s 
Mm-hmm . 
I support an apple . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Me too . 
Ah it's okay . 
I know that they do that for alarm clock also . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
What about um  
<laugh> 
And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , 
with blue L_E_D_ inside ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yep . 
Yeah . 
Banana I think , 
it's a nice idea . 
Because  
But  
You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that , 
but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , 
and here you have a a push button to  
Yeah . 
And everybody knows what is a banana . 
Basically . 
If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha 
Oh , yeah <laugh> 
So  
So we will just use a a standard battery ? 
And uh the chip we  
chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . 
Uh what do you mean by case ? 
Yeah . 
Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case , doesn't matter . 
I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it . 
Yeah yeah . 
Yeah . 
Spongy also . 
Oh no I think it's possible . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
. This is uh like the  
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Wheel on the top . 
Button , where do we want some buttons ? 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Yep . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Thank you .
