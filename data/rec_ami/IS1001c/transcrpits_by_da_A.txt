<other> Okay . 
So we are here for the concept design meeting . 
So , we will first start by summarizing the mm <other> the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . 
Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . 
So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours . 
We'll then t take decision in concert 
and then uh uh we will uh define the nest  next task , to have  to be done before the next meeting . 
So , last time we decided to have a simple interface . 
We also decided to have a wheel to change channel  previous channel button . 
Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . 
We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the T_V_ . 
We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , 
and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features . 
So now uh we will have three presentations . 
So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , 
the specification of the U_I_ by  or U_I_ <laugh> 
okay . <laugh> 
And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert . 
So maybe we can start with uh industrial design . 
So this is the presentation . 
Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
But is it a significant price on the whole remote control ? 
Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control . 
So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ? 
Okay 
You received something  
Hmm . 
And could it be adapted ? 
Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on  according to those news . 
Okay . 
You can easily find the button in the dark or so ? 
It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , 
no ? 
Hmm . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . True . 
But it can be uh battery consuming , no ? 
To have the light always on ? 
Well we will discuss that after maybe 
the other presentations . 
Yeah . 
And it is . 
Okay . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And also does it uh fit well in hand ? 
Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage . 
Yeah <other> . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So it's only the central part . 
Yeah . 
With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . S 
Okay . 
Will be down or  
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Maybe the wheel will be a <other> good advantage over our competitors . 
Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple . 
So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect . 
Okay . 
So we can move to the  
Is there any question ? 
For designer of user interface ? 
<laugh> or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
This is good also for  
Yeah . 
I think it is good also f to have a spongy material , yeah . 
Yeah , because it's robust . 
<laugh> 
Yeah 
uh sorry ? 
No . 
Yeah . 
Before ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has . 
Has it ? 
Yeah . 
I think it's  it makes it both easy and both innos innovative . 
So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept . 
Cool , fancy ? 
We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable . <laugh> 
Maybe uh um <other> a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that . 
<laugh> Maybe yeah . 
Yeah , 
and it's ergonomic as well . 
A pear . 
Yeah . Maybe pear yeah or something like that . 
Yeah . 
We can discuss that uh . 
D D Is is there anything you want to add ? 
<laugh> I don't think so . 
I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told . 
Something like that . 
But that's not in the trend . <laugh> . 
The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits . 
<laugh> I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well . 
So , 
I think we can keep the wheel 
because it's uh easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , 
and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana 
wit uh any others idea you have . 
What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with ? <laugh> 
Odi 
Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then . 
I think it's a good idea , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . 
Maybe we can keep the banana . 
And it will be very easy to find . 
Yeah . 
Yeah it's really uh really a good point . 
I think it  
So  
One second . 
So we have to take some decision on this aspect . 
So , uh so for  
sorry , 
for uh component , 
so  
we have to think about those aspects , 
sorry . 
Yeah . 
I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape . 
<laugh> 
But  
No the button would be  
In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover . 
Okay 
odd shape with spongy  cover . 
And standard battery okay , 
a chip imprint , there's no specific problem . 
So we agree to put the wheel  
So it have to  it has to be symmetrical . 
<laugh> 
Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable . 
Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left . Mm . 
I think you can turn it this way also . 
You can do both with both hands . 
I think it's okay . 
Well , you you will get used to it . 
And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons . 
Yeah . 
No 
you you  
I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . 
I think for lefty it's okay . 
I can do this movement , 
and for righty as well . 
I think this doesn't change that much . 
Yeah ? 
So , 
for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side . 
And  
and uh a wheel on the top . 
So the colour is yellow . 
I think it's uh  
we defined everything according to what we should  what the decision we should take , yeah . 
So maybe we can um 
we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting . 
So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision . 
And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc  the product . 
That is to say , uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users , 
but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay . 
It seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use . 
So  
so  
to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer uh work together . 
That would uh 
be better , I think . 
And uh  
And so uh 
you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual . 
So <laugh> 
do you need to add anything ? 
<other> You feel okay ? 
You feel uh free to express what you want to say ? 
You don't feel too constrained ? 
<laugh> You don't feel free to answer this ? 
<laugh> Okay , so  
See you .
