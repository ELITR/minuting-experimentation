Okay . 
Okay , well  
Okay . 
Okay we all ready to go ? 
Well how um on the  in this meeting then if we um  
I'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . 
And we uh decided on 
decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , 
and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , 
that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um <other> . 
And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the T_V_ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan . 
Um so that was the last meeting . 
Is there anything  have I forgotten anything ? 
Is that everything ? 
Okay . 
Um so if we have the three presentations , 
and then if you have anything to kind of  that you know you're gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end . 
That might be a better idea this time . 
And so if we start off uh with Andrew and then Craig and then David , 
if that's alright . 
Um and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff , right <laugh> . 
So if you wanna take this . 
<other> 
Screwed in quite tightly . 
Uh what did  
uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? 
We  did we say we were gonna try  maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that ? 
Right . 
Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product . 
So um <other> that's kind of the end result hopefully . 
<other> Uh-huh . 
Hopefully appear in a wee second . 
Up there we go . 
<laugh> Oh no . 
Oh right .

<other> Mm . 
Not quite . 
Oh something coming now , yeah . 
There we go . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
<other> I think it's yellow 
because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow , 
so yellow , lemon , you know definitely food for thought there , 
but keep going 
and we'll discuss it after . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm 'kay . 
Mm . 
Aye that's a good idea , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah that that was very good , 
and uh now with David . 
I know it'd be handy , wouldn't it . 
Do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um  
Yeah . 
<other> <laugh> 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
We  you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ? 
Yeah . 
Mm 'kay . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
I'll clear one of these things for you . 
Just by moving it yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
W yeah . 
Uh yeah yeah , I see . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
I know what you mean yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
<other> Okay . 
Okay . 
Right . 
Okay . 
Right can I  
Yeah well yeah 
it's just I'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so  
but yeah you c ask away . 
Mm . 
Why what kind of light do you want  are you thinking of ? 
Uh-huh . 
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
Like a phone yeah , like the backlight in a phone . 
Okay cool . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Right 
okay um well <other> 
let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start , 
and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . 
So um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an  decision on the the the concepts of the product . 
So back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that . 
Um I mean what does everybody think about  
Does anybody have any ideas of  about how we can fit all that in together ? 
I mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing , 
what are your thoughts on that ? 
So maybe  do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or  
So something quite curvy ? 
Okay 
um right okay . 
Colour-wise I mean you made a re 
uh was it you 
or uh I can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it , 
was that  
Whose  
about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much . 
Um and when the corporate colour is yellow , 
I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow 
I don't know . Um  
<other> And then obviously the uh the materials  
when it  
has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ? 
That's all . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Right . 
Oh you know like in circular in shape or  
Choice of material yeah . 
'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well  you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , 
and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , 
and it kinda feels  it feels kind of warmer to the touch . 
It feels a bit more comfortable , 
and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber 
into it . 
And then then we could have curved shapes , 
'cause wood or titanium , yeah , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular 
and I think we might be moving away from that you know so um  
<other> Well I'm  
do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or  
no I don't think we do either <laugh> . 
Okay right well um 
so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . 
A snowman shape ? 
Uh-huh . 
That's quite a distinctive shape , 
that would be good 
wouldn't it . 
Yeah 
so yeah should we go with that ? 
Do you wanna draw it on the board ? 
Ooh that'd be good . 
Mm-hmm . 
So call it the snowman-shape trademark <laugh> . 
Yeah that's cool . 
Um and I mean colour-wise what does everybody think ? 
I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . 
I mean do you want the whole thing yellow , 
maybe like yellow and white  
do you want something  
Uh-huh . 
Okay cool . 
Um and also I mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? 
The fact that it talks to you , I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , 
I dunno . 
Or when you like  
or if you turn it off or something  if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere . 
I d I d any thoughts on that at all ? 
<laugh> I know . 
Um unless an a I mean if you  
also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an L_C_D_ display , where would we put that ? 
Would we put that on the inside or  
It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would've thought . 
Yeah . 
Mm oh yeah that's true . 
Yeah . 
So so no need for an L_C_D_ display ? 
I think that would make it very complex . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I don't know if there is really , 
no um  
I would say no need for a talk-back . 
Uh does anybody disagree with that ? 
No ? <laugh> 
Easy <laugh> . 
Okay um right 
so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities , 
um I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , 
is that what you're thinking ? 
Okay . 
Okay 
right um 
what else do you need to talk about ? 
So I'm just gonna um pop this in here 
'cause I have a slide about decision making which I'd forgotten about . 
Oh sh God 
we've got five minutes 
um okay uh 
back we go . 
Um energy what  do you think that's suggesting we're  how we're powering the thing ? 
I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , 
I mean what does anybody think about that ? 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well I suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it , then you're not using any power either . 
So you'd have the battery as the kind of  to keep it ticking over idea  
I'm really sorry 
we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , 
we don't have as much time as I thought . 
Um so I think that's what energy is referring to here . 
Chip on print , is that  that's an industrial design thing , is it David ? 
Okay um as for the case , kind of discussed that  
Yeah 
I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons 
that feel kind of  
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm 'kay . 
<other> 
Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that . 
Aye that would be a good idea . 
S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it . 
Is that what you mean ? 
<other> Okay . 
Lights . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , couldn't you ? 
If you're holding it in your hand you could  
Do you think ? 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Yeah 
okay okay 
um   
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Just  
Okay 
um right well wouldn't it  
we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly . 
Um I'm all for them actually , 
I think they're quite  you know th very quick to m to use . 
So does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all ? 
No . 
And the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? 
Uh-huh . 
Uh-huh 
ooh okay , 
we really gotta wrap up 
so yeah . 
Okay 
well if we can do that , great . 
Yeah okay . 
Yeah 
let's let's try and get the slogan on there 
um , and  
Mm . 
Okay . 
Right I'm gonna have to  
I'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time . 
Um is there anything anybody's unsure about ? 
Just for  in closing just  
the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , 
and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing , 
uh I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that . 
So um <other> 
that'll be that'll be good . 
Um and I'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible . 
Anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to ? 
Is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing ? 
Okay . 
That's kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss , yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
To make something flush with the case ? 
Okay right . 
Okay . 
Sp kinda grippy ? 
Okay . 
Okay 
I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to call this to a close 'cause we're way over time . 
So um that's really good , 
like we've s had much to talk about that um pretty much run out of time to do so . 
So off you go and design stuff 
wooh <laugh> . 
Yeah quite jealous actually .
