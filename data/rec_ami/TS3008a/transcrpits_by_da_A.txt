And then you have to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot . 
It's important to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot over here . 
No . Yeah . Try the power button . 
Huh . 
Yeah , my name is name . 
Yeah ? Everybody's ready ? 
Great . 
Well , welcome to the kick-off meeting . 
I uh forgot to put my name over here , 
it's uh <other> it's Martin . 
Uh , so you all know . 
Well , this is the agenda for today . 
Well , the opening is what I'm doing right now . 
Uh , we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things . 
Uh give some um 
examples of the tool training , project plan discussion and the closing . 
We have twenty five minutes . 
Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control . 
Uh , some of the <other> oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly . 
So now we all know what our 
goal is . 
Um , I  oh forget  I forget the whole acquaintance part , but we we all know each other . 
We all know each other's names . 
Joost , Guido , Antek . 
Okay . I think we uh al already uh been through that part . 
Okay , it consists of uh three levels of design . 
Uh we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . 
Every uh level of design consists of some individual work , and we uh close it with a meeting . 
You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions , 
and uh you p you probably read that already , 
so I don't have to tell you about that . 
Okay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools . 
We have the smart-boards , uh the thes those two boards . 
This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now . 
You can uh um  
there's a document folder called um the sh <other> shared document folder . 
You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , 
so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . 
We also have the white-board . 
Uh , we're gonna skip through th 
No , no . Just on the on the screen over there . 
Oh , no . Probably is , but I don't know if the software is on the laptop  . 
Is is  if 
it's mainly a thing for in the meeting , so I don't think it's  I don't know if it's important . 
This an explanation of the smart-boards . 
There is a tool-bar over here . 
It's quite simple . 
You have the the pen function , eraser function . 
It's like a very simple uh paint application . 
Uh , we  well , 
we use the same file during uh the whole day , 
and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button . 
It works like this . 
Oh . 
<laugh> If pen is selected , yes . 
Oh , no no . 
It's not  But it is pen . 
It's not working like a pen yet . 
Huh . 
Huh . 
It's doing some stuff now . 
So you can use a pen . 
You can use an eraser . 
And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks , 
and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , 
which y you have to select pen format . And then select current colour or line width . 
So , it's quite easy . 
Uh well , now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools . 
Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards . 
Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , 
on blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths . 
Uh , I'll start off then . <laugh> 
I'll use this uh same sheet . 
Alright . 
Oh , let me think . 
Different colours . 
Oh . 
Well , I'm gonna draw um a p piranha . Uh , a fish . 
Uh . 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
I'm gonna use some different colour  now . 
Some  a little white . 
Looks like a fish . 
Think it is . 
Oh . 
Oh . <laugh> 
Uh , colour . 
This is black ? 
I think so . 
Oh . 
Oh , this is just uh <laugh> useless uh drawings but  
Oh teeth . I need teeth . 
<other> 
Well , they're not supposed to be green , or whatever colour this is . 
Okay . 
What was uh  
I have su to sum up its favourite characteris 
Well , I like its uh sharp  razor sharp teeth . 
<laugh> Plus , uh the the big uh forehead and uh a small uh , well a small actual face . 
And I like its overall uh aggressive look and  
Well , that's what I like about uh piranha . 
I think that's kind of what uh the intention should be . 
Well , who wants to be next ? 
You go , Guido ? Okay . 
Uh , make a new sheet . 
Uh , it's by pressing on blank . 
Yep . 
Yep . 
And uh  so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Well , tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh , okay . Okay . 
Okay . 
No , uh it's clear . 
N no <laugh> no . 
We get your point . 
Okay . Who wants to be next ? 
<laugh> 
Oh . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> I'll do so . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> Well , you can have a piranha at home . 
Huh . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I don't think uh I don't think uh Darwin would agree with that . <laugh> 
 . 
Okay . 
<laugh> What do you like about it then ? 
Oh , okay . 
<laugh> Okay . Okay . Okay , 
and then we are uh through the tool training , I guess . 
Okay , this is uh something about the project finance . 
The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros . 
And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros . 
We're very ambitious on this one . <laugh> 
The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , 
and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control . 
So that's clear .   
Yeah ? 
Okay , we're now gonna discuss some stuff when  
well , we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . 
Uh , well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls . 
Do you have uh  know what good experiences with remote controls ? 
Or do they annoy you sometimes ? 
Are they difficult to understand , or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well ? 
Yeah , okay . 
Okay . 
Different functions of of uh  
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um  what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ? 
Uh  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
But uh , the D_V_D_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably . 
It's what , from my experience . 
Okay . 
But we gonna  
Oh , it is only for televis 
So wha what  
What wha <laugh> what uh what document  
But , where where did it uh  Where did you find that ? 
Oh , okay . 
Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well . 
So we can  
No , we have to think about that . 
Okay , uh but uh we've gonna put some a uh is is it so user-friendliness , is a is a pri priority in this case , or  
Okay . 
Well , this the maybe is uh some aspect of the  uh , or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful . 
That w Well , then you're you're the usability uh man , so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then . 
Okay . 
Well , other ideas ? 
How can we make it trendy or something ? 
Do uh by just sh shape and the look of it ? 
Maybe a can opener underneath it ? 
<laugh> I don't know . 
Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh  
Oh , well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably . 
Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or uh  
Well , m has to be something <other> spectacular or uh one which makes it  
We gonna skip back to the goals probably . Uh , 
original , trendly , and user-friendly  
Well , we al also already talked about user-friendliness . 
No , well something trendy and original , 
well that that goes hand in hand I guess . 
When something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably , 
or we should make it combination of that . 
'Kay , so you <other>  
the um technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for , 
so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh , you know , you want to manage with it . 
Well , and that's an important part for you then , with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it . 
Well , and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy . 
<laugh> Well , you know , y like some special feature . 
Or some   Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something . 
Okay . 
Well , the closing . 
Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . 
Individual , I think so . 
The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course , 
we will uh  
Already s said that . 
The User Interface Designer <other> 
 is it a User Inter User Interface  
the technical functions design . 
And the Management Expert of uh  the Marketing Expert . User requirements specifi 
Well , this one was already clear to us . 
Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . 
I don't know how much time we have left . 
Oh , not many I guess . 
We started at twelve . 
Oh , and what does it said ? 
W 
Okay , well um  
No , we're uh ahead of schedule then . 
Yeah , close it . 
I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes . <laugh> 
And uh it's it's clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations . 
You can all  Or we're all uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah , but we're all familiar with uh uh Microsoft PowerPoint , are we ? 
Yeah , okay . 
I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down 
and then we're ready .
