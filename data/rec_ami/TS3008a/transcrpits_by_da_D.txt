<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> I wouldn't call it training , but  
<exhale indicating surprise or annoyance> Alright . 
I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , 
but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever . 
And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions a are removed , or whatever . 
Uh , so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with 
uh grouped buttons , you know . 
All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh  
Well , one area or whatever , 
not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um , yeah , to minimise it to this this <other>  or whatever o o other functions <other> totally somewhere else . 
I think we should group them . 
And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t 
Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders . 
Yeah . 
I don't know . 
Hi-fi set is uh not often used uh as I know of in combination with television . 
<other> Yes . 
Yes , it is only for television , but uh  
Well  
well we we're gonna brainstorm about that . 
If we think it's useful , we do it . 
That's right . It's a television remote control . 
But I was thinking since it is useful with D_V_D_  
Yep . 
Yeah , also no one's gonna buy it . 
I guess . 
Yeah . 
<other> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , way too high . 
Yep . 
Well that's an idea of course , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yes , what the market wishes . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<other>
