C:  Yes . Antek . 
B:  Antek Ahmet . And Joost .  
A:  Okay . I think we uh al already uh been through that part . Okay , it consists of uh three levels of design . Uh we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . Every uh level of design consists of some individual work , and we uh close it with a meeting . You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions , and uh you p you probably read that already , so I don't have to tell you about that .

D:  Yes . 
B:  Yes . 
topic_description:	project specs and roles of participants_None


A:  Okay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools . We have the smart-boards , uh the thes those two boards . This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now . You can uh um  there's a document folder called um the sh <other> shared document folder . You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . We also have the white-board . Uh , we're gonna skip through th 
B:  Can we see the white-board on our laptops ? No , I saw I saw the file , the smart-board that X_B_K_ but  
A:  No , no . Just on the on the screen over there . Oh , no . Probably is , but I don't know if the software is on the laptop  . Is is  if it's mainly a thing for in the meeting , so I don't think it's  I don't know if it's important . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  This an explanation of the smart-boards . There is a tool-bar over here . It's quite simple . You have the the pen function , eraser function . It's like a very simple uh paint application . Uh , we  well , we use the same file during uh the whole day , and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button . It works like this . Oh . <laugh> If pen is selected , yes . Oh , no no . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> With that pen ? 
A:  It's not  But it is pen . It's not working like a pen yet . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  Huh . Huh . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  It's doing some stuff now . So you can use a pen . You can use an eraser . 
B:  Little bit slower . 
A:  And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks , and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which y you have to select pen format . And then select current colour or line width . So , it's quite easy . Uh well , now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools . Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards . Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , on blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths . Uh , I'll start off then . <laugh> I'll use this uh same sheet . Alright . 
B:  <laugh>

topic_description:	drawing exercise_None


A:  Okay , we're now gonna discuss some stuff when  well , we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . Uh , well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls . Do you have uh  know what good experiences with remote controls ? Or do they annoy you sometimes ? Are they difficult to understand , or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well ? 
C:  Yes . 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever . And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions a are removed , or whatever . Uh , so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with 
A:  Yeah , okay . 
B:  Different . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  uh grouped buttons , you know . All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh  
A:  Different functions of of uh  
D:  Well , one area or whatever , not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um , yeah , to minimise it to this this <other>  or whatever o o other functions <other> totally somewhere else . I think we should group them . And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t 
A:  Okay . Yeah . Okay . And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um  what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ? Uh  
D:  Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . But uh , the D_V_D_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably . It's what , from my experience . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  But isn't it  <other> 
D:  I don't know . Hi-fi set is uh not often used uh as I know of in combination with television . 
A:  Okay . But we gonna  
B:  It's only for television , I thought . Not  
D:  <other> Yes . 
A:  Oh , it is only for televis 
B:   I thought it was only for television . So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ . 
D:  Yes , it is only for television , but uh  
A:  So wha what  
D:  Well  
A:  What wha <laugh> what uh what document  
D:  well we we're gonna brainstorm about that . If we think it's useful , we do it . 
A:  But , where where did it uh  Where did you find that ? 
B:  Uh , in the email . I thought it said uh  Yeah , television remote control . 
A:  Oh , okay . 
D:  That's right . It's a television remote control . But I was thinking since it is useful with D_V_D_  
C:  Yes ,   
A:  Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well . So we can  No , we have to think about that . Okay , uh but uh we've gonna put some a uh is is it so user-friendliness , is a is a pri priority in this case , or  
C:  Yes , that's uh something extras . 
B:  True . Yeah . True . 
D:  Yep . Yeah , also no one's gonna buy it . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  I guess . 
C:  Only the experts . <laugh> 
B:  True . 
A:  Well , this the maybe is uh some aspect of the  uh , or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful . That w Well , then you're you're the usability uh man , so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:   
B:  <laugh> Oh my God . 
D:  <other> Yeah . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  Okay . Well , other ideas ? How can we make it trendy or something ? Do uh by just sh shape and the look of it ? 
C:  Uh , to go with to go with fashion and  
A:  Maybe a can opener underneath it ? <laugh> I don't know . Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh  Oh , well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> For the bear . Uh  I I uh , no I think it  
D:  Yeah , way too high . 
B:  Uh , I th I think yo we have to keep it simple , to get a whole market . It's international , so we have to use a standard . 
D:  Yep . Well that's an idea of course , yeah . 
A:  Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or uh  Well , m has to be something <other> spectacular or uh one which makes it  
topic_description:	discussion_None


A:  Okay , this is uh something about the project finance . The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros . And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros . We're very ambitious on this one . <laugh> The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control . So that's clear .   Yeah ? 
B:  <laugh> Okay . 
D:  <exhale indicating surprise or annoyance> Alright . 
topic_description:	project budget_None


A:  We gonna skip back to the goals probably . Uh , 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  original , trendly , and user-friendly  Well , we al also already talked about user-friendliness . No , well something trendy and original , well that that goes hand in hand I guess . When something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably , or we should make it combination of that . 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  <other> Yeah . 
A:  'Kay , so you <other>  the um technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for , so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh , you know , you want to manage with it . Well , and that's an important part for you then , with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it . 
B:  Use friendly . Yep . 
A:  Well , and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy . <laugh> Well , you know , y like some special feature . Or some   Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something . 
D:  Yeah . Yes , what the market wishes . 
A:  Okay .
