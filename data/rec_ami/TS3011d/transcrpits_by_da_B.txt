That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button . 
But uh we don't uh we don't uh  
we do think it's um well  what if with ease of use , w which prefers the  which the the customer of the user prefers . 
<other> Plastic or rubber . 
Well , 
yeah . 
<laugh> 
And a button for disabling the voice recognition . 
Yeah . 
<other> That's the basic idea , yeah . Of our prototype . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
So 
just walk through it step by step . 
I mean , is it fancy , 
everything  I believe uh 
I believe it's fancy . <laugh> 
Oh , 
sorry . 
Twenty two . 
Yikes . 
Why does the price and and the s 
oh , 
one uh exa 
yeah . 
The number of uh  
yeah . 
And and does it  
But that's that's only for the buttons . 
So the button we can use plastic . 
And the pla uh  
And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , too bad . <other> 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Um the yellow rubber , I think so . 
<laugh> I'm into it . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
It's trendy trendy , fun  <other> 
yeah . 
Well , 
just <other> give it a two . 
It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but  
Yeah , 
but that's sti that's uh  
<other> Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't  we don't have the double-curved case . 
We w we do have uh the rubber , 
we do have the colours . 
That's two out of three . 
So I believe uh we are close uh to two . 
<laugh> 
But that's not in it . 
Ov or can we  
Okay . 
<other> And the scroll uh wheel . The solar  
not many remotes have the solar , I think . 
Yeah . 
Well yeah , 
the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . 
Well , 
hard  
it's not for the for the e for the elderly . 
They won't use it . 
I think  I think a three . 
<laugh> Wouldn't give it more . 
Yep . 
<laugh> 
If you make it a four it will be three in general . 
If he makes it a four . Not a three . 
Darn . 
Nee . 
A seven , a three  <other> 
No . 
A four and a three together . 
Yeah , 
you have a two , he has a two . Three ? 
And a three ? 
Nee . I know . 
Yes . 
So if you want to have the conclusion as a three  three . Then you would make a four . 
If you fill out a four  <other> <laugh> 
Yeah , 
we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , 
but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . 
Yeah , 
but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh  
But even without it  
Yeah . 
Me too . 
Was it one of our options ? 
So , in the in  
Yeah . 
<laugh> But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . 
<laugh> <other> I wan 
I'll take one . 
It will be a one . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Yeah , 
but <other> it ha doesn't has the digits . 
I believe it's  
If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is  it has all the features um a normal remote has . 
Yeah . 
I'll give a two . 
<laugh> <laugh> 
But we could  couldn't uh  what 
what's the selling price ? 
Fifty ? 
Uh twenty five . 
And costs were twelve fifty . 
But even now , if only our production costs w <other> uh were exceeded the double , 
Think . Production cost was  were t uh was twenty two ? 
So uh  
selling price uh would be uh  
yeah . 
That's price , but w w 
No . 
An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh  
Yeah , 
I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders . 
Four six seven eight . 
Nine divided by six . 
<laugh> 
Hmm . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
I think uh  
<laugh> The process was good . 
But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs . 
And and that was the the big deal . 
I if we knew that before , we c we could have made 
the the choice between  what  
yeah . 
No , no . 
Fantastic . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Response 
and  
Uh it it has  
yeah . Yeah , it's not accurate . 
The p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes 
its  um uh where it uh  
Yeah , where it draws . 
It's uh  
the drawing on on the b on the board is  r right from the pen . 
So uh  <other> 
You to take in account that your  you m 
yeah uh  
It's too slow  
Hmm . 
Yep . 
If it has O_C_R_ <other> , uh I think uh I would use , 
but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it . 
It w it w 
yeah . 
It was necessary for me to uh  
Yeah , 
because if I want something on the computer , I just type it . 
I type faster than I write . 
So  
Economic . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
But y you can  
if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder . 
So it's almost  
yeah . 
Yep . 
Mm-hmm .  . 
A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object . 
I it's not possible  
yeah . 
Oh it looks like paint actually . 
Great . <laugh> 
It was a privilege working with you . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
To private rooms ? <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
But you see the problem , 
y you can't continue your uh your line . 
Well ,
