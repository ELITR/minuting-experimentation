B:  That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button . But uh we don't uh we don't uh  we do think it's um well  what if with ease of use , w which prefers the  which the the customer of the user prefers . 
C:  Like this one . It's important . Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve . Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . But other users who are new to this device need something like that . They n they need to understand what  uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , so it's easier for them 
A:  Okay . Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ? 
C:  Yeah , maybe so . Yes , it's  
A:  A a and the voice recognition as well , th maybe you could uh could uh  
C:  Well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um  . <laugh> There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device . It's it's quite easy . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . Okay . Okay , good . And and the case is is rubber ? 
C:  Yes , rubber ? 
A:  And the buttons ? 
B:  <other> Plastic or rubber . Well , yeah . 
C:  <other> There are plastic or rubber . 
A:  Okay , and uh the colouring ? 
C:  Uh yellow with uh 
A:   with with grey or black . 
C:  grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Okay , we'll we'll come to that later . Um 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  okay . Anything else to add or  
C:  No . <other> Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons . <other> But  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , 'cause you have to assign two channel  new channels . 
C:  Yes , but it  but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think . Or not ? 
A:  M uh yeah . M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . 
D:  You  
C:  Well okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that . 
B:  And a button for disabling the voice recognition . 
A:  Yeah al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it  you'd disable it with a little beep and and  but o okay , that that's not really really important . 
C:  Yes . 
B:  Yeah . <other> That's the basic idea , yeah . 
C:  <other> 
A:  The basic  okay . 
B:  Of our prototype . 
A:  Okay .

A:  Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ? 
D:  Yes . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Uh my name is not name but  
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> You are nameless . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh well , I used the   the uh  documents . And these uh were the most important criteria . 
C:  <laugh> Is it spongy ? <laugh> 
D:  It should be .   <laugh> yeah , that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . Fancy look and feel . So  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> So just walk through it step by step . I mean , is it fancy , everything  I believe uh 
D:  Uh well appar 
B:  I believe it's fancy . <laugh> 
C:  I believe it's fancy too . 
D:  Yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet . So  
A:  No . 
B:  Oh , sorry . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Okay , so this  these are the cr uh the criteria . 
D:  Yeah , I think these are the most important criteria . 
A:  Okay , well  
D:  So uh that's about it .

A:  the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um  The production costs . The costs are not under  Can I  <sound indicating frustration> Um this is the  
B:  Twenty two . 
A:  Yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty . And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . So I guess we should skip that , because it's not that important . 
B:  Yikes . 
C:  Well it's very expensive . Okay . 
B:  Why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa yeah . 
A:  Yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum . Um well , this is what I would call our luxury model . Um if you would  if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um 
B:  The number of uh  yeah . 
C:  <other> Okay . 
B:  And and does it  
A:  <other> to make it <other> just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I did the following changes . Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature , because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price . Um  
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah , I believe  Uh , push-button , well  <other> It makes it the thirteen  yeah . Push-buttons are  buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost . So um  yeah , th this design is not um 
C:  Hmm . 
A:  within our price model . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Um  
C:  But I'm afraid it's not complete . Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . And you have not added one item there . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  So it's c way too expensive . 
A:  It's still too expensive , yeah . Um  
B:  But that's that's only for the buttons . So the button we can use plastic . 
A:  I I guess if we leave the  if we leave this one out , um  oh . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  And uh maybe not use the special form . 
B:  And the pla uh  And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber . 
C:  But it  
A:  <other> It becomes a very dull remote control , I know . But it's the board decision . Um  
C:  Yes . 
A:  And um  yeah . 
C:  Well , b basically it <other>  when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions . So  
A:  Yeah . Yeah , I know . Maybe we should look at an  uh focus on another uh  
C:  Type of m maybe another market segment . 
A:  Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic and uh m maximise the profits and um  
C:  Yeah . Yes . That's  maybe that's better . <cough> Maybe we could uh  we should go for straight and simple , but that's not what uh has been asked . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . I know , I know . 
C:  So we should kick the board's uh <laugh>  Well  
A:  <laugh> Yeah . Although I think we  yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already . Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . 
C:  Hmm . Yes . 
A:  Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no . 
C:  <other> 
A:  <other> It's not that innovative . Or however you s pronounce that . Um so , okay . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <cough> 
B:  Yeah , too bad . <other> 
A:  <other> Um  Oh , this is the wrong one . So uh that means redesign . 
topic_description:	None


A:  <other> We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product . Um <other> but we can evaluate the process and um uh 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  uh the satisfaction on how things went . Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . I guess  
D:  Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <cough> 
A:  Yeah , that's true . 
C:  Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . So  
A:  We l we can learn . Yeah . Yeah . I agree . Well

C:  So  
A:  Yeah . 
C:  After all , I think  personally I would give a two . But  
A:  Um  Okay . Uh Roo , a three ? Ruud ? 
B:  Yep . 
D:  Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two . 
A:  Okay . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  So I could make it e easy ? 
B:  If you make it a four it will be three in general . 
C:  So that's w No , two and a half . 
B:  If he makes it a four . 
C:  Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . 
B:  Not a three . 
C:  So  
B:  Darn . Nee . 
D:  Hmm ? Huh ? 
C:  Yes . <laugh> 
A:  Roo . <laugh> 
B:  A seven , a three  <other> No . A four and a three together . Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ? And a three ? Nee . I know . 
D:  Yeah . I yeah  . 
C:  <laugh> Four ? 
D:  Yeah , two , two , three  
C:  Two ? 
A:  No , I haven't said anything yet . 
D:  No . <laugh> 
A:  Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . 
C:  Divided by four . 
B:  Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three  three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four  <other> <laugh> 
C:  That's not even  
A:  But I'm filling in a three . Does it  will  so it will be a two point five . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  But that's not possible to fill in , so we have to round it . <laugh> 
A:  Yes , it is . <laugh> I have a veto . <laugh> Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about  okay , um is it easy to f 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yes . I I've  I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . So  
B:  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . So high quality , low acceptance . 
C:  Hmm . 
A:  The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . But 
C:  Yes . 
A:  <other> whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is  well , is not sure . D do you agree ? 
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yes , I agree . I  
D:  Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . Maybe we should have a radar uh <laugh> function . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , okay . But  <laugh> Yes . 
B:  But we could  couldn't uh  what what's the selling price ? Fifty ? Uh twenty five . 
A:  Twenty five Euros . 
B:  And costs were twelve fifty . But even now , if only our production costs w <other> uh were exceeded the double , 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Think . Production cost was  were t uh was twenty two ? 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  So uh  selling price uh would be uh  yeah . 
C:  M about fifty Euros . That's quite ex well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality . 
B:  That's price , but w w No . An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh  
C:  Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . It's quite expensive , yes . 
B:  Yeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders . 
A:  Bu but  well  yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros . 
C:  Yes . Yes , but you can you c Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions . And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition and this one does . So I think it's worth its price . 
A:  Yeah .  . Yeah . Okay . Um you had an overall rating . Um  
D:  Yeah , but uh <laugh> with these ratings uh 
A:  That's counting . 
C:  Well , it's it's about one point five . Something like that . 
D:  should be about one point s seven , yeah . 
B:  Four six seven eight . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Nine divided by six .

C:  Is it fancy ? <other> 
A:  I d it is it is  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yay . Is it ? Is it fancy ? 
A:  Yeah , I think so . 
B:  Um the yellow rubber , I think so . 
C:  I think so . 
A:  <other> You like the rubber , uh Roo . 
B:  <laugh> I'm into it . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  So uh one ? 
C:  But it's not that fancy . 
A:  Yeah . No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two . 
C:  I mean I think uh  I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing  the casing . It would be even more  oh , you really like titanium . I'm I'm into it . <laugh> 
A:  You like tita <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  That's a flavour as well . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  It has flavour . Yes , that's right . <laugh> You should taste it . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Right . Um  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Is it uh  
A:  Yeah , I know , but but it  but that's fancy in the way um  <other> I mean fancy has has a lot of  
C:  It has to do with fashion , I guess . So do  
A:  Yeah . 
B:  It's trendy trendy , fun  <other> yeah . 
D:  And w yeah , w what they want  wanted was uh colours and soft materials . So in that way  
A:  Yeah . It applies . It  yeah . 
D:  It  it's fancy . 
B:  Well , just <other> give it a two . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yes . I think I th I think it would have been  I would have think  uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . So  
B:  It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but  Yeah , but that's sti that's uh  <other> Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't  we don't have the double-curved case . We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . That's two out of three . 
C:  Yes . 
B:  So I believe uh we are close uh to two . 
A:  Yeah , I I agree . 
C:  Yes , I agree too . It's okay . We did   yes , we did good .

D:  Okay , and uh was it innovative ? 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Well , with the voice recognition feature and uh  
B:  But that's not in it . Ov or can we  
D:  Yep . 
A:  No , we are evaluating this this uh design now . 
C:  Well , let's let's  this product . 
B:  Okay . 
C:  So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative . 
A:  This prototype . Yeah . 
B:  <other> And the scroll uh wheel . The solar  not many remotes have the solar , I think . 
C:  No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too  yes , but  
D:  Yeah , and uh  
A:  That would have been a thrill . 
D:  So uh also a uh two ? 
C:  I think uh it's a two . 
A:  Yep .

D:  Is it easy to use ? 
A:  I'm not sure . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  I'm not sure . 
B:  Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard  it's not for the for the e for the elderly . 
C:  <other> Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . 
B:  They won't use it . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  So in that in that way it is advanced , 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . So uh  
B:  I think  
C:  It's maybe  it's not very uh easy for  
B:  I think a three . <laugh> Wouldn't give it more . 
A:  Uh I'm doubting  doubting as well . Um  
D:  Well the p the most important function is easy to use . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . 
A:  Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ? 
C:  Okay . Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I   I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  because he is already  he or she is already an advanced user .

D:  Is it easy to find ? <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , definitely . 
C:  Yes . 
B:  Yeah , we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . 
C:  It it most definitely is  it's very easy . 
A:  Yeah , or beeps or  yeah . 
B:  Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh  
C:  Yes . Maybe  Uh I I think I think  something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . So , I th 
A:  I'm here , I'm here . <laugh> Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  But even without it  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Well , I uh  we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . Um Sebastian ? 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <cough> Yeah , me too . 
B:  Me too . 
D:  Yeah , I agree .

A:  Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh it can't be more spongy . So  <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is  um can be  uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . No , it's not one of our option , but when you look in the market , when you look  
B:  Was it one of our options ? 
D:  No . Uh this this was a most spongy option . <laugh> 
A:  No okay , but but 
B:  So , in the in  
A:  for the options given , it's the most spongy one . 
C:  Uh yes , but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics  characteristics with uh market  uh with with the real market . So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . <laugh> Yes , but it's not good enough , so it's a two . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . <laugh> They're out there . <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> I'll give it a one . 
B:  <laugh> <other> I wan I'll take one . 
C:  You take one ? What do you give it ? 
D:  Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could  but  yeah . 
A:  Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . <other> Because we need to go on  in  for the time . 
D:  Well , if I give it a one 
B:  It will be a one . <laugh> 
D:  there'll be one hell of a calculation . So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five . 
C:  No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> You are  okay . The remote control offers enough features . Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ? 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> <other> 
D:  Well , the basic layout doesn't offem  offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So  
C:  <other> Basically it's it's completely programmable . You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . 
D:  Yeah , depends . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah , I know . What what we didn't talk about is um uh  
C:  So it's quite advanced . 
B:  Yeah , but <other> it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's  If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is  it has all the features um a normal remote has . 
A:  I think it has . 
D:  Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat 
A:  Yeah . Bec because you can um  we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So , you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um   the the signals . So you could uh uh uh 
C:  Yes . Has uh the signals sent to it . 
D:  Signal . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  enter any comment you like , as long it's able to  as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features . Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced . 
C:  Absolutely . Yes . But that  that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons . So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple . You can use your voice to to programme it . It's  
A:  Yeah . Yeah . Yep . Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the  for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one . 
B:  I'll give a two . 
C:  <other> Yeah , I'll give it a one . 
D:  Um I think think a one , 'cause  v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um

A:  Okay . Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product . Um  What did you think about uh the process , the project process ? Ruud ? 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <cough> 
D:  <sound indicating surprise or displeasure> 
A:  <laugh> Try to translate that . <laugh> 
C:  Well  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Hmm . <laugh> 
A:  Any any other  Uh , Roo ? 
C:  Well , I think  
B:  Yeah , I think uh  
D:  Ye 
A:  <laugh> Roo . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> The process was good . But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs . And and that was the the big deal . I if we knew that before , we c we could have made the the choice between  what  yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm . Actually , we had  
A:  Better decision . 
C:  Yes . We had we had too little information actually . So  And uh um the the the  well , looking at room for creativity , there was 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  w way too  the the choice of components was way too narrow . So there was not really a process of uh  
A:  Less . Yeah . So we could we we could be  we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price . 
C:  Well  Yes . 
D:  The prices . 
C:  Well , in the first meeting we we already were very creative . We we thought of possibilities <cough> who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components . So  
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  We're tempered by that , yes . 
A:  Okay , Roo ? Any other thoughts on that ? 
B:  No , no . 
A:  Ruud ? 
D:  I agree . 
A:  You agree , okay . Uh leadership . <laugh> Okay , Roo's on for his promotion . <laugh> 
B:  Fantastic . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah ,  okay . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  I think we're a good team . 
A:  I think so too , it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment . I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey Roo uh  . <laugh> Um  
C:  Yes . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Well , I tried once , but that was not allowed . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> So um  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , but but si uh w w w   when taken in account the the situation , uh I think we performed pretty well . 
C:  I think so too . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Um the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ? 
C:  <other> Uh . The digital pen was okay , but SMARTboard was really bad . It  it's  
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Because of the response or  
C:  The response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited . It's not accurate . 
B:  Response and  
A:  Okay . 
B:  Uh it it has  yeah . Yeah , it's not accurate . The p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its  um uh where it uh  
A:  Uh  
D:  Draws . 
B:  Yeah , where it draws . It's uh  the drawing on on the b on the board is  r right from the pen . 
A:  Okay , so it it had to be um 
B:  So uh  <other> You to take in account that your  you m yeah uh  
A:  better aligned , or what's the word ? Uh yeah . 
C:  Maybe it's  it needs to be calibrateds . 
B:  It's too slow  
A:  It it was calibrated just before this meeting . Uh the one before , the third meeting . So uh it's not the calibration , it's the thing itself , I think . Uh Ruud , w uh did you use the pen a lot ? Or not at all ? Not at all . 
C:  It is ? Okay . 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  Okay . 
D:  No . Not really . 
A:  Okay . I thought it was quite a handy uh thing , although I would like to see um O_C_R_ . 
C:  I I think so too . Yes . 
B:  Yep . 
C:  Yes . 
B:  If it has O_C_R_ <other> , uh I think uh I would use , but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it . It w it w yeah . It was necessary for me to uh  
A:  Yeah . To digitise them . 
B:  Yeah , because if I want something on the computer , I just type it . I type faster than I write . So  
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information . Because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy  it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way . I think it's a good product . I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big . It's not quite uh ergonomic . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Economic . 
C:  Eco ergonomic . 
A:  I know . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Okay . Um  What w Uh Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ? 
D:  Oh , I only use it to draw a rabbit , so  <laugh> can't say much about it . 
A:  Yeah . Okay , you can't really decide . No . I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops . I think that would be very easy if you could say okay , I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yes . 
D:  No , or the other way around . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Or the other way around , that you could show  but m 
C:  Yes , yes . That's quite what PowerPoint does . 
B:  But y you can  if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder . So it's almost  yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  I know . I know , but  I know , but we couldn't use that feature , so I missed it . 
B:  Yep . 
A:  We weren't able to do that . At least the  um I wasn't explained how to do such a th 
B:  Mm-hmm .  . A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object . 
C:  An object , yes . Yes . The drawing cap capabilities are very limited . 
B:  I it's not possible  yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  And and uh w you were  when you're using uh Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , uh which you can use for drawing . And a lot of these buttons don't appear here . So it's  
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh it looks like paint actually . 
A:  Okay , so y it  it's not even as advanced as paint . 
C:  Not not uh n not  way . <laugh> It's quite uh limited . 
A:  Yeah . Okay . Uh no . <laugh> Yeah , the project is evaluated . Um but , well , we need to redesign uh the product . 
C:  <laugh>
