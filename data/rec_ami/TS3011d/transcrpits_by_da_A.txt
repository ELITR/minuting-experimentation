Okay . 
Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ? 
A a and the voice recognition as well , 
th maybe you could uh could uh  
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay . Okay , 
good . 
And and the case is is rubber ? 
And the buttons ? 
Okay , 
and uh the colouring ? 
 with with grey or black . 
<laugh> Okay , 
we'll we'll come to that later . Um 
okay . 
Anything else to add 
or  
Yeah . 
M uh 
yeah . 
M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . 
Yeah 
al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it  you'd disable it with a little beep and and  
but o okay , 
that that's not really really important . 
The basic  
okay . 
Okay . Um 
you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> You are nameless . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
No . 
Okay , so 
this  
these are the cr uh the criteria . 
Okay , well  
the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um  
The production costs . 
The costs are not under  Can I  <sound indicating frustration> Um this is the  
Yeah , 
it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty . 
And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . 
So I guess we should skip that , 
because it's not that important . 
Yeah , 
the the price , the the number of items and the the sum . 
Um well , 
this is what I would call our luxury model . 
Um 
if you would  
if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um <other> to make it <other> just between the twelve Euro fifty , 
um then I did the following changes . 
Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , 
um by not using the voice recognition feature , 
because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price . 
Um  Yeah , 
I believe  
Uh , push-button , 
well  <other> 
It makes it the thirteen  
yeah . 
Push-buttons are  buttons are are not the most expensive , 
but do add extra cost . 
So um  yeah , 
th this design is not um within our price model . 
Um  
Yeah . 
It's still too expensive , yeah . Um  
I I guess if we leave the  if we leave this one out , um  
oh . <laugh> 
And uh maybe not use the special form . 
<other> It becomes a very dull remote control , I know . 
But it's the board decision . 
Um  And um  
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , I know . 
Maybe we should look at an  uh focus on another uh  
Yeah , 
m 
uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic 
and uh m maximise the profits 
and um  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I know , I know . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Although I think we  yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people 
Um so 
it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . 
uh by giving it another colour already . 
Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no . 
<other> It's not that innovative . 
Or however you s pronounce that . 
Um so , okay . <other> Um  Oh , 
this is the wrong one . 
So uh 
that means redesign . 
<other> We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product . 
Um <other> but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . 
Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . 
I guess  
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah , that's true . 
We l we can learn . 
Yeah . Yeah . I agree . 
Well  
I d 
it is it is  <laugh> 
Yeah , I think so . 
<other> You like the rubber , uh Roo . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
No , 
I'll I'll I'll give it a two . 
You like tita <laugh> 
That's a flavour as well . 
<laugh> Right . Um  
Yeah , I know , 
but but it  
but that's fancy in the way um  <other> I mean fancy has has a lot of  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
It applies . 
It  
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , I I agree . 
Well , 
with the voice recognition feature 
and uh  
No , 
we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype . 
Yeah . 
That would have been a thrill . 
Yep . 
I'm not sure . <laugh> I'm not sure . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh I'm doubting  doubting as well . Um  
Okay . Uh 
two 
or three ? Three ? 
Wha wh what would be your guess ? 
I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . 
It's the uh it's it's overall . 
Is the device easy to use ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Um  Okay . 
Uh Roo , a three ? 
Ruud ? 
Okay . <laugh> 
So 
I could make it e easy ? 
Roo . <laugh> 
No , 
I haven't said anything yet . 
Okay , 
but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . 
But I'm filling in a three . 
Does it  will  
so it will be a two point five . 
Yes , it is . 
<laugh> I have a veto . <laugh> 
Exactly . 
It's not about the content , 
it's about  
okay , um 
is it easy to f 
Yeah , definitely . 
Yeah , 
or beeps 
or  
yeah . 
I'm here , I'm here . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well , I uh  
we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , 
but I personally give it a one . 
Um Sebastian ? 
Right , well . 
The feel of the remote control is spongy . 
Well , uh 
it can't be more spongy . 
So  <other> 
No okay , 
but but 
for the options given , it's the most spongy one . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
<laugh> They're out there . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> I'll give it a one . 
Yeah , I know , 
but you have to name a fig uh a number . <other> 
Because we need to go on  in  for the time . 
<laugh> You are  
okay . 
The remote control offers enough features . 
Well , 
Ruud , what what do you think about it ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah , I know . 
What what we didn't talk about is um uh  
I think it has . 
Yeah . 
Bec because you can um  
we didn't talk about it , 
but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . 
So , 
you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um   the the signals . 
So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to  as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . 
So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features . 
Although there are i a few buttons , 
but the inside is is quite uh advanced . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Yeah . 
Okay , um 
let's give it a number . 
I'll give it uh a one . For for the  for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one . 
Yeah . 
So high quality , low acceptance . 
The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . 
But <other> whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is  well , is not sure . 
D do you agree ? 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Maybe we should have a radar uh <laugh> function . <laugh> 
Twenty five Euros . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Bu but  well  
yeah , I know , 
but you're paying for th for the brand , 
because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros . 
Yeah . 
 . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Um you had an overall rating . Um  
That's counting . 
Okay . 
Okay . Um 
we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product . 
Um  What did you think about uh the process , the project process ? 
Ruud ? 
<laugh> Try to translate that . <laugh> 
Any any other  
Uh , Roo ? 
<laugh> Roo . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Better decision . 
Yeah . 
Less . 
Yeah . 
So we could we we could be  we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay , 
Roo ? Any other thoughts on that ? 
Ruud ? 
You agree , okay . 
Uh leadership . 
<laugh> Okay , Roo's on for his promotion . <laugh> 
Okay . 
I think so too , 
it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment . 
I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey Roo uh  . <laugh> Um  
Yeah . <laugh> So um  
Yeah , 
but but si uh w w w   
when taken in account the the situation , uh I think we performed pretty well . 
Yeah . Um 
the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ? 
Because of the response 
or  
Okay . 
Uh  
Okay , so 
it it had to be um better aligned , or what's the word ? 
Uh yeah . 
It it was calibrated just before this meeting . Uh the one before , the third meeting . 
So uh it's not the calibration , 
it's the thing itself , I think . 
Uh Ruud , w uh did you use the pen a lot ? 
Or not at all ? 
Not at all . 
Okay . 
I thought it was quite a handy uh thing , 
although I would like to see um O_C_R_ . 
Yeah . 
To digitise them . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I know . 
Yeah . Okay . Um  
What w 
Uh Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ? 
Yeah . Okay , you can't really decide . No . 
I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops . 
I think that would be very easy if you could say okay , I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on 
or  
Or the other way around , 
that you could show  but m 
I know . 
I know , 
but  
I know , 
but we couldn't use that feature , 
so I missed it . 
We weren't able to do that . 
At least the  um I wasn't explained how to do such a th 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay , so 
y it  
it's not even as advanced as paint . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Uh no . <laugh> 
Yeah , the project is evaluated . 
Um but , well , 
we need to redesign uh the product . 
Celebrate 
Okay . <laugh> Um 
you're dismissed . <laugh> 
No , I think we are uh ready . 
Private room , Roo . 
That sounds quite scary . 
No , let's find uh the way to  . <laugh>  . 
I don't believe so . 
Well , 
maybe we'd  get an email . Thank you for your  
Forty minutes . 
A minute or or ten maybe . 
M 
Yeah , 
ten or five . 
So , 
we can uh redesign our uh  Uh I would like to  
Oh . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
It's blue tongue . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
This is a new model . 
But  <laugh> 
Blue tongue . <laugh> 
<laugh> It's spongy . <laugh> 
 . <laugh> That is uh  it's a new feature next to Bluetooth to um disable all Bluetooth devices . Um  
Yeah , 
we're done here . 
Gentlemen , thank you for your cooperation . 
<laugh> 
 
Yes .
