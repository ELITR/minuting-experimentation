Like this one . 
It's important . 
Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve . 
Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . 
And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , 
and then they will not use this dial as often . 
But other users who are new to this device need something like that . 
They n they need to understand what  uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , 
so it's easier for them 
Yeah , maybe so . Yes , 
it's  
Well , 
it's it's it's another approach , 
it's more that our um  . <laugh> 
There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device . 
It's it's quite easy . 
Yes , rubber ? 
<other> There are plastic or rubber . 
Uh yellow with uh 
grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
No . <other> 
Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons . 
<other> But  
Yes , 
but it  
but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think . 
Or not ? 
Well 
okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that . 
Yes . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Is it spongy ? <laugh> 
I believe it's fancy too . 
Okay . 
Well 
it's very expensive . 
Okay . 
<other> Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
Okay . 
But I'm afraid it's not complete . 
Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . 
And you have not added one item there . 
So it's c way too expensive . 
<laugh> 
But it  
Yes . 
Well , b basically 
it <other>  
when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , 
because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions . 
So  
Type of m maybe another market segment . 
Yeah . 
Yes . 
That's  maybe that's better . <cough> 
Maybe we could uh  we should go for straight and simple , 
but that's not what uh has been asked . 
So 
we should kick the board's 
uh <laugh>  Well  
Hmm . 
Yes . 
<other> 
<cough> 
<cough> 
Well , 
maybe it's good to do it anyway , 
because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . 
So  
Is it fancy ? <other> 
<laugh> 
I think so . 
<laugh> 
But it's not that fancy . 
I mean 
I think uh  I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing  the casing . 
It would be even more  
oh , you really like titanium . I'm I'm into it . <laugh> 
It has flavour . Yes , that's right . <laugh> You should taste it . <laugh> 
It has to do with fashion , I guess . 
So 
do  
Okay . 
Yes . 
I think I th I think it would have been  I would have think  uh 
it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , 
but we decided not to , 
because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . 
So  
Yes . 
Yes , I agree too . It's okay . 
We did   
yes , 
we did good . 
Well , 
let's let's  this product . 
So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative . 
No . 
It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , 
but it's it's way too  
yes , 
but  
I think uh it's a two . 
<laugh> 
<other> Well , 
but there are two parts in this remote control . 
What you see here is is the basic part . 
Everybody can use it , 
so that's easy to use . 
That's for a novice user . 
When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . 
So in that in that way it is advanced , 
and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . 
So uh  
It's maybe  it's not very uh easy for  
Okay . 
Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , 
but I   I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , 
because he is already  he or she is already an advanced user . 
So  
After all , I think  personally I would give a two . 
But  
So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . 
So that's ten . 
So that's w 
No , 
two and a half . 
Six and four . Six and four is ten . 
Divided by four is two and a half . 
So  
Yes . <laugh> 
<laugh> Four ? 
Two ? 
Divided by four . 
That's not even  
But that's not possible to fill in , 
so we have to round it . <laugh> 
Yes . 
It it most definitely is  it's very easy . 
Yes . 
Maybe  
Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . 
Uh I I think I think  
something like that . 
So , 
I th 
<cough> Yeah , me too . 
Well , 
it can be . 
There are cases um in which the outside casing is  um can be  uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . 
No , it's not one of our option , 
Uh yes , 
but when you look in the market , when you look  
but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . 
Because we compare all these uh characteristics  characteristics with uh market  uh with with the real market . 
there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . <laugh> 
So 
Yes , but it's not good enough , 
so it's a two . 
You take one ? 
What do you give it ? 
Uh I'll I'll change it , 
No no no . 
I'll make it m 
my my mark will be a four . <laugh> 
<other> Basically it's it's completely programmable . 
You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . 
So it's quite advanced . 
Yes . 
Has uh the signals sent to it . 
Absolutely . 
Yes . 
But that  that's its power , I guess , 
because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons . 
So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . 
And this is quite s simple . 
You can use your voice to to programme it . 
It's  
<other> Yeah , I'll give it a one . 
Yes . 
I I've  I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . 
So  
Hmm . 
Yes . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yes , I agree . I  
Yeah , okay . 
But  
<laugh> Yes . 
M about fifty Euros . 
That's quite ex 
well , 
it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality . 
Yes , 
it's more than fifty Euros . 
It's quite expensive , yes . 
Yes . Yes , 
but you can you c 
Yes , 
but you can learn this thing , all these functions . 
And it's easier to use 
because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition 
and this one does . 
So I think it's worth its price . 
Well , 
it's it's about one point five . Something like that . 
<cough> 
Well  <laugh> 
Well , 
I think  
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Actually , 
we had  
Yes . 
We had we had too little information actually . 
So  And uh um 
the the the  
well , 
looking at room for creativity , there was w way too  the the choice of components was way too narrow . 
So there was not really a process of uh  
Well  
Yes . 
Well , 
in the first meeting we we already were very creative . 
We we thought of possibilities <cough> who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components . 
So  
We're tempered by that , yes . 
<laugh> 
Yeah ,  okay . 
I think we're a good team . 
Yes . 
<laugh> 
Well , 
I tried once , 
but that was not allowed . <laugh> 
I think so too . 
<other> Uh . The digital pen was okay , 
but SMARTboard was really bad . 
It  it's  
The response is very slow 
and the possibilities are very limited . 
It's not accurate . 
Maybe it's  it needs to be calibrateds . 
It is ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
I I think so too . 
Yes . Yes . 
Mm-hmm . 
But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information . 
Because you have everything in one place 
and it's quite easy quite easy  
it's it's possible to make this information digital 
and share it with others in a quite easy way . 
I think it's a good product . 
I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big . 
It's not quite uh ergonomic . Eco ergonomic . 
Yes . 
Yes , yes . 
That's quite what PowerPoint does . 
An object , yes . Yes . 
The drawing cap capabilities are very limited . 
And and uh w you were  when you're using uh Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , uh which you can use for drawing . 
And a lot of these buttons don't appear here . 
So it's  
Not not uh n not  way . 
<laugh> It's quite uh limited . 
<laugh> 
Okay . Oh , 
very good , 
celebration . 
Pop uh pop up the champagne . <laugh> 
Okay . 
I see some action over there . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
 uh we're done , we're finished ,  I believe . 
So , 
are there any more cycles in this process ? 
I think not . 
But um how much time did we get for this meeting ? 
And how much time is left ? 
Ten minutes . 
Okay . Okay . 
<cough> Well , 
I think we we we all know what the redesign should be . 
A simple , dull , uh one-coloured box . 
No , 
it's it's just the same product that is already on the market . 
What is that ? 
It's a giraffe eating a  eating leaves from a tree . 
So you're actually promoting Bluetooth . Or blue tongue . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Blue tongue . 
Okay . 
Let's wrap it up . 
<cough> 
Thank you Mister manager . <laugh> 
Now , <other> let's have uh a bottle of champagne . 
 .
