Well , 
you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , 
'cause you have to assign two channel  new channels . 
You  
Yes . 
Uh my name is not name 
but  
Uh well , 
I used the   the uh  documents . 
And these uh were the most important criteria . 
It should be .   <laugh> 
yeah , 
that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . 
Fancy look and feel . 
So  
Uh well 
appar 
Yeah , 
but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet . 
So  
Yeah , 
I think these are the most important criteria . 
So uh 
that's about it . 
Um well , 
since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway  <laugh> 
Uh  
Yay . 
Is it ? Is it fancy ? 
<laugh> 
So uh 
one ? 
<laugh> 
Is it uh  
And w 
yeah , 
w what they want  wanted was uh colours and soft materials . 
So in that way  It  it's fancy . 
Okay , and uh 
was it innovative ? 
<laugh> 
Yep . 
Yeah , and uh  
So uh 
also a uh two ? 
Is it easy to use ? 
<laugh> 
Well 
the p 
the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . 
But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . 
Good question . 
Uh I'll go uh for the two . 
<laugh> 
Hmm ? Huh ? 
Yeah . I yeah  . 
Yeah , 
two , two , three  
No . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Is it easy to find ? <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , I agree . 
<laugh> 
No . Uh 
this this was a most spongy option . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well yeah , 
it depends , 
'cause it's the most spongy we could  
but  
yeah . 
Well , 
if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation . 
So I'll just give it a two 
and make this a one point five . 
<laugh> 
Well , 
the basic layout doesn't offem  offer much , 
but the voice recognition could add a lot . 
So  
Yeah , 
depends . 
Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat 
Signal . 
Um I think think a one , 
'cause  v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , 
so that's like um  
Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
but uh <laugh> with these ratings uh 
should be about one point s seven , 
yeah . 
<laugh> 
<sound indicating surprise or displeasure> 
<laugh> 
Ye 
The prices . 
I agree . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Draws . 
No . 
Not really . 
Oh , 
I only use it to draw a rabbit , 
so  <laugh> can't say much about it . 
No , 
or the other way around . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
And no added value . At all . 
So  
In interesting design . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Oh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling . 
So  
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
 .
