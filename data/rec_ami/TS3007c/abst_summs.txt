A:  Welcome to the conceptual design meeting 
A:  Uh uh , also this time there will be uh three presentations . 
A:  And we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts . 
A:  Um uh , and at the end , uh I uh , when I finish it off I have some uh input from uh a master class I uh <laugh> visited . <laugh>  information . <laugh> 
A:  I will take notes 
A:  uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder .

abst_sum - abstract: The project manager went over the agenda.

C:  I'll be talking about the components . 
C:  Uh , what I did was I reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups . 
C:  Uh below forty five and above . 
C:  <other> senior citizens uh  <laugh> 
C:  They , well , they like more the  they like the traditional materials , like wood and and such more . 
C:  And uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes . 
C:  where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more uh soft materials . 
C:  Uh uh , soft and fluffy and colourful and  
C:  But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic . 
C:  Or you can go for both ? 
C:  But uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light . 
C:  Uh , and you you could you could use normal light , but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something . 
C:  I I prefer kinetic because it's uh  well , the costs aren't that much higher , and um , ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery . 
C:  But , what l what Jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . 
C:  Or but but you could go in a in an double curves . And that's  like several different dimensions . 
C:  Yeah , that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look , I f I figured . 
C:  Yeah you could  y It leaves more space for creativity . 
C:  I I ch prefer rubber because it feels uh  Yeah . 
C:  Well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_ . 
C:  Uh ,  you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . 
A:  I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too . 
D:  but if you have a square uh L_C_D_ screen , and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen . 
D:  That's  it's custom customisable and  
C:  uh so what are the opinions ? Uh rubber or plastic ?

D:  I went to uh Paris and Milan for some trend-watching . 
D:  In Paris and Milan , we uh asked different people , uh differing in age and in income , uh the amount of money to spend , um <other> what they like in design uh and material nowadays . 
D:  Our main audience , uh so that's people below forty , uh prefer the following . 
D:  At first , the colours of fruit . 
D:  Um , fresh colours , uh green , red , uh strawberry red , uh yellow , banana yellow . 
D:  Yeah . They like spongy material , 
D:  Okay , our secondary audience , uh people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . 
D:  <other> Yeah , uh materials like wood that  
D:  They have to look fancy . 
D:  Um , they should be technological in innovative . 
D:  Uh , and easy to use . 
D:  We have to aim at a mu at the  main audience . And uh , therefore use fresh colours . 
D:  Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . To customise your own remote control . 
D:  Uh , in my second sheet of personal preferences , uh we have to reconsider the speech function <laugh> uh recognition . 
D:  You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak  uh speech recognition and stuff . 
D:  Uh , building games like Snake or Tetris <laugh> to amuse the younger users . 
D:  And third , I stick with it , <laugh> the log-in functionality uh with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension . <laugh>

abst_sum - abstract: He suggested using removable customisable covers, speech recognition, installing some games into the remote, and implementing a parental control feature.

B:  But , the main concept is um take one big touch screen . 
B:  Um , always display the primary buttons clear and visible . 
B:  And uh make the menu structure changeable . 
B:  <other> One thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . 
B:  But um , well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure . 
B:  And um , things like teletext , put them in the menu .

A:  I think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh Tim uh came with . 
A:  I think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote . 
D:  How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents , children . 
B:  You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings . 
B:  You c may use  like when there's uh X_P_ , uh a simple log-on , d you just push uh one or two or three . 
C:  I don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it . 
A:  Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it , 
B:  Just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , 
C:  I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control , uh let's say we do , and and well whatever , cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up <other> for instance . 
C:  What m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control . 
A:  Okay . And what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? 
B:  But I don't think when you're watching T_V_ uh , hearing loud noises from the T_V_ , someone screaming <sound imitating scream> one , and you f the channel switches , uh <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , like f voice recognition is too much , I think . But  
A:  Okay . So the games uh are in it . 
A:  The voice recognition are not . 
A:  And the parental control are 
B:  Well , I think also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . 
A:  Like the first idea uh from uh  You can buy it without and uh with parental contr control ? Or are we going to put it in and uh just uh  
C:  I I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it . 
B:  Well , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock . 
C:  But you still have the problem about uh the television itself . 
C:  You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem . 
D:  Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view . 
B:  What I was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you don't use it is simple . 
A:  We take it to the other meeting ,

A:  The parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex .

abst_sum - abstract: After a lot of discussion they decided to implement a simple parental control feature.

A:  I went to uh a master class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh  can come in handy uh for us . 
A:  First thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management . 
A:  Knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge , uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is  uh like that . 
A:  <laugh> It's it's uh very hot at the moment , 
A:  so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other uh 
A:  What other companies uh had to uh also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some uh  Yeah . <laugh> Import export .

A:  <laugh> I had a I had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh Real Reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing . 
A:  When you uh put on remote , you see a kind of a  just like when you telephone , you see a little uh animation . 
A:  And uh with the with the with the motto , we put fashion in electronics . 
C:  Well , if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen , you can  you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom . 
D:  That spins around like all the time .
