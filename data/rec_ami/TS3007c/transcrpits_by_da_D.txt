Hey , Project Manager . 
What was it , problem ? 
The laptop ? 
It hang  hung . 
Ha-ha . 
Oh . 
Project Manager . 
You're our Project Manager . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Master . 
Master of  
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> I'm sorry . <laugh> 
Okay . Go on . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
Yeah but when the power gets low , you have to shake it or something ? 
Uh , and uh uh  
Hmm . 
Mm yeah . It's too less space . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
And when the battery doesn't work , I usually shake it too . So  
<laugh> Like slamming on it . <laugh> 
It's exactly the same . <laugh> 
<other> 
Hmm . 
But , are you going to draw it ? 
The  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh , I c I can't imagine . 
I can't imagine how how how it looks like . 
Yeah . 
Design . 
Mm-hmm . 
Uh  
<laugh> 
Oh , okay . 
Okay . 
Oh , okay . 
Okay . 
Well , I think uh we're going to sell tell  ten millions of them . 
So uh I bet a big company in uh Korea or Taiwan , like uh Samsung , can give us uh a big discount on the chips , so  
U usually , chips are uh aren't more expensive than one dollar . 
So  
<other> That that shouldn't be a real issue , I think . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , a combination . 
Yeah . 
Like an uh aku uh  
Acu uh , yeah . 
<laugh> Well ,  . Yeah . 
Combine them . 
<laugh> Okay . <laugh> 
<laugh> Of course . Fifty cent . <laugh> 
Rubber . 
Rather hard . 
Yeah . 
Well , I think that touch-screens are generally square . 
But it's the case you put around it that makes the shape . 
Hmm ? 
Yeah okay , 
but if you have a square uh L_C_D_ screen , and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen . 
That  
That's  it's custom customisable and  
Yeah , me too . 
Mm yeah . 
<laugh> <sound indicating something is poor> 
<cough> 
<cough> 
<cough> 
Yeah . 
Can I uh do my thing ? 
It uh  <laugh> 
<cough> Expert map . 
Okay uh  
Last week 
I went to uh Paris and Milan for some trend-watching . 
For marketing . 
Our research and development department and I went to Paris and Milan . 
In Paris and Milan , we uh asked different people , uh differing in age and in income , uh the amount of money to spend , um <other> what they like in design uh and material nowadays . 
Findings . 
Our main audience , uh so that's people below forty , uh prefer the following . 
At first , the colours of fruit . 
Very basic colours , like Janus explained . 
Um , fresh colours , uh green , red , uh strawberry red , uh yellow , banana yellow . 
<laugh> Um , considering material , um  
<other> 
Yeah . They like spongy material , 
like  yeah a sponge-ball . 
Like a s soft material . 
Janus m uh mentioned it also . 
I think he did some uh 
some findings himself . 
<laugh> You wer you weren't in Paris ? 
<laugh> Okay . Like this . 
Like big uh g flashy colours . Fresh . 
It's nice , I think . 
Okay , our secondary audience , uh people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . 
Uh  
<other> Yeah , uh materials like wood that  
No n j just j just a w 
No , okay , but just just a wooden uh look . 
Like uh you have those fake uh fake panels on the floor . 
The  that isn't wood anyway , but  
Okay ? 
<other> But , that's our secondary audience . 
So , uh we decided to take 
mm yeah the people below forty . 
So , that  this doesn't apply . 
'Kay , the third . 
Uh , there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls . 
They have to look fancy . 
Um , they should be technological in innovative . 
That means uh there have to be fancy things in . 
Uh , and easy to use . 
But that's common . 
My personal preferences . 
We have to aim at a mu at the  main audience . And uh , therefore use fresh colours . 
Uh , I'll I'll come to that in a second point . 
Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . To customise your own remote control . 
Like the Nokia uh the removable covers , uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . 
Uh , a third , material being used uh could well be stuff like rubber . 
Um , two advantages . 
Uh , it fits within the current market trends . 
And uh it adds safety to your remote uh when you drop it . So  
Uh to come back to your question , I think uh and the people in Milan and Paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard . 
Like uh seen on regular mobile phones . 
Actually , they have a lot in common . The phones and the  
Yeah . Yeah . Okay . 
Yeah , exactly . 
Uh , in my second sheet of personal preferences , uh we have to reconsider the speech function <laugh> uh recognition . 
Uh , it's very innovative . Innovative . 
Yeah , like something . 
You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak  uh speech recognition and stuff . 
But , we have to keep the cost in uh in mind , 
but it  
Yeah , it it can be uh very expensive . 
'Kay , second . 
Uh , building games like Snake or Tetris <laugh> to amuse the younger users . 
Uh , also the link with uh mobile phones . Uh  
No , but  
No , okay . But you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call . 
It's just the same . 
Yeah . 
When you're at college . 
Uh  <laugh> No . You al <laugh> 
you also take <laugh> uh t <laugh> 
you take your IPac and go uh play games . 
Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
Well , I do that , but  <laugh> 
Okay , and um  
And third , I stick with it , <laugh> the log-in functionality uh with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension . <laugh> 
That's it . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
Yeah . Uh , 
what do you think about a back-and-forth come-up uh button ? 
<laugh> L like in uh internet explorer . 
<other> 
Yeah okay , but does it  that is for uh going from four to five . 
But if you go from two to eight , and you want  
Yeah , and on two . 
That you can switch switch easy . 
Yeah it is . 
Yeah . 
Mm no . 
<laugh> That's it . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah but  
What I see uh  <other> 
How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents , children . 
Something like that . 
And w when you want to use the parents uh option , you have to  
Yeah , ok 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . Pu push parents . 
That  then 
then then you have to uh go to three-digit uh log-in . 
Like two one three . 
And it's in . 
It automatically goes  Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm yeah . 
V violent T_V_ . 
Yeah , of course . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
w It just has to be w when it's deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . 
But if you want to install it personally uh  
If I got kids , and I could choose between uh two remote controls . One uh w with parent control and one without , and I would would buy the one with . 
I th Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah but yeah but that isn't possible . 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , and  
And and you know w uh when you install another device , uh children can still go up to the T_V_ , p pop open uh the thing and and and g 
go to a channel . 
Yeah , yeah of course . 
But  
Yeah . 
Ah it's  
Yeah . Yeah , okay . 
But it's just an an added feature feature . 
Mm yeah . 
Yeah , like f voice recognition is too much , I think . But  
<other> games . It doesn't  
Yeah . 
That that doesn't c that doesn't co 
Yeah , that that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources , I think . 
Yeah , it's it's in it . But too ma I I think so , but  
Yeah . 
To put  
Yeah , to put it in always . 
Yeah , but T_V_s aren't capable of sending . 
Yeah ? 
I thought they were just 
a able to receive . 
Yeah , some . But  
Yeah . 
Yeah , j just some rules . 
Yeah , okay . 
But , on the T_V_ 
at least my T_V_ , is a is a compartment which you can press . 
And there are buttons uh behind it which you can use , if you d if you don't if you don't have a  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , of course . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Or j Yeah . 
Ah  <laugh> 
I have to uh <laugh> consult my legal advisor about it . <laugh> <other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Consensus . 
Oh . Oh . I I have one thing left . 
Maybe for uh Jerome . 
Um , the views . 
Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view . 
Yeah . 
Like at  
In the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons . 
Yeah . 
Mm yeah , okay . Fairly enough . Yeah . 
Yeah , wh which buttons you like or not . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Just leave the other numbers away . 
Okay . Go on . 
<laugh> A little chat . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Marketing . 
Management . 
<laugh> Yeah , that's my function , to <laugh> 
Okay . Go on . <other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
How  
I know a marketing name for our product . 
R_ th R_ to the third power . 
R_ three . Real Reaction remote . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm ? 
Bling . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , okay , but it has to be like a split second , because <laugh> you have to put in a code also and  
Yeah . 
 
Yeah . 
That spins around like all the time . 
It it's just like a uh globe in Internet Explorer . 
Okay . 
<laugh>
