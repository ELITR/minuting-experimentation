A:  Hello again . 
C:  Hi . <laugh> 
B:  Hello . 
D:  Hey , Project Manager . 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Ha-ha . Oh . Project Manager . 
A:  <laugh> Yes . <loud intake of air> 
C:  <other> 
D:  You're our Project Manager . 
A:  Yes . <laugh> Your project manager . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Welcome to the conceptual design meeting 
C:  <laugh> <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  for Real Reaction . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh , hello again . Uh it's uh the same as the last time . Uh uh , also this time there will be uh three presentations . And we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts . Um uh , and at the end , uh I uh , when I finish it off I have some uh input from uh a master class I uh <laugh> visited . <laugh>  information . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  During lunch , yeah . 
D:  Master . 
B:  He's the master , yeah . <laugh> <cough> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Master of  
A:  The the the the the concepts on uh  we uh  where we uh must reach a decision on . Um uh , our  from uh are of two sorts . Components concepts and user interface concepts . Uh , the first one is uh really about the the the the the total package uh with uh  Well , we have decided to do a  do the uh  with a touch-screen that must be a case around it so uh it won't be uh uh as breakable . Uh how how about the energy ? Can you uh can you reload it or uh just have batteries which you must exchange ? Uh , the user interface concept . Uh , with the type and uh the the supplements . So uh where to put what button . <other> And uh uh I would say uh  Jans , can you begin ? Okay . At the end , uh  I will take notes uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder . 
C:  Yeah , sure . 
D:  <other> 
C:  Okay . 


C:  Uh , let me see . I think it's this one . Ha . 
B:  Wow . 
C:  Right . Uh , well , I'll be talking about the components . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Uh , what I did was I reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups . Uh below forty five and above . And uh I just uh watch what the differences are and I checked uh , well , what what d do we want , and  how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group . Well uh what I found was that a senior um  
A:  Mm-hmm . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> I'm sorry . <laugh> Okay . Go on . <laugh> 
C:  <other> senior citizens uh  <laugh> Ye Ah , it's <laugh> it's okay . Uh  <laugh> They , well , they like more the  they like the traditional materials , like wood and and such more . Wood and chrome . And uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes . Um , uh they they they they like luxurious uh styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more uh soft materials . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Think of the Teletubbies , for instance . Uh uh , soft and fluffy and colourful and  Well uh , shapes are curved and round . Y y you get <other> the picture . And uh they like sports and gaming , and that gives them uh the vitality . Uh , so w well uh , firs Yes . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <cough> 
A:  One one little question . Um about the the material . Uh a soft material for a remote control ? 
C:  Yeah . No , I'll I'll get to that . You you'll see . Yeah . 
A:  Okay . Yeah . Thank you . <laugh> 
C:  And uh , then also the simple versus advanced . Well I figure if we go for L_ L_C_D_ , we we should have the advanced . So that shouldn't be a problem . Okay , well that's my uh  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <cough> <cough> Yeah . 
A:  Mm yeah . Thank you . 
C:  Uh , you're welcome . 


D:  Can I uh do my thing ? It uh  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Do your thing , Tim . 
B:  Do your thing . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh>  <laugh> 
A:  Bring it on . <laugh> 
D:  <cough> Expert map . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Okay uh  
D:  My personal preferences . We have to aim at a mu at the  main audience . And uh , therefore use fresh colours . 
A:  Would you prefer uh uh  that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or  
D:  Uh , I'll I'll come to that in a second point . Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . To customise your own remote control . Like the Nokia uh the removable covers , uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Okay . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Okay . 
D:  Uh , a third , material being used uh could well be stuff like rubber . Um , two advantages . Uh , it fits within the current market trends . And uh it adds safety to your remote uh when you drop it . So  Uh to come back to your question , I think uh and the people in Milan and Paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard . Like uh seen on regular mobile phones . Actually , they have a lot in common . The phones and the  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Well , I actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . Okay . 
B:  Ah . 
A:  Maybe you could use your remote as a phone . 
B:  <laugh> Hey . <laugh> 
C:  Hey . That might be a next step . <laugh> 
A:  There are numbers on it , so uh  
D:  Yeah , exactly . Uh , in my second sheet of personal preferences , uh we have to reconsider the speech function <laugh> uh recognition . Uh , it's very innovative . Innovative . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  So that you say um S_P_S_S_ , and it goes to uh  Okay . 
D:  Yeah , like something . You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak  uh speech recognition and stuff . But , we have to keep the cost in uh in mind , but it  
B:  Twelve fifty uh  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , it it can be uh very expensive . 'Kay , second . Uh , building games like Snake or Tetris <laugh> to amuse the younger users . Uh , also the link with uh mobile phones . Uh  
A:  <laugh> <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , but you don't use that  <other> th games when you watching television , I think . 
D:  No , but  No , okay . But you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call . It's just the same . 
C:  Well , yeah . 
B:  When your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , okay . 
D:  When you're at college . Uh  <laugh> No . You al <laugh> you also take <laugh> uh t <laugh> you take your IPac and go uh play games . Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Well , I do that , but  <laugh> Okay , and um  
B:  <laugh> Take it . <laugh> 
C:  You take your uh remote with you to school . <laugh> 
A:  You take your remote control with you . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh>  <laugh> 
D:  And third , I stick with it , <laugh> the log-in functionality uh with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Very nice . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Ooh . S 
D:  That's it . <laugh> 
A:  <post-laughter sigh> Uh great  . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm-hmm . <other> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 


B:  In  Okay . Um the interface contents . 
B:  Um , yeah already already told that . 
D:  <laugh> That's it . 
B:  Yeah . That's my conclusion . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Oh , okay . 


A:  Uh  I think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh Tim uh came with . The parental control , the games , and the voice recognition . Uh  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  There's n not uh too much decision on uh that one so uh  I think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote . I don't know how you think about it . 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  Well , I agree , just put it in the menu structure somewhere . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Um , yeah um system properties , um parental control . 
D:  Yeah but  What I see uh  <other> How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents , children . 
B:  Yeah . Mm . 
D:  Something like that . And w when you want to use the parents uh option , you have to  
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Um , w well , yeah . It it has to be fast . You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings . 
D:  Yeah , ok 
A:  No but I think most people uh find it uh much more important that their children don't watch uh sex or violence uh on the television , and uh wait uh ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can uh finally watch it uh because of that . Uh  
B:  Mm-hmm . Why  Mm-hmm . You c may use  like when there's uh X_P_ , uh a simple log-on , d you just push uh one or two or three . And if you push parents , then  Yeah . To log in . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Pu push parents . That  then then then you have to uh go to three-digit uh log-in . Like two one three . And it's in . 
B:  Yeah . And if you puts a ye Uh-huh . And if you w you push p children , uh you don't have to uh log in , but you can only watch uh children's channels or uh  Okay . Well  
A:  <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  It automatically goes  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  I don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it . Because well it's a simple function , but it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time um to programming it . Because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such . And I'm not sure if it's actually worth uh investing that much time and effort into it . I don't know what  
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it , because uh you  Yeah , you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff , and you heard on the news that uh that he Yeah , they believe that children uh are influenced by the television , and uh  Well , we're we're aiming uh to uh below uh forty uh years . But there are a lot of uh people will below forty who have uh children in young age uh who who want um to uh not watch uh violent or uh  
C:  <other> 
D:  Mm yeah . V violent T_V_ . 
B:  Yeah . Well , maybe um some idea on that . Just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , 'cause if my grandad would buy this remote , he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the  uh things to do . Just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles or something . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , of course . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  That's a that's a better idea ? 
D:  Yeah , w It just has to be w when it's deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . But if you want to install it personally uh  
A:  Yeah . Yeah , okay . 
D:  If I got kids , and I could choose between uh two remote controls . One uh w with parent control and one without , and I would would buy the one with . 
A:  Yeah , with and one without . Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Um , b well , still some question I have about how to incorporate those ones . You're thinking about some channels they uh cannot see , but well , <other> I I <other> when I think , oh yeah , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock uh in the evening violent films and movies uh will come and uh maybe maybe some some timing uh will be uh needed <other> instead of uh of channels , because if you're watching uh , I don't know , you're in the  at day uh , cartoons will come up m on maybe Friday night . <laugh> I don't know . 
D:  I th Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , maybe it can work with show view . Uh , you you can control your video recorder with show view . Uh , when you tick in a number , it will uh start and end uh recording . But maybe there's some option that uh that t uh the kind of show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out . 
B:    Yeah , the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they  remotes and edit it all , will have to decide uh  
A:  Yeah . That's true . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah but yeah but that isn't possible . 
B:  That isn't possible . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  But , well , if you want to  I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control , uh let's say we do , and and well whatever , cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up <other> for instance . Well uh , nob nobody's stopping the child from uh well checking uh the channel . 
D:  Yeah . Hmm . 
B:  Well , yeah you could say if parental control is only  it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page-up then , but  
C:  But that  Well , I'm not sure because um for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the uh remote control , so it would , yeah , have to be constant uh constant signalling . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  What m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control . And that uh provides parental control , for instance . And that's just an optional uh device . So there's n that's  there's   uh besides uh the remote control , you'll have a separate uh   
A:  I wouldn't put it in an optional device . That that then then then it becomes too much , I think . 
C:  Yeah ? 
A:  If we do it , we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise . 
D:  Yeah , and  
B:  Yeah , on a separate menu uh option . 
D:  And and you know w uh when you install another device , uh children can still go up to the T_V_ , p pop open uh the thing and and and g 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , that's true . That's true , but uh at same instant , same happens when uh you have remote control . So  
D:  go to a channel . Yeah , yeah of course . But  
C:  But , only difference is uh <other> the uh the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , and those people wouldn't uh necessary want it . So , you  you'd be 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> 
D:  Ah it's  Yeah . Yeah , okay . But it's just an an added feature feature . 
A:  Yeah . Okay . And what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? I personally think that that becomes too much . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , well yeah , I   
A:  It's more like it gets you to the functionality , but  
B:  A mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition . But I don't think when you're watching T_V_ uh , hearing loud noises from the T_V_ , someone screaming <sound imitating scream> one , and you f the channel switches , uh <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , like f voice recognition is too much , I think . But  <other> games . It doesn't  
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . And games ? 
C:  Yeah . I can see games happening . Yeah . 
B:  W you can put it on chip anyway , so uh  
D:  Yeah . That that doesn't c that doesn't co 
B:  <other> As long as it's  isn't a primary feature of the remote , but uh  
A:  That would  
D:  Yeah , that that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources , I think . 
A:  Okay . So that will uh  that that that must be in it , you think ? 
C:  Yeah , that will be nice . 
A:  Okay . So the games uh are in it . The voice recognition are not . And the parental control are 
B:  Optional in 
A:  optional ? 
D:  Yeah , it's it's in it . But too ma I I think so , but  
B:  But how we do it ? <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Well , I think also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . So we should make it too complex . Is t some menu uh function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on . But uh how how it's gonna work uh uh will f be a problem . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , okay . Uh , but uh will there uh uh  Like the first idea uh from uh  You can buy it without and uh with parental contr control ? Or are we going to put it in and uh just uh  
B:  Mm-hmm . Well  Ye I I think best would be uh to put it in and <other> make it an menu option . You can put on  Yeah . And you can just uh s when you buy it , you can select um personal preference , parental control on , and the password or something . 
D:  To put  Yeah , to put it in always . 
A:  Yeah ? Mm yeah . 
C:  Well , I don't know . I I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it . So you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control . But it would would be uh more expensive . So , a and that that way uh you could make cheap model and a expensive model . Could ma make the uh  simple model and the deluxe model , uh for instance . 
B:  Oh , it's a p Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , but T_V_s aren't capable of sending . 
C:  Yes they are . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah ? I thought they were just 
A:  Yeah , you yo Yeah , but most often not . 
C:  Yeah , you you have some T_V_s  any  
D:  a able to receive . Yeah , some . But  
C:  Yeah . That is true , that is true . 
B:  Well , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock . And there's just some little uh clock in the remote . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Well yeah , you could you could easily you could easily you could easily  to the mote control . But you still have the problem about uh the television itself . 
D:  Yeah , j just some rules . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  No , no , it's very simple . There uh th I h I've seen some of  remotes who have a clock in it . So , the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock . Yeah ? 
C:  Yeah , yeah yeah . 
D:  Yeah , okay . But , on the T_V_ at least my T_V_ , is a is a compartment which you can press . And there are buttons uh behind it which you can use , if you d if you don't if you don't have a  
B:   Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Well , that's  To put it very blunt , that's not our problem . Just have um the parents buy uh some glue and uh  It's not not a part of the remote . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , of course . 
C:  Yeah , that is true . Yeah , that is true . Yeah , you could you could you could go like  uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy . You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem . 
B:  You have to f Yeah . Uh , or make it ourselves very diffic Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , I figured  I figure we could do that . Yeah , yeah , sure . <laugh> 
B:  Okay . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Or j Yeah . 
C:  Uh , I'm not sure what marketing thinks about it , but  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Ah  <laugh> I have to uh <laugh> consult my legal advisor about it . <laugh> <other> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Okay . So uh I think we have decided on the things that  Uh from Janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . The case will be double-curved and uh rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that  with cover is removable . The buttons will be uh touch-screen . Uh but there may not be too many buttons . And in the the menu structure , uh there must not to be uh  
C:  <other> <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Five minutes to go . Uh , too uh too many levels . And uh it must be easy to use . The parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . And the games  are in it . So  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Okay . 
A:  I think we have uh we have decided uh , okay . 
D:  Consensus . 
A:  Uh , little more . 
D:  Oh . Oh . I I have one thing left . Maybe for uh Jerome . Um , the views . 
B:  Oh . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah ? I'm listening . 
D:  Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view . 
A:  Like a like a moat or s or something . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Like at  In the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons . 
B:  Um , well  
C:  User profile . 
A:  Yeah , but you have that in the  
B:  What I was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you don't use it is simple . And when you push uh system properties , uh entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program . 
A:  Yeah . You use the  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . It's already incorporated a little in that concept . 
D:  Mm yeah , okay . Fairly enough . Yeah . 
C:  Well yeah , you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users . 
D:  Yeah , wh which buttons you like or not . 
C:  Yeah , which buttons do you want to in it . Because you can you can like build in a back-forward button , and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . Just leave the other numbers away . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah , you could you could m have people want uh want that . 
A:  We take it to the other meeting , okay ? I have a little w uh little chat to do and uh then we uh finish . I went to uh a master class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh  can come in handy uh for us . First thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management . Knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge , uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is  uh like that . <laugh> It's it's uh very hot at the moment , so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other uh marketing  or did I said management ? Oh . <laugh> Just talking about myself . <laugh> Uh  <laugh> W <laugh> 
D:  Okay . Go on . 
C:  Ah , yeah , sure . 
D:  <laugh> A little chat . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> <laugh> Marketing . Management . <laugh> Yeah , that's my function , to <laugh> Okay . Go on . <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  What other companies uh had to uh also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some uh  Yeah . <laugh> Import export . <laugh> And uh another one . Uh , they're a ha they're at  Yeah , benchmarking , that's the word I saw . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Som some bench-marker . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  I uh couldn't uh  Okay , uh another uh thing is uh there were there there was a survey , and um uh it came out that um people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who uh are partnering uh with us . So , we must uh we must bring it as if uh Real Reaction is uh is big company , uh a trustful company , and uh it has m 
D:  How  I know a marketing name for our product . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  R_ th R_ to the third power . R_ three . Real Reaction remote . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> <laugh> I had a I had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh Real Reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing . When you uh put on remote , you see a kind of a  just like when you telephone , you see a little uh animation . Real Reaction remote . <laugh> And uh with the with the with the motto , we put fashion in electronics . And then you go uh  
B:  Oh . 
D:  Mm-hmm ? 
B:  Uh , logo . Yeah ? Yeah . 
D:  Bling . <laugh> Yeah . Yeah , okay , but it has to be like a split second , because <laugh> you have to put in a code also and  
B:  <singing> 
A:  The  
B:  Yeah . Well , you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds , they'll still remember it . And it it l linger on every time you see it . 
A:  <other> <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . But w th the idea from this uh thing is that we must present it as a  as we are a a single large provider who will stand on our own . 
C:  Well , if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen , you can  you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom . And it could just stay there . Yeah , that spins around or something . 
D:   Yeah . That spins around like all the time . 
A:  Mm yep , yeah . Also also . But we we are uh  
B:  <laugh> Very annoying . <laugh> 
C:  Hmm . 
D:  It it's just like a uh globe in Internet Explorer . 
A:  Yeah yeah y yeah yeah . Okay , but uh think about that kind of things . That's what they said in the master class . <laugh>  . N <laugh> Uh , next meeting starts in thirty minutes . So uh maybe you can go to Paris and Milan uh <laugh> once again . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , something like that . A small icon . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah , I  It's ok For f 
D:  Okay . 
B:  Oh , for the next meeting , right ? 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Who uh  <laugh> Who who gave you the master class ? Ronald Betenberg ? 
A:  The master class ? <laugh> Franz Mehler's . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Okay , thanks . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 


A:  <laugh> Uh , very special , uh next uh session . Uh idea that you uh  the the industrial uh development uh centre <laugh> and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype . And uh will drawing it on the SMARTboard . So that's a kinda new uh thing . And um , the marketing expert will uh will uh ke he will be keeping busy with the product uh evaluation . But the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email . 
D:  <other> 
B:  <blows nose> 
D:  Ah . 
B:  Um  
C:  So we're going to work together right now ? 
B:  Stay here and  
A:  <other> Yeah , the  well , uh dids this what I uh what I heard . I  <laugh> 
D:  In the master class . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Not in the master class . 
B:  <laugh>
