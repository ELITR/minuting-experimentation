Hi . <laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , sure . 
Okay . 
Uh , let me see . 
I think it's this one . 
Ha . 
Right . Uh , well , 
I'll be talking about the components . 
Uh , what I did was I reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups . 
Uh below forty five and above . 
And uh I just uh watch what the differences are and I checked uh , well , what what d do we want , and  how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group . 
Well uh what I found was that a senior um  
<other> senior citizens uh  <laugh> 
Ye Ah , it's <laugh> it's okay . 
Uh  <laugh> 
They , well , they like more the  they like the traditional materials , like wood and and such more . 
Wood and chrome . 
And uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes . 
Um , uh they they they they like luxurious uh styles , 
where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more uh soft materials . 
Think of the Teletubbies , for instance . 
Uh uh , soft and fluffy and colourful and  
Well uh , shapes are curved and round . 
Y y you get <other> the picture . 
And uh they like sports and gaming , and that gives them uh the vitality . 
Uh , so w well uh , firs 
Yes . 
Yeah . 
No , I'll I'll get to that . 
You you'll see . Yeah . 
Uh , well f first off , let's start start with the energy . 
W I uh I had a choice between uh a few different uh sources . 
But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic . 
Uh kinetic , that's when you move something , then uh it gets energy . 
I figured , well that's ki kinda high-tech , when when you have a remote control that well , when you pick it up , it has power . 
That would be actually very nice , uh I figured . 
Well , we could also use a battery , 
that's a bit  
Yeah . Yeah yeah , you c just you have to shake it around a little bit . 
And then then it d then it has some more uh energy . 
Well , y you could just go for a battery . 
Or you can go for both ? 
Yeah , I actually did . 
But uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light . 
Well , sunlight preferably . 
Uh , and you you could you could use normal light , but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something . 
Uh for uh ultimate b uh <other> n uh use of uh solar panels , you could actually use uh  
you could use uh solar panels , but uh you ha you'd have to implement them into uh the remote control , leaving you uh a bit less space for the interface . 
So uh  
so i i it it wo what's actually  I I c just in f 
I've figured it out that well , uh seeing that you'll always be uh within the l uh distance of T_V_ , and the  from T_V_ there comes a a a whole bunch of light . 
So it would actually power itself uh from a T_V_ . 
But , well you just take up all the space , 
and you wouldn't uh have the full amount of power actually used . 
So  
I I prefer kinetic because it's uh  well , the costs aren't that much higher , and um , ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery . 
I mean , if  
No , but uh d Well , you pick it up and you press buttons and y well , you  
Yeah , well uh actually it is . 
And it it  
if it isn't , you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again . 
But , what l what Jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . 
And for rest , you'd just add juice on the battery . 
<laugh> Exactly . <laugh> 
And so that  Uh  <laugh> Uh well , 
f furthermore , you you  we   uh checked uh the cases . 
We have uh different options uh concerning the cases . 
You ha I  you sim uh you simply add a basic uh standard uh model uh  
it was kind of square 
and uh I figured that's a bit boring . 
So you you  
we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved . 
Um , single curve , it's just a  well , uh , you know , it's just uh a nice curve . 
Or but but you could go in a in an double curves . And that's  like several different dimensions . 
That gives you an whole new uh effec 
Yeah , that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look , I f I figured . 
But , that uh we'll discuss later . 
What ? 
You want me to draw in three-D_ ? 
<laugh> Uh , yeah , I ca I ca I could I could show you . I could show you . 
Well uh let's say y uh you uh  
Let's say that's your standard uh  
That's a bit your d standard design . 
But you could actually go like uh something like this . 
And then uh in three-D_ effect you could go  <laugh> 
So y you you just  
Yeah , this is a  this <laugh> bit uh difficulty in  
<laugh> I didn't take a major in art . 
So  <laugh> But 
but you could have uh uh a whole new uh the back back the the the depth , you could you could uh just play around a bit with . 
You you don't have to use standard uh  
Yeah you could  y It leaves more space for creativity . 
Uh that might be an idea , 
but <laugh> just a  
Well , furthermore , uh well , uh plastic versus rubber ? 
You  We could choose uh what uh what's better , plastic um or rubber . 
I I ch prefer rubber because it feels uh  Yeah . 
Yeah , it's soft and it's  that  <laugh> I like soft . 
<laugh> Yeah , 
yeah I mean uh plastic uh is  
Plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , 
<other> like plastic uh  Your your  
I usually associate plastic with uh something that's cheap . 
Uh that's maybe just me , 
but  Uh , we could uh 
uh , oh , talk about it later . 
Uh furthermore , buttons . 
Uh traditional uh or a touch screen . 
Well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_ . 
And uh chip set , 
well uh if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go uh with a simple chip set . 
But uh if we decide to go on a n uh um L_C_D_ screen , we would use an uh  we have to use an a advanced chip set . 
And that would bring uh the necessary costs with with it . 
So that's something we th have to keep in mind . 
If it isn't uh manageable uh budget-wise , we'd have to go over to uh to sim to simple buttons . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , probably . 
Yeah , probably , 
but  But uh yeah , that's that's  
That shouldn't shouldn't be uh that big a issue . 
I'll I'll I'll just add , uh uh I put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit . 
Uh  what i what are your ideas  concerning battery versus kinetic ? 
Yeah , you you you should  we should  
A combination . 
Uh ,  you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . 
When you pick it up , it charges up . 
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah , I know . 
Yeah , I con Exactly . 
What uh what do you think ? 
You agree ? 
Yeah ? Both ? 
Okay . 
Uh , well that would bring the m m some more costs , 
but I mean the  
<other> Who cares , right . 
<laugh> That's the Project Manager's problem . <laugh> 
Yeah , <laugh> well  <laugh> Fifty cent uh  
<laugh> Uh , why doesn't  
And then we have single-curved versus double-curved . 
<other> That  
 Okay . 
No , we'll we'll just wait and uh  
Uh , plastic versus rubber . Any ideas ? 
Uh , rubber ? 
You  
Uh , I figured it will be m rather than hard  
Nah , rubber c uh this is a casing , yeah . Rubber casing , 
because well if you use an uh d a touch-screen , uh it's just a casing uh around it . 
So um , you could go for plastic , but I figured  
I I I would choose rubber . 
Well , m I don't know . No . 
Yeah . 
That isn't  
<other> 
Yeah , that would cover it . 
That that would solve the problem . 
So mm  Uh uh so 
uh so what are the opinions ? Uh rubber or plastic ? 
I I I prefer rubber . 
<other> Yeah , you too ? 
You sure ? 
You  you you seemed to hesitate a bit . 
Yeah , it it shouldn't it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand uh 
 <laugh> <sound indicating something is poor> No , that that that that's gonna  The the chip set will hold it firm in place , 
and uh and and uh and a L_C_D_ screen also  
<laugh> Yeah it <laugh> m might it might . 
<laugh> Uh , tra uh traditional versus L_C_D_ , well I figured we we all set on that . 
And uh , then also the simple versus advanced . 
Well I figure if we go for L_ L_C_D_ , we we should have the advanced . 
So that shouldn't be a problem . 
Okay , well that's my uh  
Uh , you're welcome . 
<laugh>  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Well , the Teletubbies sh  <laugh> 
Well , you could . You you could . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well , I actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so  Yeah . 
Hey . 
That might be a next step . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well , yeah . 
You take your uh remote with you to school . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . <laugh>  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Very nice . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it . 
Because well it's a simple function , but it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time um to programming it . 
Because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such . 
And I'm not sure if it's actually worth uh investing that much time and effort into it . 
I don't know what  
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
But , well , if you want to  
I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control , uh let's say we do , and and well whatever , cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up <other> for instance . 
Well uh , nob nobody's stopping the child from uh well checking uh the channel . 
But that  
Well , I'm not sure because um for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the uh remote control , so it would , yeah , have to be constant uh constant signalling . 
What m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control . 
And that uh provides parental control , for instance . 
And that's just an optional uh device . 
So there's n that's  there's   
uh besides uh the remote control , you'll have a separate uh   
Yeah ? 
Yeah , that's true . That's true , 
but uh at same instant , same happens when uh you have remote control . So  
But , only difference is uh <other> the uh the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , 
and those people wouldn't uh necessary want it . 
So , you  you'd be 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . I can see games happening . Yeah . 
Yeah , that will be nice . 
Well , I don't know . 
I I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it . 
So you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control . 
But it would would be uh more expensive . 
So , a and that that way uh you could make cheap model and a expensive model . 
Could ma make the uh  simple model and the deluxe model , uh for instance . 
Yes they are . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , you you have some T_V_s  any  
Yeah . That is true , that is true . 
Well yeah , you could you could easily you could easily you could easily  to the mote control . 
But you still have the problem about uh the television itself . 
Yeah , yeah yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that is true . Yeah , that is true . 
Yeah , you could you could you could go like  
uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy . 
You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem . 
Yeah , I figured  I figure we could do that . Yeah , yeah , sure . <laugh> 
Uh , I'm not sure what marketing thinks about it , but  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
User profile . 
Well yeah , you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users . 
Yeah , which buttons do you want to in it . 
Because you can you can like build in a back-forward button , and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels . 
Yeah , you could you could m have people want uh want that . 
Ah , yeah , sure . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well , if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen , you can  you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom . 
And it could just stay there . 
Yeah , that spins around or something . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . Yeah , something like that . A small icon . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
So we're going to work together right now ? 
<laugh> 
Definitely . 
Well thank you too . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> You wish . 
M Aye ? Cheers . 
Hey . 
Yeah , uh I'm not sure if we uh we  
Because I saw something about individual actions . 
<laugh> Well , yeah . <laugh> 
Right . Uh  
 
Do you have new email ? 
Hmm .
