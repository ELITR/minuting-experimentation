Hello again . 
<laugh> 
Mm yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yes . <loud intake of air> 
Yes . 
<laugh> Your project manager . <laugh> 
Welcome to the conceptual design meeting 
for Real Reaction . 
Uh , hello again . 
Uh it's uh the same as the last time . 
Uh uh , also this time there will be uh three presentations . 
And we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts . 
Um uh , and at the end , uh I uh , when I finish it off I have some uh input from uh a master class I uh <laugh> visited . <laugh>  information . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
The the the the the concepts on uh  we uh  where we uh must reach a decision on . Um uh , our  from uh are of two sorts . 
Components concepts and user interface concepts . 
Uh , the first one is uh really about the the the the the total package uh with uh  
Well , we have decided to do a  do the uh  with a touch-screen 
that must be a case around it so uh it won't be uh uh as breakable . 
Uh how how about the energy ? 
Can you uh can you reload it or uh just have batteries which you must exchange ? 
Uh , the user interface concept . Uh , with the type and uh the the supplements . 
So uh where to put what button . 
<other> And uh uh I would say uh  Jans , can you begin ? 
Okay . 
At the end , uh  
I will take notes 
uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
One one little question . 
Um about the the material . 
Uh a soft material for a remote control ? 
Okay . Yeah . 
Thank you . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Oh . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
But you prefer kinetic ? 
Okay . 
Yeah , but you don't move a a remote control too much . 
And that's enough to to keep the energy level uh  
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> Thank you , Tim . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Dynamic dynamic look ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <other> 
A little artistic . 
Okay . 
It's soft . 
<laugh> That's the material the younger people want uh , ain't it ? 
Just like the watch from Seiko . 
Yeah . 
I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too . 
Yeah . Combine them . 
<laugh> 
<laugh>  <laugh> 
Rubber . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm yeah . 
Me too . 
Yeah ? 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Mm yeah . 
Thank you . 
Yeah . Do your thing , Tim . 
Bring it on . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Flashy . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , but wood is not a not a material you  which you build a a remote control of . 
Yeah but <laugh> never seen one . <laugh> 
Case . Oh , a wooden look , yeah . 
<laugh> Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Would you prefer uh uh  that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or  
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Maybe you could use your remote as a phone . 
There are numbers on it , so uh  
<laugh> 
So that you say um S_P_S_S_ , and it goes to uh  
Okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , but you don't use that  <other> th games when you watching television , I think . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , okay . 
You take your remote control with you . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<post-laughter sigh> Uh great  . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh , okay . 
Uh  
I think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh Tim uh came with . 
The parental control , the games , and the voice recognition . 
Uh  
There's n not uh too much decision on uh that one so uh  
I think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote . 
I don't know how you think about it . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
No but I think most people uh find it uh much more important that their children don't watch uh sex or violence uh on the television , and uh wait uh ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can uh finally watch it uh because of that . 
Uh  
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it , 
because uh you  Yeah , you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff , and you heard on the news that uh that he Yeah , they believe that children uh are influenced by the television , 
and uh  
Well , we're we're aiming uh to uh below uh forty uh years . 
But there are a lot of uh people will below forty who have uh children in young age uh who who want um to uh not watch uh violent or uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah . 
That's a that's a better idea ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah , with and one without . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah , maybe it can work with show view . 
Uh , you you can control your video recorder with show view . 
Uh , when you tick in a number , it will uh start and end uh recording . 
But maybe there's some option that uh that t uh the kind of show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out . 
Yeah . That's true . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I wouldn't put it in an optional device . 
That that then then then it becomes too much , I think . 
If we do it , we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Okay . And what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? 
I personally think that that becomes too much . 
It's more like it gets you to the functionality , but  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Okay . 
And games ? 
That would  
Okay . 
So that will uh  that that that must be in it , you think ? 
Okay . So the games uh are in it . 
The voice recognition are not . 
And the parental control are 
optional ? 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah , okay . 
Uh , but uh will there uh uh  
Like the first idea uh from uh  You can buy it without and uh with parental contr control ? Or are we going to put it in and uh just uh  
Yeah ? 
Mm yeah . 
Yeah , you yo 
Yeah , but most often not . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Okay . So uh I think we have decided on the things that  Uh from Janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . 
The case will be double-curved and uh rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that  with cover is removable . 
The buttons will be uh touch-screen . Uh but there may not be too many buttons . 
And in the the menu structure , uh there must not to be uh  
Five minutes to go . 
Uh , too uh too many levels . 
And uh it must be easy to use . 
The parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . 
And the games  are in it . 
So  
I think we have uh we have decided uh , okay . 
Uh , little more . 
Yeah . 
Like a like a moat or s or something . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , but you have that in the  
Yeah . 
You use the  
Yeah . It's already incorporated a little in that concept . 
Okay . 
We take it to the other meeting , 
okay ? 
I have a little w uh little chat to do 
and uh then we uh finish . 
I went to uh a master class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh  can come in handy uh for us . 
First thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management . 
Knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge , uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is  uh like that . 
<laugh> It's it's uh very hot at the moment , 
so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other uh 
marketing  
or did I said management ? 
Oh . <laugh> 
Just talking about myself . 
<laugh> Uh  <laugh> W <laugh> 
What other companies uh had to uh also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some uh  Yeah . <laugh> Import export . 
<laugh> And uh another one . 
Uh , they're a ha they're at  
Yeah , benchmarking , that's the word I saw . 
I uh couldn't uh  
Okay , uh another uh thing is uh there were there there was a survey , and um uh it came out that um people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who uh are partnering uh with us . 
So , we must uh we must bring it as if uh Real Reaction is uh is big company , uh a trustful company , 
and uh it has m 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> I had a I had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh Real Reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing . 
When you uh put on remote , you see a kind of a  just like when you telephone , you see a little uh animation . 
Real Reaction remote . <laugh> 
And uh with the with the with the motto , we put fashion in electronics . 
And then you go uh  
The  
<other> <laugh> 
Yeah . But w th the idea from this uh thing is that we must present it as a  as we are a a single large provider who will stand on our own . 
Mm yep , 
yeah . 
Also also . 
But we we are uh  
Yeah yeah y yeah yeah . 
Okay , but uh think about that kind of things . 
That's what they said in the master class . <laugh>  . 
N <laugh> Uh , next meeting starts in thirty minutes . 
So uh maybe you can go to Paris and Milan uh <laugh> once again . 
The master class ? 
<laugh> Franz Mehler's . <laugh> 
<laugh> Uh , very special , uh next uh session . 
Uh idea that you uh  
the the industrial uh development uh centre <laugh> and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype . 
And uh will drawing it on the SMARTboard . 
So that's a kinda new uh thing . 
And um , the marketing expert will uh will uh ke he will be keeping busy with the product uh evaluation . 
But the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email . 
<other> Yeah , the  well , uh dids this what I uh what I heard . 
I  <laugh> 
<laugh> Not in the master class . 
So you uh just wait for the specific instructions and uh  
But I think it was a very uh very good uh session , uh gentlemen . 
I will thank you all . 
And uh  
Give me a good evaluation . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Cheers . 
See you in a half hour . 
But keep an eye on your uh laptops for a real uh 
Yeah , but th there's there's still the my uh instructions that you will work together . 
That's not my problem . 
Bye-bye . <laugh> 
The project manager always works alone . <laugh>
