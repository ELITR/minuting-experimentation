Hello . 
Um , Project Manager , I have something to tell you . 
I have a little problems with my laptop . 
And uh s s s so I had a little less time to complete . 
No , a little problem , uh <laugh> big problem . 
I just thought  
Um , it didn't work anymore . <laugh> 
The entire Windows uh  
It it hung . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
During lunch , yeah . 
He's the master , yeah . <laugh> <cough> 
Wow . 
<laugh> 
Oh , have you considered the option of using a solar panel ? 
W  nah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Th th yeah . Yeah . 
<cough> 
Yeah . 
Um  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Um , I think you should use kinetic as a back-up . 
A combination , yeah . 
Okay . Yeah . 
Psycho-kinetic . <laugh> Yeah . 
Buy a fifty cents battery and uh  
<laugh> 
Well maybe I have something in my presentation to uh to cope with that . 
Um , isn't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is  or bendable remotes where you've got a  . 
Or do you think it  
Rubber casing , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Um , well d Maybe I can ask it right now the question that I have . 
Uh , is it possible uh of  is it necessary to make a touch-screen square ? 
It isn't , I think , yeah ? 
We're  
We put fashion in electronics , 
so maybe we can uh  
Mm yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Oh , yeah . Okay , I I get it . 
Okay . 
That's good . 
Well , as long a as long as it's it's uh it's firm , and you don't uh  it's not bendable or something , 
I th I think that goes too far . 
Oh . <laugh> 
Okay . 
It might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor . 
<laugh> Okay . 
Do your thing . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Spongeball . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> It'll float . 
Tables . <laugh> 
Ah . 
<laugh> Hey . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Twelve fifty uh  <laugh> 
When your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else . 
<laugh> Take it . <laugh> 
<laugh> Ooh . S 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
In  
Okay . Um the interface contents . 
Well that's a just simple PowerPoint mock-up 
I want to m make it more as dynamic for you so I'll draw there . 
But , the main concept is um take one big touch screen . 
Um , always display the primary buttons clear and visible . 
Maybe even li like this with uh <other> u uses of a lot of space . 
And uh make the menu structure changeable . 
So if you press um system , that's  
Yeah , well m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or or one , can fit in . 
Or maybe even a step further when you want to um 
t um have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . 
And um other buttons can may be displayed here if that's necessary . 
And um well , how do  uh do we want to look at uh uh f um  Yeah <laugh> 
Does a remote look  
Well , it's  you've gotta hold it in one hand . 
So um the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands . 
And some remotes you can use with your thumb . 
But I think that's too difficult for this one . 
So you can make it s a little broader . Yeah . And here ? 
And maybe use your thumb on the on the main buttons . 
And use your other hands on the menu structure . 
So here are gonna be the program buttons . One , two <other> , three , four , et cetera . 
And the the volume control and program control maybe . 
And , down here , um , I added , this could be one uh big L_C_D_ . Um , the menu structure . 
So you can use it in uh in this way . 
Um  
<other> One thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . 
Um , <other> know that if you are changing the menu structure here , um  
And well , I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . 
But if you're programming the colour of the T_V_ , do not display twenty other options that are possible . 
Just keep it as simple as uh as possible . 
And do not use too many levels . 
Do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un-plus , and um push plus twenty times . 
But just the um uh just in one button if possible . 
And um , well , you kn you all know the T_V_ levels . 
Um , channel one , two . And when you get to n to uh to ten , ye and want to go back , uh well you have a problem . 
Just m most most modern T_V_s , you   you press one zero , and it goes to ten . 
And else , to one and through after that . 
So the s a button less . 
And um , things like teletext , put them in the menu . 
Things like um um  
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah w Yeah , I I find I must trying to uh tell it . 
Is uh volume plus and minus ? 
And this is program uh plus 
and minus . 
Uh  
Yes . 
Or if you're watching Studio Sports on uh on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two  
Well yes , I think that's a good idea . 
But um , well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure . 
And if you're using that button a lot of times , well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen . 
You just don't have to play games uh in-between . 
But if you're really switching between two channels , you won't have time uh to d use the other options . 
Um , yeah already already told that . 
Yeah . That's my conclusion . 
Well , I agree , 
just put it in the menu structure somewhere . 
Um , yeah um system properties , um parental control . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Um , w well , yeah . 
It it has to be fast . 
You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings . 
Mm-hmm . 
Why  
Mm-hmm . 
You c may use  like when there's uh X_P_ , uh a simple log-on , d you just push uh one or two or three . 
And if you push parents , then  
Yeah . To log in . 
Yeah . 
And if you puts a ye 
Uh-huh . 
And if you w you push p children , uh you don't have to uh log in , but you can only watch uh children's channels or uh  
Okay . 
Well  
Yeah . 
Well , maybe um some idea on that . 
Just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , 
'cause if my grandad would buy this remote , he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the  uh things to do . 
Just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles or something . 
Um , b well , still some question I have about how to incorporate those ones . 
You're thinking about some channels they uh cannot see , but well , <other> I I <other> when I think , oh yeah , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock uh in the evening violent films and movies uh will come 
and uh maybe maybe some some timing uh will be uh needed <other> instead of uh of channels , 
because if you're watching uh , I don't know , you're in the  at day uh , cartoons will come up m on maybe Friday night . <laugh> I don't know . 
 
 
Yeah , the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they  remotes and edit it all , 
will have to decide uh  
That isn't possible . 
Well , yeah you could say if parental control is only  it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page-up then , but  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , on a separate menu uh option . 
Yeah , well yeah , I   
A mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition . 
But I don't think when you're watching T_V_ uh , hearing loud noises from the T_V_ , someone screaming <sound imitating scream> one , and you f the channel switches , uh <laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah . 
W you can put it on chip anyway , so uh  
<other> As long as it's  isn't a primary feature of the remote , 
but uh  
Optional in 
But how we do it ? <laugh> 
Well , I think also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . 
So we should make it too complex . 
Is t some menu uh function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on . 
But uh how how it's gonna work uh uh will f be a problem . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well  
Ye I I think best would be uh to put it in and <other> make it an menu option . 
You can put on  
Yeah . 
And you can just uh s when you buy it , you can select um personal preference , parental control on , and the password or something . 
Oh , it's a p Yeah . 
Well , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock . 
And there's just some little uh clock in the remote . 
No , no , it's very simple . 
There uh th I h 
I've seen some of  remotes who have a clock in it . 
So , the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock . 
Yeah ? 
 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well , that's  
To put it very blunt , that's not our problem . 
Just have um the parents buy uh some glue and uh  It's not not a part of the remote . 
You have to f Yeah . 
Uh , or make it ourselves very diffic 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Oh . 
Yeah ? I'm listening . 
Um , well  
What I was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you don't use it is simple . 
And when you push uh system properties , uh entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program . 
<laugh> 
Som some bench-marker . 
Oh . 
Uh , logo . Yeah ? 
Yeah . 
<singing> 
Yeah . 
Well , you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds , they'll still remember it . 
And it it l linger on every time you see it . 
<laugh> Very annoying . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
, I  It's ok For f 
Oh , for the next meeting , right ? 
<laugh> 
<blows nose> 
Um  
Stay here and  
<laugh> 
<laugh> P_ . 
Ah , no new email . 
Okay . 
Thank you . Thank you very much . 
Yeah . 
Uh-huh . 
<laugh> See you . 
Yeah . 
Here ? Or uh  
Yeah . If you got a  
No . <laugh> So
