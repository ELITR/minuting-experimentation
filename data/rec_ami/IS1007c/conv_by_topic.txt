A:  So we come to the third meetings . I have  good . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . So we 
topic_description:	opening_None


C:  Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please uh open uh  
A:  will talk about some specific details . 
C:  I'm participant two . Components design . 
A:  This  
topic_description:	industrial designer presentation_None


A:   
C:  Okay so uh the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control . So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique <laugh> to to store the energy . We also um <other> we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . Now  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting . But if we use battery  
C:  Yeah b uh f well uh I meant uh by by battery I meant uh I will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source but uh I didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote . So uh it's a point to discuss . Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex . <other> But uh well it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the <laugh>  from the technical uh point of view . Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so . <other> And uh this is the last point , the choice of chips . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work <laugh> in a cluttered uh <laugh> uh environment . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  So um so I think we can start with these two main things . For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it's trendy and it's uh it's uh well it's modern and uh user are are are  mm will be uh very happy to have a <laugh> a a nice remote . For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons , simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip <other> that are uh well cheaper . <laugh> 
B:  Mm . 
C:  And s so uh we can move to the next slide . Yeah . 
B:  Sorry . What is this single curved  what does it mean ? 
C:  Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote . You you will have the  well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the  
B:  So it's it's not  Yo l yeah . When you hold on it , it is comfortable to hold . 
C:  Yeah . It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat . 
B:  Okay . Yeah . And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ? 
C:  Yeah the um that's the point . The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um  
B:  That that's what it means by kinetic . 
C:  <other> Yeah and by  well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy . But I d I don't know it's  if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy . 
B:  Okay . Mm-hmm . Okay . Mm . <cough> Mm . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product <laugh> ready for market . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> And  yeah and so can you go to the next slide please . So and uh that's uh that summarize well what I have said . 
B:  Mm mm . <other> <cough> Wha 
C:  So uh you're right we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh <laugh> if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . <other> That's it . 
B:  Ah the department . Mm . Uh  So I um keep in touch with the R_ and D_ department . 
C:  Oh yeah I take care , it's all right . 
B:  <laugh> <laugh> 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


B:  So the titanium case is the normal case that  I'll show you some pictures that I have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not . 'Cause I am not very sure , plastic , titanium or whatever . There's another point I want to make , is that the uh  well you've seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some  why buttons are not the mm 
C:  <laugh> All right . Yeah . 
B:  not the only ways you can <other> use  Yeah . Yeah , maybe n 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  We will , okay . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Three . 
B:  Yeah . <cough> So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system , a programme which can be seen or heard 
A:   
B:  or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . So you s this gives you the ways to input data and we have uh  we are more  we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . Yeah . Yeah . So . 
A:  What's the function of this button . I think it makes the the interface really  
B:  Ea easy to use . So next one .  function five . 
A:  Graphical user interface  . 
B:  So I can use the button , the mouse maybe . 
A:  A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures . 
B:  Yeah . So next line . 
topic_description:	interface specialist presentation_None


B:  So the  here are some examples . So they cluster the buttons together . They group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well . Mm but this interface are kind of confusing . Uh basically there are too many buttons . Right . Next one . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  So some people are propose voice recognition and so  ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine <laugh> for this by a company when you tell the  you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . So I just got an email saying that . And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , 
C:  <laugh> Mm-hmm mm mm . Yeah fine . 
B:  supposedly . <laugh> The next one . Mm so somebody  some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real  so so that could be an option as well . Touch screen , I mean . Next one . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  And some people propose a scroll button . Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . Like the one we have here . Uh , next one . So mm 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  so there are a few aspects that I collected here . So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , and uh mm and prog basically they are programmable , specially for children . And uh mm  yeah yeah . And then they also secure uh covers , to protect uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . So  But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . I'm just saying that the  currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f  customisable for different people . Yeah , so that's the point . The next one . And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . Mm maybe useful for children , they migh you you they only see the buttons outside . And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  S a good idea . 
B:  The next one . So this guy  this is another company that provides big buttons . At  I see that that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost . But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . And you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is . <laugh> T_V_ remote controller where are you ? And then , he will beeps and to say that I am here , <laugh> for example . Is it possible ? 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:   We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ? 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Uh ? <laugh> 
C:  Yeah but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And uh , this is another one where you can uh  the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume . So there's a up arrow and a down arrow . But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top  on the top up arrow  <other> if you  up arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah yeah . 
topic_description:	existing products_None


B:  And here are  is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found . Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . And uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . Yeah . So <laugh> we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used . And basically uh  
C:  Hmm . <laugh> Yeah . Well I <other> I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:   
B:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . Mm . Mm . Okay . 
A:  Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control  and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_ . 
C:  Yeah . That's a good idea . To have a help button . 
D:  <cough> 
B:  A help button . So you are display on the screen . So  on the T_V_ screen . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  On the T_V_ screen . On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote . 
A:  On T_V_ T_V_ screen . So just you push the button and we will  
B:  Okay . Okay . Okay . So that eliminates all the complicated documentation  , okay . So wi 
D:  Oh . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  But people are often enough looking at the help , once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff . <laugh> It's a psychology . <laugh> Okay . And let us see what the market demands . We could just go to my presentation . 
A:  If the if  <laugh> No <laugh> In the case where they need help , in the case where they need help . 
C:  Uh yeah . <laugh> <laugh> In a marketing point of view . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  But  uh wel well I think  
A:  It's just for user customizable , for kids or old people . So  
D:  Yeah that's right . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the  
A:  So it's the same  
D:  Same remote with some  
A:  Can be used by both kids and old people . 
D:  Both yeah . 
B:  Mm . <cough> Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller , i <other> it could be a cube , is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the <other> um the buttons , if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls . <other> 
C:  <other> 
A:  Maybe for kids , kids they like uh t no l they like to  
B:  Small  
C:  Uh well . So le le let's see what uh what <laugh> people want . 
B:  Yeah . Let's see the market demand . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  And then we can decide what what we can  yeah . 
B:  What what  market  yes yes . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:   
D:  So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . Uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions . And we found the following solutions which we could  which would be helpful for our design . 
topic_description:	marketing expert presentation_None


D:  So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot . And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times . So this were the findings which we found . And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . Most of  fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them <laugh> rather than watching the T_V_ . And by the time they found the remote control the program is finished . So <laugh> they're frustrated a lot <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah . Yes . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Mm , the functionalities yeah . 
D:  So you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex . So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them . We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control . 
C:  <other> Yeah . 
B:  Oh . 
topic_description:	user requirements_None


C:  Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen . 
B:  Big screen . 
C:  It's  yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce <laugh> and it's not really  
D:  Mm-hmm ? 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy . So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it . It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control . We just <other> play around 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm yeah . 
C:  <other> Yeah yeah . 
B:  Mm . The thing <other>  
C:  Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have <laugh> a big screen in front of you , s 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  You can use this screen instead of the big se screen , instead of use the  yeah . 
B:  Yeah . If you re-use the existing screen , we element  eliminate the L_C_D_ , after all the L_C_D_ just to display and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the L_C_D_ , maybe even better . So  
A:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  I mean this were the points which we got from the market demands . So 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


topic_description:	discussion_None


C:  So I th I I <other> well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh 
D:  the other one  
B:  Yeah . More on a fancy design . 
D:  <other> Yeah that's fine . Yeah . I mean that's  
C:  on the speech recognition if the technology is available but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . Mm . Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  But  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . So i is  so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again . <laugh> 
D:  Uh yeah we have uh  
A:   
D:  <laugh> I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time  . Is i if i 
C:  So price of uh L_C_D_ display . And  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls . 
B:  Yeah . And also the cost for the speech recognition . Ask our R_ and D_ department . 
A:  Mm . It's for  it's just for small vocabulary . We  it's not  yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary , say eighty commands or so . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . And ho 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . And also the scroller button , how much will it cost . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah okay . And  Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button . 
A:  <other> Yeah . Push push  . 
topic_description:	project budget_None


D:  Mm , the scroll button ,  from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button . Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or <laugh> help button . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah I think that  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality . 
B:  Don't use the buttons . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Important . 
C:  Yeah . But  
A:  But they are just less used compar yeah . 
D:  They're not used much . 
C:  But the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen like uh a a list of function and then you choose with the with the button to  well you navigate and you  
B:  Yeah . Yeah . Mm . Yeah , yeah . So so the at most  more power uh . 
A:  Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  So . 
D:  <other> 
C:  But if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen <other> I think that just five buttons are sufficient , one to go up left right down and uh enter and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that . You don't have to to switch to a channel to another uh  
B:  Yep . Yeah . Mm . Mm . Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Mm . 
D:  Or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television . Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , we are most focused on the commands . So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote , you just have a menu , and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff . And accordingly you can just increase or decrease . 
C:  Yeah but  
B:  Mm . 
C:  <other>  Yeah but if you look at the L_C_D_ you you don't look at the T_V_ screen so <laugh> i i it's not really worth to get  to have the image if you don't look at , so . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  It's  
B:  Mm . I if  Mm . Mm . Yeah . 
A:  And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_ . I  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah that has to be checked out . 
B:  I think that there's no contradiction here , because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are , so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness and then you t turn  you just press lef increase or decrease button and the same for the volume and the channel , <other> if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_ , with the help of speech recogniser you can  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . Okay . I mean ,  better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_ and also with the speech recognition . And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . Mm . <other> Yeah . A and  
D:  And the third problem was to find the remote control . Always , so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes . So  
C:  Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find and <laugh> when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t 
B:  Mm . Where  , yeah . 
A:  You will listen to a peep , <laugh> special peep . 
D:  <other> Yeah that's right , that's exactly what I mean by voice commander . Or it could be also something like this , uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger . And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Mm . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Put it back at the charge . Yeah . 
C:  Put  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  And that's a good idea , that's simple , like in phones . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command , because there are problems with a voice command . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  But you don't you don't have to move the the charger . 
B:  Hmm . Mm . <other> Th yeah . Mm yeah . Yeah . Mm . 
D:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . I mean charger would be fixed because it's always with electricity plugged . 
A:  You have to keep it  . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Mm . There's  mm . Mm . 
D:  <other> 
C:  Also and uh uh the remote is lost . 
B:  Yeah . That  we can  what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . You never get it lost because uh every time you're off the computer <other>  the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where  to the charger . 
D:  Yeah that's right . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  It's an good reminder , yeah that's right . 
B:  Yeah . So you will never get lost   yeah . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Maybe for some people  <laugh> lazy people . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah because everything is programmed inside . So it's it's uh it's all about strategy , y 
A:  Yeah yeah . 
D:  And of course the final point is a fancy look . As we have seen earlier the 
B:  Mm . 
D:  remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy , I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons . I think we should have something  it  
B:  Mm . 
C:  They were ugly . <laugh> They  
B:  <laugh> Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Mm . 
C:  Well the last one with the um 
B:  With uh two two two parts controller . 
C:  <other> yeah with the two parts was uh  original , so  
D:  I mean  uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and <laugh> use it , you can't avoid him . But you can have an button for child lock . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even   
B:  Mm . Mm . Mm . 
C:  Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Mm uh  
B:  Mm . 
A:  Or  
B:  Mm . Yeah . Mm . 
D:  That's right . 
A:  Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just  yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically 
B:  Mm .  these are probl yeah . Mm . Mm . Mm . 
A:   . So if he  . 
D:  I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think  
C:  So for mm  yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on . 
D:  Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these  could be included . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . <other> I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  because uh if you want  uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . If numbers , they're easy , but if  name the channel by by name  
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now and and uh  
B:  Mm . 
D:  No , we have a problem there . You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh  basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five and suddenly <laugh> the screen the channel goes to twenty five . So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers  
A:  Yeah it's  yeah . 
C:  That's right , yeah , yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  I mean the the  you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five . Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and T_V_ twenty five 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah yeah . Yeah but well  okay . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  I dunno it will be round about one or two percent . So it's better to have some prefix  before the number . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm . But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers . 
D:  Yeah something , some code . 
B:  You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel . So some people may want to say , I want to see this channel . 
C:  Yeah yeah . Mm mm . Well I  
D:  That will be too big . And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also . 
A:  Or just  
B:  Yeah . Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser . <laugh> Uh ? 
A:  It's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel . It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel . Because you have to s t uh a ch yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary . 
B:  Well , it's convenient for the user . 
D:  Als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number . Then  
A:  Or maybe  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  The  uh uh mm . 
A:  Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary . 
B:  <other> Mm . I I think that I have  mm mm <other> I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh <other> if  when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the  you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel . So  
D:  Yeah , the  . 
A:  Or lets the user create his own vocabulary 
B:  Mm . So you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way . 
A:  of channel . No . Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train  you have to create the vocabulary by yourself . By associating each channel with the name or  
B:  Oh , okay . Yeah . 
C:  Well I uh I also  I I also think about uh another problem , if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_ <laugh> the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two . Because uh I remember when I was a <laugh> young child with my sister we  yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time so it's a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching T_V_ and say oh T_V_ thirty <laugh> and just run , s 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah yeah ,  . 
A:  And for each one has his own . <laugh> 
B:  Mm . 
A:  Or you have to s <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , I wanna watch this , I wanna watch that . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  A and in the same lines we would have a  one more problem . If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name  bad uh reputation for our company . So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  Mm . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  Or we can switch on or switch off the the special  , yeah . 
D:  Yeah that's right that should be an option . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah that's  well I think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also , so . 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  I think these are the practical problems . So we need to take care of them in the design .
