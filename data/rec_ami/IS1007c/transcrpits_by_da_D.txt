<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<cough> 
Oh . 
But people are often enough looking at the help , 
once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff . 
<laugh> It's a psychology . 
<laugh> Okay . 
And let us see what the market demands . 
We could just go to my presentation . 
Yeah that's right . 
I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids 
and if you remove the  
Same remote with some  
Both yeah . 
And then we can decide what what we can  yeah . 
So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes 
and how it could be special from the other remotes . 
And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . 
Uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions . 
And we found the following solutions which we could  which would be helpful for our design . 
So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , 
they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . 
And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . 
And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . 
And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot . 
And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , 
so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times . 
So this were the findings which we found . 
And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . 
Most of  
fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room 
and people are always searching for them <laugh> rather than watching the T_V_ . 
And by the time they found the remote control the program is finished . 
So <laugh> they're frustrated a lot <laugh> 
And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it . 
So you can just see the percentage , 
fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes 
and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex . 
So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them . 
We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control . 
Mm-hmm ? 
I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy . 
So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it . 
It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control . 
We just <other> play around 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I mean this were the points which we got from the market demands . 
So 
<other> Yeah that's fine . 
Yeah . 
I mean that's  
Mm-hmm . 
Uh yeah we have uh  
<laugh> I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers . <laugh> 
And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls . 
Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary , 
say eighty commands or so . 
Mm , the scroll button , 
 from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button . 
Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or <laugh> help button . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
They're not used much . 
<other> 
Or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television . 
Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , 
we are most focused on the commands . 
So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote , you just have a menu , 
and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs 
and this menu when you press the menu , in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff . 
And accordingly you can just increase or decrease . 
Yeah 
that has to be checked out . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
I mean ,  better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_ 
and also with the speech recognition . 
And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case . 
And the third problem was to find the remote control . 
Always , so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes . 
<other> Yeah that's right , 
that's exactly what I mean by voice commander . 
Or it could be also something like this , 
uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , 
so we have some one charger there 
and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger . 
And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is . 
I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command , 
because there are problems with a voice command . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
I mean charger would be fixed 
because it's always with electricity plugged . 
<other> 
Yeah that's right . 
It's an good reminder , 
yeah that's right . 
And of course the final point is a fancy look . 
As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy , 
I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons . 
I think we should have something  it  
I mean  uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and <laugh> use it , you can't avoid him . 
But you can have an button for child lock . 
So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even   
Mm uh  
That's right . 
I think these other four points they're the market demands 
and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think  
Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these  could be included . 
No , 
we have a problem there . 
You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh  basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five 
and suddenly <laugh> the screen the channel goes to twenty five . 
So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers  
I mean the the  you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five . 
Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent 
and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent . 
So it's better to have some prefix  before the number . 
Yeah something , some code . 
That will be too big . 
And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also . 
Als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number . 
Then  
Yeah , the  . 
Yeah yeah , 
 . 
Yeah . 
A and in the same lines we would have a  one more problem . 
If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name  bad uh reputation for our company . 
So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , 
say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something . 
Yeah that's right 
that should be an option . 
I think these are the practical problems . 
So we need to take care of them in the design . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Oh it came there on three minutes back so we are <laugh> 
 I think we can just press the okay . <laugh> 
Okay . See you another thirty minutes .
