<laugh> 
Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept 
so can you please uh open uh  
I'm participant two . 
Components design . 
Okay so uh 
the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department 
and have which components was uh available to build a remote control . 
So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique <laugh> to to store the energy . 
We also um <other> we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . 
Now  
Yeah 
b uh f well uh I meant uh by by battery I meant uh I will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source 
but uh I didn't fou 
we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote . 
So uh it's a point to discuss . 
Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex . 
<other> But uh well it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the <laugh>  from the technical uh point of view . 
Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated , 
but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so . 
<other> And uh this is the last point , the choice of chips . 
So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy 
because I think solar energy wi won't work <laugh> in a cluttered uh <laugh> uh environment . 
So um so I think we can start with these two main things . 
For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice 
because it's trendy 
and it's uh it's uh well it's modern 
and uh user are are are  mm will be uh very happy to have a <laugh> a a nice remote . 
For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons , simple buttons 
and th thus this allow to use a regular chip <other> that are uh well cheaper . <laugh> 
And s so uh we can move to the next slide . 
Yeah . 
Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote . 
You you will have the  well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the  
Yeah . 
It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat . 
Yeah the um that's the point . 
The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um  
<other> Yeah 
and by  well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy . 
But I d I don't know it's  if it is feasible 
because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> And  yeah and 
so can you go to the next slide please . 
So and uh that's uh that summarize well what I have said . 
So uh you're right 
we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh <laugh> if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . 
<other> That's it . 
Oh yeah 
I take care , 
it's all right . 
<laugh> All right . Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm mm mm . 
Yeah fine . 
Yeah . 
S a good idea . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control . 
Yeah yeah . 
Hmm . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Well I <other> I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities 
but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote 
since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , 
because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so . 
Yeah . That's a good idea . 
To have a help button . 
Yeah . 
On the T_V_ screen . 
On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote . 
Uh yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> In a marketing point of view . 
But  uh wel well I think  
<other> 
Uh well . 
So le le let's see what uh what <laugh> people want . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm , the functionalities yeah . 
<other> Yeah . 
Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen . 
It's  
yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on 
but it's it's expensive to produce <laugh> 
and it's not really  
Yeah . 
<other> Yeah yeah . 
Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have <laugh> a big screen in front of you , s 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah yeah . 
So I th I I <other> 
well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look 
on the uh 
on the speech recognition if the technology is available 
but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results . 
<laugh> 
So price of uh L_C_D_ display . 
And  
Yeah . 
Yeah okay . 
And  
Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button . 
Yeah . Yeah I think that  
Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button 
so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality . 
Yeah . But  
But the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen 
like uh a a list of function 
and then you choose with the with the button to  well you navigate 
and you  
Yeah . 
But if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen <other> I think that just five buttons are sufficient , 
one to go up left right down and uh enter 
and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that . 
You don't have to to switch to a channel to another uh  
Yeah but  
<other>  Yeah but if you look at the L_C_D_ you you don't look at the T_V_ screen 
so <laugh> i i it's not really worth to get  to have the image if you don't look at , so . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find 
and <laugh> when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Put  
Yeah . 
And that's a good idea , 
that's simple , like in phones . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery . Also and uh uh the remote is lost . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
They were ugly . 
<laugh> They  
Well the last one with the um <other> yeah with the two parts was uh  original , so  
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that . 
So for mm  
yeah . 
So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels 
and you can say to your remote control like uh sports 
and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now 
and and uh  
That's right , yeah , yeah . 
Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so . <laugh> 
Yeah yeah . 
Yeah but well  
okay . 
Yeah yeah . 
Mm mm . 
Well I  
Yeah . 
Well I uh I also  
I I also think about uh another problem , 
if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_ <laugh> 
the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two . 
Because uh I remember when I was a <laugh> young child with my sister we  yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time 
so it's a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching T_V_ and say oh T_V_ thirty <laugh> and just run , s 
Yeah , yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah that's  
well I think that's a good uh a good option 
because it's simple and uh simple to implement also , so . 
<other> 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
So I see ya .
