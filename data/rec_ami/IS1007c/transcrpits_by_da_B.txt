<laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Sorry . 
What is this single curved  
what does it mean ? 
So it's it's not  
Yo l yeah . 
When you hold on it , it is comfortable to hold . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ? 
That that's what it means by kinetic . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
<cough> Mm . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product <laugh> ready for market . <laugh> 
Mm mm . <other> <cough> Wha 
Ah the department . 
Mm . 
Uh  
So I um keep in touch with the R_ and D_ department . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
So the titanium case is the normal case that  
I'll show you some pictures that I have 
and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not . 
'Cause I am not very sure , plastic , titanium or whatever . 
There's another point I want to make , 
is that the uh  well you've seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some  why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can <other> use  
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
maybe n 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<cough> 
So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system , 
a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user 
and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . 
So you s this gives you the ways to input data 
and we have uh  we are more  
we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . 
The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on 
so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . 
Yeah . Yeah . So . 
Ea easy to use . 
So next one . 
 function five . 
So I can use the button , the mouse maybe . 
Yeah . 
So next line . 
So the  here are some examples . 
So they cluster the buttons together . 
They group them into col they colour them 
and uh they have different forms as well . 
Mm 
but this interface are kind of confusing . 
Uh basically there are too many buttons . 
Right . Next one . 
So some people are propose voice recognition 
and so  
ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine <laugh> for this by a company 
when you tell the  you say good morning coffee machine 
and the machine are reply to you . 
So I just got an email saying that . 
And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used 
so we might consider that , supposedly . 
<laugh> The next one . 
Mm so somebody  some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display 
so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen 
and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , 
you can use that as real  
so so that could be an option as well . 
Touch screen , I mean . 
Next one . 
And some people propose a scroll button . Integrated with push buttons 
or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . 
Like the one we have here . 
Uh , next one . 
So 
mm 
so there are a few aspects that I collected here . 
So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , 
and uh mm and prog 
basically they are programmable , 
specially for children . 
And uh mm  yeah yeah . 
And then they also secure uh covers , to protect 
uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . 
So  
But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . 
I'm just saying that the  currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f  customisable for different people . 
Yeah , so that's the point . 
The next one . 
And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . 
Mm maybe useful for children , 
they migh you you they only see the buttons outside . 
And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . 
So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside . 
Yeah . 
The next one . 
So this guy  
this is another company that provides big buttons . 
At  
I see that that is useful for old people 
and then you don't get it lost . 
But for our product we don't need a big one 
because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . 
And you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is . 
<laugh> T_V_ remote controller where are you ? 
And then , he will beeps and to say that I am here , <laugh> for example . 
Is it possible ? 
Uh ? <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And uh , this is another one 
where you can uh  
the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume . 
So there's a up arrow and a down arrow . 
But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top  
on the top up arrow  <other> if you  
up arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down 
so it's confusing interface , 
so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design . 
And here are  is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found . 
Big buttons are convenient , 
voice recognition helps , 
push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . 
And uh user customisable is important 
and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . 
Yeah . So <laugh> 
we have many concepts there 
but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used . 
And basically uh  
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
A help button . 
So you are display on the screen . 
So  on the T_V_ screen . 
Okay . Okay . Okay . 
So that eliminates all the complicated documentation  , 
okay . 
So wi 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<cough> Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller , i <other> it could be a cube , 
is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube 
and maybe you can just change the <other> um the buttons , 
if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons , 
you turn the other side you get the other buttons , 
so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls . <other> 
Small  
Yeah . 
Let's see the market demand . 
What what  market  yes yes . 
Yeah . Yes . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Oh . 
Big screen . 
Mm yeah . 
Mm . The thing <other>  
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
If you re-use the existing screen , we element  eliminate the L_C_D_ , 
after all the L_C_D_ just to display 
and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , 
as fancy as the one on the L_C_D_ , 
maybe even better . 
So  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
More on a fancy design . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Mm . 
Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller . 
Yeah . So i is  
so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost 
and then we'll decide again . <laugh> 
Uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time  . 
Is i if i 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And also the cost for the speech recognition . 
Ask our R_ and D_ department . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And ho 
Yeah . 
And also the scroller button , how much will it cost . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Don't use the buttons . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Important . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Mm . 
Yeah , yeah . 
So so the at most  more power uh . 
Yep . 
Yeah . 
Mm . Mm . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
I if  
Mm . Mm . 
Yeah . 
I think that there's no contradiction here , 
because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more 
because you know where the buttons are , 
so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness 
and then you t turn  you just press lef increase or decrease button 
and the same for the volume and the channel , <other> 
if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , 
just tell your channel 
and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller 
so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_ , 
with the help of speech recogniser you can  
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . Mm . <other> Yeah . 
A and  
Mm . 
Where  , 
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Put it back at the charge . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Hmm . Mm . <other> Th yeah . Mm yeah . Yeah . Mm . 
Mm . There's  mm . Mm . 
Yeah . 
That  we can  
what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . 
You never get it lost 
because uh every time you're off the computer <other>  the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where  to the charger . 
Yeah . So you will never get lost   yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah 
because everything is programmed inside . 
So it's it's uh it's all about strategy , y 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> Yeah , yeah . 
With uh two two two parts controller . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . Mm . 
Mm . 
 these are probl 
yeah . 
Mm . Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<other> I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser 
because uh if you want  uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . 
If numbers , they're easy , 
but if  name the channel by by name  
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers . 
You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel . 
So some people may want to say , I want to see this channel . 
Yeah . 
Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser . 
<laugh> Uh ? 
Well , it's convenient for the user . 
The  uh uh mm . 
<other> Mm . 
I I think that I have  mm mm <other> 
I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh <other> if  when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the  you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , 
so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , 
you just use the control button uh , 
you just you you just choose the the option you want 
and then you just hit the button 
and then you go to that channel . 
So  
Mm . 
So you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way . 
Oh , okay . Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Yeah , I wanna watch this , I wanna watch that . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Well , you you stay a five minutes . <laugh>
