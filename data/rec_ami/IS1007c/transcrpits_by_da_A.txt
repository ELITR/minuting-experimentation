So we come to the third meetings . 
I have 
 good . 
Um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design 
and now we will talk about the conceptual design . 
So we will talk about some specific details . 
This  
 
Uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting . 
But if we use battery  
We will , okay . 
Three . 
 
What's the function of this button . 
I think it makes the the interface really  
Graphical user interface  . 
A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
 We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ? 
Mm-hmm . 
 
Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control  
and we should have just a button like help 
and you say uh and you ik you press the button help 
and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_ . 
Yeah . 
On T_V_ T_V_ screen . 
So just you push the button 
and we will  
Yeah . 
If the if  
<laugh> No <laugh> 
In the case where they need help , in the case where they need help . 
Yeah . 
It's just for user customizable , for kids or old people . 
So  
So it's the same  
Can be used by both kids and old people . 
Maybe for kids , 
kids they like uh t no l they like to  
<laugh> 
 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
You can use this screen instead of the big se screen , 
instead of use the  yeah . 
Hmm . 
But  
Yeah . 
 
<laugh> 
Mm . It's for  
it's just for small vocabulary . 
We  it's not  
yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> Yeah . Push push  . 
It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important . 
But they are just less used compar 
yeah . 
Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others . 
So . 
Mm . 
It's  
And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_ . I  
You will listen to a peep , <laugh> special peep . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
But you don't you don't have to move the the charger . 
You have to keep it  . 
Okay . 
Maybe for some people  <laugh> lazy people . 
Yeah yeah . 
Mm . 
Or  
Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids 
and then just just  yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically 
 . 
So if he  . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah it's  yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Or just  
It's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel . 
It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel . 
Because you have to s t uh a ch 
yeah 
but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary . 
Or maybe  
Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , 
just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary . 
Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel . 
No . 
Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train  
you have to create the vocabulary by yourself . 
By associating each channel with the name or  
And for each one has his own . <laugh> 
Or you have to s <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Or we can switch on or switch off the the special  , yeah . 
Maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting . 
It's time to close this meeting . 
<laugh> Yeah  . <laugh> Okay . 
Thanks for your collaborations .
