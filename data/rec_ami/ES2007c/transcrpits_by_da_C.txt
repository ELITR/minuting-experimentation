<other> 
Hello . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive . 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
<other> Do you have any preference uh of order ? 
I think she is still finishing her  . <laugh> 
Hmm . 
Okay , it's uh <other>  
Is it like a crank thing or something  . 
Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with  but also using some solar power . 
Uh I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know . 
Let's have a squeezable remote . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
If it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway , 
 it doesn't matter if it's double  
I mean isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , I mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? 
Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double  rubber double curved case ? <laugh> 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Go rubber . Go rubber the whole way . 
I think push-buttons is  
Yeah . 
Th the the <other> speech recognition um option is  it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh , 
'cause uh  
The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , 
where , basically , you can program a sample wi um  That when you say something it will give a response , 
and you program the response as well . 
Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . 
So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello Rick , or whatever . 
But , I mean , it's not  
it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns  comes on , 
but it's not that . 
It just gives you 
a it just gives you a verbal response . 
So , yeah , I mean , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , I mean , hello , how how are you ? <laugh> 
Yeah , if you're really lonely , it is it's  
No , 
tha that w that w that would be more promising . 
It it's just a remote that talks to you . 
Uh . <laugh> I mean to certain cues . 
'Kay . 
Yeah , I'm fine with the basic battery . 
Hmm . 
Yeah , 
so we want it rub rubber double curved . <laugh> 
So rubber rubber keys , yeah . 
Yeah . 
 . 
Yeah . 
We're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah . 
<other> Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful . 
<laugh> Oh yeah , I guess T_V_ can be stressful , yeah , if you're watching sports . 
Alright . 
Alright . 
Yeah , some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about . 
Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . 
And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . 
It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them . 
Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 
'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . 
Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . 
So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface . 
I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . 
It's it's pointless . 
Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output . 
It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ . 
Uh so yeah , they they also give the uh  
they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . 
Um so we've already addressed that 
and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ 
I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing . 
Um the other suggestion , 
and I I have a feeling that 
we're interested in in something more general , 
but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , 
like either gearing our remote towards kids , 
where you could have  lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or  , 
or uh something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . 
But you know we can we can discuss this , 
but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . 
Uh  um  
So , the key layout and design are really crucial . 
You don't want uh 
you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . 
And I didn't mention that we need a power button  in our last  
I can give you an example here of uh ,  good layout and bad layout 
uh 
from our manufacturing department . 
So this would be an example of bad layout , 
where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh 
it's sort of confusing for the user . 
Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose . 
<laugh> And for  something for kids . 
Yeah . Um . 
And so , 
yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of  we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . 
Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . 
I think it should be more general . 
I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . 
And , yeah , that's it for me . 
So we're  we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh . 
So , yeah , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . Um . 
I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , 
ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . 
Uh . 
And some sort of  
it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . 
I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that . 
Well now that we've decided on our  
Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , 
but um  
Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , 
like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that . 
I I guess <other> the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . 
I mean , 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . 
But I think that should be  
I mean um , I can speak with the button department , 
but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating . 
So that should be simple . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , 
I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Actually , I mean , these first two points we've already sort of gone away from , 
'cause our rubber one is not fancy  
I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . 
If that's what people want then we  maybe we're going in the wrong direction . 
And it's it's not technologically innovative either . 
Mm . 
So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other 
electronics ? 
Yeah , that's basically what it allows you to do , 
right ? 
Yeah , the  that wouldn't be the remote so much , 
I mean  
Mm . 
Yes , so can  
Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating  like the energy generator . 
<laugh> 
 we're all about that . 
Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them . 
 . 
Yeah , that's great for us . 
Right . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that's great . 
Yeah , I don't know how we incorporate  
We don't have to follow every trend , I guess . 
Uh-huh . 
The power button could be like a big apple or something . 
They don they don't own <other> all images of apples . <laugh> 
Okay , we'll make it a uh pomegranate , a big pomegranate . 
 . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Sure . 
The one thing I'm wondering about , I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having  
I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote . 
I mean <other> what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ? <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh>  
Mm . 
Yeah I mean , that that seems to work well with for products like iPod , 
where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing . 
Right . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
<other> Oh right . 
Yeah . 
That sounds good . 
Mm . 
Right . 
Alright . 
Yeah . <other> 
Yeah . 
Mm , I think we all know what we need to do now . 
Okay . 
Okay , 
I'll stay in here . 
<laugh> 
Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that  
So we're buying fut I mean , we're getting futures in the company  . <laugh> 
<laugh> So we really have a incentive to make this remote work . 
I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits , because that's really doing well . 
Yeah . <laugh>  . 
This company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots . <laugh> 
Yeah , we're definitely not in the money making department . 
Well I I did notice looking at  
I mean , they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R_R_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable . 
I mean , if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page , it's not obvious . 
R_R_ . 
Well it is to us , because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine , 
but it's  doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black . 
No . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Right , well , I guess that's us . 
Okay . Right .
