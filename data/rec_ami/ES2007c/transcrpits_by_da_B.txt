<laugh> 
 . 
Almost . <laugh> 
Mm 'kay . 
<other> 
No no no no , it's fine I'm just preparing . 
Okay . 
Where is that thing ? 
Oh sorry , couldn't see . 
Would that work ? 
<other> Okay , so that's me again . 
<other> Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , 
a hand dynamo which is  which was used uh in the fifties for torches , 
if you remember that kind of  
which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v 
yeah , yeah . 
It wouldn't be very fancy . 
You can have a kinetic provision of energy , 
which is used on some watches these days . 
So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that  it will give it the energy to work . 
Or you can use solar cells , 
but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but  
Yeah . 
I dunno actually . 
I dunno . 
Um . 
Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . 
And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , 
but I don't know if it's worth the cost . 
So we've got to discuss that . 
<other> For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . 
You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , 
if you know what I mean , so  
You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing . 
So  
<other> Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . 
And th for each of them you have uh cases where  for example titanium , you can't use it for  if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . 
And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , 
so we just have to take that into account . 
But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . 
And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And also it doesn't break as easily maybe , 
I dunno  
<laugh> 
So rubber would be  Okay . 
Uh s so if d 
okay . 
And then there are the push-buttons , 
so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , 
um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display . 
Um scroll buttons , as well . 
So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . 
So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . 
Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . 
So it's a constraint . 
Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? 
<other> If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , 
if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons . 
If that makes sense . 
Yeah .  . 
No , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing , 
then you have the case is uh , whether it's flat or curved . 
And that's  <other> 
we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , 
but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . 
So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . 
And I'm just saying if it  if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go  
I dunno why , 
but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons . 
So , either  
I dunno 
we just need to decide on the on the case . 
Let's go crazy . 
<laugh> And then , do I have a last slide ? 
Yes , I do . 
Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be  
so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . 
Um and the price that go with it with it , 
so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . 
Uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . 
If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive . 
Mm . 
 . 
Yeah . 
The infra-red . 
Yeah . 
Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . 
It's less expensive mm  
Technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too . <other> 
Fo 
It doesn't , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
Totally . 
Yeah . 
So let's not go for the  
Yeah , yeah . I agree . 
So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons . 
Well  
It'd be it'd be cool , but they are saying they've just developed it , 
I'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and  
Hm . 
<laugh> Just if you are really lonely , maybe . <laugh> 
Channel five . And then it switches on . 
<laugh> 
Okay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide 
and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . 
So for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the  
Cheaper option . 
Are you happy with that ? 
Okay . So we'll go for the battery . 
Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ? 
Double ? 
Okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , 
and that's fine ? 
P 
Yeah . 
I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a  
That they don't . <other> 
Mm . 
<other> 
Alright , that's me done . 
Sorry . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well  
Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to um um connect  for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now . 
Things like that . 
No i 
No , but if you get Bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to  
I with the television , yeah . 
 I was just trying to find an advantage . 
Wha what w what advantage would you get for the  
Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . 
It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet . 
Change the batteries ever again . 
<laugh> Yeah , 
well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<other> Yep . 
<laugh> No vegetables . 
Well yeah , but Apple would sue you for that . 
 sued the Beatles so  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Why not ? 
<laugh> 
 I'm gonna write that down . 
<laugh> 
That's  yeah . 
Although I'd be curious to see how many uh  
You know , there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose , and I would be curious how many people choose that colour . 
Mm . 
And produce less of the silly colours , maybe . 
<other> 
Yep . 
Alright . 
Mm . 
Cool . 
It is . 
<laugh> 
Great . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> That's true . 
<laugh> Doesn't  
Yeah . 
Are we taking these off ?
