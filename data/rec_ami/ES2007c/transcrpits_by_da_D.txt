Oh right okay . 
<laugh> I cover myself up . <other> 
 . 
<cough> I've always wanted one of these , I really have . 
<laugh> Where do you buy 'em from ? <laugh> 
They're  . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Oh my gosh . 
<other>  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<Random sound> 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
<cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
<cough> 
<cough> 
Batteries . 
It's here . 
<cough> 
Ah . 
<other> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
I think rubber's  
But after my after my fashion thing , I think you'll realise that rubber is more  
People . <other> 
<cough> 
What about the just developed uh sample sensor ? 
G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing . 
Mm , I dunno . 
Be cool . 
<laugh> Channel two . <laugh> 
Oh , it just gives an answer . 
Oh , then then  
I thought I thought it was  when they said  
I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like , 
channel five , and it will change . 
Like you talk to it . 
Can I have channel five ? 
Oh , then  forget about it . 
Oh right okay . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
So it will look like something like this . 
 . 
Yeah . 
Well the rubber push-buttons  . Don't you have to move your  
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah , the rubber's good . 
Yeah , so they can sit there and go like  
<laugh> 
<cough> 
<cough> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
That does get annoying . 
Uh-huh . 
Well  
<cough> 
Maybe we can  
Right . 
Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets 
and what the fashions are for next year . Um . 
So yes <other> , 
so from looking at this year's trends and fashions 
and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , 
we have found that for the remote control market <other> these are like most important aspects like that we really need to  
which we've already probably discussed . 
Um <other> the most important aspect is look and feel . 
So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already  that we already have . 
So it has to be  
Yep . 
Exactly . 
<other> Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . 
So  
<laugh> Technologically it should be like um work , basically , I guess . It should work . 
Should  
That's new . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
So ,  no loose  
That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 
'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 
'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is <laugh> , 
like people  
and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , 
they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . 
Well , they do , but it's like it's not  
Yeah , but it looks good . 
If it looks good and it's  it can just be there for decoration . <laugh> 
But like  
You could always insert , yeah . 
Yeah , but , I mean , people like  
Well , if you're looking at <other>  if you  looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . 
Well , it doesn't  
Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , 
that was just an idea , 
but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . 
Whether it's a battery  
it could be something really really minor , you know , like  
but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it . 
If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have 
and um just go creative . 
And then you can market it . 
Never have to change a battery again . <laugh> 
<cough> 
I think , safety s 
Yeah . 
Third most important aspect <laugh> uh is it's easy to use . 
And I think we've all um worked that out . 
Um okay , in the fashion , how it's supposed to look . 
Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . 
<other> So next year people will be buying <laugh> , 
I found this really funny <laugh> , 
you know , strawberry shaped chairs , 
Yeah . 
Rubber things . 
<other> Um <other> 
and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , 
so it's it's not quite spongy , but spongy , I would say is  
yeah , so we're in . 
<other> Yeah . 
And so personal  what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , 
while still keeping to the company's image , basically . 
So yeah . 
 . I had to say  
So we're moving in the right direction like  
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
Maybe make it like fruity colours or something . 
Some sort . 
Or  
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Well <other>  
I think , if it's rubber it needs to be 
different . 
I think , it's  it should be  
I mean , what do you associate with rubber ? 
You know like 
really different colours basically . 
Okay , sor I sorry , I used the wrong word , 
what do you associate with the mate the material <laugh> that material ? 
<laugh> Um <laugh>  <laugh> 
Um like I'm just thinking bright colours . 
Bright natural colours , 
nothing too  
Bright , but too  not  
yeah . 
<other> Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . 
Wanna make it different colours so <other> anybody can choo like like   
Yeah . 
And on the back of it have the logo . 
<laugh> 
Well <other>  
I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool . 
Like  
and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , Mummy I wanna buy that one . 
<laugh> And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's um 
like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around . 
Especially with younger kids , you know they can pick it up and and  
Yeah . 
The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but <laugh>  
Yeah . 
So <laugh> 
so it's rea it's quite 
it's quite like um user friendly 
and also for different families , like like family use as well , 
so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think . 
Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like  pink remote control for their room something . 
Yeah . 
So like you walk in , you're like , oh I like that remote control , because it's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ? 
and then they go like , oh I can choose the colour <other> wow . 
So it puts , I think , even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of , you've got all colour it's either that or nothing . 
So they also get to pick . 
Well , personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour . 
It's um  
Yeah . 
Mm . 
D you've got the  
<other> Evaluation . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
S 
This gives you all the details ? 
<laugh> 
 <laugh> um . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<other> 
Mm . 
<other> 
Mm .
