A:  Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting . 
A:  Um <other> which was we got together just to basically decide on  well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing ,

abst_sum - abstract: The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting.

B:  <other> Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , 
B:  a hand dynamo which is  which was used uh in the fifties for torches , 
B:  You can have a kinetic provision of energy , 
B:  Or you can use solar cells , 
B:  but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but  
C:  Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with  but also using some solar power . 
B:  And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , 
B:  Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . 
B:  <other> For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . 
B:  You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , 
B:  <other> Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . 
B:  And th for each of them you have uh cases where  for example titanium , you can't use it for  if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . 
B:  But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . 
B:  so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , 
B:  um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display . 
B:  Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . 
B:  Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be  
B:  If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive .

abst_sum - abstract: The industrial designer discussed different options for batteries, materials, and components, as well as restrictions involved in combining particular materials, components, and batteries.

A:  So that might be an idea of using the rubber , 
B:  And also it doesn't break as easily maybe , 
A:  Rubber , we're all we're all going  we're all liking that idea ? 
C:  Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double  rubber double curved case ? <laugh> 
A:  Let's have rubber push buttons , hey . 
A:  <other> is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ? 
B:  Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . 
A:  If it's something that's inside the the unit . <other> I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . 
A:  So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print . 
D:  What about the just developed uh sample sensor ? 
B:  I'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and  
C:  it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns  comes on , 
C:  a it just gives you a verbal response . 
D:  Oh , then  forget about it . 
C:  So rubber rubber keys , yeah . 
C:  so we want it rub rubber double curved . <laugh> 
A:  But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific

abst_sum - abstract: The team then discussed and decided what materials, components, and what type of battery to use in their product.

C:  Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . 
C:  Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . 
C:  they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . 
C:  So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface . 
C:  I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . 
C:  but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , 
C:  but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . 
C:  I can give you an example here of uh ,  good layout and bad layout 
C:  So this would be an example of bad layout , 
C:  where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh 
C:  Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose . 
C:  Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . 
C:  I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . 
C:  So we're  we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh . 
C:  I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , 
C:  ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . 
C:  it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . 
C:  Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , 
C:  Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , 
C:  I I guess <other> the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before .

abst_sum - abstract: The interface specialist presented examples of existing remotes on the market with good and bad layouts and stated what features the remote required.

D:  Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets 
D:  So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already  that we already have . 
D:  <other> Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . 
D:  Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . 
C:  Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them . 
D:  and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , 
A:  Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there .

abst_sum - abstract: The marketing expert discussed research from trendwatching reports, finding that products now require technological innovativeness, a fancy look and feel, a spongy feel, and a fruit and vegetable theme.

A:  now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap . 
C:  I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . 
D:  That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 
D:  'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is <laugh> , 
D:  they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . 
A:  Of course , they do . 
C:  So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other 
A:  that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , 
D:  Well , if you're looking at <other>  if you  looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . 
D:  Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth ,

A:  and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though .

C:  The power button could be like a big apple or something . 
D:  Um like I'm just thinking bright colours . 
D:  Wanna make it different colours so <other> anybody can choo like like   
A:  so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the
