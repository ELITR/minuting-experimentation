I feel like Madonna with one of these on . 
I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Right . Hello everybody . 
Back again for another wonderful meeting . 
Is uh everyone ready ? 
Okay , 
we c we can hold on for a minute . 
I figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . <laugh> 
Are you ready ? 
Okay , right , well , 
I take it that you are all ready now . 
Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting . 
Um <other> which was we got together just to basically decide on  well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , 
and who we all are and stuff like that , 
mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . 
<other> Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um 
now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff 
and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that , 
that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , 
see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . 
Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations , 
whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . 
Um I'd like to um hear 
o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first . 
I want  
what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and 
It's just that  
yeah , let's let's hear from you first . 
Get yourself in position . <laugh> 
I don't think any of us remember the fifties . 
Do  sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ? 
Does anybody know ? 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Okay , jolly good . 
What's a double curved one ? 
Okay . 
So that might be an idea of using the rubber , 
but then it should , you know  
yeah . 
 when a T_V_ programme's got one  
watching the match and  your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you . 
Yeah , I like that idea . 
Rubber , we're all we're all going  we're all liking that idea ? 
You think you can market that ? 
Ooh , we like rubber , ooh . <laugh> 
Uh-huh . 
Well , we're gonna go with  I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so  
 push buttons instead of the wheel ? 
 rubble double double . <laugh> 
I'll have a Big Mac , please . <laugh> 
Let's have rubber push buttons , hey . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Simple , yeah . 
Chip on print . It's a bit  . 
<other> 
Okay , uh what I'm not understanding here 
<other> is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ? 
Right . 
Um what a what alternatives do we have to that ? 
<other> Y um <other> 
what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ? 
<other> so it sounds  
So , why would we not go for that ? 
If it's something that's inside the the unit . <other> I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . 
Um we wanna go for an i i all <other> 
so long as it works , 
you know . 
So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print . 
Yeah . 
S yeah , push buttons . 
What about what ? 
Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ? 
S 
Yeah . 
It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Basic battery . 
It's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work . 
We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ? 
The the  <other>  
The double whopper , please . 
Yep , 
but  
we're going for the simple buttons . 
Yeah . 
And it's cheapest all round , 
it sounds kinda funky , 
and we can also market it 
as i 'cause we were s saying earl 
you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_  people were getting the  complaining about R_S_I_ , and this is anti-R_S_I_ . 
So that's another marketing point that we can use . 
But anything is gonna have buttons . 
Even if it's a jog wheel , it's still repetitive . 
You  
You see , you can still get  it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . 
It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same  doing the same movement . 
It's not actually what you are doing . 
But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific  
Yeah . 
And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children  yeah . 
Okay , Gabriel . Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's  the interface . 
Great . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Do we have an uh example of a good one ? 
 <laugh> Brilliant . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Well let's um  
so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? 
The um  
The the um the interface type we're going for  
Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay , 
and we're not  yeah . 
 Are we gonna hav hav  an  are we d 
have we decided on whether 
w we're gonna s supplement it with anything , 
you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , 
we're not we're just gonna go for something  
We're  
Yeah . 
Yeah . Okay . Okey-dokey . 
Yeah , I don't have any other questions on this . 
Let's move over to  
Yeah , sure . 
 . 
Yeah , the button that just does that , yeah . 
Cool . 
Mm yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
Yeah , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ? 
What's that mean ? 
Okay , 
now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap . 
Yeah . 
Maybe we could um  
Of course , they do . 
<other> One hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , oh I'm not gonna buy that , 'cause I dunno if it works or not . 
Okay , well , 
what do you two think about this ? 
Yeah , what  I don't understand what m 
Yeah , 
and it  this is just gonna   
all this is being used for is your television . 
It would  
that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , 
does it ? 
That would mean we'd have to make a television as well . 
No , that would be your telephone  in with your television . 
<other> Yeah , 
and i 
Nah , the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible , basically . 
An and there is no there is no such thing 
Okay . 
Okay . <other> Yeah , this  that's that's very good . 
And and this is all tying in very nicely . 
The fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . 
Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it . 
But yeah , by the squeezing it the  
Yeah , that's a great idea . Well done . 
Yeah . 
I wanna watch the pineapple channel . <laugh> 
Well spongy , that's where  . 
Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there . 
Okay . 
Alright , yeah , no , this i this is good , 
so through all that we've  we go we're  
right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , 
that's great , 
using the spongy rubber that we were talking about 
that anti-R_S_I_ you can  as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries <other> , 
and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though . 
 . 
Yeah , this is true  . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is its image . 
Like , yeah , we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , 
or like are we going  yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ? 
I mean you said earlier on i <other> it should be funky . 
<laugh> L keep it clean , keep it clean . <laugh> 
Bright , but not too bright . <laugh> 
Like the volume buttons should be the  all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ? 
Okay , 
what  ? 
Okay . 
Tha 
Yeah , 
I mean we  that's we we  
Yeah . 
<laugh> This is the remote control tomato . <laugh> 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Well , it's it's gotta be chew proof . <other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different  
so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the  
Mm . 
Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know , 
if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular . 
Mm . 
Okay . Alright . Well um , we'll  alright let's  
what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um 
<other> is 
from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design . 
Um Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know  come up with the the user interface design . 
Then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this . 
You won't be going off to your separate offices . 
Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay . 
I think , yeah , it's gonna <other> you know , 
come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas . 
'Cause at the moment , uh you know , it's it's hard . 
We were kinda going , yeah , it's gotta feel nice , it's gotta look cool and that it's  
you know now we can actually start , 
you know , s some sort of physical something or other . 
Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation . 
Um . 
<other> And I <laugh> will be uh 
talking to the bosses , basically , and uh 
f fielding off some more spam and 
uh 
that's it really . 
Keeping things t well , 
uh you know , ho hopefully uh keeping things together . Um . 
Yeah , that's  
This is this is uh good . 
So we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on . 
We definitely know how it's powered , 
we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons , 
we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things , so we've we're keeping the costs down . 
It's this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky . 
Don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff . 
People , you know , people are saying , oh , standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury , well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite , 
It's supposed to fix it rather than cause it . Um . 
 you know , we're gonna we 
we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it , 
you know what what extra things  are there extra things this product have ? 
We'll look into this lock key 
facility , 
although whether or not it happens , <other> or is possible , I don't know , 
but something to look into . 
Okay . I think that's um  
well done everybody . 
Anyone have any uh any questions , 
everyone know what they're doing ? 
'Cause if you don't , you'll  I'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it . 
Okay . right well . 
It's um we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish . 
But um 
I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together  
so bef before you all disappear off just 
hold hold fire . Um . 
<other> Um I think , it's uh , yeah , I think , it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product . 
Yeah , I think i I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment . <laugh> 
Yeah . Yeah . 
I want a share in the space rocket . 
Did you  see that this k that this company  we've made a spaceship . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
 . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
And the spaceship doesn't have the R_ <laugh>  have a massive R_ and R_ down the side of it 
but  I still want one . <laugh> 
Okay . Um I've just had a sign flashing up saying , finish the meeting . 
Uh <other> .
