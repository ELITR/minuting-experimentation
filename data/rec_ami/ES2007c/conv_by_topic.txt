D:  Oh right okay . <laugh> I cover myself up . <other> 
A:  I feel like Madonna with one of these on . I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:   . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <cough> I've always wanted one of these , I really have . <laugh> Where do you buy 'em from ? <laugh> They're  . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <other> 
D:  <other> 
A:  Right . Hello everybody . Back again for another wonderful meeting . Is uh everyone ready ? Okay , we c we can hold on for a minute . 
C:  Hello . 
B:   . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Almost . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Oh my gosh . <other>  <laugh> 
A:  I figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive . 
D:  <other> <Random sound> <laugh> 
B:  Mm 'kay .

A:  Are you ready ? Okay , right , well , I take it that you are all ready now . Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting . Um <other> which was we got together just to basically decide on  well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , and who we all are and stuff like that , mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . 
D:  <cough> <cough> 
A:  <other> Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <cough> 
C:  Hmm . <other> Do you have any preference uh of order ? 
A:  Um I'd like to um hear o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first . I want  what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and 
D:  <cough> 
B:  <other> 
D:  Batteries . 
C:  I think she is still finishing her  . <laugh> 
B:  No no no no , it's fine I'm just preparing . 
A:  It's just that  yeah , let's let's hear from you first . 
C:  Hmm . 
B:  Okay . 
topic_description:	opening_None


B:  Where is that thing ? Oh sorry , couldn't see . 
C:  Okay , it's uh <other>  
D:  It's here . <cough> 
B:  Would that work ? 
A:  Get yourself in position . <laugh> 
D:  Ah . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


B:  <other> Okay , so that's me again . <other> 
A:  <other> Simple , yeah . Chip on print . It's a bit  . <other> 
topic_description:	industrial designer presentation_None


B:  Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is  which was used uh in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of  which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v yeah , yeah . It wouldn't be very fancy . You can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that  it will give it the energy to work . Or you can use solar cells , but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but  
A:  I don't think any of us remember the fifties . 
C:  Is it like a crank thing or something  . 
D:  <other> Mm . 
C:  Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with  but also using some solar power . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Do  sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ? 
D:  Mm . 
B:  I dunno actually . 
A:  Does anybody know ? 
C:  Uh I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know . 
B:  I dunno . Um . Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , but I don't know if it's worth the cost . So we've got to discuss that . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  Mm . Okay , jolly good . 
B:  <other> For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what I mean , so  
A:  What's a double curved one ? 
B:  You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing . So  
A:  Okay . 
B:  <other> Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . And th for each of them you have uh cases where  for example titanium , you can't use it for  if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could uh  
A:  So that might be an idea of using the rubber , but then it should , you know  yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Let's have a squeezable remote . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . And also it doesn't break as easily maybe , I dunno  
A:   when a T_V_ programme's got one  watching the match and  your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you . Yeah , I like that idea . 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . Mm . 
B:  So rubber would be  Okay . 
D:  I think rubber's  
A:  Rubber , we're all we're all going  we're all liking that idea ? You think you can market that ? 
D:  But after my after my fashion thing , I think you'll realise that rubber is more  
B:  Uh s so if d okay . 
A:  Ooh , we like rubber , ooh . <laugh> 
D:  People . <other> 
B:  And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display . Um scroll buttons , as well . 
A:  Uh-huh . 
B:  So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . So it's a constraint . 
A:  Well , we're gonna go with  I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so  
B:  Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? <other> If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons . If that makes sense . 
A:   push buttons instead of the wheel ? 
B:  Yeah .  . 
C:  If it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway ,  it doesn't matter if it's double  I mean isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , I mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double  rubber double curved case ? <laugh> 
A:   rubble double double . <laugh> 
B:  No , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing , 
A:  I'll have a Big Mac , please . <laugh> 
B:  then you have the case is uh , whether it's flat or curved . And that's  <other> we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . And I'm just saying if it  if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go  I dunno why , but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  So , either  I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case . 
A:  Let's have rubber push buttons , hey . 
C:  Okay . Go rubber . Go rubber the whole way . 
B:  Let's go crazy . <laugh> And then , do I have a last slide ? Yes , I do . Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be  so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . Um and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . Uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive . 
A:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


A:  Okay , uh what I'm not understanding here 
B:  Mm . 
A:  <other> is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ? 
B:   . Yeah . 
D:  <cough> 
B:  The infra-red . Yeah . 
A:  Right . Um what a what alternatives do we have to that ? <other> Y um <other> what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ? 
B:  Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . It's less expensive mm  
A:  <other> so it sounds  
B:  Technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too . <other> 
A:  So , why would we not go for that ? If it's something that's inside the the unit . <other> I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . Um we wanna go for an i i all <other> so long as it works , 
B:  Fo It doesn't , yeah , yeah , yeah . Totally . Yeah . So let's not go for the  Yeah , yeah . I agree . 
A:  you know . So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print . 
B:  So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons . 
A:  Yeah . S yeah , push buttons . 
D:  What about the just developed uh sample sensor ? 
C:  I think push-buttons is  
A:  What about what ? 
D:  G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing . 
B:  Well  
A:  Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ? 
D:  Mm , I dunno . Be cool . <laugh> Channel two . <laugh> 
B:  It'd be it'd be cool , but they are saying they've just developed it , I'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  S 
C:  Th the the <other> speech recognition um option is  it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh , 'cause uh  
A:  Yeah . It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product . 
C:  The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi um  That when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello Rick , or whatever . But , I mean , it's not  it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns  comes on , but it's not that . It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response . So , yeah , I mean , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , I mean , hello , how how are you ? <laugh> Yeah , if you're really lonely , it is it's  
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Hm . 
D:  Oh , it just gives an answer . Oh , then then  
A:  Yeah . Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  I thought I thought it was  when they said  
B:  <laugh> Just if you are really lonely , maybe . <laugh> 
D:  I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like , channel five , and it will change . Like you talk to it . Can I have channel five ? Oh , then  forget about it . Oh right okay . 
B:  Channel five . And then it switches on . 
C:  No , tha that w that w that would be more promising . It it's just a remote that talks to you . Uh . <laugh> I mean to certain cues . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
topic_description:	discussion_None


B:  Okay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . So for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the  
C:  'Kay . Yeah , I'm fine with the basic battery . 
A:  Basic battery . It's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  Hmm . 
B:  Cheaper option . Are you happy with that ? Okay . So we'll go for the battery . 
D:  Mm . Yeah . 
B:  Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ? 
A:  We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ? 
C:  Yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved . <laugh> 
A:  The the  <other>  
D:  So it will look like something like this . 
B:  Double ? 
A:  The double whopper , please . 
B:  Okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , and that's fine ? 
A:  Yep , but  we're going for the simple buttons . 
C:  So rubber rubber keys , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . And it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_  people were getting the  complaining about R_S_I_ , and this is anti-R_S_I_ . 
B:  P 
C:  Yeah . 
D:   . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  So that's another marketing point that we can use . 
D:  Well the rubber push-buttons  . Don't you have to move your  
A:  But anything is gonna have buttons . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  Even if it's a jog wheel , it's still repetitive . 
B:  I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a  
A:  You  You see , you can still get  it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same  doing the same movement . It's not actually what you are doing . 
B:  That they don't . <other> 
C:   . 
B:  Mm . <other> 
A:  But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific  
D:  Mm . Yeah , the rubber's good . 
C:  Yeah . We're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , so they can sit there and go like  
C:  <other> Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful . 
A:  And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children  yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Oh yeah , I guess T_V_ can be stressful , yeah , if you're watching sports . 
D:  <cough> 
B:  Alright , that's me done . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


C:  Alright . 
A:  Okay , Gabriel . Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's  the interface . 
C:  Alright . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


C:  Yeah , some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about . 
A:  Great . 
B:  Sorry . 
C:  Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them . Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . 
A:  Mm . 
C:  So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface . I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . It's it's pointless . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  Mm . 
C:  Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output . It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ . 
C:  And so , yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of  we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . I think it should be more general . I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . And , yeah , that's it for me . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Let's move over to  
C:  I I guess <other> the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . I mean , 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . But I think that should be  I mean um , I can speak with the button department , but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating . So that should be simple . 
A:  Yeah , sure .  . Yeah , the button that just does that , yeah . Cool . 
topic_description:	interface specialist presentation_None


C:  Uh so yeah , they they also give the uh  they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . Um so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing . Um the other suggestion , and I I have a feeling that 
D:  Mm . 
A:  Mm . Yeah . 
D:  Mm . That does get annoying . 
C:  we're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have  lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or  , or uh something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . But you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . Uh  um  
A:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


C:  So , the key layout and design are really crucial . You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . And I didn't mention that we need a power button  in our last  I can give you an example here of uh ,  good layout and bad layout 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  uh from our manufacturing department . So this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  it's sort of confusing for the user . Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose . <laugh> And for  something for kids . 
A:  Do we have an uh example of a good one ?  <laugh> Brilliant . 
D:  Uh-huh . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Well  
C:  Yeah . Um . 
A:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	existing products_None


A:  Okay . Well let's um  so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? The um  The the um the interface type we're going for  
C:  So we're  we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh . So , yeah , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . Um . 
A:  Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons . 
C:  I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Uh . And some sort of  it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that . 
A:  Yeah . Okay , and we're not  yeah .  Are we gonna hav hav  an  are we d have we decided on whether 
C:  Well now that we've decided on our  
D:  <cough> 
A:  w we're gonna s supplement it with anything , you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go for something  
C:  Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , but um  
A:  We're  
D:  Maybe we can  
C:  Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Okey-dokey . Yeah , I don't have any other questions on this . 
topic_description:	discussion_None


D:  Right . Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets 
A:  Mm yeah . 
D:  and what the fashions are for next year . Um . 
D:  <other> Yeah . And so personal  what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company's image , basically . So yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
D:   . I had to say  So we're moving in the right direction like  
C:  Right . Yeah . 
B:  <other> Yep . 
C:  Yeah , that's great . 
D:  <laugh> Mm . 
topic_description:	marketing expert presentation_None


D:  So yes <other> , so from looking at this year's trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market <other> these are like most important aspects like that we really need to  which we've already probably discussed . Um <other> the most important aspect is look and feel . So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already  that we already have . So it has to be  
A:  Mm-hmm . <other> Yeah , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ? 
D:  Yep . Exactly . <other> Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . So  
C:  Mm . Yeah . 
A:  What's that mean ? 
D:  <laugh> Technologically it should be like um work , basically , I guess . It should work . 
C:  Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market . 
D:  Should  That's new . 
topic_description:	trendwatching_None


A:  Okay , now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . Actually , I mean , these first two points we've already sort of gone away from , 'cause our rubber one is not fancy  I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . If that's what people want then we  maybe we're going in the wrong direction . And it's it's not technologically innovative either . 
D:  Yeah . Mm . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  So ,  no loose  
A:  Maybe we could um  
C:  Mm . 
topic_description:	discussion_None


D:  That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is <laugh> , like people  and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . 
A:  Of course , they do . <other> One hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , oh I'm not gonna buy that , 'cause I dunno if it works or not . 
D:  Well , they do , but it's like it's not  Yeah , but it looks good . If it looks good and it's  it can just be there for decoration . <laugh> 
A:  Okay , well , what do you two think about this ? 
C:  So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other 
D:  But like  
C:  electronics ? 
A:  Yeah , what  I don't understand what m 
D:  You could always insert , yeah . 
C:  Yeah , that's basically what it allows you to do , right ? 
A:  Yeah , and it  this is just gonna   all this is being used for is your television . 
D:  Yeah , but , I mean , people like  
A:  It would  that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , does it ? 
D:  Well , if you're looking at <other>  if you  looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . 
B:  Well  
A:  That would mean we'd have to make a television as well . 
B:  Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to um um connect  for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now . Things like that . 
A:  No , that would be your telephone  in with your television . 
C:  Yeah , the  that wouldn't be the remote so much , I mean  
B:  No i 
A:  <other> Yeah , and i 
B:  No , but if you get Bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to  
A:  Nah , the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible , basically . An and there is no there is no such thing . 
B:  I with the television , yeah .  I was just trying to find an advantage . Wha what w what advantage would you get for the  
C:  Mm . 
D:  Well , it doesn't  Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . Whether it's a battery  it could be something really really minor , you know , like  but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it . If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have 
A:  Okay . 
D:  and um just go creative . 
B:  Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet . 
A:  Okay . <other> Yeah , this  that's that's very good . 
D:  And then you can market it . Never have to change a battery again . <laugh> 
B:  Change the batteries ever again . 
A:  And and this is all tying in very nicely . The fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it . 
D:  <cough> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah , well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much . <laugh> 
C:  Yes , so can  
D:  I think , safety s 
A:  But yeah , by the squeezing it the  
C:  Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating  like the energy generator . 
A:  Yeah , that's a great idea . Well done . 
D:  Yeah .

C:  Uh-huh . 
D:  Or  
C:  The power button could be like a big apple or something . 
D:  Mm . <laugh>

C:   . 
A:  Like , yeah , we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , or like are we going  yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ? 
D:  Well <other>  I think , if it's rubber it needs to be 
A:  I mean you said earlier on i <other> it should be funky . 
D:  different . I think , it's  it should be  I mean , what do you associate with rubber ? You know like 
A:  <laugh> L keep it clean , keep it clean . <laugh> 
D:  really different colours basically . Okay , sor I sorry , I used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material <laugh> that material ? <laugh> Um <laugh>  <laugh> Um like I'm just thinking bright colours . 
B:  <laugh> <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Bright natural colours , nothing too  
A:  Bright , but not too bright . <laugh> 
D:  Bright , but too  not  yeah . <other> Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . Wanna make it different colours so <other> anybody can choo like like   
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Like the volume buttons should be the  all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ? 
C:  Mm . 
D:  Yeah . And on the back of it have the logo . 
A:  Okay , what  ? 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Sure . 
B:  Why not ? 
A:  Okay . 
C:  The one thing I'm wondering about , I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having  I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote . I mean <other> what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ? <laugh> 
A:  Tha Yeah , I mean we  that's we we  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> This is the remote control tomato . <laugh> 
D:  Well <other>  I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool . Like  and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , Mummy I wanna buy that one . <laugh> And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's um 
A:  <other> 
D:  like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around . Especially with younger kids , you know they can pick it up and and  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but <laugh>  
A:  Well , it's it's gotta be chew proof . <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . So <laugh> so it's rea it's quite it's quite like um user friendly and also for different families , like like family use as well , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think . Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like  pink remote control for their room something . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:   I'm gonna write that down . 
C:  <laugh>  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different  so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  That's  yeah . 
C:  Mm . 
D:  So like you walk in , you're like , oh I like that remote control , because it's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ? and then they go like , oh I can choose the colour <other> wow . So it puts , I think , even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of , you've got all colour it's either that or nothing . So they also get to pick . Well , personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour . 
C:  Yeah I mean , that that seems to work well with for products like iPod , where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing . 
D:  It's um  Yeah . 
A:  Mm . 
D:  Mm . D you've got the  
B:  Although I'd be curious to see how many uh  You know , there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose , and I would be curious how many people choose that colour . 
C:  Right . 
A:  Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know , if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  And produce less of the silly colours , maybe . 
A:  Mm . 
B:  <other>
