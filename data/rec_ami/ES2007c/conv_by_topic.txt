Um <other> which was we got together just to basically decide on  well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , and who we all are and stuff like that , mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . 
D:  <cough> <cough> 
A:  <other> Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <cough> 
C:  Hmm . <other> Do you have any preference uh of order ? 
A:  Um I'd like to um hear o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first . I want  what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and 
D:  <cough> 
B:  <other> 
D:  Batteries . 
C:  I think she is still finishing her  . <laugh> 
B:  No no no no , it's fine I'm just preparing . 
A:  It's just that  yeah , let's let's hear from you first . 
C:  Hmm . 
B:  Okay . 


B:  Where is that thing ? Oh sorry , couldn't see . 
C:  Okay , it's uh <other>  
D:  It's here . <cough> 
B:  Would that work ? 
A:  Get yourself in position . <laugh> 
D:  Ah . 


B:  <other> Okay , so that's me again . <other> 
A:  <other> Simple , yeah . Chip on print . It's a bit  . <other> 


C:  Alright . 
A:  Okay , Gabriel . Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's  the interface . 
C:  Alright . 


C:  Yeah , some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about . 
A:  Great . 
B:  Sorry . 
C:  Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them . Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . 
A:  Mm . 
C:  So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface . I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . It's it's pointless . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  Mm . 
C:  Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output . It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ . 
C:  And so , yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of  we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . I think it should be more general . I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . And , yeah , that's it for me . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Let's move over to  
C:  I I guess <other> the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . I mean , 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . But I think that should be  I mean um , I can speak with the button department , but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating . So that should be simple . 
A:  Yeah , sure .  . Yeah , the button that just does that , yeah . Cool . 


D:  Right . Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets 
A:  Mm yeah . 
D:  and what the fashions are for next year . Um . 
D:  <other> Yeah . And so personal  what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company's image , basically . So yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
D:   . I had to say  So we're moving in the right direction like  
C:  Right . Yeah . 
B:  <other> Yep . 
C:  Yeah , that's great . 
D:  <laugh> Mm . 


A:  Alright , yeah , no , this i this is good , so through all that we've  we go we're  right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , that's great , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can  as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries <other> , 


A:  Okay . Alright . Well um , we'll  alright let's  what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um <other> is from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design . 
B:  Yep . 
A:  Um Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know  come up with the the user interface design . Then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this . You won't be going off to your separate offices . 
B:  Alright . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay . 
C:  <other> Oh right . 
A:  I think , yeah , it's gonna <other> you know , come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas . 'Cause at the moment , uh you know , it's it's hard . We were kinda going , yeah , it's gotta feel nice , it's gotta look cool and that it's  you know now we can actually start , 
B:  Mm . Cool . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  It is . 
A:  you know , s some sort of physical something or other . 
C:  That sounds good . 
A:  Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation . 
D:  <other> Evaluation . 
A:  Um . <other> And I <laugh> will be uh 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  talking to the bosses , basically , and uh 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  f fielding off some more spam and uh 
B:  Great . 
A:  that's it really . Keeping things t well , uh you know , ho hopefully uh keeping things together . Um . Yeah , that's  This is this is uh good . So we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on . We definitely know how it's powered , we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons , we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things , so we've we're keeping the costs down . It's this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky . Don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff . People , you know , people are saying , oh , standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury , well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite , 
C:  Mm . 
D:  Mm . Yeah . 
A:  It's supposed to fix it rather than cause it . Um .  you know , we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it , you know what what extra things  are there extra things this product have ? We'll look into this lock key 
C:  Right . 
A:  facility , although whether or not it happens , <other> or is possible , I don't know , but something to look into . Okay . I think that's um  well done everybody . 
C:  Alright . 
A:  Anyone have any uh any questions , everyone know what they're doing ? 'Cause if you don't , you'll  I'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it . 
C:  Yeah . <other> Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Mm , I think we all know what we need to do now . 
D:  S This gives you all the details ? 
A:  Okay . right well . It's um we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  But um 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together  so bef before you all disappear off just 
C:  Okay , I'll stay in here . 
D:   <laugh> um . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  hold hold fire . Um . 


C:  Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that  
A:  <other> Um I think , it's uh , yeah , I think , it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  So we're buying fut I mean , we're getting futures in the company  . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , I think i I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> So we really have a incentive to make this remote work . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits , because that's really doing well . 
A:  I want a share in the space rocket . Did you  see that this k that this company  we've made a spaceship . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh>  . 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  This company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots . <laugh> 
D:  <other> 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah , we're definitely not in the money making department . 
D:  <other> 
A:   . 
C:  Well I I did notice looking at  I mean , they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R_R_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  I mean , if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page , it's not obvious . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  R_R_ . Well it is to us , because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine , but it's  doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black . 
A:  Mm . 
B:  <other> That's true . 
A:  And the spaceship doesn't have the R_ <laugh>  have a massive R_ and R_ down the side of it but  I still want one . <laugh> 
C:  No . 
B:  <laugh> Doesn't  
C:  Mm . <laugh> 


A:  Okay . Um I've just had a sign flashing up saying , finish the meeting . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh <other> . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Right , well , I guess that's us . 
A:  Yeah . It's not telling  it's not saying do anything in particular just yet . So maybe you should go back to your own offices .
