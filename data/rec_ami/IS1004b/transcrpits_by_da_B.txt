Yep . 
<laugh> Yes . 
Mm . 
Uh the Powerstick . 
<laugh> 
Maybe a Spanish name would work well . 
Especially if we're selling into the U_S_ market becasue there's a lot of Spanish speakers there . 
Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish . 
Mando . 
What is that ? 
What does it mean in Spanish ? 
Control . 
Okay . 
'Cause it also  like in English it sounds like you know the man's tool you know 
because you know men like to have control of the remote 
so it might  
<laugh> 
The Mando . 
Yeah that's  . 
And we could have some like you d 
you could have the fonts you know special , 
so you have man in like in in uh in one o in one font and then the O_ as like  
Although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though , 
do you ? 
So  
Yeah . 
Marketing . 
Well that's the thing . 
We need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on a  
Um . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
More likely .  
Well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person . 
So unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe 
cut out some  a lot of your market . 
Still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand , right ? 
Well it can still be a  , you can still extend past the hand . 
Uh . 
Well it means  like , this remote here is kind of  is very thin and long so instead of having  you know you might have it kind of  a bit bigger 
or , you know , with maybe some some finger molds or something . 
 
 
Some finger grips maybe . 
You could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything , 
but  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
No . 
<other> I was still uh I was still working on this uh twenty five Euro price point 
because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low uh price 
if if we're  
maybe I can get to this in my presentation though , 
but um yeah . 
Yep . Okay . 
Yeah . 
I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult 
because if you think  if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the  
Uh participant three . 
You might have some background noise from the T_V_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder , so . 
<other> Oh you press a press a button to talk , and the the T_V_ the T_V_ <laugh> sound turns off .  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Okay , so , could I describe the mouse maybe  
be easier to  
could I use the mouse , or  
Mm . Thanks . 
Okay . 
<other> Great <laugh> . 
Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote , 
and just uh looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes , 
and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site . 
So um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days 
and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , 
but it's not really  
it's by no means uh mm you know <other> on it's own in being so expensive . 
There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there . 
So  <other> 
yeah it doe 
it's  
well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen 
except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons . 
Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market , 
I know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L_C_D_ screens 
which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions  d different functions on the screen at different times . 
But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control , and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , 
which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel , 
which I think is  it's a really kind of important design aspect 
um is  it's  
'Cause the thing is what a <other> what we  the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do . 
And obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel . 
Now um 
uh the  
I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel . 
'Cause I know when I um when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad . 
I usually use the up and down 
because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number , and then two numbers , 
so that's just uh  it's annoying . 
So I think a scroll wheel is is quite handy . 
Now um 
the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an L_C_D_ screen , 
and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability . 
One possibility , if we  
now we need to still talk about the price point 
because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro , 
but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen 
so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme's on , 
you know , often you don't know what ch what channel it's on , or you don't know what's on . 
If you have a list of of programs on your L_C_D_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel . 
So if you think about  it's kind of like a  you know in mobile phones now you don't use  you don't remember people's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it . 
So this would be pretty  kind of a handy thing to have , 
but um we we really need t to discuss the price . 
So , I mean there are <other> 
there are uh cheaper  
this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , 
there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . 
So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , 
because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions . 
It it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible 
um because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control . 
And  was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks , 
but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . 
So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want . 
So  
Yeah well we w 
Yeah 
well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control . 
Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . Um 
<other> I I would  
if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way . 
They don't really do anything . 
Maybe you know I  
although I do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever , 
but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good . 
Um <other> but I think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device . 
Um  
<other> Well I guess that depends on how you market it . 
If you <laugh> 
if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can , you know , navigate to a program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy . 
So , but  
yep . 
Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this  a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . 
So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh  something that would be worth implementing . 
Um mm there's the L_C_D_ screen , 
um which maybe maybe is too expensive , 
um but I think also at the scroll wheel , I haven't mentioned it here , 
the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . 
I think even that , 
I mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an L_C_D_ screen , to implement , 
um but I think that would be quite useful as well . 
And the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , 
but I think one  maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of  you can have with technology , 
and maybe we wanna make it something that's <other> extensible to do other tasks . 
Say you have like um <other> a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room . 
You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development , 
but , you know , later on you could you can you know you  
also , selling the potential of the device . 
Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , 
and um , I think that's something we may need to have as as  at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics . 
 
Hmm . 
<other> Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though , 
because , I'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this , but I presume it's not gonna just be English speaking countries . 
So then you have to s you know , you have to train models for  
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
You know I guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know <laugh> turn volume up , and you press the uh press the button 
like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well , by speaking and doing  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> <cough> Actually I'm not so sure 
because I'm the  
you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm  instead of pressing up on on a remote control . 
You know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear , I'm trying to actually find out what's being said , 
so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps . 
<laugh> 
Well it depends if it's a remote control th 
Maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion . 
If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it , then that could be  . 
Well it depends though  well it depends . 
If we we don't  
unless we have some input some video input to the T_V_ or we have control over the T_V_ then we can't actually display that . 
Like if we if we produce the T_V_s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there , 
but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of  something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T_V_ to superimpose those those menus . 
So that's an extra 
cost . 
Well this is this is another que 
we still haven't really defined the remote . 
Are we still  
you say we're focusing on T_V_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ? 
'Cause that really makes a big difference . 
'Cause <other> even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' T_V_s . 
It's just there are too many T_V_s out there . 
It's it's not really gonna  
For twenty five Euro ? <laugh> I think it's impossible . 
But but I dunno , 
I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that  any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro 
because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , 
and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics . 
So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh 
of increasing the unit price . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
because  
yeah . 
Well th 
'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide . 
You can get a lot more information on it . 
So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to . 
You could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something 
so you can quickly just kind of  even without reading  
Well no , 
but there are the electronic programme guides out there . 
They may not have pictures , but maybe they do . 
There's  dependi it also depends on the country . 
No 
but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from . 
So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that . Uh . 
Well I I think if we're gonna  I think we would definitely need the internet connection 
because even with y I don't think you could even get teletext information from the T_V_ onto the remote control , especially if we don't control the T_V_ . 
I dunno . 
We need to find that out . 
Mm . 
If it's a really small T_V_ maybe <laugh> . 
<other> 
Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop 
I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a  you know . 
Well this is what we need to find out . 
Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ? 
'Cause otherwise we need  
It's kind of hard to guarantee that you're gonna  
 
Ninety five percent is not good enough though . 
 
Yep .
