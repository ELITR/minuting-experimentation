<laugh> 
Yep . 
Yeah . Yep . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah 
they are the most T_V_ watcher . 
So we should be careful . 
Yep . 
Well maybe it could be a universal design . 
A universal design , which is which is good for both the hands . 
Yeah ? 
That's right , whether it's left hand or right hand , 
but but <other> don't you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ? 
The first and the third point , they are clashing . 
Okay . 
So fitting the hand doesn't mean much then . 
Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ? 
Little sleek , longer ? 
And it should fit the hand . 
Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
Mm-hm mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
No 
it could be command control kind of thing . 
It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated . 
Means you say  
you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on kind of thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition . 
Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the T_V_ also . 
So there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop . 
It's like V_I_ editor , you are having two modes similarly . 
Otherwise it's just lying idle . 
<laugh> 
Change the channels . 
Yeah . 
Mmm-hmm mm-hmm . 
Yeah yeah . 
But there is one problem  then the user has to understand each of that functionality . 
Because the same button is doing too many things . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
It does sampling out of the  . 
Yep . 
So  yeah . 
So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh , 
that means on my own I  
yeah , it should be . 
Two . 
Okay so the working design is uh 
user i interface could be of two types , 
one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing  doing some he is knowing about that technology . 
So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , 
and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being  sitting on the on the remote . 
So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them , 
and the new users , as uh our Marketing Expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing . 
That's right . 
So anyway , that didn't come into my mind , 
so th that is a possibility . 
These could be other kind of interfaces . 
Means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces . 
So spe buttons are something which is very  everybody is familiar with . 
So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is , 
and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five Euros money which we are thinking . 
Otherwise we are just like others in the market . 
So anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , 
and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which cannot be done now actually . 
So apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons . 
Now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required . 
And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote . 
Uh that's right . 
But uh means we have to see how much  what kind of microphones and stuff like that . 
Uh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough . 
Yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc 
That's right . 
No it it could be little d yeah it could be  
That's right . That's right . 
Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
Uh it's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing 
so D_T_W_ could be kind of which is the easiest . 
So you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself , 
and <other> it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , 
instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller . 
Yeah , that's right . 
Yeah . 
So we can 
That's right . Yep . 
Yep . 
No no . 
Components . 
Yeah . 
So , will you go to the next slide ? 
<laugh> Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so . 
We are having a power button and the switch <laugh> , which is not much , 
and then we are having the  which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . 
And then there are two kind of things which can be  
so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time <laugh> . 
So we could not put that . 
So now where the A_S_R_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there . 
So there is A_S_R_ decoder which could be there , 
and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , 
and then there could be buttons , 
and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . 
And then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , 
and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver . 
So this is the easiest design the there could be . 
So th an A_S_R_ decoder we can have things in  . 
To have different technologies . 
So this was the  
my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control . 
Yeah . 
Yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up . 
So these are the slight problems . 
Because  
yeah 
the reason is that if we go into the market means  
though I don't have much idea , 
but as he  the uh Marketing Expert presentation was  
<laugh> So if we go with just the  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Alright . 
It's not possible . It's impossible . 
Are  
But <other> just a small thing , 
what kind of market we are targeting ? 
Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ? 
So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or  
because the cost of L_C_D_ thing could be as high as the T_V_ itself . 
That is very important . 
<laugh> 
Broke . Okay . Okay . 
Okay . Okay . 
Okay . Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
It's it's cheaper as compared to the L_C_D_ . 
Means th yeah twenty five Euros is  yeah , that's right . 
<laugh> 
Okay .
