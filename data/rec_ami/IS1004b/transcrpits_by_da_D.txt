Uh . <laugh> 
Mm I was thinking of the  
Mando . 
Mando . 
A_N_ yeah D_O . 
It doesn't it doesn't sound cool for me , 
but maybe for a Spanish  for I  for  
Control . 
But  
mm , yeah . 
Mando sounds Latino . <laugh> <other> 
But  
yeah 
it uh  
Yeah because if the product will be international  
Maybe maybe I should uh start . 
Yeah . 
Mm . Okay . 
Yeah . 
Should be in participant four . 
Yeah , yeah . 
<cough> 
Uh . 
Okay so yeah I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting . 
For the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements . 
I prepare a marketing report 
and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls . 
And also I di I did a study with  for the incorporation of new technologies 
it seems that the remote controls have been  have remained the same for the last five , ten years . 
There is no no significant difference between the the b the first new controls and  
Yeah . Yeah . 
Well <cough> <other> more  most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . 
So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control , 
which is which is good and it's interesting point . 
Also the people are worried about about the R_S_I_ disease , 
which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not a  with a not very appropriate device , you you will have problems whe when you will get old . 
So s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control . 
They are also <cough>  
they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often , 
so I think it would be a good point to to l to to find a a solution to  
any beep any alarm or something incorporated to  with the remote control every time it it get lost . 
And also I found that young people  
the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control . 
So <cough> <other> in my opinion the Mando  this Mando shouldn't be very small 
because the smaller it is , the more like  the the liklier it is to get lost . 
Liklier or more likely ? 
 likely . Okay . 
Uh <cough> people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use 
like f uh memorising channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often 
but <other> they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote cont in the remote control . 
Also the z the design should fit the hand shape . 
So it may be interesting to to think in a  in both prototypes , for right and left handed people . 
<other> Yeah . 
I dunno 
I th Anyway I think it could be int interesting to to release some  a a small fraction of of this remote controls . 
Sorry ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Sorry ? 
Yeah . 
Like uh  
Yeah , like  
No no 
I was thinking of so like something  
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah . 
It sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical . 
Not anymore . 
That's what  
yeah . 
And finally , the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , 
but I don't know if the budget would be large enough . 
But most of  yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology . 
Actually this marketing report is restricted to T_V_ remote controls . 
Yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate , 
so  yeah yeah . 
<other> Yeah 
uh channel fifty . 
Yeah . 
H I think I think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard 
because w if people see a remo see the  see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to  very different build  very different to the traditional  
If y 
 
I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo <laugh> everyone will s will buy it . 
I'm sure . 
Yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons , it's about <laugh> 
it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that . 
<other> 
With a good shape for the  
Yeah . 
Uh  
What would be  
Wha but what would be  
one question , 
what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ? 
What what kind of information ? 
Yeah but mo most of the T_V_s nowadays show the show the 
the n 
Yeah 
but yeah most of the T_V_s have teletext nowadays . 
Yeah . 
So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ? 
Okay . 
But  
Yeah . 
I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the  than the L_C_D_ . 
Because with the L_C_D_ you need more requirements . 
You need a internet connection . 
You need m more things . 
But 
for the speech recognition you you don't need anything . 
You just say channel fifty , and that's it . 
But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars , 
it's  
To move to another target ? 
 the expert uh said ninety five percent <laugh> .
