B:  Hi . 
D:  Hi . 
C:  Hello . <laugh> 
A:  Hello . 
B:  Hi everyone . 
D:  So I don't know if you all received the the a agenda for this meeting . Do you  no ? 
C:  No , I haven't . 
D:  Here it is . 
C:  Thank you . 
B:  I haven't . 
D:  So um <other> um the goal for today are um  We have two goals . Uh first is to decide a movie for uh the next projection for our movie club . As you know  uh so it's for the last Friday of this month of April . As you probably remember , the movie already projected were uh Lawrence of Arabia and Apocalypse Now in February and Amadeus from Milos Forman in March . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  <other> So um the question that is open is are we going to select a movie from the nineties and which movie . So that's the first goal , decide for a movie to be projected , and second goal is to uh discuss for an ad advertising poster um for our um <other> uh club , because we noticed that n last time not enough people came to the projection . So that's it . Um wh who wants to start to  So I guess you all prepared some documents for the mm selection of movie . 
A:  Yeah . Yep . 
B:  Yes . So who who has what ? Actually maybe um   
D:  Okay . 
A:  Um I've got a PowerPoint presentation . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  Uh-huh . What do you have , Mirek ? 
C:  Okay , I have a PowerPoint presentation and uh it's about  there are some reviews of the of the I think like seven movies . 
B:  Uh-huh . And I have a uh <other> well just a a piece of paper with some suggestions . What about you , Denis ? 
D:  Yeah , I have also uh a piece of paper with uh my favourite movie . 
B:  Uh-huh . 
D:  <other> Okay , so 
B:   should we start with the two presentations maybe ? Yeah ? 
D:  presentation ? Yeah . Okay . A Agnes , we can start with you ? 
A:  Sure . <other> It's not very long in any case . 


D:  Okay , here it is . 
A:  Yep .  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  I passed this one . 


A:  And the two in particular that I would propose are , next slide please , The Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense . Um I don't know if you've seen any of them . 
A:  So The Usual Suspects is a hundred and five minutes long , so it's a decent length of time . 
D:  Okay . You have a last slide or  no . 
A:  So I think that's it , unless you have any questions . Yeah , that's it . 
B:  Okay . 


C:  Okay , now you can go to to my slides , but actually what I pre what I have prepared is just a kind of a review of fo uh se six or seven movies , if you ca can go to the second slide . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  You sent your slides around , right ? Yeah . 
C:  Yes , basically seven movies , and it's uh it's uh uh top movies uh based on the uh on the ra ranking and a and awards awards . Um you see the the names of the movies on the on the on the wall . So um we can perhaps go through all of them and we can little bit discuss , so I I I have n I didn't see all of them actually , so it's just  we should probably select one of these , because I think uh these are really good movies and uh , okay , we will see . So if you can go through uh <other> okay , so this is the first movie and uh it's it's m it's more like a drama . Uh it's uh it's uh very uh high ranked and actually you have a a nicer list , because uh we can even see the number of the votes . So what is the number of the people ? 
D:  Okay . <other> Yeah one hundred f w uh one hundred forty thousand . 
B:  Yeah , I think your table is very clear Denis . 
C:  Finally I found actually your table much better than my <laugh> than my presentation , because perhaps here we can we can really see I mean  
D:  <other> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  No , we don't have the plot of the of the movie and uh  
C:  What is the ranking ? We ha didn't have the plot , yeah . 
D:  Okay , but maybe we can  wh who has seen this movie ?  
C:  Yeah , who has seen this movie ? <laugh> Because then perhaps someone can give some some comment . 
A:  No I haven't . I've heard a lot of good things about it , I've heard it's a really powerful movie , but I haven't seen it . 
B:  No , I haven't . 
D:  I uh  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  I think I I I've seen it actually , but  
B:   W what is the name in French , 'cause  
D:  I have no idea . 
B:  Uh-huh . Uh yeah . 
C:  Uh it's quite hi it's quite high ranked , so I think uh it's not a bad movie , I'm uh thinking whether there was some good occasion , uh something what has happened recently . There was something like a celebration of the 
B:  <other> 
C:  fifty years after the war or something recently , no ? 
B:  Um I think there was a celebration of uh sixty years from the liberation of the camps , actually . Because they were liberated beginning forty five and uh  yeah , it's not bad , and it's also I think it's a good idea at at least from my point of view it's coherent with the previous films , like history , im major events . I don't know if we want to keep this coherence , or change radically , but maybe  yeah , that's  yeah , I think it's a drawback uh . 
D:  Sixty . S sixty years . 
C:  No , that's  Sixty , yeah . <laugh> S it can't be fifty , sure . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah , so . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yep . Yep . That's right , yeah . 
C:  That's true . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Um okay , but uh anyway , I think it's it's really a good movie , I like it when I saw it and uh  okay . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  It is a good movie , yeah . 
C:  That's the second one . 
D:  Okay , The Usual Suspect , do we want to say something again about it , or 
C:  Um no . <laugh> I think we can just skip this slide . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  How come it's coming third on your list ? 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh yeah . It's 
D:  It's forth on Agnes's uh and on my list , but it's okay . Ah you j you selected some movies , no ? You didn't take the six first . 
D:  <laugh> Okay . Do we have something to add on this movie , or  
A:  Mm . No . 
B:  No . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Wait , how many of us saw Schindler's List ? Three of us ? Did you see it ? I'm just trying to keep track of how many of us have seen  
C:  Uh Schindler's List . I saw it , I saw it . 
D:  Yep . 
A:  You have ? You have . You haven't . 
D:  Yep . 
B:  Haven't . Uh I I've seen very few movies from the list , about ten out of the first fifty . 
C:  Mm-hmm . <cough> 
D:  That's why you are in the movie club , to see more movies . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Okay , yeah . 
C:  Okay , Pulp Fiction . Uh I think it's again quite uh hi high ranked uh , but from my perspective , everyone already saw it . Who was interested in that movie , he saw it . Wh who is not interested in that movie , he he didn't see it and he uh wouldn't uh like to see it in the in our movie club . So I think we should uh we should just leave  skip it out and leave it out . I I wouldn't think about this as a candidate , even if it's a good movie , but I don't know , I think it's  
B:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Why not ? It's quite representative of the nineties , I think . 
C:  Mm . So what do you think ? I I wouldn't think about this as a candidate , because it seems to me it's  
D:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  Oh I would keep it as a candidate , but I don't know , I think for the moment m m guess most of these are candidates , so we'll try to . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  W w we vote at the end , or you want to  
B:  Yeah , we should probably vote after everyone  
A:  Yeah , I mean if there's something that none of us like , we can just eliminate it , but we might as well leave everything 'till the end . 
C:  Vote , that's the best , yeah , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  When going through we c we could just eliminate . Okay , so we are not gonna eliminate this one . <laugh> Uh Goodfellas , I didn't see it . 
A:  No . 
B:  No . <laugh> 
D:  No . 
C:  No . 
B:  Mm . Okay . No , yeah , so <other> probably not uh  
D:  Okay , n nobody's seen it , so . 
C:  No . 
D:  <other> 
A:  No . 
C:  It's definitely not for kids , uh but uh if the kids are not visitors of our cinema , why not ? 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  It  One have to rethink when when when you are watching this movie , you have to think and it's uh scaring . Uh why not ? 
A:  How many of us have seen it ? I'm guessing you haven't seen it or h okay . 
D:  No , I've seen it actually twice , I think . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , I've seen it . I think I've seen it a second time on T_V_ , but maybe not entirely . 
A:  So have we all seen it ? Okay , so we've all seen it . 
C:  I've I've see I've seen it , but I can't really remember exactly the  all the details . 
A:  I can't either , 'cause I saw it right when it came out . 
D:  That's it's it's probably begin 
C:  Uh . It's a long time ago , it's from ninety one ? 
A:  It came out when  ninety one , yeah . 
D:  Ninety one . 
C:  Ninety one , yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  So  and I saw it when I was like twelve or thirteen . <laugh> So perhaps it would be  
A:  So . Yeah , me too . <laugh> And at that age I was like mm . <laugh>  
B:  <other> They're much too young . 
D:  Yep . <laugh> Okay , American Beauty w w was coming next , seven , was quite quite nice actually . 
C:  Yeah . Could you go to the next slide ? 
A:  Yeah . That was very good , yeah . 
D:  Ah , it's actually there . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , it's here , and that's actually my last slide . So um 
D:  Why you choose you choose seven movie ? 
C:  I don't know , because it nicely f <other> I I was thinking perhaps we are not able to go through more of them . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  <laugh> Indeed . 
C:  Uh 
C:  And it's my last slide . So  uh yes , yes , yes . And I think , okay , why not . 
D:  You have seen it , Mirek ? 


D:  Okay , can we 
B:  Yeah , let's uh  
D:  discuss about your document , maybe ? 
C:  Maybe  can I ask you for the for the list of movies ? 
D:  Yep . Okay . Okay . 
A:  Thank you . 
C:  This one . And 
B:  <other> Yeah , <other> so it's uh  actually I have made I have made photocopies . I have them Denis , so it's all for you . 


B:  Actually I I tried to propose just one movie with some alternates . 
B:  Um so my proposal , which is only a proposal , would be to to keep the focus on um uh more or less history and action , 
B:  Um okay , so um yeah , that's that's the point , it's it's a bit grey , and actually if you look at my second page , uh in the trivia I found out that in fact they uh actually reduced the the colour saturation of the movie , just to make it look maybe a bit like the documentaries from the time . Yeah , I was very surprised to find this uh  it's  
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  That was very interesting to read , yeah . But then they uh  I read that they they  w where was it ? Th they turned back to  yeah . 
B:  They they turned back the colours for uh  <laugh> 
A:  They re-enhanced the colour , yeah . 
C:  Because people start to complain that uh <laugh> that w there was a problem with a T_V_ when they were broadcasting the movie on the T_V_ . Uh  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  That it was their T_V_s and not  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . So this uh fact number two I think obviously for I mean technical people like us is uh <laugh> is is is quite funny . So yeah , so I I mean these four points could serve also as an introduction if you want to talk f fo for fi five or ten minutes before the movie , I don't know , in in the room . So uh yeah , mm so tha this would be my candidate , but I'm very much open to  
C:  That's an interesting point , interesting point . <laugh> 
B:  So yeah , I I don't know . I don't know how many people have have seen it , well among you , well most of you actually . Oh all , okay , all of us . So maybe th people know it quite well . 
D:  <other> Yeah . 
A:  I have . 
D:  I have . 
C:  I've seen it . I've seen it . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah , we're running um  
B:  Yeah . Okay , so  yeah , so I have some other candidates , um it's on first page at the bottom . Uh I also put Pulp Fiction , uh The Silence of the Lambs and I also , <other> well , sort of included La Vita e Bella , but I know we're an Engish movie club , so I guess it's um <laugh> it's a bit out of purpose . <laugh> But it  
C:  Out of time ? Mm-hmm . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 


B:   Okay uh Denis . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yep , so I have uh a quite different movie to propose you . I don't know uh  it's f called The Big Lebowski from um uh Joel Coen . Actually they are brothers , you probably know them . I don't know how many of you have seen this movie . 
A:  <laugh> No . 
B:  Haven't seen it , but uh I heard it's very funny . And I've seen some other films by by the Coen brothers . 
D:  No ? 
C:  Just partially I think . 
D:  Yeah , they made uh Fargo , which is in the list . 
B:  Yeah , which is in your table . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  And uh 
B:  Um the last one was the one with Catherine Zeta-Jones uh . 
D:  uh Cr uh Cruel Intentions , or something like that I think , or  
B:  Crue crue Yeah , something about cruelty or  very funny . 
D:  okay , actually I wanted to propose you some posters related to this movie . Uh maybe it w maybe it's going to open the discussion on on posters as well . 
C:  Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
B:  Y you wrote the paragraph on the poster ? 
D:  Uh I I took it from  I don't know where . So uh 
B:  <laugh> Okay . <laugh> Could be edited a bit . <laugh> 
D:  Uh I wanted to say some information to involve people on  in the committee as well , if they want to take part to the committee to select movies . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> And uh  what else ? 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  S some  
C:  I think this is not bad , because they say something little bit about our uh movie club and uh , yeah , The Big Lebowski it's clear that it's a movie and uh I guess the people can remember that it was a movie at least , even if they haven't see it . 
A:  Looks like a C_D_ cover . <laugh> 
B:  Mm-hmm . <laugh> 
C:  CD cover . <laugh> 


D:  Okay , great . So I think now we have to decide for a movie . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Mm-hmm . <cough> 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  And um  
B:  Oh yeah . W 
D:  Yep . So  
B:  I I would suggest 
C:  So Big Lebowski . 
B:  if it's not too long , maybe each of us could nominate one or two movies . We make a list and then we vote . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Okay , good idea . 
B:  What do you think ? 
D:  Yep . I th 
B:  So who wants  so , Mirek , what do you nominate ? 
C:  So I'm really convinced by The Big Lebowski . <laugh> I  yes , yeah , I I would like to uh , yeah , at least to have it uh in the 
B:  You are ? Okay . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  In the nominees , okay . Another nominee ? 
C:  in the nominees , exactly and uh I'm trying to remember all of them . 
A:  Usual Suspects . 
B:  Okay , Agnes , Usual Suspects . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Mainly because only two of us have seen it and it's not a mainstream movie , so I don't think a lot of people would have seen it to begin with . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . Well you can nominate one or two , so that we  or whatever . Um I would nominate , well okay , my candidate , Saving Private Ryan . And uh I'm happy with your nominations too . Uh I would nominate also Pulp Fiction , because it's a very good movie . Um Denis , so your yours is already nominated , but you want  
D:  I would nominate uh American Beauty as well . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  And um and I would be okay with Saving Private Ryan , it's it's it can  
B:   Okay , so it's already on the list . 
C:  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . And then I'm still hesitating between the Schindler's List and the S uh Silence of the Lambs . <laugh> 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  May I nominate uh these  all these three movies , Big Lebowski , Schindler's List and the Silence of the Lambs ? 
B:  Yeah , if you want . So so we have uh seven candidates . Um if you have a good short term memory that should be okay . <laugh> Yeah . So uh Big Lebowski , Usual Suspects , Saving Private Ryan , Pulp Fiction , American Beauty , Schindler's List and Silence of the Lambs . So now let's vote . Should we vote just for one film or should each of us say  give  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  <laugh> So you reduced that by what , two ? <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> So eliminate first eliminate first ? Mm-hmm . 
D:  Or we can eliminate first one one movie each , and then we s and then we select . 
C:  I'm sorry , could you go t uh uh uh once again through uh the list of the movies , because I don't  or i is it possible to put them on the on the on the uh whiteboard ? 
B:  Okay . So Big Lebowski  Alright . Uh you can write on your paper maybe . 
C:  Okay , okay , so the Schindler's list , The Usual Suspects , uh Silence of the Lambs , uh Big Lebowski , okay . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  American Beauty and  
B:  And Saving Private Ryan .

C:  I have six I have six . How many ? <other> Okay , we <laugh>  American Beauty . 
A:  <laugh> I have seven . 
D:  Yeah . That's a bit cruel , but uh that's I think a good way . 
B:  Okay . Denis ? 
D:  Me , I would remove Silence of the Lambs because I think it's too violent . 
A:  <other> 
B:  Okay . I will just remove it this way . Um um 
C:  <other> 
B:  I would remove Schindler's List because it's too sad . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Well , it's not very good reason , but  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Pulp Fiction . 
B:  Oh , too bad . 
C:  Yeah , and I would eliminate  
D:  And you have a reason for it or  <laugh> Okay . 
A:  I'm not a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino . <laugh> And it didn't make a good impression . 
C:  Yeah . And I would eliminate Pulp Fiction actually as well if so   
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Maybe you can eliminate another one , you can  no ? <laugh> 
C:  Another one . Because it <laugh> because it would be Saving Private Ryan . 
B:  No , no . <laugh> Well I mean leave someth <laugh> okay , so we're left with The Big Lebowski , Usual Suspects , Saving Private Ryan and American Beauty . 
A:  <laugh> Really eliminate Pulp Fiction . <laugh> It's gone . 
B:  Okay , so let's vote just simply for one , for the moment . So I would vote for American Beauty , because I haven't seen it . <laugh> 
C:  Mm .
