A:  Hello . 
B:  Hi everyone . 
D:  So I don't know if you all received the the a agenda for this meeting . Do you  no ? 
C:  No , I haven't . 
D:  Here it is . 
C:  Thank you . 
B:  I haven't . 
D:  So um <other> um the goal for today are um  We have two goals . Uh first is to decide a movie for uh the next projection for our movie club . As you know  uh so it's for the last Friday of this month of April . As you probably remember , the movie already projected were uh Lawrence of Arabia and Apocalypse Now in February and Amadeus from Milos Forman in March . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  <other> So um the question that is open is are we going to select a movie from the nineties and which movie . So that's the first goal , decide for a movie to be projected , and second goal is to uh discuss for an ad advertising poster um for our um <other> uh club , because we noticed that n last time not enough people came to the projection . So that's it . Um wh who wants to start to  So I guess you all prepared some documents for the mm selection of movie . 
A:  Yeah . Yep . 
B:  Yes . So who who has what ? Actually maybe um   
D:  Okay .

D:  Okay . 
B:  Uh-huh . What do you have , Mirek ?

topic_description:	opening


D:  Okay , here it is . 
A:  Yep .  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  I passed this one . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues


A:  And the two in particular that I would propose are , next slide please , The Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense . Um I don't know if you've seen any of them . 
A:  So The Usual Suspects is a hundred and five minutes long , so it's a decent length of time . 
D:  Okay . You have a last slide or  no . 
A:  So I think that's it , unless you have any questions . Yeah , that's it . 
B:  Okay . 
topic_description:	movie selection presentation


A:  Okay , so what I was thinking is basically the previous movies that we had , which you've already mentioned in the agenda d um Lawrence of Arabia , Apocalypse Now and Amadeus , were fairly historical , serious , dramatic , and also action-ey movies except for maybe Amadeus . Um this month I was thinking of selecting something that's more in the present time , still dramatic but slightly less serious . And what I'd propose is something of a thriller or mystery . And I know that a lot of people find mystery is not really mysterious in the movies these days , they kind of can predict what's gonna happen , um but in the nineties there were some movies that did have surprise endings and that people came out saying okay , didn't see that coming , so I thought we could maybe show one of those . And even if people have already seen the movie , a lot of the times you go back and watch the movie again , and you pick up on things that you didn't really notice the first time around , or you see where the clues were and mm what led up to the end , so that's more along the lines of what I was thinking . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	genre


A:  Uh The Usual Suspects was directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie . It has a fairly large cast , so I'm not gonna read all of them , but the main characters are Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne . And it's basically about five criminals who get set up . Um they're arrested , they're released from prison and the get together um and plan a crime , and basically the story is told through the views of one of the suspects . Um <other> the tag line is kind of neat , five criminals , one lineup , no coincidence and you get told the story um as uh  that these f characters are being controlled um by one sort of uber-villain , and in the end you find who the uber-villain was . And I kind of like the <laugh> the quote from Rolling Stone magazine , The Usual Suspects is the freshest , funniest  
D:  Which which one was it again ? The guy who was controlling ? I don't remember , I have seen the movie twice , but uh  
A:  <other> Well they ha have you guys seen the movie ? 
B:  No , I haven't seen it . 
C:  No , I haven't . 
D:  It's the bald guy , the  
A:  So I'm not gonna give away  you want me to give away the movie ? <laugh> That'll spoil it . <laugh> I'll tell you later . <laugh> But the the quote from Rolling Stone is fairly accurate , I think . It's one of the freshest , funniest and scariest crime thrillers to come along since Pulp Fiction . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> No , no . <laugh> Okay . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	movie plot


A:  And the other movie is The Sixth Sense with the famous line I see dead people , which the little boy says . <other> Um it was written and directed by M_ Night uh Shyamalan and stars Bruce Willis , Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette and again has a neat twist that you find out right at the end . 
D:  Yeah , it's a bit more commercial that one .  first one . 
B:  Um . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:   yeah , The Sixth Sense was very commercial , but anyways  
B:  So w what what is this s the second image on the slide ? Is it the the poster or  
A:  It's the poster for The Sixth Sense , but unfortunately I couldn't find a clear , big enough one . 
B:  Has a s it has a strange format , um horizontal and  uh so it's one two three four five six . 
A:  <other> 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah , I th I think it's only part of a full  yeah , it goes th the all of the se all of the senses . Um if you go to the next slide there's slightly more detailed things about the movies . 
topic_description:	movie plot


A:  It has an R_ rating , so I don't remember what type of audience we had at the last uh shows , but it may not necessarily be suitable for kids . 
D:  Um  R_ is what uh in  
A:  R_ is sort of if you're eighteen and under , you have to have an adult with you . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  So it means restricted . Uh-huh . 
D:  Restricted . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Hmm . 
A:  It's mostly for violence , yeah , it's restricted . 
topic_description:	ratings


A:  Um it got an eight point seven out of ten on the Internet Movie Database . It's the sixteenth in the top f two hundred and fifty movies and fourth in the top movies of the nineties . It won um a couple of Academy Awards , notably for best writing , um so that's for the script um and best actor for Kevin Spacey . 
D:  But wait , I   I have the top ten from the nineties ? No , the top fifty . And it's fourth . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Yeah , fourth in the top movies of the nineties . Sixteenth in the top two hundred and fifty I think , of all time . 
D:  Oh , sorry , sorry , yep . Yeah , yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah , because your table is only the nineties , yeah . Mm-hmm . 
D:  From  yeah . Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Nineties , yeah . 
A:  So it won lots of awards um , it won best film from the British um British Film Association , or the British equivalent of the Academy Awards . Um it was nominated for best foreign film for the Cesar . 
B:  <other> 
C:  So plenty of awards we we could say . <laugh> 
D:  But but sixteenth in top two hundred fifty , it's what two uh  all all days ? All time ? 
A:  Plenty of awards , yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Well  
A:  I think of all time , yeah . 
C:  Of all the movies , yeah yeah . 
A:  Yeah . So 
C:  It's still good , actually . <laugh> 
D:  Okay . 
A:  yeah . 
D:  But those rating are more like uh  it's the number of votes , no ? 
A:  <other> 
B:  W w 
A:  Yeah , it's ratings by viewers and  
B:  No , no , actually if you look at your tables , I think it's a sort of uh well average between number of votes and and and uh yeah the the rating or th the marks , because there are  in you table you have uh things that have very few votes but still are ranked quite high , for instance number twenty four , which has only four thousand votes 
D:  Votes and u 
C:  By the users . 
D:  Yep . <other> And rating . Yep . 
A:  Yeah , like Memories  
D:  Yeah yeah . 
C:  <cough> 
A:  Yeah , and Forty Four as well , which has seven hundred and forty something votes . 
B:  But um  yeah . 
C:  So it's definitely just the average of the rating and  okay th the number of the votes is there just for the information , so that you know how how reliable  yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
B:  Yeah . Maybe it's just the search is compensated a bit for the number of people , I I don't know actually . Because if you have just ten votes and  yeah probably are not in the database . 
C:  Yes . Mm  Okay . Okay , then you  yeah . Then yes , yes , yes , yes , sure . 
A:  Yeah so  
B:  But yeah , anyway it has excellent votes . Haven't seen it , but  <laugh> 
D:  Okay , yep . 
A:  Yeah <other> um  Yeah . 
topic_description:	reviews/awards/rankings


A:  No it's a good movie , I <other> I highly recommend it , and I wouldn't mind seeing it again , because I do know the ending and I haven't been able to watch it again to see where the hints were that were scattered across the movie , 'cause apparently there are hints as to who it is . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> Mm-hmm . 
C:  <cough> Mm-hmm . 
D:  Ah , now I remember . 
B:  Oh . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . Okay . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Yep . Actually there is one guy who is the  at the police station and they ask him to tell the story . Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . and he's the one telling the story , yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
B:  <other> 
A:  There's him and the the guy in the burn unit . 
B:  Yep . <laugh> 
topic_description:	movie plot


C:  And what is the second movie ? 
A:  The second movie is The Sixth Sense . Again , it's fairly short . It has an easier rating , it's P_G_ thirteen , um it's much less violent . It got an eight point one out of ten , it's a hundred and first in the top two hundred and fifty and it's nineteenth on your list I think , if I'm not mistaken . Yeah , it's nineteenth . Um got a fair number of votes , too , ninety six thousand . Um again , it was nominated for a lot of different Academy Awards , um it didn't win any , but it got a lot of buzz and a lot of people liked it , so . 
C:  Yeah , Sixth Sen 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	reviews/awards/rankings


A:  Those are my two selections , and as you can see , the plot is a boy who communicates with spirits that don't know when they're dead , seeks the help of a disheartened child psychologist to figure out why he's seeing what he's seeing and what it means . 
D:  <other> Both movies are quite similar in some way , because the last sentence is uh totally contradictory to the whole movie . It's uh  
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  The last sentence from the movie or  oh . 
D:  Yeah , the last sentence from the movie . 
A:  Yeah . It's only right right at the end where you find out really what's going on and it makes you rethink everything that happened beforehand . 
B:  W 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	movie plot


A:  So those would be my two suggestions and y they ar they are slightly more commercial , or at leas The Sixth Sense is , than the other ones we've seen , but  
B:  Mm-hmm . So these guys were actually nominated , so the the bottom part of your slide , actually , it says  yeah , so these are the best awards they had . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah , they were they were nominated for a lot of different awards , they didn't win . 
B:  Okay . <laugh> Too bad . <laugh> Well there is just one winner , so . <laugh> Uh-huh . 
C:  Mm-hmm . <laugh> 
A:  But I guess the comp I can't remember what the competition was that year , but  And they were nominated for a lot of them , and um  Yeah . 
topic_description:	reviews/awards/rankings


C:  Okay , now you can go to to my slides , but actually what I pre what I have prepared is just a kind of a review of fo uh se six or seven movies , if you ca can go to the second slide . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  You sent your slides around , right ? Yeah . 
C:  Yes , basically seven movies , and it's uh it's uh uh top movies uh based on the uh on the ra ranking and a and awards awards . Um you see the the names of the movies on the on the on the wall . So um we can perhaps go through all of them and we can little bit discuss , so I I I have n I didn't see all of them actually , so it's just  we should probably select one of these , because I think uh these are really good movies and uh , okay , we will see . So if you can go through uh <other> okay , so this is the first movie and uh it's it's m it's more like a drama . Uh it's uh it's uh very uh high ranked and actually you have a a nicer list , because uh we can even see the number of the votes . So what is the number of the people ? 
D:  Okay . <other> Yeah one hundred f w uh one hundred forty thousand . 
B:  Yeah , I think your table is very clear Denis . 
C:  Finally I found actually your table much better than my <laugh> than my presentation , because perhaps here we can we can really see I mean  
D:  <other> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  No , we don't have the plot of the of the movie and uh  
C:  What is the ranking ? We ha didn't have the plot , yeah . 
D:  Okay , but maybe we can  wh who has seen this movie ?  
C:  Yeah , who has seen this movie ? <laugh> Because then perhaps someone can give some some comment . 
A:  No I haven't . I've heard a lot of good things about it , I've heard it's a really powerful movie , but I haven't seen it . 
B:  No , I haven't . 
D:  I uh  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  I think I I I've seen it actually , but  
B:   W what is the name in French , 'cause  
D:  I have no idea . 
B:  Uh-huh . Uh yeah . 
C:  Uh it's quite hi it's quite high ranked , so I think uh it's not a bad movie , I'm uh thinking whether there was some good occasion , uh something what has happened recently . There was something like a celebration of the 
B:  <other> 
C:  fifty years after the war or something recently , no ? 
B:  Um I think there was a celebration of uh sixty years from the liberation of the camps , actually . Because they were liberated beginning forty five and uh  yeah , it's not bad , and it's also I think it's a good idea at at least from my point of view it's coherent with the previous films , like history , im major events . I don't know if we want to keep this coherence , or change radically , but maybe  yeah , that's  yeah , I think it's a drawback uh . 
D:  Sixty . S sixty years . 
C:  No , that's  Sixty , yeah . <laugh> S it can't be fifty , sure . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah , so . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yep . Yep . That's right , yeah . 
C:  That's true . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Um okay , but uh anyway , I think it's it's really a good movie , I like it when I saw it and uh  okay . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  It is a good movie , yeah . 
C:  That's the second one . 
D:  Okay , The Usual Suspect , do we want to say something again about it , or 
C:  Um no . <laugh> I think we can just skip this slide . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  How come it's coming third on your list ? 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh yeah . It's 
D:  It's forth on Agnes's uh and on my list , but it's okay . Ah you j you selected some movies , no ? You didn't take the six first . 
D:  <laugh> Okay . Do we have something to add on this movie , or  
A:  Mm . No . 
B:  No . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Wait , how many of us saw Schindler's List ? Three of us ? Did you see it ? I'm just trying to keep track of how many of us have seen  
C:  Uh Schindler's List . I saw it , I saw it . 
D:  Yep . 
A:  You have ? You have . You haven't . 
D:  Yep . 
B:  Haven't . Uh I I've seen very few movies from the list , about ten out of the first fifty . 
C:  Mm-hmm . <cough> 
D:  That's why you are in the movie club , to see more movies . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Okay , yeah . 
C:  Okay , Pulp Fiction . Uh I think it's again quite uh hi high ranked uh , but from my perspective , everyone already saw it . Who was interested in that movie , he saw it . Wh who is not interested in that movie , he he didn't see it and he uh wouldn't uh like to see it in the in our movie club . So I think we should uh we should just leave  skip it out and leave it out . I I wouldn't think about this as a candidate , even if it's a good movie , but I don't know , I think it's  
B:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Why not ? It's quite representative of the nineties , I think . 
C:  Mm . So what do you think ? I I wouldn't think about this as a candidate , because it seems to me it's  
D:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  Oh I would keep it as a candidate , but I don't know , I think for the moment m m guess most of these are candidates , so we'll try to . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  W w we vote at the end , or you want to  
B:  Yeah , we should probably vote after everyone  
A:  Yeah , I mean if there's something that none of us like , we can just eliminate it , but we might as well leave everything 'till the end . 
C:  Vote , that's the best , yeah , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  When going through we c we could just eliminate . Okay , so we are not gonna eliminate this one . <laugh> Uh Goodfellas , I didn't see it . 
A:  No . 
B:  No . <laugh> 
D:  No . 
C:  No . 
B:  Mm . Okay . No , yeah , so <other> probably not uh  
D:  Okay , n nobody's seen it , so . 
C:  No . 
D:  <other> 
A:  No . 
C:  It's definitely not for kids , uh but uh if the kids are not visitors of our cinema , why not ? 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  It  One have to rethink when when when you are watching this movie , you have to think and it's uh scaring . Uh why not ? 
A:  How many of us have seen it ? I'm guessing you haven't seen it or h okay . 
D:  No , I've seen it actually twice , I think . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , I've seen it . I think I've seen it a second time on T_V_ , but maybe not entirely . 
A:  So have we all seen it ? Okay , so we've all seen it . 
C:  I've I've see I've seen it , but I can't really remember exactly the  all the details . 
A:  I can't either , 'cause I saw it right when it came out . 
D:  That's it's it's probably begin 
C:  Uh . It's a long time ago , it's from ninety one ? 
A:  It came out when  ninety one , yeah . 
D:  Ninety one . 
C:  Ninety one , yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  So  and I saw it when I was like twelve or thirteen . <laugh> So perhaps it would be  
A:  So . Yeah , me too . <laugh> And at that age I was like mm . <laugh>  
B:  <other> They're much too young . 
D:  Yep . <laugh> Okay , American Beauty w w was coming next , seven , was quite quite nice actually . 
C:  Yeah . Could you go to the next slide ? 
A:  Yeah . That was very good , yeah . 
D:  Ah , it's actually there . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , it's here , and that's actually my last slide . So um 
D:  Why you choose you choose seven movie ? 
C:  I don't know , because it nicely f <other> I I was thinking perhaps we are not able to go through more of them . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  <laugh> Indeed . 
C:  Uh 
C:  And it's my last slide . So  uh yes , yes , yes . And I think , okay , why not .

D:  It it's in uh jail right , it taking  yeah . 
A:  Yeah , it's set in a jail . 
D:    I don't remember well this movie . 
B:  Yeah . Well , actually your third slide has the plot , so uh . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Yeah , it's this one . It's the one that is on the on the wall . It's projected , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh yeah , exactly , yeah . So yeah , this guy is jailed , okay , uh-huh . Wow . 
D:  Okay . Okay . Okay , so mm  
C:  So I ge okay , so no one of us saw this movie , so in that case perhaps it's it's little bit danger to select that movie for the for the 
B:  Okay . 
D:  Yep , so let's  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  s play , so uh Schindler's List , who saw this ? 
A:  Me .

B:  Yeah , I haven't seen  I heard about it , but  <laugh> Mm-hmm . Yep . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	movie plot


A:  It's a fairly emotional movie though . That's one thing to keep in mind is that it's  
D:  But then it's not representative of the nineties . It's more a movie about the story of uh  the horror of the uh  endured by the Jewish during the Second World War . 
A:  Yeah , but Amadeus isn't really representative of the eighties either . <laugh> Yeah , and according to your thing it's nineteen eighty four , <laugh> so . 
B:  <laugh> Well , of the seventeen eighties . 
D:  <laugh> Yeah , right . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yes . Yes yes yes . 
B:  Yeah . Maybe it's representative of a style of the eighties , I don't know . As for Amadeus , but uh <laugh> that's  I don't know . But  <other> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  Um but even here I wouldn't uh uh say that the that th this style is representative of the nineties , right , so . <other> 
A:  No . 
B:  Yeah , hard to tell . 
topic_description:	genre


D:  Okay , and Steven Steven Spielberg is uh  
C:  It's one of the candidates , I defini yeah , Steven Spielberg is really quite a good  so I  director , so I I would say we we could think about it . So I would keep it as a candidate , at least . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
topic_description:	director(s)


C:   That's strange , what is the rating ? 
B:  Yeah , it's funny actually um because on your on your slides actually the ratings are eight point seven for both . No they have the same , Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction , both are at eight point seven , but on Denis's table uh this one is at eight point six . Who knows , maybe people voted for it , yeah . Could have changed in the meanwhile . 
C:  Perhaps it has changed . It's higher . 
A:  But it gets updated daily . 
C:  It gets updated . Yes , yes , and I did it I did it on Wednesday . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  And me on Tuesday , probably . 
B:  Though with one hundred and thousand votes , it shouldn't change too much . I mean , given the number of votes , I wonder  but anyway , it's m it may change I think , yeah . 
C:  Yes . Mm-hmm . So it probably has changed , so um 
B:   Okay . <laugh> Wow . That's encouraging . 
C:  it becomes more popular , no po uh <laugh> yeah , yeah , yeah . <laugh> 
topic_description:	reviews/awards/rankings


D:  And the structure of the movie is interesting . I I think the the first scene is actually the same scene as the last scene , no ? There is a kind of loop in this movie . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  I can't remember . 
C:  Yes , yes , there was ple I I think there was a plenty of loops actually , plenty of  . 
D:  Yep . 
A:  I think also it's old enough that even if people saw it the first time around , they don't necessarily remember everything that happened , 'cause I remember seeing it when it came out , but I don't particularly remember  
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  I fully agree that you can see this movie three times perhaps , three times and for the fourth time see you still discover something new , but uh on the other hand , I have the impression it's really  it's uh , you know , every everyone saw it , it's it's quite well known , uh it woul it wou I  
D:  Yeah yeah . I agree also . Yeah . You've you've seen it ? Okay . 
B:  Yeah , I've seen it , this one . I I like it very much . I've actually seen it

C:  So American Beauty , so I can perhaps read a little bit the user comment if you want , or uh yeah , you can read the plot outline on the on the on the projector , but it's basically deep , wonderful and penetrating movie , extraordinary uh irony and the p and the psychological drama about American life . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , it's definitely about American life . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> Suburban life . 
D:  It's it's kind of crude the critique , but uh on the other way it's quite poetic , it's uh  yeah . 
A:  There's a lot of very true things in it . 
C:  Poetic ? <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , you know , with the the way of filming and um  I don't know , I found it pretty  
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Okay , the way of filming perhaps , but uh  
B:  <other> I haven't seen it , but I would like to see it , so . 
D:  No , it's q it's quite in interesting . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  So  yeah . 
A:  It's much less dark than the other movies we have <laugh> on that list . 
B:  <other> 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . So it's not very violent , really . 
D:  Well , it depends . 
A:  It's not  well it's dark but  <other> no . 
D:  Ah no , it's it's not violent at all , but more  it's more the cr the cr the critique that is quite crude , because all the people in this movie are are uh psychopath in their own way . 
B:  Ah okay , great . 
A:  No . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  But not like violent cutting people to pieces psychopaths they're  just everyone has their own issues and  
D:  But they are normal people then . 
B:  Okay , yeah . Uh-huh . And what about the  well that picture with the the girl and  do you see naked people in the movie or  is it about sex or something like that ?

D:  Okay . 
topic_description:	movie plot


C:  It seems to me that perhaps that Schindler  okay , definitely Schindler Schindler's List is perhaps more serious topic for sure , but um  well it depends , it depends what we want . Do we want that people are more like uh relaxed in our in our cinema , or are more interested in some particular things ? Um what do you think , I mean what should we  how we should uh  What should be the influence , how we are influencing the people in the cinema ? 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Um  
D:  I think we w want them to to see movies that they won't see oth otherwise , but I'm not sure then it's quite popular the movie we selected , so . 
C:  What do we want ? 
B:  Mm-hmm . Yeah , I think it's a mixture of bringing new things to them , but also making them enjoy the show , so that they come to our movie club , so yeah , I think we shouldn't maybe do very mainstream movies , but well okay , the list here is quite uh  
C:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	experience of movie-goers


A:  See I don't know what was mainstream in Europe , like all of these movies are very mainstream for me . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah , I think also if you look at the number of votes here . 
A:  But  
D:  If they are in the top fifty , they are quite mainstream , but uh 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Uh  Yeah . Uh regarding the Denis's table I would say given that this site , I don't know if it's mainly American , but uh I would say that  
A:  It has other movies , but I think it's predominantly  
D:  Uh I think there is the  
B:  Yeah , I think mm  yeah , it's English speaking anyway , so uh  though  so  
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  There are Chinese movies , English movies . 
B:  Yeah , but if you look at 
A:  No , there's movies from everywhere , but  
B:  Yeah , but I would say mainstream are the ones that have more than , whatever , sixty thousand votes , and you can see some more , well , confidential films that have like ten thousand , twenty thousand , like mm Princess Mononoke , twenty thousand and uh , whatever , the the Kieslowski at eleven thousand , the Trois Coleurs Rouge . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	mainstream/popularity of movie


D:  It's it's quite a lot for Kieslowski actually . I was surprised to s yeah yeah . 
B:  Yeah , it's not bad at all , yeah . <laugh> So yeah , anyway , if you want a definition of mainstream or whatever . 
C:  Hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  And Festen also is uh is quite high . Uh I I don't know if you've seen this one . It's The Celebration I think . It's uh uh movie from a Swedish guy . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Yep . 
A:  No , I've never even heard of it . 
B:  D uh Danish I think , it's the Dogma movement . Yeah .

D:  Yep . Okay . Okay . 
A:  Thank you . 
C:  This one . And 
B:  <other> Yeah , <other> so it's uh  actually I have made I have made photocopies . I have them Denis , so it's all for you . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues


B:  Actually I I tried to propose just one movie with some alternates . 
B:  Um so my proposal , which is only a proposal , would be to to keep the focus on um uh more or less history and action , 
B:  Um okay , so um yeah , that's that's the point , it's it's a bit grey , and actually if you look at my second page , uh in the trivia I found out that in fact they uh actually reduced the the colour saturation of the movie , just to make it look maybe a bit like the documentaries from the time . Yeah , I was very surprised to find this uh  it's  
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  That was very interesting to read , yeah . But then they uh  I read that they they  w where was it ? Th they turned back to  yeah . 
B:  They they turned back the colours for uh  <laugh> 
A:  They re-enhanced the colour , yeah . 
C:  Because people start to complain that uh <laugh> that w there was a problem with a T_V_ when they were broadcasting the movie on the T_V_ . Uh  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  That it was their T_V_s and not  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . So this uh fact number two I think obviously for I mean technical people like us is uh <laugh> is is is quite funny . So yeah , so I I mean these four points could serve also as an introduction if you want to talk f fo for fi five or ten minutes before the movie , I don't know , in in the room . So uh yeah , mm so tha this would be my candidate , but I'm very much open to  
C:  That's an interesting point , interesting point . <laugh> 
B:  So yeah , I I don't know . I don't know how many people have have seen it , well among you , well most of you actually . Oh all , okay , all of us . So maybe th people know it quite well . 
D:  <other> Yeah . 
A:  I have . 
D:  I have . 
C:  I've seen it . I've seen it . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah , we're running um  
B:  Yeah . Okay , so  yeah , so I have some other candidates , um it's on first page at the bottom . Uh I also put Pulp Fiction , uh The Silence of the Lambs and I also , <other> well , sort of included La Vita e Bella , but I know we're an Engish movie club , so I guess it's um <laugh> it's a bit out of purpose . <laugh> But it  
C:  Out of time ? Mm-hmm . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	movie selection presentation


B:  so Lawrence of Arabia was , okay , about this guy during the first world war , so it happens , okay , outside Europe and the States , but uh it's a piece of history . Uh Apocalypse Now it's uh Vietnam , if I'm um correct and , okay , Amadeus , that's much uh much earlier and it's not about  it's not violent , which is a nice thing I think . 
topic_description:	movie plot


B:  But um given that we would like a movie from the nineties , I thought the Saving Private Ryan  oh thanks for projecting the document  um would keep this  more or less this theme of uh history and war and action drama , while showing actually a very new and I would say humanistic view on on war . 
topic_description:	genre


B:  Uh <laugh> you want one ? 
C:  the  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Denis , Denis , could you give me the the list of the to uh top fifty ? Yeah . But you have your own copy then ? <laugh> okay , good , thank you . 
D:  Yeah , sure . Yep . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues


B:  Because it's it's not like the sort of glorification of uh , you know , the good guys that that uh well go against the Nazis , but uh it's uh it's  well the plot actually if you don't know it  It's about people looking for just one soldier , in fact it's um it's about a a family of four brothers , who  actually three of them get killed during the war in these days of forty  well , I guess summer forty four and the uh well the government decides that they need to get back the fourth brother just to save one member of the family . And this this guy is Private Ryan . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
B:  So the movie is not about killing the Germans or whatever , it's about saving at least one guy from a family , so  but of course the the setting is during the war and um it's very realistic and uh very dramatic in fact . It's um it's not at all a glorification of war but it's just uh  it shows a bit uh the violence of um of the things . And especially the the beginning is uh  I think it's great , it's it's very violent , but it's it's an image of of war . It's uh  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . It's quite horrible actually . 
A:  It's v very <laugh> very violent . 
B:  Yeah , but I think if mm  well if you compare it with  
D:  Yeah . Mirek , you didn't see it ? 
C:  That's the  I I I saw it and I d I'm trying to remember the beginning , that's the Normandy landing ? Okay , yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah , that was really horrible . 
A:  The landing , yeah . 
B:  It yeah , it's the landing , and actually every more or less everyone gets killed and  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . This is not a movie for kids , like  
D:  But it's it's a piece of art because he used something like one hundred camera to film that , or  
C:  Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
C:  Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah it's quite s yeah . 
C:  <laugh> No , not at all . 
B:  Oh I I didn't know , but yeah , actually it's very well filmed and it's very realistic , and I don't know if you compare with , I don't know , in Lawrence of Arabia I think they have some battles and camels . I know it's very nice , someone falls somewhere there and , well you know , it's like battles that look nice , but this one doesn't look nice , and I think it's uh it's also maybe representative of the nineties , you know , people starting to get the more uh realistic view of uh of of war . 
topic_description:	movie plot


B:  But it's true , it's it's a bit violent , and so what I put here  it's a bit long too , it's nearly three hours . But uh I don't know , Apocalypse Now is quite long too I think 
A:  <other> yeah . 
D:  Yeah , it is . There is two  there are two versions I think , and  but w but we  yeah , we projected the longer one , so . 
B:  I don't remember . 
A:  Yeah , the redux version is longer . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	length of movie


B:  Yeah . So it won uh five Oscar prizes , uh best director for Steven Spielberg , um best cimena cinematography , etcetera . Uh  
D:  How many times uh Spielberg received the best uh director Oscar ? 
A:  I think just once for this . 
B:  I don't know . 
D:  Not for the Schin Schindler's List or for 
A:  Oh maybe he did . 
D:  for E_T_ ? 
A:  No , for E_T_ he didn't . It wasn't until he started doing things like Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan that he actually started winning awards for them . 
D:  He won f he won the mm  
B:  Oh . 
D:  No , he won f for E_T_ , he won the mm Cannes , uh what is  uh Palme d'Or . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  Did he ? Oh okay , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  I didn't know that . 
topic_description:	reviews/awards/rankings


D:  And then then there is this uh  there is an hero , I mean it's uh  or a non-hero , and in all the other stu stories , the  in the previous movies there were an he an hero , Lawrence of Arabia , uh Amadeus . Apocalypse Now , it's also non-hero I think , but uh but here I don't remember it's actually the Tom Hanks the hero , or it's  
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , on th on  yeah , on the picture actually  yeah , it's Tom Hanks . In fact you you don't see uh Private Ryan until the end more or less , or you see mm  because they they're looking for him , yeah . 
A:  Yeah , about two thirds of the way through the movie , 'cause most of the movie is them find trying to find him on the front , right ? No , no . 
C:  Yeah , but in the end you can ref yes . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  He's Private Ryan , Tom Hanks ? No he's not . He's trying to find him . 
B:  No , Tom Tom  
C:  No . 
A:  Yeah , he's trying to find him . 
B:  Yeah . Well the caption says Captain John Miller , so . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  So i if you look at the caption um  yep . So he's uh he's  
D:  Yeah , yeah . Okay . 
A:   Private Ryan was Matt Damon I think , yeah . 
B:  Yeah , so the Private is just a simple soldier actually . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  By the way , did he fied dinally  uh f fi <laugh> died finally or not ? 
B:  Uh who , Private Ryan or  no no , they find him actually and they send him back to the family , but the Captain dies actually , Tom Han 
C:  Uh the Private Ryan , yeah . Th they  I remember I remember they found him , but  ah okay , yes yes yes . 
A:  Yeah . Is it him at the begin it's him at the beginning of the movie at the at the the graveyard , right ? 
B:  L 
C:  Because I remember  <other> 
B:  Oh yeah , it's Private Ryan , yeah , remembering at the beginning . Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah , with his family . Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Because I remember that th in the end of the movie they are trying to defend some bridge or something and there's quite heavy shooting and uh finally it's actually John Miller who die . Okay okay . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Yeah , exactly , yeah , he dies unfortunately . So yeah , there is sacrifices and  
C:  It's not the Private Ryan 
D:  At the end , to tell you the truth , I didn't like so much the movie because it was quite moralistic , because there were a guy who was  who didn't kill German because he was quite non-violent . And because he didn't kill this German , the German killed , I don't know , uh maybe um  
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Oh . 
C:  Perhaps it was a g uh this uh Tom Hanks , yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Oh yeah , yeah . 
D:  And it was like , if he had killed the mm 
B:  Yeah , the German . 
C:  If he would kill him , he wouldn't die . Wow . Tom Hanks wouldn't die . 
B:  Uh-huh . Yeah . 
D:  Because he e yeah . 
B:  Well I mean yeah , it has a moral dimension all over the movie , you know , saving the individual and the guys . 
topic_description:	movie plot


C:  What is the movie about , the La Vita e Bella ? 
B:  Oh it's uh it's about  again about the camps and the Second World War . So it's about uh a family of Italians which uh g arrives into a a death camp , and in fact it's treated in a more or less humorous mode , so um the father tries to hide from i from his boy that they are in a death camp , and it's this very strange mm well , not really humour , but relation between the uh  how 
D:  But it was in English , no ? 
A:  <other> 
C:  Ah-ha . 
A:  I don't think so . No , it was an Italian . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Uh-huh . Uh-huh uh-huh . How it end up , what is the what is the ending of the movie ? 
B:  Well the boy gets saved , but the father dies . Yeah . So I don't know i it created some controversies I think , because people said you shouldn't do any form of humour related to the camps , but it's very very moving , so I think it's  anyway um Italian , so . 
C:  Mm-hmm mm-hmm . <other> Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  That's actually the third movie about the Second War . Schindler's List , a P uh Saving Private Ryan and La Vita e Bella .

topic_description:	movie plot


B:   Okay uh Denis . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yep , so I have uh a quite different movie to propose you . I don't know uh  it's f called The Big Lebowski from um uh Joel Coen . Actually they are brothers , you probably know them . I don't know how many of you have seen this movie . 
A:  <laugh> No . 
B:  Haven't seen it , but uh I heard it's very funny . And I've seen some other films by by the Coen brothers . 
D:  No ? 
C:  Just partially I think . 
D:  Yeah , they made uh Fargo , which is in the list . 
B:  Yeah , which is in your table . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  And uh 
B:  Um the last one was the one with Catherine Zeta-Jones uh . 
D:  uh Cr uh Cruel Intentions , or something like that I think , or  
B:  Crue crue Yeah , something about cruelty or  very funny . 
D:  okay , actually I wanted to propose you some posters related to this movie . Uh maybe it w maybe it's going to open the discussion on on posters as well . 
C:  Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
B:  Y you wrote the paragraph on the poster ? 
D:  Uh I I took it from  I don't know where . So uh 
B:  <laugh> Okay . <laugh> Could be edited a bit . <laugh> 
D:  Uh I wanted to say some information to involve people on  in the committee as well , if they want to take part to the committee to select movies . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> And uh  what else ? 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  S some  
C:  I think this is not bad , because they say something little bit about our uh movie club and uh , yeah , The Big Lebowski it's clear that it's a movie and uh I guess the people can remember that it was a movie at least , even if they haven't see it . 
A:  Looks like a C_D_ cover . <laugh> 
B:  Mm-hmm . <laugh> 
C:  CD cover . <laugh> 
topic_description:	movie selection presentation


D:  Actu Actually I'm not going to sp to describe much more The Big Lebowski , but uh it's quite hard to describe , it's uh it's it's a journey about this guy , but it's it's a movie , quite surrealistic , I mean there are some part that are like coming from dreams and uh   
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Why the movie is called The Big Lebowski ? Why The Big  uh Lebowski is his uh family name , right , but why it's called The Big  
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah , it's his family name and uh actually Jeffrey Lebowski and he's he's the  there is a a story with another Lebowski that  yeah . 
B:   Yeah . Yeah , there are two Lebowskis in the film . 
C:  Okay . And why The Big Lebowski ? It's the it's the second one or  <laugh> 
D:  And uh  <laugh> I I I don't remember , maybe it's just uh uh because of The Big Sleep there is uh 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Uh-huh . Ah okay , okay . Uh-huh . 
B:  Yeah , there should be a reference there . Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
D:  I don't know , a reference . So it's a kind of  it's like American Beauty in some way , it's even worse . We see worse people . So it's kind of uh an ethnographic movie I would say , but uh  and it's a modern hero , it's it's quite fun . And the casting is is marvellous , so that is  that's it for this movie . 
topic_description:	movie plot


D:  Okay so , I don't know how I'm going to sell you this movie , because actually the plot is impossible to make , because it's um  actually it's inspired from a movie called The Big Sleep and um  
A:  <laugh> <laugh> 
B:  A movie or a novel ? 
D:  Uh it's actually the t where I've seen that ? In a  it's uh a movie from Raymond Chandler , The Big Sleep . It's uh  
B:  No , but they say that Raymond Chandler wrote the novel . You see , it's the the last but one paragraph on your second page . 
D:  Ah okay . Yeah yeah yeah . So it's it's uh it's a novel , okay . But uh  then the story goes that while that film was in production  and director  , okay , okay you're right , it was a book . Okay , so it's about a a g a guy who called the D the Dude , I don't know you pronounce it , and uh he's actually uh smoking pot and doing nothing , just um  <other> he's living in L_A_ . It's uh it's a typical typical fellow from the from the suburb , and he has some friends , uh typical friends , one one is uh an old guy from  coming back from Vietnam , obsessed by Vietnam , um another guy who is never speaking , and they all play together uh bowling . 
B:  I think so . Mm . 
C:  <laugh> Mm-hmm . 
D:  And um <other> the casting is very interesting , there is um  
topic_description:	movie plot


D:  So actually here you  on this  the first poster you can see the actors from the movie , I don't know if you know some of them , so Jeff Bridges at the top , uh Goodman is the second one , the b the big guy . Then Turturro , and uh uh the last one is Buscemi , and I don't remember the name of the girl .

D:  And um <other> I just wanted to go to the design of the poster actually . 
A:  Hmm . I quite like that . 
D:  Because  
B:  Yeah . It's probably a bit dark for a poster , but otherwise it's very nice . 
D:  Yeah . Yep . The idea is is also to discuss the content . Shall we put a summary of the movie or the plot , and w what kind of information do we want ? So that's the first poster . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  There is alo um this poster , quite dark also . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Uh so y y I don't know if you  you cannot really see , but uh mm there is the the pricing information . So we said that one movie is eight Francs and three movies eighteen Francs . And we can have annual subscrip subscription of sixty Francs . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Yeah .

A:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh okay , it's a dream . 
D:  And uh the the first part is actually y you see a cowboy and the the hero , the Jeffrey Lebowski , the Dude . And the cowboy , it's actually  at the beginning of the movie , the c the cowboy introduce the story , and he's coming back at the end of the story , and he's e explaining what kind of movie uh you are going to to see . <laugh>

topic_description:	movie plot


D:  And last posters  
B:  Yeah . Hmm . 
D:  So same principle , but I w I don't know , I w I was thinking of adding some some um cita quotations of uh well known directors . 
B:  Uh-huh . Yeah . 
D:  And uh  
B:  I like it because it's not so dark , so the images are a bit um brighter . 
C:  Yeah , but I <laugh>  on the contrary I would say there is too many colours and uh it's difficult to read and uh  
A:  I actually don't like it . <laugh> It looks like two  yeah . It's  it looks like two separate posters . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Although I think you can mix  I would keep the format of the first one , add the quotes and the content information from the second one . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
D:  <other> 
C:  Yeah , that would be the best . 
A:  So take those take those quotes , get rid of that section <other> of text , put those quotes in there , put the the information you had in the second poster about the movie club , how to join , kind of in the middle and keep this title and everything just slightly higher up . 
C:  <cough> 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Okay . Okay . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Okay , I see . 
B:  Wh what about a brighter background , because this one , I don't know how it would show on a wall or something like this . It doesn't really catch your attention . 
A:  I think it does . I think the contrast between the the the strip of film and  or the strip of pictures and everything else is  
B:  'Kay . 
D:  And yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Mm . Yeah . Okay . 
D:  Okay , I see  what I wanted is more or less to know the content of the movie , uh what y you want to have on the poster . 
C:  <cough> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . No , the content was very good in the second one . Th 
D:  Because we di we  Okay , on that one . 
A:  Yeah , so take all of that content throw it up into the first one , and then maybe add the quotes that you had from the from the famous directors sort of at the bottom or something . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , all this information is very good . 
C:  Yeah , all this information and put into the first one . Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm .
