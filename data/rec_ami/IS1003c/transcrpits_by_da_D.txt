Mm-hmm . 
No 
y you do the minutes first , 
or ? 
No ? 
Okay . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Yeah 
but how how is  how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? 
Okay . Okay . 
But this this  but this would never happen anyway . 
Yeah  
Yeah , 
but the  
Yeah 
but this  
Yeah . 
I don't think it  
Oh , okay , okay , 
you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . 
No . 
No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . 
Yeah . 
Uh if you if if you use the basic  
But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . 
Because then you need uh  
I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
this could be downloaded by the web maybe , 
or  
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah , 
but then w 
Yeah , 
we have to take care of the twelve Euros 
problem . 
Okay . 
No , 
but then it's it's like this uh  
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
But you would still have the buttons . 
Or is it  
do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? 
Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? 
Okay , 
so you  
yeah . 
Yeah , 
I dunno . 
It's a bit risky risky . 
<other> Yeah , 
I dunno . 
What ? 
If if  
I mean , uh 
I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . 
But if if if it like doubles uh 
no one would would be interested . 
Yeah . 
No , 
I mean  
Y 
No , 
but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , 
or  
No . No . 
Cause for example  yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
you wou you would  
True . 
I mean , for example the goo y 
you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller . 
I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . 
Google is <other> is simple , 
works fine , 
so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . 
Uh thi this  
I mean , 
the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition 
or  
if he has something that works fine and is really <other> fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . 
See <other>  
That's the problem , 
yeah . 
I mean , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . 
But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product 
and so . 
I mean , that's the point . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <laugh> 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
Dunno . 
I dunno if you remember what you had to say 
or  
I think it's more interesting what he says , 
okay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , true . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Special for  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . 
It's it's expensive I I guess . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Uh no , 
trend watching . 
<cough> The other one . <cough> 
Yeah . Uh , I think so , 
just  
Yeah , so 
just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market 
and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , 
so 
next . 
So 
again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . 
Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . 
They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , 
okay . 
Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  I mean <other> i i it sounds good technically 
but it's it's not what they want 
and uh  
So , 
second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , 
so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . 
At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . 
So 
that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis . 
Now i if we look at fashion in general um  
Okay . 
Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , 
okay , 
so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . 
'Cause it's it's really what people want . 
Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . 
And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . 
Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . 
Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones . 
So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , 
and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris 
we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . 
And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , 
okay so 
this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design . 
I dunno . 
Yeah 
thi this is this would be like um 
plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh 
device , 
so um 
Okay , 
tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . 
Yeah , so when I think it's  
Mm-hmm 
<laugh> 
Maybe not no wood , 
but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know . 
Yeah , maybe the base . 
But still y 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . 
But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , 
or 
I dunno . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah  
d 
I dunno . 
What interface ? 
Yeah , 
no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends . 
If possible . 
Hmm . 
Okay .
