Yep . 
Yeah . 
No no no . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
So uh 
first I will present the concept of user interface . 
Um there's three concepts in the user interface . 
So first one it's a Google controller . 
The second is a fancy controller . 
The last one is uh intelligent controller . 
So there are three concepts in our controller . 
Um n next I will explain one by one , 
the first is Google controller . 
Um , so 
I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . 
So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . 
Uh this is a first concept of our controller . 
The second concept is a fancy controller , 
um so 
we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , 
um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , 
so so 
the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um 
attractive . 
Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides . 
<laugh> Yeah , 
it's very , 
you know 
if you're  
Yeah . 
It's hard f i 
it's easy for you to remember it . <laugh> Or to recognise it , 
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So 
the last uh concept is intelligent . 
We want uh we want our controller to be smart , 
so maybe we should uh use um uh 
technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , 
so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um 
With this advanced features we  I think we can attract a lot of user . 
Okay . 
No . 
There  
this is the three concepts of our controller . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , so  
Y 
Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . 
For example , if you cannot find your uh <laugh> controller , you can just uh <laugh> just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two . 
Yeah . 
So you can use your gesture . 
That's no problem . <laugh> 
For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very  
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
they cannot speak at the same time . 
Yeah , 
it's very interesting . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . 
Even you h you have the controller , I can <other> I can say channel three , 
so it's c come to channel three , 
I don't have to <laugh>  
It's advantage . 
How much ? 
No no 
we we d we we just are use um  
No no 
we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , 
we don't have to do some basic research on this field . 
Yeah , 
I think it's uh  
because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , 
it's very  
it's uh  
yeah . 
It's  
No 
it's uh  
Even for the f um because the the vocabulary  the  
The vocabulary is very small , 
so that's not a problem . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
the key , the key um the key of our  the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation 
mechanism . 
It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . 
It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French . 
<laugh> Yeah , 
it's  
Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed . 
So  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Oh n Yeah , yeah 
tha that's why we have to do language adaptation . 
Yeah . 
Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to  
No , it's not so complex <laugh> . 
No no no 
it's not  
I think that's n that's not a problem 
because you you don't have to wear a microphone . 
It it just  the microphone is embedded in the controller . 
Where is the controller ? 
It's in your family , in your home . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
you can you can embed it uh microphone here . 
Yeah yeah 
just  you just put the controller here , 
then you 
you use your command 
and you do s your gesture . 
No no 
it's n y <other>  if you lose it  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
think it  we should give the uh flexibility to the user 
and we think  
yeah . 
You can see  they can switch form one modality to another . 
No , 
that's quite inter quite attractive . 
Well , 
if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . <laugh> 
We should have confidence in technology . <laugh> 
More features , 
yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah 
but if if you stick to um  
stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? 
There's no k features of our controller , 
so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? 
Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that  
<other> Yeah , 
you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , 
that's a function of T_V_ . 
You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , 
but  
Okay . 
But it's not the  only the problem  only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ . 
Yeah , 
but we do we do we we 
we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , 
but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , 
but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . 
That's  
the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , 
but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our  from other products . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , uh  
Yeah , 
if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Oh yes , 
but there's no big difference between the traditional controller . 
The  then nn 
no . 
Tha 
But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . 
That's the same  
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
It did didn't r receive it . Didn't receive it . 
Participant one . Participant one . 
Yeah , 
maybe we can first come to 
uh to Frahan . With Frahan , 
then you can prepare your slides , 
then present it later . 
Okay . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Uh-huh . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
So 
you got email ? 
Mm . 
Later ? <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Pla 
Uh yes . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
The smart controller . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
It's good . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . Yep 
Okay . 
Okay .
