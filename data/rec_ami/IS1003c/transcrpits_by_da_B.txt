<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
A nice one . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . Maybe . 
Oh yeah , <laugh> that's a good  that's a good point , so . 
One and  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yep . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah but <laugh> Yeah 
but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control 
because the  
<laugh> That's right . 
<laugh> It's  it's  <laugh> 
And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to 
manual controllers , eh . 
No , 
more expensive maybe . 
Well 
y y you have also the language problem , 
you know 
when you  
'Cause it it have to be universal , 
so . 
<other> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah 
but you know . The product  The pro 
<laugh> It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe <laugh> 
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
But  
Yeah 
but the problem is how to s 
you know 
if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . 
If you have the language , you have to develop for each country . 
Yeah , 
but for each country you have to do one , 
because uh the for example for Se <laugh> 
Oh really ? 
<laugh> That's  <laugh> 
Comple 
<laugh> 
A microphone maybe . 
To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe . 
I if you say one , he switch to channel , 
yeah . 
So well 
for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . 
Devic 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
but so you need a camera and you know a microphone <laugh> inside your remote control . 
Yeah . 
But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , 
so  although y y 
Yeah 
but i i <other> 
<laugh> Yeah , we should . <laugh> Uh . 
Mm . 
Yeah , but  
I think he need a control that is very reliable , 
so . 
<laugh> Yeah . Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
It's not really the  we 
we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so  or something like that . 
But uh I think a user need  
Don't have a  the the  
Yeah 
if we can send email from it . 
Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if  
Yeah  
<laugh> 
And for all the person of the family maybe , 
so , 
yeah . 
Because you have new  
<other> Ye <other> 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah , participant two um  
Yeah , working design , 
so . 
So 
I think  
Can you go to the <laugh> next one ? 
I uh  
it's not this one . 
It's uh oth the oth <laugh> so I  
It's the working design . 
Sorry . 
<laugh> Component design . 
So this yeah  so this is the described use  
What ? 
Are you inst 
I don't think so . 
Oh . 
Maybe I record recorded directly on the  Computer . 
Okay , okay . Yes . 
I can say it to you without . 
<laugh> Yeah , 
exac 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
In fact , I don't know , 
I s 
because i in my presentation I don't have here with <laugh> 
so  
It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r 
of the remote control . 
So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside 
and  so . 
So 
I  in fact the the  f 
something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , 
so 
will  it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control 
or a a plastic remote control like this one . 
So and <other> 
in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , 
so 
it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , 
or you have also some button like L_C_D_ 
where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , 
or , you know , you can see them in the darkness . 
And 
the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , 
so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation 
or will it be a battery like the classical battery 
so . 
And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have 
uh both of them , 
so so 
for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come 
and  so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah mm . 
Ecologists , 
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
<other> 
Alrigh 
In fact , having them both will  
if we want to have battery , regular battery and and <other> the solar energy battery it could be  it'll it will add a little bit of the price , 
but it will be an added value also 
that will be compensated , 
so hmm . 
And the materials , 
it depends 
for example you  if you have a wooden material it can be more  
the plastic material is more common 
it's very resistant 
but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , 
or you know , you can have some  
Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood 
and it can be interesting . 
And so 
the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , 
it depends , 
but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah , 
I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , 
so . 
 
I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know <other> lighted buttons 
because , you know , it's  I don't know <laugh> um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion 
and it's related to how beautiful it is 
or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness 
or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness 
it's very easy so , right . 
<other> I think a touch screen <other> will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so . 
But  And it is a kind of other design , I mean . 
It can also be interesting to have this kind of  
<other> 
Mm . 
 
Ah yes . 
Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah . 
Okay . 
And fruit and vegetables 
yeah . 
<laugh> Spongy <laugh> 'Kay . 
Okay , yeah , yeah . 
Yeah , 
but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? 
Pla 
S 
Very stuff  
Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Solar . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
It will be a  
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I think <other>  
Yeah , yeah . Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> No wood 
but  Plastic ? 
Would some  
I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . 
It depends on the design we want , 
so . 
Yeah , it's natural 
and i 
And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , 
you know , 
saying that it's ecol 
Mm , yeah , it's not right , 
so . 
Okay . 
<other> Google and  
and fancy , 
f 
how about the the voice ? 
<laugh> And <other> 
Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested 
and how  
<other> It It is an an interesting concept to see  to have uh voice control . 
Mm . Yeah . 
But  and 
the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , 
so . 
But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , 
so . 
Yeah , L_C_D_ . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
And pf what can we think a supplement to  
I think the supplement can be the voice <other> . 
It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of  
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . Mm . 
To push button , 
yeah , yeah . 
Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four . 
Yeah , turning <other>  yeah , yeah . 
Not very complex commands , but easy commands , 
so . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , simple ones 
for  
<laugh> 
<laugh> expensive buttons  <laugh> 
Yeah , 
to make some new  
<laugh> Yeah . 
Okay , 
fruits . 
Okay . 
Need it to be , okay . 
<other> <laugh> Okay . 
Okay . 
Sounds good , mm-hmm .
