<other> So 
let's start our second me meeting on <other> conceptual design . 
So , 
as the previous meeting I will be the secretary 
and we will have three presentations 
and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept 
and finally we'll close the decision . 
So 
I will first uh  
What ? 
I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . 
So , 
we'll  
S 
technical accessoire ? 
Interface ? 
This . 
<laugh> I'm not sure the one in the middle <laugh> is very attractive . 
<laugh> It's very big , 
<laugh> yeah . 
<laugh> <laugh> Okay . 
Yeah , why not . <other> 
We'll have big discussion I suppose after that , 
so . 
Okay . 
Something else ? 
I just have one question , 
because for the intelligent controller , <other> you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , 
but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . 
Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? 
Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? 
or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . 
You don't think so ? 
Yeah , sure . 
I 
That's true . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller . 
Broken arm ? 
Yeah , 
but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? 
Why ? 
If you have one brother and one sister 
and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme , 
so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , 
so . 
Yeah , 
but you have the remote control , 
so maybe you can keep it f with you . 
You're not you're not obliged to share it . 
Yeah , 
we can  
yeah . 
Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage . 
Yeah , 
but one other question . 
How how much will it cost ? 
Yeah . 
Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working . 
Some some efficient . 
So 
you think it won't cost an  Not a lot for us ? 
Or ? 
Yeah , 
but uh uh  
Mm-mm . 
Yeah . I agree with uh  
Yeah , 
but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international 
remote control . 
We need something that is international . 
Suppose we're  we want to sell it in France . 
The recognition system will be able to understand French . 
If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , 
so . 
Mm , okay . 
And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? 
Yeah , 
but how will you  
Oh . 
Seems to be quite complex . 
And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? 
And where will be they ? 
Do you think if we're far from television it will work ? 
Yeah , 
but where is the controller ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
but we're  
here it's uh an object . 
But here you say you want to use i uh s technology . 
Yeah , 
but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . 
If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object . 
You just want to interact with television . 
<other> Yeah , 
but you can lose it . 
<laugh> 
Okay 
you  so you can build a kind of black box 
and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . 
Ah . 
Yeah , 
Mm . 
I think so . 
And maybe it will be quite  
<other> Okay . <other> 
Hmm . So , 
what do you think ? 
We'll try the controllers you'd prefer . 
Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? 
So 
I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller 
and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . 
Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? 
Hmm ? 
Just want to have something  controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . 
You think it's possible ? 
Yeah , 
but uh we want so 
Yeah , 
but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . 
You don't need to tune it . 
Yeah , why not ? 
If it's  
Not too expensive too . 
Okay . So 
let's go to the Industrial Designer . 
Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , 
so . 
Two ? 
Working ? 
I can  
Okay . 
It's okay <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Uh I think there's something wrong with your  
Maybe you you record it somewhere else . 
Interface concept . 
No . 
Mm mm . 
Uh . <other> 
Nope . <other> 
It seems that we have a problem with the  
Yeah , 
so  
No , 
I think it will be more interesting to start with uh  
Yeah . 
You will had s some more information in  
I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation . 
So . 
Okay . 
Okay , never mind . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control 
and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers 
and 
but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , 
no ? 
So . 
Okay . 
And what tha what about the uh materials ? 
Impersonal , mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
and i if you  we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm okay , 
seems to be interesting , mm . 
Yeah , 
we want something easy to use 
and  so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . 
And you think that we will be  
Okay . 
So 
wood . 
And what about the buttons ? 
No 
it's fashion , yeah . 
I dunno . 
<other> I think we have only <laugh> <other> uh five minutes left . 
Participant four ? 
Functional requirements ? 
This one ? 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
So 
we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . 
So , <other> 
as you say you want something technologically innovative , 
maybe using solar energy and  with battery would be something interesting , 
maybe will attract 
pro-ecology consumers . 
Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well . 
Case . 
So you think  case . 
Something spongy . <laugh> 
Someth no wood . 
Maybe you  
It's it's natural . 
Th The feeling is natural , 
so maybe we can stay with wood . 
But it's still fashion . 
Yeah , 
something that you can <other> into it . 
Uh and what about the user interface concept ? 
Google and fancy ? 
Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . 
<other> Yeah , 
but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice . 
That's true . 
So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , 
maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . 
And L_C_D_ buttons . 
Yeah , 
I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . 
Yeah , 
for the interface something  added value . 
With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use 
commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers . 
Turning the T_V_ o on o or off . 
So , 
adding some vocal commands . 
Simple ones ? 
Okay . 
<other> So 
the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes 
<other> so <other> 
we'll  you will all have to work in in your direction . 
So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition . 
Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons <laugh> 
and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . 
<other> And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control 
and uh the colour of the um the society will be really  it will be seen in the remote control . 
So you will have  Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype 
and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control , 
so you will have to model model something . 
And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . 
So , 
no more questions , 
we can close the session . 
Yeah . Okay , cool .
