A:  <other> So let's start our second me meeting on <other> conceptual design . So , as the previous meeting I will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first uh  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  No y you do the minutes first , or ? 
A:  What ? 
D:  No ? 


A:  I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . 
D:  Okay . 
C:  Yep . 
A:  So , we'll  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  S technical accessoire ? Interface ? 
C:  No no no . Yeah . 
A:  This . 
C:  Mm . So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . Um there's three concepts in the user interface . So first one it's a Google controller . The second is a fancy controller . The last one is uh intelligent controller . So there are three concepts in our controller . Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um 
D:  Mm . 
B:  Mm . A nice one . 
C:  attractive . Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides . 
A:  <laugh> I'm not sure the one in the middle <laugh> is very attractive . <laugh> It's very big , <laugh> yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah , it's very , you know if you're  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . <laugh> Or to recognise it , yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> <laugh> Okay . Yeah , why not . <other> We'll have big discussion I suppose after that , so . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah . So the last uh concept is intelligent . 


B:  <other> 
C:  So you got email ? 


A:  I dunno . <other> I think we have only <laugh> <other> uh five minutes left . Participant four ? Functional requirements ? 
D:  Okay . Uh no , trend watching . <cough> The other one . <cough> 
A:  This one ? 
D:  Yeah . Uh , I think so , just  Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  I mean <other> i i it sounds good technically but it's it's not what they want and uh  
C:  Mm . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis . Now i if we look at fashion in general um  
B:   
D:  Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . 
B:  Ah yes . Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah . 
D:  'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones . So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris 
B:  Okay . And fruit and vegetables yeah . 
D:  we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design . 
B:  <laugh> Spongy <laugh> 'Kay . Okay , yeah , yeah . 
D:  I dunno . 
B:  Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? 
D:  Yeah thi this is this would be like um 
B:  Pla 
D:  plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh 
B:  S Very stuff  Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . Yeah . 
D:  device , so um 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . 
B:  Okay . 


A:  So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . So , <other> as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and  with battery would be something interesting , maybe will attract 
B:  Yeah . Solar . 
D:  Yeah , so when I think it's  
B:  Okay . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah . It will be a  
A:  pro-ecology consumers . Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah , I think <other>  Yeah , yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Case . 
C:  Later ? <laugh> 
A:  So you think  case . Something spongy . <laugh> Someth no wood . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> No wood but  Plastic ? 
D:  Maybe not no wood , but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know . 
B:  Would some  
C:  Pla 
A:  Maybe you  
B:  I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . It depends on the design we want , so . 
D:  Yeah , maybe the base . 
A:  It's it's natural . 
D:  But still y 
B:  Yeah , it's natural and i 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Th The feeling is natural , so maybe we can stay with wood . 
B:  And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol 
D:  Yeah , I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . 
B:  Mm , yeah , it's not right , so . 
A:  But it's still fashion . 
D:  But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , or I dunno . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  Yeah , something that you can <other> into it . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh and what about the user interface concept ? 
B:  <other> Google and  
A:  Google and fancy ? 
B:  and fancy , f how about the the voice ? <laugh> And <other> 
A:  Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . 
C:  Uh yes . 
B:  Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how  <other> It It is an an interesting concept to see  to have uh voice control . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . The smart controller . <laugh> 
B:  Mm . Yeah . But  and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , so . 
A:  <other> Yeah , but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice . 
B:  But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so . 
A:  That's true . 
D:  Yeah  d 
C:  Okay . 
D:  I dunno . 
A:  So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . 
C:  Mm . Yeah . It's good . 
A:  And L_C_D_ buttons . 
B:  Yeah , L_C_D_ . 
A:  Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . 
B:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . And pf what can we think a supplement to  
D:  What interface ? 
A:  Yeah , for the interface something  added value . 
B:  I think the supplement can be the voice <other> . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of  
A:  With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers . 
B:  Yeah . Mm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  To push button , yeah , yeah . Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four . Yeah , turning <other>  yeah , yeah . Not very complex commands , but easy commands , so . 
A:  Turning the T_V_ o on o or off . So , adding some vocal commands . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Simple ones ? 
B:  Yeah , simple ones for  
A:  Okay . 


A:  <other> So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes <other> so <other> we'll  you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition . Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons <laugh> and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yep . Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> expensive buttons  <laugh> Yeah , to make some new  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  <other> And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too . 
D:  Yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Okay , fruits . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  If possible . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really  it will be seen in the remote control . So you will have  Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control , so you will have to model model something . 
B:  Need it to be , okay . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <other> <laugh> Okay . 
C:  Okay . Yep 
A:  And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  So , no more questions , we can close the session . 
C:  Okay . 
D:  Hmm . 
B:  Sounds good , mm-hmm . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Yeah . Okay , cool . 
C:  Okay .
