Easy to learn .

Yeah . 
I also think we should not add too many buttons . 
Modern day uh remotes have <other> too much buttons I think . 
Precisely . 
Yeah . 
Yeah indeed . 
Yeah 
we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we uh we make ? 
Yeah . 
And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes . 
So we can keep that in mind . 
<other> 
W well it's a n it's a new remote 
and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it . 
Yeah alright , but  
Yeah . Yeah 
we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things . 
Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and  
Yeah or so

 but young people want something different 
and it is
