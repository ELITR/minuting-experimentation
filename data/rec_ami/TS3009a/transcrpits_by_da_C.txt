I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment . 
<laugh> 
I I I <laugh> I understand . 
Alright . 
 so start  
<other> Yep yes . 
Don't uh count on it . 
<laugh> I think it's a mouse or a rat . 
Oh . 
Oh I know it . 
It's a hedgehog . 
Well I'm amazed uh about your uh drawing skills . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<other> I am the Industrial Designer . 
Chief , I am the Industrial Designer . 
Yeah . 
<other> I think  It's pr it resembles <laugh> the animal drawn by  . 
I think  
can I say it ? 
<laugh> 
It looks amazing . 
These are very impor <other> 
These are very important documents , of course , uh these drawings , uh  
And he deliberately draws a animal we don't know the English word for . 
It looks like an uh  
It looks like that beast from Sesame Street . 
Yeah . 
It's it's uh  
<laugh> 
Do we have to uh  
But we have uh <other> do we have to name the specific species of the bird ? 
No ? 
Well wonderful . 
<other> Why do I have to do the difficult tasks ? 
Uh pen  
yeah that's  . 
Uh current colour . 
I like uh  
oh they don't have pink . 
<other> Oh b oh <other> think this is uh  
Uh ? Uh  
Line width . 
Uh <other> <laugh> fifteen . 
And I can draw ? 
Uh  
<laugh> 
Oh the line width is too thick , but oh well . 
Uh . 
It smiles nicely . 
Now <other> I have to change the line width . <other> 
Uh one <other>  . 
These are  whiskers , you know . 
Uh well I think it's obvious right now . 
Miaow . 
Well if this isn't obvious  
<other> I'll save it <laugh> alright uh save . 
Uh yeah uh blank . 
Well I feel comfortable now . 
Thanks for this exercise . 
I feel totally at ease . 
Yeah something like that . 
So  
<laugh> 
Alright . 
Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh   
it's not , it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls , 
but uh  
Mm-hmm . 
No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh 
and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise . 
Alright . 
Yeah 
so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh  
And stereo uh s uh audio installations . 
Most people do , yeah . 
It doesn't  
it doesn't have to be  
Yeah . 
Well . 
Hmm . 
It has to be different and familiar at the same time . 
 yeah the shape will will have to be recognised . 
I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing  
you can make it uh triangle shaped , 
but that's not uh very recognisable . 
Oval ? 
I  
Mm . <other> 
Oh but it ha it has to be m 
yeah . 
But you still have to know it's a remote and not another  
Yeah . 
Yeah 
so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful 
or else uh they would have been ano another shape . 
Yeah . Yeah 
a lo  the long box shape yeah . 
You have to <other> use one hand . 
Why not ? 
But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , 
and you can make it another shape , 
but then you have  
W no w what else ? 
I di 
Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then ? 
Hmm . Well <other> 
but it's still then uh the the long box , 
uh but then with some uh round uh <other> round forms in it to fit your hand , 
but it's it's still  
Yeah yeah al alright 
but but it's still it's still  sort of box , yeah . 
It it has round forms 
but it in the end it's still the box , so that's what I mean . 
Yeah yeah I understand , 
but  no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square 
but a also with round edges of course , 
but in in in at the end it's still this long <other> box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh <other> to fit . 
Yeah yes <other> 
I thought about something like that . 
Yeah . 
A big recognisable button on top or something . 
The buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course , 
and uh n uh uh not too close uh together . 
Uh-huh . 
Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions . 
<other> Yeah . 
Colours , yeah . 
I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um  
 . 
<other> 
Already thought about something tha <other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah now we can still talk about the material , 
we have some some minutes left uh  
I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , 
the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh . 
No n n 
Mm . Alright . 
And of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh <other> to connect things uh to each other . 
I think so . 
It's a a common stan standard way  
infrared beams an infrared beam I think  . 
It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things . 
<laugh> 
And have  well yeah 
I've wrote something down about how it works . <laugh> 
The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly , 
but that's pretty obvious , I think . <other> 
Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something 
uh b a simple colour not not very flashy . 
Pink television sets <other> pink remote ,  . 
Alright . 
I must not forget my pen the next time . <laugh> 
Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task , yeah . 
Yeah I uh w was wondering that too . 
Y you went to the company website  . 
It's the the the start uh starting page uh  
<cough> Very handy to know . 
Right see you in half an hour then . 
W 
Right uh see you in thirty minutes then . <laugh>
