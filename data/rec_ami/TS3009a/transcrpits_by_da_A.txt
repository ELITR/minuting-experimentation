 <laugh> 
Yo . 
Ow . 
 <laugh> 
Uh  
Yeah . 
What the  
Uh  
Yeah well , ja well let's just start . 
<laugh> <other> I've uh made a presentation 
uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard , so we can all see it . 
So it's in the project documents 
because that's what we can find here . 
Well  . <laugh> 
Very nice . 
Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting . 
So uh <other> I'm the Project Manager , 
so I had to fill it in , 
and uh hmm . <laugh> <other> 
Oh sorry . <other> 
And  an uh a nice agenda . <cough> 
Uh we'll do the opening 
and then uh we'll meet each other , 
what uh we already do , 
so , that's not uh very much trouble . 
I'll I'll show you the the tools we have here , so that we can all use them . 
Then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction . 
We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project , 
and then uh we'll close the meeting , 
and then we can uh individually uh do our things 
and then uh we'll get back here . 
So <other> this the opening we'll uh  
We have to uh design a new television remote control . 
You have heard that uh already I think , so . 
Um we want it to be original , 
so a nice uh a nice new design . 
Uh trendy , it's <other> also for young people , 
and we have to just uh make it uh modern . 
And uh friendly , 
so size does matter . 
And uh  Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place , that kin those kind of things . 
Other uh  
There happen to be uh three stages . 
 
functional , conceptual , and d detailed design . 
Um so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , uh and then go into the next phase . 
That's just it . 
<other> Um  
We have uh these two Smartboards . 
Um well as I just showed , there's a project management folder , a project document folder on the desktop . 
It just works exactly the same as a computer . 
You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop . 
So you can uh make uh <other> Words Excel , everything . 
Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things , 
you can uh draw . 
This is a uh well a drawing board . 
 you have a  these different uh functions on the board . 
You can see them there . 
So you have a a nice pen , 
and it's works just like a bal ball pen . 
<other> This is just a  . 
I want to uh  
Oh yeah . 
Of course w <laugh> doesn't work any more . <laugh> 
Yes I will  
eraser  so . 
It's fantas fantastic . 
We can uh uh well you can save a file . 
So if uh we draw we have to save everything . 
Don't throw anything away . 
Uh just we can start a new one , and we just go on , and don't throw anything away . 
Just uh let them all uh stand here . 
We can delete , but we don't do that . 
Um you can here select a pen , 
you can draw anything you want . 
It's a bit uh childish you have to write . 
It's not as fast as you w you know it , 
but it does work sometimes . 
<laugh> Well it's just like a normal uh paint . 
So it's gone . 
Well we are designers , so we have to have a a more uh a Smartboard . 
So that's fantastic . 
Um well this uh speaks for itself . 
We going to try it . 
So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board , 
not my idea . <laugh> 
Yes our your favourite . 
So um I'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo , 
but I'm going d I'm not going to . 
I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast 
w I dunno what I'm going to design . 
Oh um <other> doesn't  oh . 
Yeah , 'kay . 
Hmm ? 
I just said it's not my idea 
but I am the Project Manager , 
and officially this is my idea . 
<laugh> So  <laugh> 
what ? 
Ah <other> the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose , loosen up , a bit uh meeting each other 
 well uh uh nice yeah . <other> Sh 
I hope our Industrial Designer does this better 
because uh this is uh  
No <cough> <other> 
so a a few legs . 
<laugh> Yes yes 
guess . 
<laugh> Well I should make it an hippo now . <laugh> 
<other> No I don't think so . 
Well what is it , huh ? 
Yeah 
 difficult English word . 
I didn't knew it myself  . <laugh> 
Our characteristics sum it up . 
Well it's uh very <laugh> uh painful 
 <laugh> those kind of thing . 
So we can uh just uh  
We're going back 
and now uh our Industrial Designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal . 
Huh . 
Oh uh but this uh marketing designer . 
<laugh> 
<laugh>  
what kind of animal is that then ? <laugh> 
Uh it  . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
No no no . 
What are you going to do ? 
<other> 
No no . 
No no 
save it and start a new uh  
save it 
and start a new black uh doc  a blank document . 
Yeah well we have to save everything 
so now um the next one uh  
 and then save it and start an blank document . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
There's also different colours 
and different uh well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness . 
So um well you should uh try it but uh  
Well y y y you could have but uh <other> . 
It speaks for itself . 
<laugh> What the  <laugh> 
uh just a duck . <laugh> 
<laugh> Nice . <laugh> 
<other> 
Is it a duck ? 
Is it a plane ? <laugh> 
It doesn't draw uh circles uh that easy uh . 
Yeah 
just a bit a bit childish , 
a bit <other> . 
<laugh> 
Well uh save the document 
and then uh  
And then a a new blank document for  . 
 uh will uh choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it . 
No well first 
yeah . 
And then you go to format I think <laugh> , 
and current colour  
you choose a new colour . 
<laugh> And a new pen width uh  also format . 
It's not like in paint . 
Line width . 
And you can choose a nice one . 
Width width . 
With each other . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> So . Just a wa that's the way we do  
it's quite easy . 
Mm-hmm . <laugh> 
Oh Pussy . <laugh> 
Well then you change it . 
And erase things . 
<laugh> What ? <laugh> 
Super pig . <laugh> 
So  
<laugh> Yeah yeah yeah 
we know . <laugh> 
Yes alright . 
It's a cat . <cough> 
<laugh> 
Well well um  
Yeah 
save it <laugh> and <other> start a new blank document . 
Yep . 
So that's uh what we're going to use when we uh need it . 
Well <laugh> it's terrific , eh ? <laugh> 
Yeah that's it . <laugh> 
We're one big happy family now . <laugh> 
Well then uh the serious uh stuff . 
We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally 
um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars , but uh twenty five Euros . 
Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros . 
So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell . 
<laugh>  we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros 
so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research . 
Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls , 
first  about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera ? 
Well uh we c we can sit down uh 
because uh presentation can wait . 
We can uh take notes <other> and uh  
Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls ? 
Please ? <laugh> 
No uh I did . <laugh> 
Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then  
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah . 
Yep . 
That's alright . 
That would be a nice idea , yes . 
Yep yep yep . 
Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit , so . 
Yes . 
I'll make uh notes 
and then uh maybe uh  
well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now . 
No that's right . 
Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's  
culture uh international . 
Yes . 
Yep , 
and maybe we do uh <other> we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player . 
Don't we have uh other uh ou 
Uh . 
We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw . 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Well yeah . 
It doesn't have to be , but we can . 
Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_ . 
Yeah 
because we look at competitors 
and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design  
Yes . 
Yep . 
Yeah . 
Oo 
N we can use uh it as a as a game pad . 
So <laugh> one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh  <laugh> 
Well i we already uh  
one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so  
Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to  we can imagine uh 
because it's a long time uh on the market . 
So the the form will have <other> been uh tested out so  
Yes . 
Well <other> 
for me personally I have a <other> a lot of remotes uh at home 
but <other> those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle <other> I don't like to use them . 
I have uh have to  it has to fit my hands . 
When it falls over it and I just have  and then the button that I use most has to be here . 
It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with  thumb . 
Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those . 
D_V_D_ players . Yes . <laugh> 
Well  
A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand . 
That's  
<laugh> 
<cough> 
We have five minutes left . 
Yes 
uh that's <other> yep . 
Yep . 
Ha . 
Sound nice . Yes . 
Well it's just uh about our first ideas now 
so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . 
Yes ? 
Yes . 
Well thirty minutes we have . 
So um  
This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh . 
You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh . I think . 
Oh and uh that's uh that's all . 
So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over . 
Yeah yes say . 
Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons 
and when I've had use it much it was gone . 
So it has to be made in the buttons I think . 
It has to uh not be loose . 
Yeah . 
Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television 
so it's all about uh  
It's not that in China it's different ? 
Yeah . 
But y you can have uh of course different between D_V_D_s and televisions and between  
Yeah . 
<laugh> Probably yes . 
China rules . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes . 
Yeah . 
Yes . 
Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it , 
but you can change them uh when you buy the  
And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh  
Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself <other> 
so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh . 
Yes . 
Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell , 
so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so  
 . 
Yeah . 
Well if if you  
yeah . <laugh> 
If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it . 
I think . 
But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh . <laugh> 
Yes . 
<other> 
Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh  I don't know what your specific instructions will be , but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote . 
And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think . 
Or something like that . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Euro ? 
Well it it it's <other> 
if you uh  
Finish meeting now . 
Oh alright . <laugh> 
Well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so  
In thirty minutes , 
but uh I think it will be  you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here . 
I'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh 
because uh <laugh> it's it's the half of the normal size . <laugh> 
Oh right , oh . 
<laugh> Ma <laugh> 
W <other> that was a nice meeting . 
Yeah , see you . <laugh>
