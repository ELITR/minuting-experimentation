topic_description:	drawing exercise_None


A:  Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things , you can uh draw . This is a uh well a drawing board .  you have a  these different uh functions on the board . You can see them there . So you have a a nice pen , and it's works just like a bal ball pen . <other> This is just a  . I want to uh  Oh yeah . Of course w <laugh> doesn't work any more . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> <other> Maybe you should try to write on the on the big white uh  Does it ? Yeah . It works . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yes I will  eraser  so . 
C:  <laugh> <other> Wonderful . 
A:  It's fantas fantastic . We can uh uh well you can save a file . So if uh we draw we have to save everything . Don't throw anything away . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Uh just we can start a new one , 
D:  <other> 
A:  and we just go on , and don't throw anything away . Just uh let them all uh stand here . We can delete , but we don't do that . Um you can here select a pen , you can draw anything you want . It's a bit uh childish you have to write . It's not as fast as you w you know it , but it does work sometimes . <laugh> Well it's just like a normal uh 
C:  <laugh>  . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  paint . So it's gone . 
C:  <other> Alright , yep . 
A:  Well we are designers , so we have to have a a more uh a Smartboard . So that's fantastic . Um well this uh speaks for itself . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  Well then uh the serious uh stuff . We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars , but uh twenty five Euros . Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros . 
C:  So  
A:  So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell . <laugh>  we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Right . 
C:  Alright . 
topic_description:	project budget_None


A:  Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls , first  about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera ? Well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait . We can uh take notes <other> and uh  
D:  Right . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  But are  
A:  Yes . <other> 
topic_description:	discussion_None


A:  Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls ? 
C:  Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh   it's not , it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls , but uh  
A:  Please ? <laugh> No uh I did . <laugh> Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then  
D:  I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control . On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce . Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player 
A:  Yeah yeah . Yep . That's alright . That would be a nice idea , yes . 
D:  so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control . 
A:  Yep yep yep . 
topic_description:	existing products_None


D:  Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe , because we want to we want to  well fifty million ? 
A:  Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit , so . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah yeah so a lot of people have to be able to use it . 
B:  <other> 
C:  No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh 
D:  So  
B:  Easy to learn . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah that's right . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yes . 
C:  and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  I'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh  well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now . Well  yeah ? 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Alright . 
B:  I also think we should not add too many buttons . Modern day uh remotes have <other> too much buttons I think . 
D:  Right . 
A:  No that's right . Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's  culture uh international . 
B:  Precisely . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


D:  Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah indeed . 
A:  Yes . 
C:  Yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh  
D:  Yeah right . 
A:  Yep , and maybe we do uh <other> we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player . Don't we have uh other uh ou 
B:  Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we uh we make ? 
C:  And stereo uh s uh audio installations . 
A:  Uh . We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw . 
D:  Yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yep . 
B:  And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes . So we can keep that in mind . 
C:  Most people do , yeah . 
A:  Well yeah . 
C:  It doesn't  it doesn't have to be  
B:  <other> 
A:  It doesn't have to be , but we can . 
B:  W well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it . 
A:  Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_ . 
D:  Yeah but  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah alright , but  
topic_description:	other_functionality


D:  We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh  
A:  Yeah because we look at competitors and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design  
C:  Well . Hmm . 
D:  Yeah but it's  it has to be useable . 
C:  It has to be different and familiar at the same time . 
A:  Yes . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things . 
A:  Yep . 
C:   yeah the shape will will have to be recognised . I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing  you can make it uh triangle shaped , but that's not uh very recognisable . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> No . 
B:  Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and  
A:  Oo 
C:  Oval ? 
A:  N we can use uh it as a as a game pad . So <laugh> one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh  <laugh> 
C:  I  
B:  Yeah or so 
C:  Mm . <other> 
B:  Well yeah it's new . <laugh> 
D:   . Not with two hands . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah yeah yeah , right . No  <other> 
B:   but young people want something different and it is  
A:  Well i we already uh  one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so  
D:  Yeah but it's quite important that it fits . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh but it ha it has to be m yeah . But you still have to know it's a remote and not another  
B:  Yeah alright . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  It shouldn't be boxy . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah a lo  the long box shape yeah . You have to <other> use one hand . 
A:  It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with  thumb . 
D:  Nah  I don't agree with the long box uh shape <other> it it has to be custom made for the hand . 
C:  Why not ? 
B:  Yeah it doesn't fit  . 
A:  Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , but then you have  
D:  Yeah but if you shape it  
B:  Mm . Yeah it  
D:  Hmm ? 
A:  Well  A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand . That's  
D:  Um . 
C:  Yeah yeah al alright but but it's still it's still  sort of box , yeah . It it has round forms but it in the end it's still the box , so that's what I mean . 
D:   . <other> Well  
B:  Yeah yea 
D:  Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand . It shouldn't be too boxy , you know . It's  
C:  Yeah yeah I understand , but  no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course , but in in in at the end it's still this long 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  <laugh> No no no . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh>  . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah it should be  
C:  <other> box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh 
A:  <cough> 
D:  Right maybe something like this or  <other> and then a button here to switch between <other> different systems like D_V_D_ player and so you can  I've  
C:  <other> to fit . Yeah yes <other> I thought about something like that . Yeah . A big recognisable button on top or something . 
D:  Yeah right , and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  with the with the numbers and <other>  
A:  We have five minutes left . So  <laugh> 
C:  The buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course , and uh n uh uh not too close uh together . 
D:  Right . 
B:  <cough> 
A:  Yes uh that's <other> yep . 
D:  But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . So there has to be some space between the buttons . Yeah . 
A:  Yep . 
C:  Uh-huh . Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions . <other> Yeah . 
D:  Yeah right right , and maybe we should use colours . 
C:  Colours , yeah . 
B:  Yeah  maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well  <laugh> you can you can put on on them , and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs <other> I dunno but  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Ha . 
D:  That's kinda trendy . Yeah right . 
A:  Sound nice . Yes . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to  we can imagine uh because it's a long time uh on the market . So the the form will have <other> been uh tested out so  
C:  Yeah . Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful 
A:  Yes . 
C:  or else uh they would have been ano another shape . 
A:  Well <other> for me personally I have a <other> a lot of remotes uh at home but <other> those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle <other> I don't like to use them . I have uh have to  it has to fit my hands . When it falls over it and I just have  and then the button that I use most has to be here . 
topic_description:	existing products_None


B:  No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_  with their uh remotes <laugh> pl players <laugh> they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped . They're all um  
D:  If  <laugh> 
A:  D_V_D_ players . Yes . <laugh> 
C:  W no w what else ? I di 
D:  No that's ol old fashioned . 
B:  Well  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then ? 
D:  I can imagine that us 
B:  Yes uh  Well <other> most of  of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end . 
D:  Well  Yeah right . It fits in your palms . 
C:  Hmm . Well <other> but it's still then uh the the long box , uh but then with some uh round uh <other> round forms in it to fit your hand , but it's it's still  
topic_description:	existing products_None


C:  I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um  
B:  Well  <other> 
A:  Well it's just uh about our first ideas now so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . Yes ? 
C:   . 
D:  Right . 
C:  <other> 
D:  But  <other> I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make , so we <other>  
C:  Already thought about something tha <other> 
A:  Yes . Well thirty minutes we have . So um  
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  <other> 
A:  This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh . You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh . I think . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:   . 
D:  <other> No problem . 
A:  Oh and uh that's uh that's all . So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over . Yeah yes say . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


C:  Yeah now we can still talk about the material , we have some some minutes left uh  I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy . 
B:   . 
C:  No n n 
B:   . 
A:  Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons and when I've had use it much it was gone . So it has to be made in the buttons I think . It has to uh not be loose . 
B:  Yeah that's bad , yeah . 
D:  Yeah yeah yeah . 
B:  Yeah that's important  . 
C:  Mm . Alright . And of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh <other> to connect things uh to each other . 
A:  Yeah . Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about uh  
D:  Yeah it's univ yeah yeah yeah . 
C:  I think so . It's a a common stan standard way  infrared beams an infrared beam I think  . 
A:  It's not that in China it's different ? 
D:  Yep . 
A:  Yeah . But y you can have uh of course different between D_V_D_s and televisions and between  
D:  And you can use  
C:  It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . But our T_V_s are mostly made in China and that sort of country , so  
A:  <laugh> Probably yes . China rules . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> And have  well yeah I've wrote something down about how it works . <laugh> The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly , but that's pretty obvious , I think . <other>

B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes . Yeah . 
D:  I think <other> we should make it universal and you can always use a front front on it , you know ? You can use it <other> just plain but you can <other>
