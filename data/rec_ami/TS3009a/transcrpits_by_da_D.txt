 
I dunno . 
<laugh> Throwing away my toothpick . 
'Kay . 
Nice user interface . 
 
'Kay . 
Right let's see it . 
'Kay . 
<cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<other> <laugh> 
Alright , your favourite animal ? <laugh> 
<other> Grizzly bear . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
We're kinda losing time , though . 
We're losing time , but  
Alright . 
Do we have to guess ? 
<laugh> A hippo ? <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
I don't know how to call it . 
A hedgehog ? <laugh> 
 . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <other> 
Alright . 
Thank you . 
<laugh> 
It's  . <laugh> 
Yeah sure . 
It's a rabbit . 
<laugh> Well  
Looks very nice , right ? 
<other> 
Yes . 
Yes uh right . 
You go man . 
Alright . 
I should have made mine a white rabbit . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other>  . 
You're standing in front of it , 
I can't see it . 
Alright , thank you . 
Yeah it's a bird , 
but what kind of bird ? 
You have to push harder . 
Release your anger . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Hmm . <other> 
It's a cat . <laugh> 
<laugh> It's a pig . <laugh> 
Right . 
No it looks great . 
Just save it . <laugh> 
Oh great . 
It's good for group spirit . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Right . 
Right . 
I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors . 
Get the good points 
uh try to merge them into one universal remote control . 
On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce . 
Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player 
so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control . 
Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe , 
because we want to we want to  well fifty million ? 
Yeah yeah 
so a lot of people have to be able to use it . 
So  
Yeah . 
Yeah that's right . 
Mm-hmm . 
Right . 
Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ 
and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something . 
Yeah right . 
Yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that . 
Yeah but  
We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh  
Yeah 
but it's  it has to be useable . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> No . 
 . 
Not with two hands . <laugh> 
Yeah yeah yeah , right . 
No  <other> 
Yeah but it's quite important that it fits . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
It shouldn't be boxy . 
Nah  
I don't agree with the long box uh shape <other> 
it it has to be custom made for the hand . 
Yeah . 
Yeah but if you shape it  
If  
<laugh> 
No that's ol old fashioned . 
I can imagine that us 
Yeah right . 
It fits in your palms . 
Hmm ? 
Um . 
 . 
<other> Well  
Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand . 
It shouldn't be too boxy , you know . 
It's  
<laugh> No no no . 
Yeah . 
Right 
maybe something like this 
<other> and then a button here to switch between <other> different systems like D_V_D_ player 
and so you can  I've  
Yeah right , 
and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and <other>  
Right . 
But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . 
So there has to be some space between the buttons . 
Yeah . 
Yeah right right , 
and maybe we should use colours . 
Yeah . 
That's kinda trendy . 
Yeah right . 
Right . 
But  
<other> I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make , 
so we <other>  
Yeah . 
<other> No problem . 
Yeah . 
Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy . 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
Yeah it's univ yeah yeah yeah . 
Yep . 
And you can use  
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
But are  
<laugh> Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ? 
I think <other> we should make it universal 
and you can always use a front front on it , you know ? 
You can use it <other> just plain 
but you can <other>  To make it more trendy . 
Right . 
Right . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah right . 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
But people of often don't like bright colours or something . 
We have to make it grey or s or black . 
Yeah but then you can use <other> a a front . 
Yeah that's right . 
Yeah or a t Teletubby front . <laugh> 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
I will investigate . 
Right . 
It's  Yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your Internet Explorer  
Yeah . 
Well that's great . 
Thirty minutes . 
<laugh> It's totally broken . <laugh> 
Oh  
<other> 
 .
