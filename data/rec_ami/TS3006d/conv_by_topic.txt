A:  Okay . Uh first of all I'll start with the costs , because that's going to influence our design . If you  Don't know if you al already had a look or not ? 
D:   . 
B:  <laugh> Oh no . 
D:  Oh ,  . <laugh> 
C:  Did you do your questionnaire already ? 
B:  No n I I already did it . It's not much . It's just one question . 
D:  No . 
A:  Because we have a problem . 
C:  Uh  
D:  Oh . <laugh> 
A:  If you look closely , you can see . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  It wants  
A:  Um I already took the liberty to make some suggestions .  .  . <cough> At the moment we have fifteen buttons , one L_C_D_ screen , one advanced chip-on-print . We use a uh sensor , that's for the speech . Uh we use kinetic energy . And we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour . Okay . What's the first thing we should drop ? The special colour of the buttons ? 
B:  No that's that's for the trendy uh feel and look . So  
A:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah but everything is . 
A:  Uh  Should we switch to a hand dynamo ? Uh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  No . 
B:  Yeah , b but  
D:  Yeah but young people like that . So just do normal battery . 
A:  Batteries ? Batteries . 
B:  I think the battery option . 
C:  Just a normal battery then , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:   . 
D:  It has to be twelve and a half . Or not ? <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh . <laugh> 
C:  Oh my goodness . 
A:  So  You're going to redesign something . Okay , so we're at twenty five . <cough> Um  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh no . 
D:  Uh , yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ? 
C:  Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then . I mean we have to drop on everything . 
A:  Mm-hmm . <other> Uh  
D:  But we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved , but from the side it's it's flat , and the screen screen is just  Well you just have to hold it like this then . So  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> Yeah . Um  Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . That would skip nine buttons and four and a half Euros . 
C:  How about  Sorry . That's what I was thinking . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Alright . Let's do it then . Yeah .  we  
A:  Yeah ? 
C:  A a 
A:  Uh then we have left  
B:  But we don't have any basic options any more . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh yeah . We do . 
C:  And uh 'cause then they don't have to n They don't need special colour as well . 
D:  F_ eight . 
A:  They don't need special colours . Fine . That's more like it . <cough> You were saying something . 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  That was exactly my point . Like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one  I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway . So we'll just have to use it for everything . And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click  
A:  Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah , some more menu options . Yeah . Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons . But um  Now let's look . 
C:  <other> 
B:  Yeah we c could  We only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing . Everything you can do with with the menu . So  With the display . 
C:  <other> 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah we need one integrated button for everything then . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  The joystick . 
A:  <laugh> Uh  
C:  Yeah . Kind of . I was  Because  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , scroll-wheel , push-button uh  
D:  Integrated scroll-wheel push-button , yeah . 
C:  If you if you go to  If you go to our uh view , like you  if you are in the sound system there , uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance , this is just uh an example , y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
C:  But you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound , right ? So you wanna click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound . So you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button . So that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you're out of it . But you still  But you then still need to have  
C:  Yeah . Exactly . 
D:  Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels . But you still um  
C:  Yeah it's r Yeah . 
D:  You still have to have some some button in the menu to go back . 
B:  So you do one inte You can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . And then just drop all the other buttons . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh yeah . 
D:  Well not all . Not s not sound I guess . 
B:  But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons . 
C:  <other> No . 
A:  Yeah . It's uh  One integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button . 
D:  <other> 
B:  Yeah . So we have to to make it s uh more uh  It has to be  
D:  Mm . 
A:  So  You could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality . You just drop the Okay and the Back . 
D:  Yeah . Wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker ? 
A:  Oh , that's for the speech . 
D:  Speech recognition . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Could drop the speech recognition . <laugh> 
D:  Right . 
A:  S s Drop speech recognition ? 
C:  <other> No but  
A:  Yeah that's possible . <other> 
B:  We we d 
C:  Yeah it's it's expensive , but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition . 'Cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons . 
A:  Buttons . That's not very easy to use . 
D:  Buttons . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  I 
D:  No , it can be disturbed by by noise and 
C:  No . Yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works . 
D:  stuff like that . Let let let me see what's more what's more popular . I guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition . I have to look on that . Let me see . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> Uh well no I was wrong . There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen . 
A:  <cough> Yep . Okay . Because if you d lose the L_C_D_ screen , we <laugh> need a lot of  Yeah . We need a lot of extra buttons . 
D:  But if it  <other> But it it  it's a it's a both a hypers 
B:  We lose our whole concept . Uh so  No we just  We keep the L_C_D_ . 
D:  No , but  Well we Yeah we keep the screen . I mean it's it's about the same . Eight one to ninety one percent , uh sixty six to seventy six . 
C:  We uh we we haven't really integrated this  the speech into the system , so we can might as well s drop that .  
A:  Okay so we drop the speech . And drop it yeah ? Okay . S Fo Four less Euros . So we still have three and a half Euro to lose . 
D:  Yeah . Let's drop the speech . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Sixteen Euros . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <other> We need to lose some buttons . 
D:  But y y 
A:  Yeah if you lose the the Back , the Okay button  Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . And then and then use um  
A:  Then you're  <other> Oh and the power button we have also . 
D:  The the  Okay . And the menu button does also does the okay function then . And then when you in the menu  
A:  Yeah . So that's one Euro . 
D:  S so so you activate the menu . 
B:  If we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons , we can drop all the the push-buttons . 
A:  <other> Yeah . Yeah ? And   
B:  With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . With the other , we can do the the channel , the volume , et cetera . 
D:  Yeah yeah . <other> Yeah .  . 
A:  That would save zero point two Euros compared to  No . 
B:  No it's three Euros . No ? Um  
A:  Yeah . To This together is more expensive than  Oof , it's almost the same as t keeping this . And we can drop these two . 
B:  No it's it's n Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Well okay . For example if you have f f four buttons , <other> channel up and down , uh volume left right  Okay , I've  I think we have to keep that . And then  and the power button . So that's five . 
B:  It's the  
A:  Volume . And the power button . That's the basic . 
D:  That's basic . That that's what you need anyway . And then for the menu , um you can have a button that activates menu . Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button . And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . Click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it . Click again , it's okay . Then you only need one button to move back . Or or under each option , you set a  you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . And in that menu , scroll , click , one step back . So that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yep . 
C:  Which   That's even  
D:  But we can't drop three buttons . But I see that's  Yeah . So   <laugh> that's not a good idea . 
A:  Okay th that's  Yeah that's one Euro more expensive . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  That's not an option . 
D:  Because which buttons do we have now ? Those five which I mentioned , and then menu , and then  
A:  Menu , power . 
D:  Yeah . F of the four things ? Yeah , th power . 
A:  Four arrows ? Power . Uh  
D:  <other> Which more ? 
C:  <other> Yeah , if you if you go to eight  I don't know how to  
A:  Yeah . Okay . So four arrows ? Uh power I believe ? <laugh> Uh  
D:  Yeah . Power . Th Yeah that's five . 
A:  We have a Back and a Okay button . 
D:  Yeah , okay that's seven , and one to activate the menu , yeah . So okay that's eight . Well we can't reduce that . We we keep the display . 
A:  And the Menu . 
D:  Oh , well okay . 
A:  Yeah , and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here . So  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , we need the chip for the for the L_C_ display . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  The L_C_D_ ? Yeah . 
B:  Let's make the  Let's make the case plastic . 
D:  Yeah well we need the advanced  Instead of r 
A:  Then I rather make it wood . Because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah but but that's not our market . 
C:  True . 
B:  But  
A:  No that  maybe not . But maybe it's better than plastic anyway . 
D:  Ah no , hard plastic . <other> 
C:  <other> Oh . 
B:  Plastic with a with a special colour . A woo wood uh wood uh wood colour . <laugh> That's an option . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , plastic with special colour . 
A:  Yeah ? <laugh> Yeah okay uh  
D:  <laugh> No but I I  Because we have to use the special colour anyway . You forgot that . <cough> So let's go for the plastic . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yep . Yeah , yeah . 
B:  So we do one one s Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , okay . Plastic . 
D:  And since it's not kinetic , it doesn't have to flip around that much ? 
A:  Uh that's easy because plastic is free . <laugh> 
C:  Hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  We still have problem of two Euros . 
A:  Yeah , okay . Uh if we dropped uh  
D:  <other> 
B:  No the buttons , those are really needed . 
A:  Yeah ? 
D:  Yeah we can't drop them . 
B:  Yeah th th it's it's uh  An advanced chip-on-print . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah uh  
D:  <laugh> Do we really need that advanced chip for an L_C_D_ display ? 
A:  <other> You still need that . 
C:  You  uh uh  Yeah . So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and  Which can use a regular chip , wh which is six Euros in total . That doesn't matter . 
A:  <other> S 
D:  Oh . I rather keep I rather keep the display . So the only option is an hand dynamo . 
A:  No , I keep the re Yeah . Yeah . Because we already designed for it . So  
C:  Well yeah . Exactly . 
B:  <laugh> Oh that  
A:  Yeah and something else . 
C:  <other> Yeah but the  uh can't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button ? 'Cause that will save us one and a half Euro already . 
D:  Oh no tha Oh that's one Euro , right . 
C:  And then if w 
D:  And then integrated s Yeah but that would make it not so easy to use . I mean it's not that important , easy to use , but  
A:  No y you would rec Then you have  
C:  Th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want , huh ? And uh  
A:  Then you still need two additional buttons I believe . For the volume . You can use those  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah d at l Yeah . At least one for power . 
B:  But the  
A:  Oh yeah and power . That's three buttons and this would cost  
C:  Oh . Yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now . 
B:  But the integrated uh button ? How many func functions can it uh have ? 
A:  Yeah . Three . Up , down , Okay . 
C:  Yeah endlessly . I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on . You can go into you in you main menu , you can choose uh flip channel , uh you can choose sound options , any options . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  You you press it for like three seconds . Then then then you should do everything in the menu . On the screen . 
C:  Yeah . <other> Maybe we should . 'Cause we don't have money and w we want the screen . 
A:  Yeah , okay . It would save enough  Yeah you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half Euro left . <laugh> So we can maybe still use power button . 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> <laugh> Yeah , but we'd  <other> Alright . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  I guess we have to . 
D:  It s it saves us four Euros and it costs us two and a half . So let's see , we we drop the price by one and a half . But we still have thirteen left . 
C:  We'll we'll be on  
A:  Yeah . You see ? Oh still  Yeah ? Oh then I miscalculated . Oh yeah . 
D:  Thirteen . So still half . <laugh> There goes the special co <laugh> Well  <laugh> That would make it less appealing . So that's no option . 
A:  <laugh> Shit . Drop the special colour . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Oh no . 
A:  <other> 'Kay . What else ? Uncurved ? 
B:  No no , it has to be um curved . 
D:  We sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ? 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah it says right here . 
A:  <laugh> They made it very easy for us . <laugh> 
B:  Okay . 
D:  Well yeah . <laugh>  yeah . We made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it's a cool feature . 
A:  Ah , I don't think I can s uh persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Okay . Wh what we could do is um  
C:  <other> 
B:  drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Buttons . That's  Oh yeah since we only have one button . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah but I mean what is meant by special colour ? 
A:  I just m I don't  I think  Uh yeah it's  I think it's grey , regular . 
B:  Just something else than than black or white I think . 
D:  S yeah . Alright . 
A:  Grey and rubber . 
C:  But we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though . <other> Damn . 
A:  Of plastic . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . So I rather have an hand dynamo <laugh> than than drop the colour . You can still play with it then I guess . I don't know . Yeah , but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working . So I guess that isn't an option . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah and then <other>  Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  The display  <laugh> 
C:  Well , you only have to power it up when you wanna use it . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  The  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  But if you have to power the for ten minutes , <laugh> then the  
C:  I don't know . 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  No I don't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving , no . 
C:   . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah true . Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah hand dynamo ? Do you want an extra button ? 
D:  Or or do we  Or do we do uncurved and flat ? Instead of  
A:  <laugh> <sound indicating displeasure> 
B:  No no it has to be curved . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour . And a screen . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Just put a special special colour of the buttons , or something . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . That's the most import 
A:  Yep ? Instead of an additional power button ? 
B:  Yeah or spe special form ? 
D:  Yeah . S what what is special f Oh yeah , special form . Maybe that's nicer . 
A:  Yeah ? It's for scroll  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  But we don't have any buttons . <laugh> So do  d Uh make it a special colour then . 
A:  Without  
C:  We only have  
B:  Yeah . But it's it's for the integrated button , I think also . Or  
D:  Yeah ma make it a special colour then . 
C:  Yeah but  
A:  Yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down . So  
B:  Yeah . Okay . Yeah . 
D:  Okay . Make it a special colour and then it look fancy . <laugh> So  
A:  Yeah ? 
B:  Yep . 
A:  So  Woah we're within budget . <laugh> It's a miracle . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . Let's let's save it . 
B:  Oh just  oh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button . Okay . 
D:  Yeah . Let's do it like this , I mean , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we  
A:  Yeah ? <other> Okay . Um , well   . 'Kay , this was old . 
topic_description:	other_costing and re-design of prototype


C:  Well we come back to the drawing board then , huh ? <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah all your designs are uh pretty much  
B:  Yeah . <laugh> Okay . 
A:  Yeah back to work . Uh  
C:  <laugh> It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing . 
A:  Did I save it ? Yeah . <other> I I wanted to go , but I wasn't allowed . So  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah but that but that's the fun part of it . <laugh> 
C:  Oh yeah ?  okay . 
D:  Alright . 
A:  Uh I just forgot to save this . Just a minute . <other> <sound indicating frustration>  . 
topic_description:	discussion_None


D:  Yeah what's the next uh phase ? 
A:  Yeah , this the last phase of course , so  
D:  Uh the agenda . By your humble P_M_ . 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  <laugh> Oh f <laugh> Frustrated . <laugh> Alright . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Oh . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . Um  <other> Well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation . But well as you saw that hadn't made no sense , because we had to drop it . Uh  <other> 
C:  <other> Drop everything . Yeah . 
D:  Drop , yeah . 
C:  We went straight into finance ? <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> Yeah it was more important , so I just 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  For  Yeah . 
A:  pushed up the agenda . Uh , 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  evaluation criteria . You have t produced something about that ? 
D:  Yeah that that's  Yeah . I uh I sure did . And it combines with product evaluation . Uh so  
A:  Uh you put it in the  . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


D:  We all have to keep in mind what has changed now . So what we have left on the  Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements . Alright . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> Let's make it big . <other> 
A:  F_ five . 
D:  Um  Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale , as following . Well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah . True or false , and then on a scale of seven points , a  scale , as we all know it . Um  
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Well the criteria are based on the user requirements , uh the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself . Um well they are in a Word document , which I will open now . <other> Yeah . I don't know it's open yet . No . 
A:  Alt up 
D:  And we all have to uh agree on a certain level . What's this ? 
A:  <laugh> Freaky . <laugh> 
D:  Oh . I don't know . Um  Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions . How do you think about that ? 
C:  <other> I think it does . Because the operating  behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_ , right ? 
A:  Yeah . Uh , of course we dropped a little bit of those uh  
D:  Yeah the us u It it  it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions , in this question . So do you think  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Well , we have extended menus , on the on the L_C_D_ screen . So  
D:  Yeah . You can you can ma Yeah , you can make a lot of extended menus . That's true . I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen . 
B:  Yep . 
C:  <other> I  No . 
D:  So on a scale from one to seven , what do you think ? 
B:  Two or three . 
D:  Huh ? 
B:  Two or three . 
D:  Two or three ? Something like that ? Well we have to choose one . So uh what do you say ? I agree on two . 
A:  Two . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh y we should fill this in now . Yeah okay . Uh  
D:  Yeah . I uh I say two , personally . But  
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah in the new design I s would say it's three . But now , in original design I say two . 
C:  Yeah alright . 
D:  Yeah well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now . 
A:  Okay then I say three . 
D:  Yeah ? You say three , and you you said al also three ? Three ? Okay well I say still two , but it has to be three then . Yeah I know . So it's made bold . But it's  nah , it's not very clear on the sc Maybe other colour , yeah . That's better . 
C:  Yeah yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> Hey , you're marketing , eh . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Hmm . M maybe underline . 
B:  Or give it a colour . 
A:  <laugh> Red . <laugh> 
D:  Uh  Yeah . Alright . Oh , it doesn't have to be bold anymore . 
A:  <laugh> Oh yeah very true . <laugh> He types everything . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Alright . Yeah . Um well the remote control has  <laugh> Wha <laugh> 
B:  Yeah true one . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Definitely one . It has to be . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . For example audio settings and screen settings . 
B:  It hides uh basic functions . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Everything . <laugh> You don't use anything else . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . Well , yeah . So it it's a very true point . I mean it hides all those function . But , I mean uh they're hidden in the screen . If you don't want to use them , you don't s you s just scroll over them . And you place them  
C:  <laugh> You're not gonna find them . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah okay . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah true . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  <other> F I don't know where . So that's very true , I guess , for our case . Uh the second point . It shows the relevant and most used functions . Power button . 
C:  Yeah the next  Not so much so . 
A:  Nope . 
D:  Do we ha still have a power button ? Well yeah the button's integrated , huh ? 
A:  Uh check with the Excel sheet . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> I think we are  
C:  Yeah it's uh it's integrated . 
D:  Yeah we dropped it . You j you just push it in for  Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then  Yeah . I don't know . <laugh> Yeah . Um it shows the relevant and most used functions . 
B:  It's in  Oh yeah it was integrateds . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah integrate it . 
C:  E exactly just like a m mobile . 
A:  Yeah . Just go scrolling and it will activate . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh>  . 
D:  Yeah uh on the other  uh on one side I would say yes , and the other side I would say no . So it's  I don't know . 
A:  It shows the most used functions and they are relevant , but  
B:  Can you uh change channels directly with with just one button ? No , you have to scroll through the menu , before 
D:  Yeah . With the scroll butt Yeah and then say channel . And then  
B:  Yeah . So it's it's not  
C:  Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something , if  When it's on , yeah , it's turned on , 
D:  Hmm ? 
A:  You say you double click on the  
C:  It automatically has the the programme and the volume function , but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some   Of you  Or you double click it . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . But but how do you change from volume to channel ? 
C:  No because it has four arrows , right ? 
A:  <sounds indicating uncertainty> No , not anymore . Because he's  now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in . 
B:  No . <laugh> 
D:  No . <laugh> 
C:  Oh yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah I was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick . 
A:  Like on the the mouse . 
D:  No we have n we have no buttons left . So <laugh> the joystick was not an option . So  <other> so you hav <laugh> So you you have to double-click , I mean , for , I mean , uh volume , and three double click for the menu , or something . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . Yeah . Alright . 
C:  Say . Yeah that is a bummer . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> To get into menu . Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> Oh no . 
A:  <laugh> Or hold it ten seconds . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> We'll make it a Morse code . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  But but ease of use was not very important , may I remind you . So that's  Yeah but that that's not a question . Uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions . Well I think it's pretty much in the middle . 
A:  No no no . Uh it should be trendy . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> 
B:  <cough> 
A:  Yeah . Four . 
D:  You have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen , in the menu . So  
A:  Yeah , im  in the menu . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Seven . <laugh> 
D:  So maybe it's more like a f a five . Or  
B:  Yeah . Five . 
C:  Yeah I would go for five or six , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Five or six ? 
A:  Five . 
C:  Okay five . Let's not diss our remote . 
B:  Five . Yep . 
D:  Five ? Alright . Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  It's the weirdest remote control I've ever seen . So  <laugh> 
D:  Oh . <other> Yeah . 
C:  Yep . Just one button . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Well it's different . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . Alright . Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . Well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition . But it has at least one innovation . 
C:  But  Uh yep . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah , it's still  Yeah , I say two . 
C:  <other> We still have the fruit and vegetable print . 
D:  I say two then . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah but  <laugh> that that's not that's not this question . Uh thi uh that's the other question . 
A:  Oh , that's the next . <laugh> 
C:  Fr Oh I mean the  Oh never mind . I'm a bit lost . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  This one . 
B:  I think a two . No . 
A:  Two . 
D:  Two yeah . I think L_C_D_'s more useful than speech  What ? Oh not the bold one . 
C:   . 
B:  Yep . 
A:  Yeah definitely . 
C:  It's way more practical , yeah . 
D:  Right . Okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material . <laugh> It should have been two questions . <laugh> I realise now , because <laugh> sponge-like material is dropped . But the look and feel  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> You still have rubber d Or no . 
C:  Yeah . So we still uh we still have the primary colours . But only on the on the outside , not on the button . 
B:  No you got a plastic . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  The button has also colour . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah ? Okay . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> The one button we have . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . The one . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve . 
A:  Yeah you could check with the Excel sheet . 
D:  Mm mm . 
B:  Yeah . You only have one  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah we have single curve now , and no and no material . So maybe in the middle or something . 
C:  And and colour . Yeah . S 
B:  Four . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I mean it's 
A:  Yeah or three . 
C:  <other> Uh  
D:  worth the  Yeah . 
A:  We have something . 
C:  Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one . Because it's basically an old one , uh with little curve on the side , and in a different colour . Still , it's still hard . I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  New . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . But then we would have to drop the screen . Oh red . 
B:  Red . <other> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  You like both . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> I like bold . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo . <laugh> 
A:  Um oh yeah . 
B:  <laugh> Mm yeah yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Of course . 
A:  <laugh> I just couldn't  <laugh> Um , just one minute . 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> You just have to draw it . <laugh> 
C:  <other> Yeah but it  be because uh we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen , we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the  
B:  It's the white part uh  
A:   . 
B:  Yeah . We have a we have a  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  So I mean I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well . But  
A:  So  
D:  But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo . I mean , <laugh> if there's only one thing . 
C:  Hell yeah . If we have only one button . 
D:  Yeah . So I will say that is very true . 
A:   . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  And even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_ , doesn't it ? <laugh> So  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> The remote control is easy to use . Well I would say  <laugh> Skill , uh I would say six , or something . I don't think it's easy to use , or not so . 
C:  No . <other> The only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers . 'Cause it has only one button . 
B:  Ah i 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  And that you only have to control one button . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . It it it has a nice screen . But  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah exactly . 
B:  It gives visual feedback . So  
D:  Yeah . Well I I would say a five or a six . 
C:  <other> I would say six . 
B:  I think a five . Five . <laugh> 
D:  What do you say ? Easy to use ? Five or a six ? 
C:  It's really not easy to use . 'Cause you're putting everything  
B:  <laugh> <other> 
A:  No not anymore . 
D:  So a six , more . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , uh I would go for the six too . So  
B:  Okay . Yeah . 
C:  Most votes count . Um  
D:  <other> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Um well , another question , uh the remote control is durable . I don't know if that's the correct word . But uh  
B:  Yeah that looks uh great . <cough> Yeah . Nah  
C:  Definitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic  Yeah . Yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever . 
D:  In use , both battery as casing ? Yeah ? True , true . And the casing is plastic ,  ? 
C:  And the the casing , hard plastic also lasts forever . 
B:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah . If you don't drop it too much , it's uh should last pretty long . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  So I would go for one . 
D:  Yeah ? But uh I think rubber compared is better . So I think a two is more appropriate 
B:  Yeah . S Yep . 
A:  <other> <sound effect> 
C:  Okay yeah . 
D:  than  
B:  Wow . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . Logo . Okay I will go  go for two . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> Uh the last one ? The remote control's a good example for company's motto , we put the fashion in electronics . 
C:  <other> Oh . No m 
B:  No we put the electronics into the fashion . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Yeah well  yeah . 
C:  <laugh> I would g I would go for four . 
D:  <laugh>  uh   turn around . Yeah . But um  Yeah ? 
A:  No  
C:  Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have . 
D:  It's not  <laugh> Yeah , true . 
A:  Yeah okay . 
D:  So a four . It's  <other> it g it g goes , it's not the best we could do , I guess . But it all has to do with the budget , because it's it's not the bad idea we had , so  
C:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah yeah . 
B:  Yeah , four is okay . 
D:  Alright , yeah . Right . 
A:  So  
D:  So if I understood it right , we have to count these numbers . 
C:  That's it . 
A:  Ooh . And  Yeah ? What ? 
D:  Uh  Yeah . Mm-hmm . Oh  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh  Alright . Word document , the  Yeah we have to count them . 
A:  Yeah . That  Count them . Add them ? Or  
D:  Uh  Yeah just add them and then uh divide them . <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  Could somebody start calculator ? <laugh> 
D:  Mm . <other> I all made it po I I all made it I all made it possible uh for a positive questions , so we can count it . I mean if you have reversed question , you have to reverse the scale , uh  Yes . 
C:  Ah we can do the math . Uh  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm-hmm . Yeah , yeah . You have to  'Kay . So four and  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . Did you make this questionnaire or what ? 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> Thanks . <laugh> 
A:  <other> Nice work . 
B:  Okay . 
C:  Oh . <other> 
B:  Three plus ? 
C:  I wouldn't be able to do it that fast . 
A:  O one . 
B:  Plus one . 
A:  Plus five . 
B:  Plus five ? 
D:  <laugh> Oh  Easy . <laugh> Question number four , yeah ? 
A:  Bo <other> Uh two . 
D:  Yeah . <other> 
C:  F 
A:  Four . 
B:  Oh . Wait a second . Oh . <laugh> It's it's gone wrong . 
A:  <other> 
D:  <other> How hard is it ? 
B:  Okay . It's your turn . 
D:  <laugh> Yeah just use  Oh there tho uh there's no n There's no num pads . 
C:  Pretty difficult . 
A:  Start over ? 
B:  No it's if you press twice on the plus button , then you get s s 
A:  You can  Oh yeah . <other> 
B:  No . That's why it's uh  <laugh> 
D:  <other> It's a it's a bit uh  <other> 
C:  Just type in the digits . They're all one digit numbers right ? And then you can count them together . 
D:  Yeah . I think you can just count them by a  Um let's move over . Three , plus one , four . Nine . 
B:  Just count it to  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  Okay . Three , four , nine . Uh  
D:  Uh , yeah . Are you here ? Eleven . Fifteen . 
C:  Eleven . Fifteen . 
A:  Eleven , fifteen . 
B:  Sixteen . 
C:  Sixteen . 
D:  Sixteen , yeah . 
C:  Seventeen . 
A:  Seventeen . 
D:  No sixteen . Uh sixteen plus six . Twenty two . 
C:  Oh what ? 
B:  Twenty two . <laugh> 
A:  S Uh  
C:  <laugh> How hard is this ? <laugh> Never mind . Twenty four . Twenty eight . 
D:  Twenty two , yeah ? Tw 
B:  Twenty four . Twenty six . Oh , sorry .  . <laugh> Oh my . 
D:  Twenty  Twenty eight . 
A:  That was the last one . That was that . Yeah . So divided by nine . 
C:  Twenty eight . 
B:  Okay . Twenty eight . 
D:  Twen Uh okay . By nine . That's uh three uh  <other> Or le less than a three . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  So  
C:  Yeah the lower the  The lower the score the better , right ? 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Twenty eight 
C:  Yeah but  
A:  Divided by nine . 
D:  di divided by nine makes three point one one one one one one one . 
A:  So thr t two . So we're better than average . 
C:  But  
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  I Are you sure we  this number actually tells us somethings ? I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative . So if you give a true to a positive , it actually means that the low  the lower the better . But if you give true to a negative question  
A:  No . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Some questions are  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , but there are no negative questions I guess . Good example . Durable use . Easy to use . This  is good . Fancy look and feel , that's good . Technology innovation was good , because of a marketing uh requirement . Re relevant most used function . And hides these functions . <other> That was also a good thing . 
C:  No ? Durable , that's good . Easy to use . <other> Yeah .  . Also good . Yeah okay . I guess you did do it . 
B:  Oh yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Oh yeah yeah . No  
D:  And then matches the opera of the  user was also a good thing . So it were all positive questions , by uh by purpose . So  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Okay . Okay . Yeah true . 
D:  Yes , so the  It tells us something , yes . Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things , I guess . 
B:  Oh great . 
A:  Things , yeah . 
C:  Yeah definitely definitely . Because now it's just an average  It's remote . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Yeah . Nah it it's it's better than average , but  
C:  Yeah okay because of the L_C_D_ screen . But uh it looks and stuff , it still uh  it's not , it's not really eye-catching , except for the colour . 
D:  Yeah . So th 
A:  It's still  yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Has some shortcomings . 
D:  No . The colour and the screen . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> 
topic_description:	evaluation of prototype(s)_None

C:  Product evaluation . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


D:  Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Okay it's your turn now . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> So you can just make one big L_C_D_ screen . <laugh> 
C:  Shall we try ?

C:  Black . Okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours ? But are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue ? 
A:  Yeah uh  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah we we can just uh use this one . And then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh  he only needs one button . Yeah . Or we have to delete this one or  
A:  The the button has a special colour , the frame has a special colour . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  One scroll button and  
A:  It's plastic . <laugh> And single curved . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED . 
B:  <laugh> Oh  oh no . <laugh> 
D:  Oh yeah . 
A:  <laugh> Otherwise it uh doesn't function uh so well .

B:  So that's  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> Do we have to do other things ? 
A:  Well I have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far . And I try to get chip just before uh I uh receive the Excel sheet . So I  
D:  Or just redesign ? <laugh> Alright . Yeah . So you made a start , right ? 
A:  Yeah I'm I'm somewhere , but maybe you can help me . 
C:  Should give it some time ? 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yay .

D:  The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape . The playfulness , we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Okay . That's conceptual , yes . 
A:  That's enough to get started with , so  <sound indicating frustration> <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . Um , uh it's just a scroll  Yeah , is it's horizontal or vertical ? 
D:  Mm .

A:  Uh , I just took one for every step and then a conclusion . 
D:  Alright . Y you have you have done the first two . 
B:  I think  
C:  Horizontal's easier too , 'cause you can  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Okay , and and the look and feel is  
B:  Yeah .

A:  So how were  did the project process uh go ? Did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ? Or are there uh  
C:  Uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us ? Or  
A:  Yeah the interaction and the steps we followed , and and so forth . 
C:  Yeah well at first I was really stressed . Because it went a bit fast . But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on , the second time I think I did a bit better . And the third time yeah , I mean  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  . <laugh> Yeah . And 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  we move more to to working together as team , because at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make . And then finally you have some idea , okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that , and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . So  The 
B:  No . 
A:  Mm-hmm . <other>  . 
B:  No . 
C:  Yeah , yeah yeah yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  process , I mean , the interaction between us became better and better I guess . Yeah 
C:  Yeah we  
B:  Yeah . Yeah . Especially after the first meeting . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  , especially if f f if you see  uh you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess . <laugh> 
B:  And  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Definitely . 
A:  Okay and was that due to my leadership ? 
B:  Yeah yeah yeah . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah 
C:  Well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that  Yeah . You were more in charge kind of thing . 
A:  Yeah ? 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  . Yeah 
A:  That okay ? <laugh> Okay . Um was there uh enough room for creativity ? 
C:  I guess so . 
D:  . Li 
B:  Yeah but only the the financial parts uh  Yeah . 
C:  I mean  
D:  Limiteded afterwards , but  If if you don't take that into account , there's plenty of room for creativ creativity . Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of uh the 
C:  I We were pretty democratic . 
D:  the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that . Mm 
A:  So and the  uh about the board  digital pen ? Uh was that helpful or  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  uh I think in in essence the 
A:  Ooh . <other> 
D:  digital pen is better than the SMARTboard . Because it it it just works better . I mean uh uh I've made  yeah , uh I've made several notes just to test it , and and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly . So it it's better a better device than uh than 
A:  Yeah it works . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  <other> Maybe  Yeah . 
D:  the screen . But the screen is useful , in essence , but it doesn't work that well . <laugh> <other> 
C:  It's uh it's  The the pen is more intuitive , 'cause we're all used to writing with pen . And uh as I said , uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation . But once I get to know the program probably , I mean , it looks better , you know . Or uh something like that . You can 
A:  <other> Use the pen . 
D:  Yeah . Yep 
C:  give it a kind of a home style , like we have i the the logo and everything . And  I don't know . 
A:  Yeah yeah . 
D:  . Warning 
A:  Blink . Oh . <laugh> 
D:  . Finish meeting now . Well 
B:  Finish meeting . 
A:  Okay , are are there <laugh> any new ideas about this ? All I think  
D:  , it  It's use especially useful , I guess , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff . And 
A:  I didn't really receive , yeah . <other> Uh uh w uh  S sorry uh  
D:  and the  screen and stuff like that . Yeah 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  I think the PowerPoint is is too limited . You can't uh draw easy in in PowerPoint . It has to be uh  yeah . The drawing board has to be integrated into PowerPoint , so that you can just easily  
D:  . Yeah 
C:  Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well . You know , you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there , or whatever . 
B:  <other> Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  . Yeah . But it it's useful to to show something to to an  a small audience , and then to  Yeah 
B:  Yeah just for text , for text it's uh it's okay . But  
D:  . These these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things . So  Yes 
B:  <laugh>
