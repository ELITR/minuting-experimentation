Okay . Uh first of all I'll start with the costs , 
because that's going to influence our design . 
If you  
Don't know if you al already had a look or not ? 
Because we have a problem . 
If you look closely , you can see . 
Um I already took the liberty to make some suggestions . 
 . 
 . 
<cough> At the moment we have fifteen buttons , one L_C_D_ screen , one advanced chip-on-print . 
We use a uh sensor , that's for the speech . 
Uh we use kinetic energy . 
And we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour . 
Okay . What's the first thing we should drop ? 
The special colour of the buttons ? 
Okay . 
Uh  
Should we switch to a hand dynamo ? 
Uh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things . 
Batteries ? 
Batteries . 
 . 
Yeah . 
So  
You're going to redesign something . 
Okay , so we're at twenty five . 
<cough> Um  
Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ? 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Uh  
<other> Yeah . 
Um  
Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . 
That would skip nine buttons and four and a half Euros . 
Yeah ? 
Uh then we have left  
Uh yeah . We do . 
They don't need special colours . 
Fine . That's more like it . 
<cough> You were saying something . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , some more menu options . Yeah . 
Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons . 
But um  
Now let's look . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> Uh  
Yeah , scroll-wheel , push-button uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh yeah . 
Yeah . 
It's uh  
One integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button . 
So  
You could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality . 
You just drop the Okay and the Back . 
Oh , that's for the speech . 
Yeah . 
S s Drop speech recognition ? 
Yeah that's possible . <other> 
Buttons . 
That's not very easy to use . 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
Yep . 
Okay . 
Because if you d lose the L_C_D_ screen , we <laugh> need a lot of  
Yeah . 
We need a lot of extra buttons . 
Okay 
so we drop the speech . 
And drop it yeah ? 
Okay . 
S Fo Four less Euros . 
So we still have three and a half Euro to lose . 
Yeah 
if you lose the the Back , the Okay button  Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button . 
Then you're  
<other> Oh and the power button we have also . 
Yeah . 
So that's one Euro . 
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah ? 
And   
That would save zero point two Euros compared to  
No . 
Yeah . 
To This together is more expensive than  Oof , it's almost the same as t keeping this . 
And we can drop these two . 
Volume . 
And the power button . 
That's the basic . 
Yep . 
Okay th that's  
Yeah that's one Euro more expensive . 
That's not an option . 
Menu , power . 
Four arrows ? 
Power . 
Uh  
Yeah . Okay . 
So four arrows ? 
Uh power I believe ? 
<laugh> Uh  
We have a Back and a Okay button . 
And the Menu . 
Yeah , and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here . So  
<laugh> 
The L_C_D_ ? Yeah . 
Then I rather make it wood . 
Because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people . 
No that  maybe not . But maybe it's better than plastic anyway . 
Yeah ? <laugh> 
Yeah okay uh  
Yep . Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah , okay . Plastic . 
Uh that's easy because plastic is free . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , okay . 
Uh if we dropped uh  
Yeah ? 
<other> You still need that . 
<other> S 
No , I keep the re 
Yeah . Yeah . Because we already designed for it . So  
Yeah and something else . 
No y you would rec 
Then you have  
Then you still need two additional buttons I believe . 
For the volume . 
You can use those  Yeah . 
Oh yeah and power . 
That's three buttons and this would cost  
Yeah . 
Three . Up , down , Okay . 
Yeah , okay . It would save enough  
Yeah you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half Euro left . 
<laugh> So we can maybe still use power button . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . You see ? 
Oh still  Yeah ? 
Oh then I miscalculated . Oh yeah . 
<laugh> Shit . 
Drop the special colour . <laugh> 
<other> 'Kay . 
What else ? 
Uncurved ? 
Yeah . 
<laugh> They made it very easy for us . <laugh> 
Ah , I don't think I can s uh persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than  <laugh> 
Buttons . 
That's  
Oh yeah since we only have one button . 
<laugh> 
I just m I don't  I think  
Uh yeah it's  I think it's grey , regular . 
Grey and rubber . 
Of plastic . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
No I don't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving , no . 
Yeah hand dynamo ? 
Do you want an extra button ? 
<laugh> 
<sound indicating displeasure> 
Yep ? 
Instead of an additional power button ? 
Yeah ? 
It's for scroll  
Without  
Yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down . So  
Yeah ? 
So  
Woah we're within budget . 
<laugh> It's a miracle . <laugh> 
Yeah ? 
<other> Okay . 
Um , well  
 . 'Kay , this was old . 
Yeah back to work 
Uh  
. 
Did I save it ? 
Yeah . 
<other> I I wanted to go , but I wasn't allowed . So  <laugh> 
Uh I just forgot to save this . 
Just a minute . 
<other> <sound indicating frustration> 
 . 
Yeah , this the last phase of course , so  
Hmm . 
<laugh> Oh . 
Okay . Um  <other> 
Well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation . 
But well as you saw that hadn't made no sense , because we had to drop it . 
Uh  <other> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah it was more important , so I just 
pushed up the agenda . 
Uh , 
evaluation criteria . 
You have t produced something about that ? 
Uh you put it in the  . 
Yeah . 
F_ five . 
<laugh> 
Alt up 
<laugh> Freaky . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Uh , of course we dropped a little bit of those uh  
Mm-hmm . 
Two . 
Uh y we should fill this in now . 
Yeah okay . 
Uh  
Yeah in the new design I s would say it's three . But now , in original design I say two . 
Okay then I say three . 
<laugh> Hey , you're marketing , eh . <laugh> 
Hmm . M maybe underline . 
<laugh> Red . <laugh> 
<laugh> Oh yeah very true . 
<laugh> He types everything . <laugh> 
<laugh> Everything . <laugh> You don't use anything else . <laugh> 
Yeah . Yeah okay . Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Nope . 
Uh check with the Excel sheet . 
Yeah integrate it . 
Yeah . 
Just go scrolling and it will activate . <laugh> 
It shows the most used functions and they are relevant , but  
You say you double click on the  
<sounds indicating uncertainty> 
No , not anymore . 
Because he's  now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in . 
Like on the the mouse . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
To get into menu . Yeah . 
<laugh> Or hold it ten seconds . <laugh> 
No no no . Uh it should be trendy . <laugh> 
Yeah . Four . 
Yeah , im  in the menu . 
Five . 
It's the weirdest remote control I've ever seen . So  <laugh> 
<laugh> Well it's different . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , it's still  
Yeah , I say two . 
Oh , that's the next . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Two . 
Yeah definitely . 
<laugh> 
You still have rubber d Or no . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> The one button we have . <laugh> 
Yeah you could check with the Excel sheet . 
Yeah . 
Yeah or three . 
We have something . 
New . Yeah . 
You like both . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Um oh yeah .

So thr t two . 
So we're better than average . 
No . <laugh> 
Things , yeah . 
Okay . 
It's still  yeah . 
Has some shortcomings . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Okay so  <other> Um this we had , this we had . 
We have to do a product evaluation . 
<other> Uh prototype presentation we dropped . 
So  Uh the finance we looked . 
We have redesigned . 
Uh not on that , but  
<laugh> So you can just make one big L_C_D_ screen . <laugh> 
Yeah uh  
The the button has a special colour , the frame has a special colour . 
It's plastic . <laugh> And single curved . 
Oh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED . 
<laugh> Otherwise it uh doesn't function uh so well . 
<laugh> 
Well I have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far . 
And I try to get chip just before uh I uh receive the Excel sheet . 
So I  
Yeah I'm I'm somewhere , 
but maybe you can help me . 
Uh  
I was here . So  
Ah  <other> 
That's enough to get started with , so  <sound indicating frustration> <laugh> 
Uh , I just took one for every step and then a conclusion . 
Yeah . 
Well I think I have to make a p an issue called finance . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . <other> 
... . 
I don't think so , if you see the options . But  
Yeah . <laugh> 
<pause filling whistle> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
You can't even draw anymore .

Can you just push pen and then keep on  
Hmm . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
just on the the m um the L_C_D_ display . 
This is your Real Remote . <laugh>

Yeah . 
You can just reuse that , because the name is the same . Initials . 
Mm . 
<laugh> Luckily . 
<laugh> <sound indicating relief> Yeah , it's uh 
 Yeah . 
Okay . And copy this . 
Just a minute .

<laugh> 
Yeah well I just  
<triumphant sound> <laugh> Okay . 
You go ahead . 
Yeah . Yeah .
