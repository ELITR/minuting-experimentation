 . 
Oh ,  . <laugh> 
No . 
Oh . 
<laugh> 
No . 
Yeah but young people like that . 
So just do normal battery . 
Yeah . 
It has to be twelve and a half . 
Or not ? <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Uh , yeah . <laugh> 
But we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved , but from the side it's it's flat , 
and the screen screen is just  
Well you just have to hold it like this then . So  
Alright . 
Let's do it then . Yeah . 
 we  
<laugh> 
F_ eight . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
The joystick . 
<laugh> 
Integrated scroll-wheel push-button , yeah . 
Yeah 
or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button . 
So that's kind of on your mouse 
and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you're out of it . 
But you still  
But you then still need to have  
Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels . 
But you still um  
You still have to have some some button in the menu to go back . 
Yeah . 
Well not all . 
Not s not sound I guess . 
<other> 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Wh wh what what what is the 
what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker ? 
Speech recognition . 
Right . 
Buttons . 
No , it can be disturbed by by noise and 
stuff like that . 
Let let let me see what's more what's more popular . 
I guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition . 
I have to look on that . Let me see . 
<other> 
Uh well no I was wrong . 
There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen . 
But if it  
<other> But it it  it's a it's a both a hypers 
No , but  
Well we Yeah we keep the screen . 
I mean it's it's about the same . Eight one to ninety one percent , uh sixty six to seventy six . 
Yeah . Let's drop the speech . 
Sixteen Euros . 
But y y 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And then and then use um  
The the  
Okay . 
And the menu button does also does the okay function then . 
And then when you in the menu  
S so so you activate the menu . 
Yeah yeah . <other> 
Yeah .  . 
Well okay . 
For example if you have f f four buttons , <other> channel up and down , uh volume left right  
Okay , I've  I think we have to keep that . 
And then  
and the power button . So that's five . 
That's basic . That that's what you need anyway . 
And then for the menu , um you can have a button that activates menu . 
Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button . 
And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , 
and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . 
Click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it . 
Click again , it's okay . 
Then you only need one button to move back . 
Or or under each option , you set a  you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . 
And in that menu , scroll , click , one step back . 
So that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . 
But we can't drop three buttons . 
But I see that's  
Yeah . 
So   <laugh> that's not a good idea . 
Because which buttons do we have now ? 
Those five which I mentioned , and then menu , and then  
Yeah . 
F of the four things ? 
Yeah , 
th power . 
<other> Which more ? 
Yeah . 
Power . 
Th Yeah that's five . 
Yeah , okay that's seven , 
and one to activate the menu , yeah . 
So okay that's eight . 
Well we can't reduce that . 
We we keep the display . 
Oh , well okay . 
Yeah . 
<cough> 
Yeah well we need the advanced  
Instead of r 
Yeah but but that's not our market . 
Ah no , hard plastic . <other> 
Yeah , plastic with special colour . 
<laugh> No but I I  
Because we have to use the special colour anyway . 
You forgot that . 
<cough> So let's go for the plastic . 
And since it's not kinetic , it doesn't have to flip around that much ? 
We still have problem of two Euros . 
<other> 
Yeah we can't drop them . 
<laugh> Do we really need that advanced chip for an L_C_D_ display ? 
Oh . I rather keep I rather keep the display . 
So the only option is an hand dynamo . 
Oh no tha Oh that's one Euro , right . 
And then integrated s Yeah but that would make it not so easy to use . 
I mean it's not that important , easy to use , but  
Yeah . 
You you press it for like three seconds . 
Then then then you should do everything in the menu . On the screen . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah , but we'd  <other> Alright . 
It s it saves us four Euros and it costs us two and a half . 
So let's see , 
we we drop the price by one and a half . 
But we still have thirteen left . 
Thirteen . So still half . <laugh> 
There goes the special co <laugh> 
Well  <laugh> That would make it less appealing . So that's no option . 
We sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ? 
Well yeah . <laugh>  yeah . 
We made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it's a cool feature . 
<laugh> 
Yeah but I mean what is meant by special colour ? 
S yeah . Alright . 
Yeah . 
So I rather have an hand dynamo <laugh> than than drop the colour . 
You can still play with it then I guess . 
I don't know . 
Yeah , but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working . So I guess that isn't an option . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah true . 
Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then . 
Or or do we  
Or do we do uncurved and flat ? Instead of  
Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour . 
And a screen . 
Yeah . 
S what what is special f 
Oh yeah , special form . 
Maybe that's nicer . 
But we don't have any buttons . 
<laugh> So do  
d Uh make it a special colour then . 
Yeah 
ma make it a special colour then . 
Okay . Make it a special colour and then it look fancy . 
<laugh> So  
<laugh> Yeah . 
Let's let's save it . 
Yeah . 
Let's do it like this , 
I mean , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we  
<laugh> Yeah all your designs are uh pretty much  
Yeah but that but that's the fun part of it . <laugh> 
Alright . 
Yeah what's the next uh phase ? 
Uh the agenda . 
By your humble P_M_ . 
<laugh> Oh f <laugh> Frustrated . <laugh> Alright . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Drop , yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah that that's  Yeah . I uh I sure did . 
And it combines with product evaluation . 
Uh so  
We all have to keep in mind what has changed now . 
So what we have left on the  Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements . 
Alright . 
<other> Let's make it big . <other> 
Um  
Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale , as following . 
Well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah . 
True or false , and then on a scale of seven points , 
a  scale , as we all know it . 
Um  
Well the criteria are based on the user requirements , uh the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself . 
Um well they are in a Word document , 
which I will open now . 
<other> Yeah . 
I don't know it's open yet . 
No . 
And we all have to uh agree on a certain level . 
What's this ? 
Oh . I don't know . 
Um  
Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . 
So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions . 
How do you think about that ? 
Yeah 
the us u 
It it  
it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions , in this question . 
So do you think  
Yeah . 
You can you can ma 
Yeah , you can make a lot of extended menus . That's true . 
I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen . 
So on a scale from one to seven , what do you think ? 
Huh ? 
Two or three ? Something like that ? 
Well we have to choose one . 
So uh what do you say ? 
I agree on two . 
Yeah . 
I uh I say two , personally . But  
Yeah well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now . 
Yeah ? You say three , 
and you you said al also three ? 
Three ? 
Okay well I say still two , but it has to be three then . 
Yeah I know . 
So it's made bold . But it's  nah , it's not very clear on the sc 
Maybe other colour , yeah . 
That's better . 
Uh  
Yeah . Alright . 
Oh , it doesn't have to be bold anymore . 
<laugh> Alright . 
Yeah . 
Um well the remote control has  <laugh> Wha <laugh> 
<laugh> 
The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . 
For example audio settings and screen settings . 
<laugh> Yeah . Well , yeah . So it it's a very true point . I mean it hides all those function . 
But , I mean uh they're hidden in the screen . 
If you don't want to use them , you don't s you s just scroll over them . 
And you place them  
<other> F I don't know where . 
So that's very true , I guess , for our case . 
Uh the second point . 
It shows the relevant and most used functions . 
Power button . 
Do we ha still have a power button ? 
Well yeah the button's integrated , huh ? 
Yeah we dropped it . 
You j you just push it in for  
Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then  
Yeah . 
I don't know . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Um it shows the relevant and most used functions . 
Yeah uh on the other  
uh on one side I would say yes , and the other side I would say no . 
So it's  I don't know . 
Yeah . 
With the scroll butt 
Yeah and then say channel . 
And then  
Hmm ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But but how do you change from volume to channel ? 
No . <laugh> 
No we have n we have no buttons left . So <laugh> 
the joystick was not an option . 
So  <other> so you hav <laugh> 
So you you have to double-click , 
I mean , for , I mean , uh volume , 
and three double click for the menu , or something . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . Yeah . Alright . 
But but ease of use was not very important , may I remind you . 
So that's  
Yeah but that that's not a question . 
Uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions . 
Well I think it's pretty much in the middle . 
You have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen , in the menu . So  
So maybe it's more like a f a five . Or  
Yeah . 
Five or six ? 
Five ? Alright . 
Yeah . 
Oh . <other> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . Alright . 
Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . 
Well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition . But it has at least one innovation . 
I say two then . 
Yeah but  <laugh> that that's not that's not this question . Uh thi uh that's the other question . 
This one . 
Two yeah . 
I think L_C_D_'s more useful than speech  
What ? 
Oh not the bold one . 
Right . 
Okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material . 
<laugh> It should have been two questions . <laugh> I realise now , because <laugh> sponge-like material is dropped . 
But the look and feel  
Yeah . 
The button has also colour . Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . The one . 
Mm mm . 
Yeah we have single curve now , 
and no and no material 
. So maybe in the middle or something . 
Yeah , I mean it's 
worth the  Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . But then we would have to drop the screen . 
Oh red . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . <laugh> I like bold . 
Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> You just have to draw it . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo . I mean , <laugh> if there's only one thing . 
Yeah . So I will say that is very true . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> The remote control is easy to use . 
Well I would say  <laugh> 
Skill , uh I would say six , or something . I don't think it's easy to use , or not so . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
It it it has a nice screen . 
But  Yeah . 
Yeah . Well I I would say a five or a six . 
What do you say ? Easy to use ? Five or a six ? 
So a six , more . 
Yeah , uh I would go for the six too . So  
<other> 
Um well , another question , 
uh the remote control is durable . 
I don't know if that's the correct word . 
But uh  
In use , both battery as casing ? 
Yeah ? 
True , true . 
And the casing is plastic ,  ? 
Yeah . If you don't drop it too much , it's uh should last pretty long . 
Yeah ? 
But uh I think rubber compared is better . So I think a two is more appropriate 
than  
Yeah . Logo . 
Okay I will go  go for two . 
<other> Uh the last one ? 
The remote control's a good example for company's motto , we put the fashion in electronics . 
<laugh>  uh   turn around . Yeah . But um  
Yeah ? 
It's not  
<laugh> Yeah , true . 
So a four . 
It's  <other> it g 
it g goes , it's not the best we could do , I guess . 
But it all has to do with the budget , because it's it's not the bad idea we had , so  
Alright , yeah . 
Right . 
So if I understood it right , we have to count these numbers . 
Uh  
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . Oh  
Oh  Alright . 
Word document , the  
Yeah we have to count them . 
Uh  
Yeah just add them and then uh divide them . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Mm . <other> 
I all made it po I I all made it 
I all made it possible uh for a positive questions , so we can count it . 
I mean if you have reversed question , you have to reverse the scale , 
uh  Yes . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Thanks . <laugh> 
<laugh> Oh  Easy . 
<laugh> Question number four , yeah ? 
Yeah . <other> 
<other> How hard is it ? 
<laugh> Yeah just use  
Oh there tho uh there's no n 
There's no num pads . 
<other> It's a it's a bit uh  <other> 
Yeah . 
I think you can just count them by a  
Um let's move over . 
Three , plus one , four . Nine . 
Uh , yeah . Are you here ? 
Eleven . 
Fifteen . 
Sixteen , yeah . 
No sixteen . 
Uh sixteen plus six . 
Twenty two . 
Twenty two , 
yeah ? 
Tw 
Twenty  
Twenty eight . 
Twen Uh okay . 
By nine . 
That's uh three uh  <other> Or le less than a three . 
Yeah . 
Twenty eight 
di divided by nine 
makes three point one one one one one one one . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , but there are no negative questions I guess . 
Good example . Durable use . 
Easy to use . This  is good . 
Fancy look and feel , that's good . 
Technology innovation was good , because of a marketing uh requirement . 
Re relevant most used function . 
And hides these functions . <other> That was also a good thing . 
And then matches the opera of the  user was also a good thing . 
So it were all positive questions , by uh by purpose . So  
Yes , so the  It tells us something , yes . 
Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things , I guess . 
Yeah . 
Nah it it's it's better than average , but  
Yeah . 
So th 
Yeah . 
No . 
The colour and the screen . 
Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this  <laugh> 
<laugh> With some casing around it , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Oh yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> Do we have to do other things ? 
Or just redesign ? 
<laugh> 
Alright . 
Yeah . 
So you made a start , right ? 
Yeah . 
Alright . 
The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape . 
The playfulness , we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour 
Okay . 
That's conceptual , yes . 
Mm . 
How many pages ? <laugh> 
Alright . 
Y you have you have done the first two . 
Okay , 
and and the look and feel is  
Yeah . 
The items we had to drop . <laugh> 
Where did we start with price ? 
Twenty six and a half . 
Or not ? 
Or twenty six ? 
Something like that . 
This ? 
Speckles ? 
Uh  
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . Some some big dots . 
Yeah . 
... . 
We have the original balance sheet , or  
Yeah . 
Woah . 
<laugh> Just cut . 
Control Z_ . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Just dual screen . 
<laugh> Very nice . 
<laugh> Yeah . Y y you you <laugh> 
you push the button or something . 
Or  
Lot of options . 
Yeah , the R_ and another R_ . 
It's called the Real Remote , right ? 
Maybe maybe it c it can say that . The Real Remote . 
<laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Welcome . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
You can copy and paste the picture if you want . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> What is that ? Look more  Looks more like a campfire . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
 Yeah . Type 
in your report . I 
don't see any new messages . So  Hmm 
? Luckily 
, yeah . What 
time do we have to deliver the report ? Four o'clock or  Or 
before that ? Just 
compare uh  No 
it's on the on the beamer I guess . Yeah 
. Strange . This 
something what's projection from behind , I guess . Yeah 
it 
it's a beamer , but then with a  within 
a mirror , yeah . So 
it looks like a big screen , but   in fact it isn't . Well 
it's it's single single curved . Th 
this is flat . Yeah . But 
it's it's better to have in the front , this kind of shape , because it looks nice . I 
mean you see more of this than of that . Yeah 
, more like that . <other> 
It's 
not very uh ideal . <laugh> Do 
like this . Yeah 
. What's 
this ? Ooh 
. But 
I don't see a detector over there . I 
thought it was a kind of thing to put it on , and then draw right lines or something . <laugh> 
Yeah 
. <laugh> 
Or just messed it up . <laugh> <laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> Yeah 
but it wasn't good . <laugh> Yeah 
it it has to touch the corners , I guess . But 
th this one wasn't good , because if I was drawing here , I drew a line and then it came over here . <laugh> 
Oh 
. Ooh 
. <laugh> 
Yeah yeah , it's it's okay . It's working again . It's 
better than before . Yeah 
. Yeah 
that's improved uh pretty much . Yeah 
. Yeah 
but it's better , it's better  Mm 
. No 
. It's better than it was I guess . <laugh> 
Silly . Yeah 
. Works pretty well . Five 
minutes before the meeting's over . And 
then ? We 
have to present  Alright 
. So 
it  after the  after 
after these five minutes , you have to  Alright 
. After 
after that five minutes , you have ten minutes to finish it , or  Alright 
. And 
we uh  Right 
. Chill . <laugh> Huh 
. Uh 
 Yeah ? Next 
slide . Yeah 
? How 
do you do it ? <other> 
Alright . Yeah 
. <laugh> Yeah 
. And 
we move more to to working together as team , because 
at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make . And 
then finally you have some idea , okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that , and 
you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . So  The 
process , I mean , the interaction between us became better and better I guess . Yeah 
, especially if f f if you see  uh you se you 
saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess . <laugh> 
Yeah 
. Yeah 
. Li 
Limiteded afterwards , but 
 If if you don't take that into account , there's plenty of room for creativ creativity . Also 
not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of uh the 
the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that . Mm 
uh I think in in essence the 
digital pen is better than the SMARTboard . Because 
it it it just works better . I 
mean uh uh I've made  yeah 
, uh I've made several notes just to test it , and 
and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly . So 
it it's better a better device than uh than 
the screen . But 
the screen is useful , in essence , but it doesn't work that well . <laugh> <other> 
Yeah 
. Yep 
. Warning 
. Finish meeting now . Well 
, it  It's 
use especially useful , I guess , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff . And 
and the 
 screen and stuff like that . Yeah 
. Yeah 
. Yeah 
. But it it's useful to to show something to to an  a small audience , and then to  Yeah 
. These these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things . So  Yes 
. Check your email . <laugh> 
 <laugh> You also . <other> Right 
. Yes 
boss . <laugh> 
Well see you soon . <laugh> 
Yeah .
