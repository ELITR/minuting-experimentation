Did you do your questionnaire already ? 
Uh  
It wants  
Yeah but everything is . 
Just a normal battery then , yeah . 
Oh my goodness . 
Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then . 
I mean we have to drop on everything . 
Yeah . 
How about  
Sorry . 
That's what I was thinking . 
A a 
And uh 'cause then they don't have to n They don't need special colour as well . 
That was exactly my point . Like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one 
 I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway . So we'll just have to use it for everything . 
And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click  
<other> 
<other> 
Yeah 
we need one integrated button for everything then . 
Yeah . Kind of . 
I was  Because  
Yeah . 
If you if you go to  
If you go to our uh view , 
like you  if you are in the sound system there , uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance , 
this is just uh an example , 
y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example . 
But you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound , 
right ? 
So you wanna click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound . 
So you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button . 
Yeah . 
Exactly . 
Yeah it's r Yeah . 
<other> No . 
<other> 
No but  
Yeah it's it's expensive , but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition . 
'Cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons . 
I 
No . 
Yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works . 
We uh we we haven't really integrated this  the speech into the system , 
so we can might as well s drop that .  
<other> We need to lose some buttons . 
Which   That's even  
<laugh> 
<other> Yeah , if you if you go to eight  
I don't know how to  
Yeah , 
we need the chip for the for the L_C_ display . 
Yeah . 
True . 
<other> Oh . 
Hmm . 
Yeah uh  
You  uh uh  
Yeah . 
So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and  Which can use a regular chip , wh which is six Euros in total . 
That doesn't matter . 
Well yeah . 
Exactly . 
<other> Yeah but the  
uh can't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button 
? 'Cause that will save us one and a half Euro already . 
And then if w 
Th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want , huh ? 
And uh  
Yeah d at l Yeah . At least one for power . 
Oh . 
Yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now . 
Yeah endlessly . 
I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on . 
You can go into you in you main menu , 
you can choose uh flip channel , uh you can choose sound options , any options . 
Yeah . 
<other> Maybe we should . 
'Cause we don't have money and w we want the screen . 
I guess we have to . 
We'll we'll be on  
Yeah it says right here . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
But we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though . 
<other> Damn . 
Yeah 
and then <other>  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
Well , you only have to power it up when you wanna use it . 
I don't know . 
 . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . That's the most import 
We only have  
Yeah but  
Well we come back to the drawing board then , huh ? <laugh> 
<laugh> 
It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing . 
Oh yeah ? 
 okay . 
<other> 
Drop everything . Yeah . 
We went straight into finance ? <laugh> 
For  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> I think it does . 
Because the operating  behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_ , 
right ? 
Yeah . 
Well , we have extended menus , on the on the L_C_D_ screen . So  
<other> I 
 No . 
Yeah . 
Yeah alright . 
Yeah yeah . 
<laugh> Definitely one . It has to be . 
<laugh> You're not gonna find them . 
Yeah the next  Not so much so . 
Yeah . 
Yeah it's uh it's integrated . 
E exactly just like a m mobile . 
<laugh> 
 . 
Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something , if  
When it's on , yeah , it's turned on , 
It automatically has the the programme and the volume function , 
but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some   
Of you  
Or you double click it . 
No because it has four arrows , 
right ? 
Oh yeah . 
Yeah I was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick . 
Say . 
Yeah that is a bummer . 
<laugh> We'll make it a Morse code . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah I would go for five or six , yeah . 
Okay five . 
Let's not diss our remote . 
Yep . 
Just one button . <laugh> 
But  Uh yep . 
<other> We still have the fruit and vegetable print . 
Fr Oh I mean the  Oh never mind . 
I'm a bit lost . 
 . 
It's way more practical , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So we still uh we still have the primary colours . But only on the on the outside , not on the button . 
Yeah ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve . 
And and colour . 
Yeah . S 
Yeah . 
<other> Uh  
Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one . 
Because it's basically an old one , uh with little curve on the side , and in a different colour . 
Still , it's still hard . 
I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh . 
Of course . 
<other> 
Yeah but it  
be because uh we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen , we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the  
So I mean I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well . But  
Hell yeah . If we have only one button . 
And even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_ , 
doesn't it ? 
<laugh> So  
No . 
<other> The only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers . 'Cause it has only one button . 
Yeah exactly . 
<other> I would say six . 
It's really not easy to use . 
'Cause you're putting everything  
Most votes count . Um  
Definitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic 
 Yeah . 
Yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever . 
And the the casing , hard plastic also lasts forever . 
So I would go for one . 
Okay yeah . 
<other> Oh . 
No m 
<laugh> I would g 
I would go for four . 
Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah yeah . 
That's it . 
Ah we can do the math . Uh  
Yeah . 
Did you make this questionnaire or what ? 
Oh . 
<other> 
I wouldn't be able to do it that fast . 
F 
Pretty difficult . 
Just type in the digits . 
They're all one digit numbers right ? 
And then you can count them together . 
Eleven . 
Fifteen . 
Sixteen . 
Seventeen . 
Oh what ? 
<laugh> How hard is this ? <laugh> 
Never mind . 
Twenty four . Twenty eight . 
Twenty eight . 
Yeah the lower the  
The lower the score the better , right ? 
Yeah but  
But  
I Are you sure we  this number actually tells us somethings ? 
I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative . 
So if you give a true to a positive , it actually means that the low  the lower the better . 
But if you give true to a negative question  
No ? 
Durable , that's good . 
Easy to use . <other> 
Yeah .  . 
Also good . 
Yeah okay . 
I guess you did do it . 
Oh yeah yeah . No  
Okay . Okay . 
Yeah true . 
Yeah definitely definitely . 
Because now it's just an average  It's remote . 
Yeah okay because of the L_C_D_ screen . 
But uh it looks and stuff , it still uh  
it's not , it's not really eye-catching , except for the colour . 
Yeah . 
Product evaluation . 
Shall we try ? 
Black . 
Okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours ? 
But are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue ? 
One scroll button and  
For what ? 
Should give it some time ? 
Yay . 
Have to take this away also . 
And this um  
Oh yeah , of course . 
Um pen yeah ? 
Format . 
Current colour red . 
Oh  Yeah we did our special colour for the  
Line widths , now that's a ten . 
It's gonna be one str scroll . 
Horizontal's easier too , 
'cause you can  
Is it more natural than this ? 
So let's say  
Whoops . 'Kay . 
Basically . <laugh> 
It's really ugly . 
Oh  <other> 
What do you mean ? 
Like a other colour than this one ? 
Yeah can we do it uh 
 uh can we do a print ? 
I think we have to choose , yeah ? 
Okay special colour . We do have special colour . 
Does it mean uh that  
Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty ? 
Purdy . 
Purple ? 
Yeah yeah . 
Oh no my remote has acne . 
No . That's why we have that button . 
It's so cute . 
Doh . 
Is that that ? 
How the  We  did we do that ? 
We can try . 
That doesn't respond also to the undo . 
It looks like it's  
No ,   
<other> Where do you want some more dots ? 
Okay , it's not the prettiest , I know . 
It's not so random huh ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah okay . 
We can make a l a logo . 
Like uh  put it like the shape . 
Something like that . 
I mean it's not too uh  
That's not their logo , is it ? 
Yeah . 
It's a  
<other> 
How   
Shall we do the logo in black or not ? 
<other> Are you dissing my drawing ? 
<laugh> This one ? 
It looks like a ribbon . <other> 
So who wants to draw ? 
This is actually quite fun . 
Do we need to do anything ? 
I hear you people are typing . 
Oh , okay . 
It's almost four . 
<other> At four , yeah ,  ? 
This is really bizarre . 
It looks like there's a  It looks like a butterfly . 
<other> 
No , but it i It's not a bu a beamer . 
B It's a normal T_V_ screen , kind of thing . 
Oh . 
Yeah there is some kind of projection I think . 
With a with a mirror , huh ? Or something . 
Yeah . 
So are we gonna change anything to this ? 
I mean is it gonna  
This is gonna be flat . Yeah exactly . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And this is also gonna be  
Nope . 
But sometimes then uh all of a sudden it does work . 
<other> Maybe  
<other> No it's  
I think you only need two points . 
Or not . 
No , you sh 
Slanted yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well maybe . 
Yeah it it matters for the aim of this thing . 
<other> 
Yeah . <other> 
Yeah it's only a bit like to that side , 
but that is that one by the way . 
'Cause this one makes the angle either like this . 
So i if I change this , it will go there , if I change that , will go there . 
Mm-hmm . 
I will take this away 'cause it looks messy . 
Maybe we will . 
What's this anyway ? 
It looks like candle wax . 
Uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us ? Or  
Yeah well at first I was really stressed . Because it went a bit fast . 
But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on , the second time I think I did a bit better . 
And the third time yeah , I mean  
Yeah , yeah yeah yeah . 
Yeah we  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . Definitely . 
Well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that  
Yeah . You were more in charge kind of thing . 
I guess so . 
I mean  
I 
We were pretty democratic . 
Yeah . 
<other> Maybe  Yeah . 
It's uh it's  
The the pen is more intuitive , 'cause we're all used to writing with pen . 
And uh as I said , uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation . 
But once I get to know the program probably , I mean , it looks better , you know . 
Or uh something like that . 
You can 
give it a kind of a home style , 
like we have i the the logo and everything . 
And  I don't know . 
Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well . 
You know , you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there , or whatever . 
Alright . 
Alright . 
Well , s see you in a second huh ?  . 
Yeah <laugh> we have to pull it this way , huh ? 
Wait .
