If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time . 
Is that  . 
 three , apparently . 
Okay , 
you all switched on . 
I presume we're good to go . 
Okay , um 
minutes 
um we decided to use a kinetic charger , 
standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , 
it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor . 
We wanted a stand-by function . 
The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . 
Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design . 
Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel . 
Um <other> and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . 
Um <other> and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ . 
Okay ? 
Prototype presentation . 
I think that would be you . 
Yes , yes you can . 
Wait a second , 
I'll get it out . 
Make sure the camera's  <laugh> 
Um  
Okay . 
<laugh> You should have one of those things 
and you can just take it off . 
Ta-da . 
<laugh> 
Right . 
Mm 'kay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Mm . So it's flush . 
Oh right , okay , yeah . 
So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , 
'cause it's the top part that's  
okay . 
Okay . 
I'm under the sofa . 
Or , that would be too complicated . 
Infrared  . 
Like here . 
Okay . 
Actually , no , 
it would be  it would have to be on the on the front . 
Oh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you . 
yes . 
It's still pointing , 
Yeah , that would make sense . 
Okay . 
But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product 
once it's  
Okay . 
Thank you very much . 
Um I've now got evaluation criteria . 
Wrapping it all up , 
okay . 
It's to be presented  . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
It's quite similar to what it was before , though . 
Sorry . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Just write small . 
Yeah . That works . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> I would agree . 
Okay . 
I would say two . 
A two . 
It's just two point five for that one . 
I would say a two . I would say a two . 
One point seven f five . 
Okay , mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
One . 
Well 
the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_ 
it's meant to . Um 
maybe because it's slightl 
with the size that we've got it's quite small , 
but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much . 
So maybe because there's more space , 
it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between . 
It's quite obvious just big buttons . Um  
Four . 
A standard . 
It would be . 
And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room . 
One . 
<laugh> 
I don't think so . 
I think we  yeah . I think we're set . 
Do much apart from having a huge big  
Don't think so . 
<other> Okay , 
thank you . 
<other> Okay , 
I've got finance here now . 
I'm gonna plug this in 
so you can all see it , 
if that's okay . 
Um . 
Thanks . 
Right . 
Now 
I presume that the screen will go blank , 
that um  
Okay . 
We just type numbers into this 
and we come out with the final value . 
So are we still on for kinetic ? 
Okay . 
See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . 
Um it might have influenced our choice . 
Right , 
what's happening with the electronics ? 
Double-curved . 
Oh , right , 
okay . 
Thanks . 
So , would there be two ? 
One chip . 
Okay . 
One double curve . 
So 
what's a single curve then ? 
So 
just one double  
Yeah . Um  
Mm . 
<other> Um we've got plastic and rubber , 
haven't we ? 
<laugh>  . 
Um  
Do you think ? 
Okay . 
It would be like saying we're using  
See , it says case material . 
So 
we're not actually using plastic in the case , 
are we ? 
It's including , it's including . 
Okay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half . 
Or sh we should just put it in as one , 
because the plastic is zero anyway . 
No , we don't step on anyone's toes . 
Okay , 
special colour , do we need that ? 
N 
yeah , okay . 
<other> Interface . 
Buttons  
Has that not gone up ? 
Oh no , 
it was seven five 
it's changed not a lot . 
<other> 
Oh , 
it's not calculated it . 
Okay , there we go . 
<other> It's not a lot though . 
We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though , 
I think  
Okay , 
so the highest we've got is the electronics here . Um <other> and the interface . 
Where's the 
where's the voice recognition ? 
Right , okay . 
Well 
the kinetic is three . 
If we change it to the battery it's  that's minus three . 
Oh , right . 
I keep seeing zero . 
Um  <other> We can do it some other way , 
we can do  
it doesn't have to be voice recognition . 
We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version . 
You could choose to have that or not . 
So should we just change the design specification then ? <laugh> 
Yes . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay , 
we can make the price fit , 
and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this , 
because it also sets it apart from the crowd . 
They like their gadgets , 
they like something that's completely different . 
It's <other> s something completely different associated with your company . 
Right , okay , so  
No , 
it's twelve point two five . 
It's two point five . 
Yeah well 
two , twelve point two five times two is twenty five , 
isn't it ? 
<other> I think the agenda one was where the um price was , 
wasn't it ? 
No . 
Twelve point five . 
 
Well done , people . 
So 
is 
that uh got us covered for the electronics then ? 
We don't need something else to take that place ? 
Okay . 
<other> Okay . 
Right , 
so we've done that . 
Okay . 
Product evaluation . 
We've done room for creativity , 
haven't we ? 
Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't  didn't feel able to make . Um 
I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork . 
um in the sense that 
um did you feel like a team ? 
Or did you feel like <other> uh autonomy ? 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Thank you . 
How did you find it ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , 
you know , 
y 
it didn't matter it saying what you thought , 
because if it wasn't something that was that relevant , then it didn't matter , 
'cause it was just another idea in the field . 
I like that . Um 
teamwork . 
Well 
you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model . 
Um <laugh> uh I'm still not caught up . 
<laugh> But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all . Um  
Maybe . 
No , 
that was quite fun . 
Um <other> means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ? Any ideas ? 
Had time to kind of  
Yeah , 
'cause we could just sort of say , sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it , 
yeah . 
But it was nice having it there . Um like the whole picture of the thing . 
Yeah , 
I think it's new ideas in general , 
rather than  
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , no . Well 
they have to come from somewhere , 
don't they ? 
And as sh as w 
sorry , 
you go . 
Um as was shown by <other> your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one's thought about it particularly . 
I mean they're slightly different , 
but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it . 
so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's , 
'cause it's w something we should think about , 
Mm . 
But then when it everything is really smart , and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it doesn't go , 
I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing , a funky item that's individual , individual to you , 
I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea 
and they design it on Photoshop 
and then they just get it printed on the plastic , 
you would pray  
you would pay a lot extra , 
because it's individually being  a plastic was being made for you . 
But people could  have anything that they wanted . 
Because of the produ 
Mm . 
Yes . 
Yeah . 
Well , 
it's innovation for money's sake . 
The the people have to keep buying . 
Yeah . 
And you can't get  
you've got your handset that works fine , 
but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone , 
because the phones have moved on , things like that . 
Yes . 
It's madness . Um  
In closing  There we go . 
Um <other> our costs are below budget 
with recommendations that they  the budget be increased , 
but I think  
I don't know , 
d 
Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ? And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ? 
what do you think ? 
So it looks  well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , 
you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that . 
So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at . 
But I think  but you were saying that that's quite  
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
It's a shame it won't ever get made . <laugh> 
Maybe it will . 
Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it . 
Um the project has been evaluated well and truly . 
Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire . 
Oh , so 
we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with <other> <laugh> everything that I fell behind with , 
so I'll be delegating in my um role as Project Supervisor , 
so good luck . 
I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds . 
Either that or we'll be dancing on the desks . 
I just got con 
Oh . 
Um yeah , just the last , I think . 
<other> I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy .
