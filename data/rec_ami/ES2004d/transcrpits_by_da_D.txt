Is that someone's ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> Or something . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well done . 
Certainly . 
Logged in ? 
Thank you . 
Oops . 
Okay . 
This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . 
<other> So this is the first stage of the evaluation . 
Now , 
the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . 
So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , 
are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? 
Now 
the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . 
The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , 
and those  the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . 
<other> The design should minimise R_S_I_ 
and be easy to locate 
and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , 
though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , 
but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . <other> 
Okay , so 
we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . 
I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . 
We're going to use a seven point scale , 
where one is true 
and seven is false . 
We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , 
I'll call that slide back up , 
and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . 
Does that seem clear ? 
Any questions there ? 
we're going to look at these crite 
So 
Yes , 
we're going to come to  
w we'll discuss each one 
and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . 
Is that okay ? 
One is true , 
seven is false . 
Right . So 
I won't write all of that out again . 
It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , 
or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ 
to confuse it with the number rating . 
B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ . <other> 
This is where I realise how tiny I actually am . <laugh> 
Criteria and rating . 
Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , 
and we could take an average at the end . 
How about that ? 
Okay . 
So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , 
and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who . 
Okay . 
Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . 
How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy  it is a fancy look and feel . 
One is true , 
seven is false . 
My own rating for that would be a two . 
One is true 
and seven is false . 
I'll just go this way . 
Two . 
Okay . 
Two . 
A four , okay . 
Adding those up , we've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? 
Uh two and three quarters , it that right . 
Two and three quarters ? 
Okay . Two point seven five , there we go . <laugh> 
Okay , 
criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative . 
I would give that a three . 
Okay . 
Not that you're biased <laugh> in that it  the designer . 
The average  
oh , for you ? You want your rating to be a two ? Is that what you're saying ? 
Okay . 
So , 
I'll work out the average for that again at the end . 
It's a very slightly altered  
Okay , 
and we're just waiting for your rating 
f 
Two point five , okay . 
Losing one decimal place , that's okay . 
So what are you rating for this one , Paw ? 
Two , okay . 
So that is eight . 
That brings it down to two , 
nice and simple , 
yeah . 
Okay , 
ease of use . 
Easy to use ? 
Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true . 
Two . 
A two , okay . 
Two . 
I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't I ? 
<laugh> We'll just put almost two , 
because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places . 
Okay . 
Or we  or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . 
Um mm now we're looking at 
now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours . 
Right . So 
I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . 
Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ? 
Right . 
So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . 
Okay . 
And the spongy feel is no problem with that . 
Okay . 
In that case it's got to be a one for me . 
Yep . 
Everybody ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> That part was nice and easy . 
Okay . Uh 
moving on 
to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . 
it incorporates current fashion trends , 
I don't think we've really touched on that a lot . 
We've we've discussed it , 
we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . 
We've talked about pointers , 
but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Right . 
Right . 
I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that 
and give it a four . 
A five , okay . 
Four 
and a four okay . 
Twenty one  is that twenty one ? 
So that's four point two five . 
And finally , last but not least , easy to locate . 
Now we talked about voice recognition , 
we talked about a beeper , 
have we really  
have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? 
It was the I'm here thing , 
yep . 
And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise . 
That sounds good then . 
I'd go for a  I ca 
we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ . So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or . 
Right . Okay . 
You built into the feature . 
Okay . 
Logical . 
That's a one for me . 
One 
and one , 
good . 
<laugh> So , 
how do we feel about this ? 
We've got our our  we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . 
The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , 
i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . 
<other> Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , 
or do we have to make further modifications ? 
We happy to go ahead ? 
Yeah . 
I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , 
and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . 
I know . 
Okay . Well , 
I hope that's uh clear to the team . 
Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings 
before I sum up ? 
Good . Fine then . 
I'll just leave it there . 
Oops . 
Oh yes . 
Yes . 
But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit . So it can rest . 
It would just be a flat bottom with one curve .  like a domed thing . 
Mm . 
The other curves at the sides , 
but it's slightly flattened at the bottom 
so it doesn't roll over . Yeah . 
What does it mean if you put point five for that ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Right , okay . 
But it is gonna be part of the total cost , 
and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , 
is there ? 
There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . 
So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ? 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours . 
S 
Has that not made any d 
if you click off that square now , 
has that not made any difference ? 
Is it  
oh , 
it's brought it slightly down . 
So 
is is uncurved completely 
and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , 
is that going to make a difference ? 
Oh , 
it's not made any difference , 
has it? . 
It's gone up again . 
Oh . 
<other> It's brought it down slightly . 
Is there anything on the menu  
No . 
If we tr um . 
If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ? 
And people are used to buying batteries , 
they're not gonna say I'm not getting this , 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control . 
Should we see what difference it makes ? 
Um  
Yeah . 
Sure . 
But we're still working to um head o 
We can put in our recommendations . 
If we if we're working to head office specifications as  this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we  the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings . 
But we need to work to that specification to start with . 
And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , 
but our object is so distinctive 
that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . 
Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it . 
Yeah . 
So if we take voice recognition out  
 we are . 
Are you sure ? 
Sorry , not meaning to doubt your words there . 
Right . <other> 
Are they really going to quibble about ten P_ ? Or point zero one of a Euro ? 
Which is less than ten P_ . 
That's today's 
kick off meeting ,  . 
Mm .  I thought that's what it was . 
So we're okay . 
Although we had our separate tasks , 
there was so much interaction , 
so much that we needed to um bounce off each other . 
And I've certainly felt heard , listened to 
in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take 
and adjust our remit where necessary . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line . And fake R_C_s . 
How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ? 
Could it've been better , 
was it adequate ? 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
It's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in , 
it so it's  
I mean nothing is new , 
but it's applying it to a d in a different area . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Absolutely , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , the focus isn't on to that , yeah . 
<laugh> 
I think it's really good that this has been very market research based , 
because <other> just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . 
We see it in mobile phones a lot , 
and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . 
There are innovations in that that people don't really want . 
<laugh> I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , 
and they can't get it anymore 
and it's innovation for innovation's sake , 
and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
But forcing it onto people , 
yeah . 
It's things that , 
you know , 
they might want to buy the thing they really want . 
Mm . Mm . 
Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever , 
yeah . 
See I think  
I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone . 
Mm-hmm . 
But I think in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . 
I think we've done what we were required to do , 
and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things . 
I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for . 
I think we've done very well to get within budget 
and it still makes such an innovative item 
that I think people are really gonna want . 
I know . 
Maybe it will . 
Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas 
and sell it . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Questionnaire . 
Questionnaire done . 
Oh , 
I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time . 
Oh , 
right . 
But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too ? 
Yeah .
