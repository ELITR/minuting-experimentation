Is that  for us ? 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
shall I show ? 
I'll show . 
Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it 
and I'll I'll show you the presentation . 
Can I just nick your  
Whoa . 
Going a bit crazy over here . 
Thank you . 
Okay , so 
this is our look and feel presentation , the final  our final presentation . 
And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . Um 
It's gonna have a a plastic body <other> um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . 
This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing 
um which there'd be sort of a wide choice  
they would be attached , 
but we can we can come up with that . 
Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , 
so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . 
Um <cough> it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design <other> 
and uh <cough> the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um <other> how do you say , it's  yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top 
so so it'll fully close flat . 
and the buttons at the bottom would d 
yeah . 
Yeah , 
<other> And working on the inside 
we've um already said  d decided on the kinetic batteries , 
which  actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , 
so that you could probably get a bit of  
Yeah . Yeah . 
Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in <other> 
and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , 
so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . 
So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something . 
<laugh> And then  
yeah . 
It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something . 
It'll just shout out I'm here , or something to similar effect . 
Uh yeah , 
if it was going like I d 
well 
tha that could be something for next time , maybe . 
You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . 
Um the standard , there's  be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about . 
Um it would it would have  
obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , 
it would need two separate P_C_B_s , 
so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . 
<other> And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , 
we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . 
And the infrared um sender would be on the  on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the  
we haven't  
I don't think we actually put it on . 
Yeah , yeah , something like that . 
Yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah . 
So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ . 
And then finally um on to the interface . 
<other> The top screen , as we said , is  would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen 
which  yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , 
uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect . 
And now we've  we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top . 
No d not not actually . No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing . 
And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , 
as that is  that's the company logo  . 
There you go .  . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
 
<laugh> 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh <other> two  yeah , 
two or three . 
No , 
three . Three . 
Mm yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
I'd give it a one . 
No , no , not at all . 
Yeah . 
Two . 
Two . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
D_ . 
One . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
that's  
No , no , 
the the base colour was um <other> white or or like or l sort of a light blue , 
but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any  basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah 
and  
No , no , 
'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , 
that  otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic . 
Yeah , I'll give it a one as well . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Mm . 
No . 
Yeah . 
It's meant to be . 
 
 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , 
'cause  
Yep . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , 
yeah . 
Yeah , yeah , that  yeah , that's feasible . 
Um I think it would r 
I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand 
it would be quite loud . 
So it would be s p 
yeah . 
<cough> Yeah , one . 
<other> I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 
'cause it is our product , 
but  
  
W I thin 
yeah , 
I think  
yeah . 
Mm . 
No . 
  
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
It was a regular chip on print 
and  
Oh , 
no , no , no , 
the um  
Yeah , 
it's  
you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , 
there should just be one . 
In the top , it's the number 
of c yeah  . 
Yeah , 
and  
yeah , just a  
no , 
one reg v uh  
Yeah , 
one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker . 
And they're double curved . 
No . 
Y 
Two , 
'cause it's two . 
Yeah , 
I'd say I'd say it was w 
yeah , 
I think I think it's  
One double-curved . 
And one  
no , 
'cause one  yeah , one's double-curved , 
and then the other one's 
a plastic . 
Yeah . 
And special colour . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
No , no , 
that's  it's as an extra . 
So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there , 
because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get . 
 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah , 
and L_C_ display one . 
the push-button's one 
And buttons  
Well 
yes . 
Yeah . 
No , 
we'll have  
No , no , 
you've got to click off to calculate it again . 
C 
it might uh 
you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros . 
It could be in Dollars . 
And then it would be fine , 
because the exchange range would make it about twelve . 
<laugh> No . 
Yeah , 
the standard , 
it <other> um it would make one difference . 
The biggest one would be taking away  if you took away  
If you to 
Yeah . 
If if you take away the voice , 
I I do I don't like to say it , 
but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it . 
Yeah i yeah . 
No 
'cause it's samples sens sample speaker . 
If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five . 
They <other> n n 
yeah , 
but you p 
minus three plus two . 
Yeah . 
But they  but I mean in  
I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , 
because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product . 
Yeah . 
We c we could s 
Yeah , 
we could say  
Yeah , 
I s 
And then say we recommend  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
That'll do it . Twelve point three five . 
Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ? 
Ah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
No . 
'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra , 
you could just take that out and that would be fine , yeah . 
Yeah , 
I think that's brilliant . 
Yeah . 
Yes . <laugh> 
Yeah , I'd say , as a team . 
Yeah . 
Find out from each other , 
yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , no , 
I thought it it went really well 
and I 
yeah , I I feel that everyone was listened to 
and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , 
although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , 
but that's that's good . 
I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually  if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different , 
but  
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , well . 
 <laugh> 
 
 Discuss which ones  
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Vegetables . 
Yeah . 
No . 
<other> Yeah , 
I do 
I don't think the the companies are really concerned . 
They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player , 
does anyone remember the remote control ? 
Can't you get the one that we used for the last one ? 
Yeah , 
just jazz it up a bit . 
Uh d they don't really think about it , 
because normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship . 
They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player , the video player , the T_V_ . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
No . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<cough> 
<laugh> Well . 
I think that was just the the physical . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I think  
yeah 
I don't  from the market research . 
No . 
Yeah , 
it was  
<laugh> 
I it's top secret . Um it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here . That's what it is . 
<laugh> <laugh> In your  
yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Is that it then ? 
Awesome . 
Was that not the questionnaire for the  how you felt you'd done in your thing ? 
I don't think . 
I think  yeah , questionnaire seven was the one I did just before the meeting . 
Mm . 
Yeah , 
the the s 
yeah .
