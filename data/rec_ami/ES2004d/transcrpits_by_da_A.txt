Yep . 
 
<other>  . 
The black and white touch screen 
wherein people can  
Right . 
  
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
'Kay . 
Ah oka 
Infrared could be here also . Yeah , here . 
 . So when it's  even if it's open here , the signals would go  . 
Yeah . 
This one right here . 
 
 . 
Which is  
No . 
Look up to it . 
Yay . 
So 
this is the one . 
Sorry . 
Evaluation . 
 . 
Mm um I I think this is  chip . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Ah , it's perfect . 
Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market  
okay . 
'Kay . 
Yeah , 
so you can  
'Kay . 
<other> I would say four . 
Mm-hmm . 
Almost three . 
I think yeah . 
Oh 
sorry , 
I I got it wrong . The first one rating , 
I'm sorry . 
Can you just make it two ? The first . 
Yeah , 
I I just  it the other way . 
Uh in  
Yep , 
I just got  
 
two point f 
One is a  , 
seven is false , 
okay . 
Two . 
Two . 
<laugh> 
White . 
With  
for the plastic ? Uh blue . 
Any  
Right . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , 
because you'll be having a  Because of the rubber case . 
One . 
Mm . 
Four . 
 
Voice r recognition . 
<other> <other> 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
You want me to b unplug that ? 
That's all . Yes . 
Okay . 
Chip on print . 
Okay . 
Yep . 
Single-curved . 
Two curves , yeah . 
Single-cu 
 . 
Plastic and rubber . 
Yeah . 
Plastic one 
and maybe rubber point five . 
No 
I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing , 
we can put point five . 
Yeah , 
I think it allows the point five , 
yeah . 
We can use that . 
It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually . 
We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic . 
Push-button . 
One . 
An One . 
<other> I think we could change the battery also . 
Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery . 
Uncurved , flat . 
No , 
it just surprises one . 
 . <laugh> I don't think so . 
Ri 
I think it's in Euro  . 
And going to a regular bat 
Yeah . 
What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery  . 
It's internal , 
nobody looks into the battery . 
But shape and colours , that's something we shouldn't comprimi 
Where's that special form ? Mm mm mm . 
 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> Make it costly . 
Yeah 
we are close to the budget . 
Two five . 
It's twelve point five maybe , then . 
I don't know what  
it said fifty percent of the cost . 
So half of the price would be  
I think it is the first one . 
So we are under the budget . 
Seems fine . 
Except voice recognition , everything is  
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
I think we had a nice time . 
Yeah , I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody . 
It's not like people trying to cut each other . 
There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork . 
We came to a very predic creative design , yeah . 
Yeah , and uh  
Yeah , I think . 
And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Yeah . 
I think that was the best part 
of the  <laugh> 
'Kay . 
 
Yeah , 
 moving around the room . 
<laugh> But I think it's good , 
like uh we spent times individually . 
I never thought of a remote control with a flip top . 
<other> 
<laugh> That's mine . 
Yeah , 
it's  <other> 
The thing is  
Yep , sorry , 
go on Sarah . 
Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that . 
And new f television products coming up , 
but nobody giving uh much idea to this . 
Like Sarah was telling , everything's  
Right . 
Mm-hmm . 
 
<laugh> 
Maybe fifty percent more . 
Yeah . 
Who knows ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
There's a final questionnaire . 
Celebration , you didn't talk about that . 
<laugh> 
Yeah .
