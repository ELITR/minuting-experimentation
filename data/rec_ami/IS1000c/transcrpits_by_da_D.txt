Okay so 
we are just waiting for Matthew  . 
Mm 'kay . 
Yep . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah 
I think  <other> yeah the  Matthew it is it's important that Matthew yeah is here 
because it's really a a team uh project with a team 
and if someone is not here then we cannot  
but it's okay <laugh> it's good . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
So 
can you repeat 
and be more precise about what you just said ? 
Uh about the feeling 
yeah 
uh yo 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah that's a very good idea , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah very clear . 
To let the people choose ,  you mean ? 
Yeah . 
<cough> 
Yeah a range of uh yeah , a set of three , four different aspects . 
Sure that fits the <other>  
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah I agree . 
Yeah . 
And your part is very related to mine 
because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside . 
Yeah . 
 . 
Yeah . 
So 
what functionalities do you suggest for that ? For facing this problem ? 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Oh yeah yeah yeah mm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
And you want 
okay  
for 
coming back to one point 
y you want to let the user to programming the keys ? Some of them ? 
And uh isn't that too difficult 
for the  we want w 
I don't know if we still want the um R_C_ to be easy to use , 
that's the  compromise . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
A standard . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm 
yeah like 
<other> I would say that for programming uh keys , you said , uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve Euros , 
but for the A_S_R_ system , uh I'm not sure if it's feasible to have this 
We <other> 
Exactly yeah 
i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented , 
and w how much it's cost , maybe with a f cheap chip . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah <other> . 
Mm . 
It's true . 
Mm-hmm . 
 . 
I don't know how if if I have time to talk about the  
<laugh> Okay . 
So 
what I'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a R_C_ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you . 
So 
the method is  ther 
there is a a set of components in a in a remote control 
like  , and uh what cost  
the the components in themself do not cost a lot 
but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously , 
and I will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end . 
So 
there are two uh different types of uh um  Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control . 
Uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an  
that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led 
that will uh transmit to the receiver . 
And uh yeah 
the other components and the circuit board  buttons , infrared <laugh> , led , etcetera , for the components 
um . So 
you  finding , 
just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed , 
and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , uh with a different sequence for each key , 
and uh uh 
that's , 
with the components we will use , we will have different uh messages , different sequences , 
and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor 
that amplify to make it stronger 
um . So 
electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards 
uh because it's easier to mass produce and assemble . 
And uh so 
I think <other> for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_ uh high technology , 
and this is important , 
and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to  them and connect them . 
So 
my personal design <other> 
we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use . 
If it's plastic 
or you said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit , veg or <laugh> 
I dunno . <laugh> 
Yes . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
Yeah 
like they do in with cars I think . Yeah inside the car 
yeah . 
So 
they also emailed me that uh they have <other> available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a  computer mouse . And uh very cheap L_C_D_s , so liquid crystal displays , 
so I'm wondering , I think we might be able to integrate L_C_D_ into our R_C_ . 
And the final point okay is um we have  yeah there are some uh compromise to to do . 
So 
we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip , 
but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money um which is a higher price range 
alright . 
And the display requires an advanced chip , 
which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , 
but <other> I think uh with twelve Euros um and if it's uh uh made for mm four million uh items , then I think w we could be able to handle that . 
So 
to <other> to sum up um 
we need <other> 
yeah so 
I I just said that the components uh the list of components uh has to be uh yeah listed 
and um and um assembly is a an important process 
that has to be taken into account . 
And uh for the designing of the cove uh uh cover layout then it's better to to to maybe see that with uh the the U_R_ exp U_R_I_ Expert 
so that we can  it's really a team-working 
uh . So 
I I cannot design something without your agreement , 
right ? 
Yes . 
Yeah 
it's kind of um simple  pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert . 
I think we could insert one that could underlie several functions 
of  
Exactly yeah , for customizing and yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . Yeah good idea . 
<other> Yeah . <laugh> 
Exactly yeah that's a very good idea , 
we could have uh one main chip uh that could handle , uh it's called F_P_G_A_ chip , that could handle both uh like scrolling wheels as well as uh L_C_D_ 
and 
yeah . 
Yes . 
Yeah 
also thinking , 
I think both uh  if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh Euros , it will be okay , 
but uh   . 
Yeah that's an excellent idea . 
Yeah yeah . Yeah 
because right now I don't have  price in in head 
but for next meeting I'm sure yeah be able to do that . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
I agree on that . Yeah . 
Yeah 
but i it's a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood , 
and we need maybe to centre our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality we want to offer to the user , and maybe with uh <other> graphs or I don't know uh   
User Interface Designer you could maybe uh help us on that . 
Yeah . 
Perfect yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah customized . 
Yeah . 
I agree yeah , 
and not too m too many keys of course yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
That's what you mean ? 
Yeah I like also this one . 
Yeah , 
the point is w 
maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be 
and how many buttons like n we should <other> dec decide numbers or  
Okay . 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
Perfect . 
Exactly . 
Yeah . 
Two or three prototypes ? 
Two ? 
Okay . 
Yeah 
and find maybe a compromise . 
Perfect yeah . 
Thanks .
