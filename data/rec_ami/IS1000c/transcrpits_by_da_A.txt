Right first time this time . 
Nu 
There we go . 
It's not that complicated , 
but I get it wrong every time . 
<laugh> 
For Matthew , yep . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yep . 
Mm-hmm . 
I have a presentation , 
I'm just making this  
Okay 
I'll just email you this file , my presentation . 
Mm-hmm 
I'm just emailing it to you . 
Okay it should've gone through to you . 
Mm-hmm . Okay so 
this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . 
Um can I just put this on ? 
So 
we have to work out a way  what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it . 
Um . This is  to do this I will not remove my microphone . 
<other> We basically used um some focus group surveys 
which I went through with you last time , the main results of that , 
and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um , 
and as part of this  
The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . 
The most important by far was the look and feel of it . 
It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . It needs to stand out <cough> . 
It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . 
Most people find remote controls boring at the moment , 
we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . 
People will wanna buy it . Um  
That was twice as i important as the next item on here 
which is that it has to be technologically innovative  
has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . 
People have to then think about it and say  got something there that I want . That's a really cool feature , 
and it has to make them wanna buy it again . 
Third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect , 
it has to be easy to use . 
So they have to be able to  be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um . 
Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , uh fruit and vegetables um . 
This is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , um eye-catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel . 
Um I had a talk to the design people about this , 
but having a remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool . 
That would make it stand out . Um . 
Well 
ma make it not necessar sp 
spongy is the current thing . Spongy is the current texture , 
but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all , 
so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that'll be something that sets it apart , 
rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment . 
So 
as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . 
So 
going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables um . 
Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , 
they've all got those  
a lot of them have the changeable covers , 
so they can choose what colour the outside is . 
That's one way of looking at it um . 
Textured feel we just talked about . 
Maybe it's another way of doing that . 
So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . 
So they can choose it li as they want to to maybe  to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever . 
Um and yeah , 
still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . 
Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . 
They're big selling items . 
People put a lot of thought into that 
so we can leverage off that , 
and we can start using some of their ideas . 
Um back to technological in in innovation , not quite as important , 
but still a big issue . 
Um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost , 
uh that's one thing we could look at . 
There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't  I don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . 
I think we're better doing something basic like this 
which is very important 
and very  will be a really cool feature to put in . 
And   use . I had no real specific ideas for this , 
maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves , 
and then  
yeah 
 and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate . 
Yep <other> and that's the presentation . 
So 
does anyone have any comments or ideas on that ? 
I think you  
Hmm . 
Well 
we're selling so many units of this . 
This is gonna be a mass marketed product , 
we can afford to have two or three different designs at least . 
Mm mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like B_B_C_ , rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad . 
That's a good idea . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Mm . Yeah I really like that idea . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Maybe ten channels , yeah at the most . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm b 
But a coffee machine , there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<other> 
Two thirty five supposed to finish . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
I think you can do it both ways . 
You can have it so it's easy  they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it , 
or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
I like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark , 
so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them 
or if they if they light up or something . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> <cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm just have a yeah  
Just the veneer on it , 
yeah . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well 
maybe we need specific costings then . 
Actually 
do maybe two designs 
and then cost them out 
and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Mm yeah sure . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
So 
is there any of these that you're looking at particularly 
or is this just ideas ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm yeah . 
You see ? 
Yeah . 
Mm well 
one I've had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom 
so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , 
and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Um yeah 
I've seen that before too . 
Anoth another like b 
it flips up 
and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath . 
Mm . 
But I've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well . 
I like this one . I like the shape of this one . 
Can we have  
can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box 
that's a  
maybe curved or something . 
Mm mm 'kay . 
Is this for the next meeting though ? 
I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting . 
Yep . 
No . 
So 
is this  
is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting ? 
Mm . 
Okay 
well 
is this <other> me designing a way to evaluate it 
so  
Thinking about how to set up test groups and things ? 
Mm . 
Okay . Yep . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm 'kay . 
Thanks guys .
