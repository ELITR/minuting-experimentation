Sorry . 
So  
Yeah 
I sent you the slides , 
you didn't see them ? 
Okay . 
 . 
<other> So  <other> 
'Kay . 
<other> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<other> You can  
Yeah . 
Voila . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
s 
then we could discuss later 
like  
we can put all ideas together . 
It should be easier with that . 
Yeah . 
So  
Yeah . 
Yeah so <laugh> 
I'll I'll go with that actually 
so um <other>  
Okay so m so <other> 
then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures , different forms , 
and uh they could be like buttons 
and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other , 
and uh maybe like you can have different colours 
for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button . 
So this this is the general trend to ha the method they do . <other> 
So what I have found was that uh currently uh the  they are mostly that the T_V_ , V_C_R_ , music system operated ones actually , 
and they are very specific to each other , 
but there are some common keys 
for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have 
and uh <other>  
There is also um a speech recognition to store channel information , names , 
like  
You can basically  
if you have a multiple functionality , say T_V_ , V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the  T_V_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information <other> . 
Yeah yeah 
so you you you can just uh 
because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly , 
even if you arrange it by  however you arrange it , you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to  
So 
it it it's like 
it  limited one . 
In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for <other> eighty word thing , eighty word , 
which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word . 
Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control , 
you want to st store your favourite channel . 
Yeah some ten twelve channel information . 
You know 
you don't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that . 
And uh basically uh 
it depends 
like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing 
because you have multiple functionalities 
for example you are watching a movie , and uh uh you are <other> having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which functionality is  now , 
so I am using the T_V_ so every time I use it , it could be like , 
for example I can use a simple toggle switch , and a display , 
so I press it so the display says , okay , I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys , 
to model the functionalities will increase actually , 
and for you and you might want <laugh> 
you don't want separate keys for all of them . 
You can't . 
And uh well 
there can be children friendly 
where you can programme your remote 
so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them . 
So these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present . 
I personally would look at <other> things like having a u universal remote , 
is uh um is a good idea , 
like 
instead of having  unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition . 
I got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit 
that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine , 
and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi Joe , or something like that , 
you know , and uh  
<other> Yeah 
you you won't be using it , 
so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing , and very isolated word 
and it's uh it is interesting , and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing 
which is again  
and maybe having something like a blinking thing , 
like uh it could indicate you're uh  it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote , the blinking . 
At the same time , if it's a dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also 
<other>  or  
Yeah you can let them to do that . 
N no 
but the  if you give  
it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put . 
Like for example uh I would like to store in certain way , 
so if you want to give the full freedom to the user 
or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint . 
So it de 
So  
<other> So  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
We well 
we can still look at  
we can talk with the coffee unit 
and you can uh check how much how much they  <other> 
yeah yeah 
yeah . 
Maybe we can come <other> we we can talk to them , and we can come with that , 
you know . 
And also well you can think of having uh since you have a  you know something  
maybe if you added little bit of  display , 
you might need the  to che keep checking the battery , 
so you really need a some <other> kind of indicator , 
so it could be a blinking option of L_E_D_ <other> 
it could actually be used to detect also . 
If it's in a dark room you can basically detect it also . 
So  
No 
actually 
<other> i if i it is like  
you know 
it tells you um , 
it can be for two purposes , 
like if you have an L_C_D_ display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote , 
which is having 
uh which need just uh six six volt uh th sorry three volts um of D_C_ . 
It may need more actually , 
so y you you may need to check your battery usage 
it  
and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit . 
And then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something 
and it can change the colour depending on your uh  how much is the battery , 
well 
that is good enough to even locate even if you want to . 
You know . 
Yeah 
so  
You you have time some more ? 
Yep . 
<laugh> Sure you can you know <laugh> . 
Hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah mm mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Sorry . 
Yeah so 
of course 
for example uh I wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the L_C_D_ display over there , 
or if you want to store a programmes with a keys  
What kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside  
W wh what  
W what  
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay so 
in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the  card . 
Yeah 
where they do all the wi with with them actually . 
How f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things . 
D 
well <other>  
Well 
I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know . 
Is it possible to fit in to that ? 
Sorry . 
Yeah 
that's uh that's something which I wanted to ask you also , 
like what will be the each individually the cost of it . 
For example if f if you want to put wood  I wouldn't suggest for wood 
uh  'cause it's  I think it's m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber  rather than wood . 
It will be much ch much expensive 
th though it's the most natural thing , 
but <laugh>  
Yeah . 
<other> Yeah 
it's uh  
<other> Yeah we we can give a preference to them , 
but it is  
but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is  it's much better with that rather than going for  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yea 
Okay . 
<other> Yeah sure . 
Yeah 
we will uh  
Yeah . 
Uh . 
Yeah . 
 . 
Okay <other>  . 
We can give them smooth keys , 
you know . 
Smooth keys with bigger s uh  So that you know  
The the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small , 
and every time we have to be very  but if i the  if we 
if we go to a different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together 
to  
Oh 
you can actually , 
for example , if you see , they are they are they are quite small over here , 
and uh <other> now you can , 
for example , as I was  if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people . 
At the same time , it is m more uh like it would be more interesting for people who are having this R_S_I_ and all  problem . 
Uh big keys may better  for them actually and uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yes . 
Yeah 
so it's something like this , the model here 
s  you can put the keys  
Yeah . Yeah . 
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah , mm . 
We should make a  
Yeah 
that  yeah next meeting we should be <other>  
Yeah 
that would depend upon us actually . 
Yeah okay . 
<other> No no . I don't have . 
Maybe it would be interesting if you could look um for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition or something like that . 
Mm . <other> 
Two . 
One for like cost and the one with like higher-end 
so that then we can be easily comparing them 
or you know find a compromise between both of them , 
yeah that's how it is . 
Yep . 
Okay . 
So 
we are done for now .  .
