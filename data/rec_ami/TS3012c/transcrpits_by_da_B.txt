Well , 
I had just a little bit of time , 
so  <laugh> I hope it's something uh we can work with . 
But  
Hmm ? 
Well , 
I heard that there was a new uh <other> component  speech recognition component , 
which was pretty much up to standard , 
so we might use that  
I put that in my drawing , 
but again I didn't not have that much time . 
So  
Okay , 
that's just super . 
Let me just  
 uh  
You need to start it up first ? 
Okay . 
Okay , 
what t 
Okay , yeah . 
<laugh> 
Is that enough ? 
Because I don't really see people shaking their remote control before using it . 
No . 
And what does the hand dynamo  
oh , sorry . 
Oh . 
Curves being ? <laugh> 
Of the remote control itself , 
okay . 
I was thinking along the line of one curve . 
I'll show that in my design . 
So 
we'll get back to that . 
Okay , 
I t 
I'd go for plastic 
because I have a couple of curves in my design . 
Well , 
g 
let's just get back to that . 
No , wood's not an option . No . 
Yeah , 
but it doesn't have to be unbreakable , 
because we do need to keep selling these thing <laugh> 
Okay , well 
that  that's definitely true . 
Because it  
well , 
ru 
will rubber actually protect the remote control itself ? 
Because it  
Yeah , 
but then you buy a new cover . 
But rubber  
Okay . 
Yeah , 
of cour 
Yeah , 
but there is a  
is it really necessary 
'cause a normal push-button can do that job . 
Yeah , 
but why would we use it ? 
<laugh> 
Perhaps . 
I have t I have two different  
Okay . 
I have two designs , 
one including uh <other> an L_C_D_ screen , wh which is basically the deluxe edition . 
And then I also have a standard edition , which wi we can also choose to develop too . 
Exactly . 
But we'll  
Yep . 
Basically , 
it  
Oh , 
I got  
I got an email that it's relatively small . 
Yes , 
let me just  <other> Get back . 
Well , 
they b 
they basically can have speech recognition . 
I mainly focused on the L_C_D_ uh aspect . 
'Cause you wanted to see them , 
right ? 
So this is basically the deluxe edition . 
I j 
Why is it square ? 
It  
'cause it's designy . 
It's basically  it has some futuristic  Potentially , 
yeah . 
I don't really know . 
But I just thought that uh in normal remote controls you have like smooth curves and this and that , 
and this is something new , this is something different , something fresh . 
And basically what you can see here is that it has a little , yeah , let's say gap 
which you can put your finger in . 
So you can you can hold it really comfortable , 
that's basically the idea . 
Or left hand . 
I 
doesn't really matter . 
As you can see , this is the remote control 
Uh you can't really see it that well , 
but this is the L_C_D_ screen . 
So just imagine it goes that way . 
Then you can see you can hold it in your left or in your right hand . 
And I also made a quick image , 'cause I did not have that much time , of the standard edition 
which has basically the keys are pretty much the same . 
Yeah . 
I had to do this really fast . 
So excuse me for the uh inconvenience here , 
but as you can see , the keys moved . 
Yeah . 
So 
these are basically the two types we have . 
So if we were to select the L_C_D_ screen , the transmitter here , you can see the light i 
Well 
we can shift that . 
But normally , as you can see there , we put the uh number buttons right on top . 
<other> Whereas because we had the L_C_D_ screen here , we had to move them downward , 
so what you could say is that  
Because these are basically the functions you use the most . 
So if you hold it in your hand like this , you put your finger in the gap , 
this is the m most easy part . Bit . For zapping , 
cau 
because people are zapping most of the time . 
Okay . So 
that's pretty much ha which I had in mind . 
As you can see here , this can be spaced for extra keys , 
which is the design thingys . 
Yeah . 
Speech recognition . 
Then rubber would be the best as a material indeed . 
If that is the uh  
It could be a c it could be a cover . 
But <other> it's not . 
Our focus is the young audience . 
So let's stick to that . 
Yeah , 
but that's just more a se a seasonal , a trend thing . 
The idea now is is is that you can uh put a cover on it , for example , with fruit , like a shape or whatever . 
But not  
'cause a n next year it will  it'll be something completely different . 
And then you have your apple-shaped remote control , which is not trendy anymore . 
So I think that's more something you can focus  
Well , 
you can s 
What you can do is smooth the edges indeed . 
But that will bring extra c expenses . 
Well 
we've got we've got like one curve here . 
For the gap . 
And we could have one here . 
No , no no no no . 
What I'm just  
'cause you mentioned that more curves the more expensive , 
so I'm just taking that into account . 
Well 
we picked rubber , 
right ? 
So basically what we can do is m make these edges a little bit less sharp . 
But the problem then is that it will start to resemble m the remote controls as we have them today . 
We were looking at something fresh , something trendy  
Okay . 
Okay , 
so that's basically silly . 
But isn't the f the fruit like a cover thing , 
because we  
No , 
but  
But if we put that directly into the design , we limit ourselves extremely . 
Because it  that's just for one seasonal trend . 
Okay , 
so that's  
well , 
that's probabl 
 , you'd just like it to go a little bit more like this . 
Okay . 
Did you present e everything you wanted to ? 
Okay . 
Uh we still need to decide on a couple of things you you needed to know . 
<other> 
Are we all in agreement about the , well , the primary structure of the  of my design ? Except for the edges . Like the keys there . 
Yeah . 
To create a kind of disco effect 
when you  
That was basically what w 
  Light for the finding of the remote . 
We can also use one light for showing that the signal is being sent . 
But  
So we have the teletext we have here , 
we have the mute . 
L_C_D_ screen . 
This is the on off button . 
Speech recognition , 
I  
where did I imagine . 
I did that pretty much over here , 
so that you could use it like this and speak to it . 
Then you have the uh extra keys for teletext , mute , 
We can also just not use them . 
two buttons which can be pretty much anything or nothing . 
<other> Main controls and a key-pad . 
Will be fine . 
Yeah , 
but that would  
this was just in the design . 
Because if you  
I had a square design . 
So I had square buttons . 
But in that case the round buttons would be more appropriate . 
Yeah . 
The left one is teletext 
and the right one is mute . 
And these two buttons are  or not necessary 
or  
Yeah , the triangles would be best indeed . 
I personally think that a round b button looks bit silly , 
but  
Does everybody agree on that ? 
You prefer a round ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , you can . 
But it but it's not necessary , 
becau 
We could put our logo there . <laugh> 
Oh 
that could be that b 
Well 
now it's getting a little bit too crowded up there . 
So  Is your  
So it can basically be the button down below or one of the four buttons up there . 
Because  
One of the four is better , I suppose . 
Because it's a little bit confusing to have twelve buttons down there , 
because you're only accustomed to eleven , I'd say . 
<laugh> 
Oh , 
we still need an okay button . 
Well , 
you could also shift the two buttons to be nicely aligned . 
Oh , 
we're pretty much missing an okay button , 
but we have a button up there which is still free . 
So  
Yeah , pretty much . 
Well , 
I think it looks better curved . 
But that's probably uh  
It can be curved , 
because that  
yeah , 
it's a little bit more trendy to be curved . 
Hmm ? 
But it pretty much looks like a banana already . <laugh> Uh  <laugh> 
It's fruit . <laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Or they can design their own cover . 
We could set up a a marketing uh agreement . 
Won't that be a problem with the L_C_D_ screen ? 
Yeah , 
but the L_C_D_ screen probably needs <other> quite the chip . 
<other> Okay . 
Okay , that's not a problem . Okay . 
<laugh> I think we get the idea . 
Oh , basically 
the idea that I had was it to be pretty much in combination with the transmitter . 
'Cause you can talk to it like this . 
Well , 
the email said it was a quite a small component . 
So I don't see that . 
It's a  
Well , 
the  
Yeah , 
but do you actually need the remote talking back ? 
Beep . 
At the back , 
yeah . Like that . Or at the side . 
Which is  . 
So what's basically edi the editi idea , sorry , now ? 
We need to stay here and work out that . <laugh> 
Well , 
I suppose we'll  
Pretty much . 
Yeah , 
but when you use covers , it basically easier to have a n have a neutral colour on the base . 
No , 
we're designing the remote control now , 
but taking that into consideration , it's better to have a neutral base colour than to have a flashy  
It is more trendy . That's definitely true . 
Oh , 
where would you like to put it ? <laugh> 
Uh you could use it for the channels and for the volume . 
But it's  has no real added value . 
Yeah , 
but if it has no function , 
then  
<other> Basically out . 
I don't see the  
<other> Do you have all your answers ? 
Okay . 
Yes , you can colour rubber , yeah .
