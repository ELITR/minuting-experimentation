<pause filling noise> 
Hello . 
So , 
are you d 
what were j you guys discussing ? 
Okay . 
Did you find anything new ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Great , great . 
Come on .  . 
What's  uh here . <gasp> 
And there we are . 
What the f 
oh , yeah uh . 
It doesn't do what I want it  
Okay fine , 
that's too bad . 
Yeah , I have to start our  
'Kay . Okay , 
go again . 
Well 
second phase , conceptual design . 
It's fine , everybody knows what we're talking about . 
So , 
take you past the minutes of last meeting again . 
Again you get your three presentate to see what you came up with . 
So 
too bad we don't have any finance information apparently . So that's too bad . 
So then we'll just have to d uh have to go on , you know , the information that we have to make the  make final decisions on uh on a conceptual design . 
So  <sharp intake of air> Here we go . Anyway , 
last w last w what discussed last time , 
you all remember that , that we have to keep the electronics size in mind . 
Same goes for you . 
We have to have an easy design with big buttons which are durable 
and there are people actually spen willing to spend money to do  to get more features 
and uh among those features L_C_D_ screen and voice recognition are very popular . 
So we have to make a move on that area , I guess . 
S 
especially s when when the new uh component is applicable in our uh product , we'll be fine . 
Anyways , well 
teletext wasn't important  
and that's  what I took . 
And the consumer , 
yeah , 
we aim for young consumers , 
so that's fine . 
And well actually we  yeah , 
we did need some more data on finances , 
but w yeah we still don't have that apparently . 
That's too bad . 
Yeah , 
we need to im de 
we are going to implement the beep and the flash thing to recover your remote . 
So  
one of these interchangeable covers apparently which will make it a more fashionable product . 
So   anyway . 
Guess we'll have to do this after the after the  you give your presentations . 
So 
I'll just close this one now , 
and let's  uh let's see ,  . 
We have a lot to tell . 
You had a lot to go on . 
So uh 
how about you go first . 
<other> 
<other> 
<cough> 
Okay . <other> 
Does it provide enough energy ? 
Also if if we were choose the the L_C_D_ option , would it give enough energy  
Okay , 
that's  the  just assume it takes  . 
Well , 
I'm not sure if it's shaken enough , 
because  
No , I don't think so , 
because uh watches can go on kinetic energy 
because they move all the time . 
But I'm sure t 
I mean remotes lie still I think like ninety nine percent of the time . 
So I don't think that's a really good  
the other alternative were solar cells . 
I don't think that's applicable 
because 
I thin why 
why shouldn't we take a basic battery ? 
Why not ? 
I mean everybody everybody knows how to use that . 
It's it's common . 
So  
and it's available everywhere . 
So why sh mm I think  better . 
Yeah , 
but it's  
Yeah , 
uh it wasn't it wasn't in the options , a rechargeable m module actually . 
Okay yeah , 
b you c 
of course you could place re re-chargeable batteries . 
But that's up to the consumer himself . 
So  
Well , 
mm 
it's not in the list . 
So we cannot choose from it . 
So  <laugh> 
Okay , will just take regular batteries . 
Okay , we'll get back on that later . 
Just  
But what were the implications if you  if put more curves it  it's gets more expensive . 
Okay , 
so I think with with the extras that we had there it's two curves I suppose . 
Okay . 
Also decreases , okay . 
Okay . 
More than one curve , uh yeah okay . 
We'll just go uh  
'Cause it  
yeah , 
I'm not sure . 
We'll discuss that later . 
Okay , 
we have  
so I think we can rule out um  
I'm not sure we can rule anything out . 
We'll do that when y when you get your design . 
No , wood i wood's not an option . 
Well 
it  it's stylish , 
but we can  
yeah , 
but you can change your covers anyway . 
Yeah , 
is it  keep in mind that it  it's it's  uh it fal uh 
remote controls fall a lot on the ground . 
So you don't want it to break . 
So either have rubber edges 
or  a rubber remote control is very durable . 
But  
Continue . 
Don't have to be un-breakable , 
it's p it's a  
it's not supposed to ju yeah , break after one use . 
I mean it  they 
they fall a lot . 
So  
Well , 
you have for  if you  if 
for example if you take hard plastic . If it falls it might crack . 
And rubber uh kind of softens the fall . 
I'm not sure if it's the it's the entire cover you change . 
Uh , it's could be . 
You know what , 
th 
we're focusing very much on the covers now . 
I think it's just w now we're going for the basic design . 
If we wanna expand our options , f be fashionable , then we can get changeable covers . 
But I think the basic thing  
let's just rule out wood for now 
and continue . 
We're definitely focussing on the younger people , 
'cause that was our main goal . 
Okay okay , we will . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Evident . Yeah , o of course we're gonna use . 
But I didn't I didn't go on the thought of a scroll-wheel actually . 
I'm still deciding on what what what could you use it for . 
Maybe for volume control . 
Channel , I think that would be annoying 
because it might accidentally scroll onto another channel . 
I think a push-button for channel would be better . 
I mean it  
for volume control it's it's a smoother motion , 
you can just increase or decrease . 
But not sure . For channels will be good . 
I don't think so . 
I haven't I haven't taken it into consideration . 
I don't think we really need one . 
 . 
But why do we need it ? 
If we don't need it , why put it in your why put it in your in your  if it's if it's not something people are looking for or is useful . 
Are they ? 
Yeah , 
but if it's if it's not useful , 
I don't think it I don't think it gives an extra function to the remote . 
Anyway  
What you  what  
what'd you get on the L_C_D_ screen ? 
Is it expensive ? 
Does it  
And how much more expensive is that ? 
Or  
No absolute numbers , 
but it's just more expensive 
and takes more room I suppose in your in your design . 
Don't think it's an issue , okay . 
Oh let's go for  
we should take it take it t to consideration to build an L_C_D_ screen in it . 
let's say because it is uh very hot in n our target group I think , 
Okay . 
Which basically has the same functionality , but lacks the L_C_D_ screen . 
Okay . 
We'll pick a  we'll pick from uh  
we'll just combine everything later . 
Mm-hmm . 
Once again I was  would ask you if it's expensive , 
but apparently you don't have any data . 
So  
Well 
what d what was exact what you got on the on the new component ? 
That's small . 
So we can implement it . 
So why why  
if it's small and we can imp why shouldn't we ? 
And there's um   get your mar marketing report ? 
What was uh the last number 
of how many people were interested in voice recognition ? 
Although it's hard for different countries of course . 
But you have to programme it yourself , I suppose , with your own voice . 
More than sixty percent of the people would like voice recognition . 
If it's small , if it's fits , if if people like it , why not ? 
So  
Yeah , 
but we got some data on people that actually are int  are interested in that , 
and I don't think a scroll-wheel offers new functionality , 
whereas speech recognition and L_C_D_ screen do offer new functionality in your product . 
Uh I think so , 
because if  I think we're specially w if you're going  
maybe uh if you have the two editions you wanna wanna give out , probably you have one with uh with speech recognition 
and  
Um  Yeah , 
hold on a minute . 
Were were you  
we're finished ? 
Or  
Oh . 
Because if there's something that  
'Cause have  
did you have all the materials ? 
Or everything that you desc 
Okay , so uh 
just just go for design for now . 
Just m have a seat for a second . Uh  
We'll combine everything after this . 
Why is it s why is it squared ? 
Why did you pick square ? 
Or uh not square , but why is it   yeah , sharp corners . 
 
Looks like a Star Trek phaser . <laugh> 
<other> It's true . 
Yeah . Or  Okay , so just  yeah , 
you can rest it on your finger . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
No , 
it just uh  
it's a curve inside a thing . 
So  
It's on the back . 
Yeah , I think it's okay . 
Keys are probably the n the number keys , I suppose . 
Okay . Well , 
you can work on the actual concept or actual design later with him . 
But  
Well , 
I think what you have to keep in mind is that um you're moving the the the number keys from the top . 
Uh in the the simple design you have them at a top , 
and the uh complex design you have them at the bottom . 
So it would  that would give us a totally different design . 
So  which actually making a whole different product instead of two different models . 
I think it would be very expensive to produce two whole different products . 
So  
<other> Yeah ,  uh  
or for example , why did you pick the mm the numbers uh all the way below , and the and the channels and volume control  
Okay . 
That's fine . That's fine . 
Just as long as you tak took it into consideration what people would prefer . 
Uh , okay 
if you all agree , I'm fine with it . 
But  
Okay . <other> 
Yeah , 
I think we'll  
I think we're going towards the deluxe edition anyway , 
because that seems to be what the people want . 
But let's see what's what they want now . 
Mm-hmm . 
That's mine . 
No , 
you should send it to the f to the folder first . 
Okay um , 
let's just assume we go to forty  one . 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
I think so . 
Okay . 
Okay , 
so we're definitely going for rubber . 
Let's just go 
Uh-huh . 
Nah , 
I think we're  in this case you're losing the the focus on the young group , 
because we're  that's what we're focussing on . 
So I think the spongy feel gives us rubber . 
Yeah , 
apparently  
yeah , 
maybe also  
yeah , 
I tend to disagree with with uh with a sharp form . 
I suppose it basi if you're uh saying fruits and vegetables , maybe it's supposed to be a little little more round . 
Yeah , 
for exa 
maybe like uh like a pear or something . 
That's what we're doing . 
Mm . 
I think shape is is important , 
because they s they really extend . 
Yeah , 
but now you have your your  like your Star Trek phaser thing shaped control . 
So I I th the edges are really really sharp . 
I'm uh not su 
Or maybe just make it  make it up into into a low  a smooth curve instead of just  less sharp twist on the outside . 
<other> 
I think I think there needs to be a little  
I think it's too too sharp . The edges are too sharp . 
The bottom is fine of course if it's square . 
But maybe just th make uh the top a little  round it off on the sides . 
So  I mean y 
That would be two curves . 
One cur 
you could also make the curve go through of course . 
But that would make make the top round . 
But let's see , 
titanium would give us only one curve . 
So  
but we're not d we're not using titanium . 
Right , we did . 
So  
Just doodle something on the board on the left . 
Well actually , 
we're setting ourselves apart from  by technology alone actually . 
So that  
let's see what you're doing . 
Oh , okay . 
I don't think like that . Not not really the curves on the on the side of the remote . 
Okay , 
now I uh  of course now I understand why they have more uh like um  Why the curves <other> um decrease the the um <other> the size the electronics that can be inside . So  Okay . 
I don't think the outside would be called as a curve really . 
I think it's for all the basic  well , looking from the side anyway . 
Well , 
if you see what  
I have to come up with some designs fast anyway . 
So  
<other> <other> 
Okay . <other> 
Well , 
you shouldn't focus on the  mostly on the covers , 
because lot of things we came up with , 
shouldn't be too  really too much  shouldn't be too focussed on the covers 
because it's kind of an idea of our own , 
but we're not sure if we can actually make that . 
<other> That's the one thing I'm also afraid of with this one 
because it  the edges are really um  they might stick out on the on the side for example . 
If you have a basic design , a little m a little smaller on the on the s on the edges , you could put more covers on it , y one one with square or um sharp corners if you want to . 
So  
M 
just round it off a little , I guess , 
because  so we have more options I suppose . 
I think so 
because it looks leaner 
and we should just go with that . 
Anyway , you have all the time in the world to make to make the final design in a minute with him . 
So  <sharp intake of air> So 
we decided on what 
what did you guys wanna know again 
because this is um  
anyway , 
I'll fire up my thing . 
So  so 
we come to a decision . 
Uh what the  
Ah . 
Yeah . 
Okay , anyway . 
Uh energy , we choose regular regular batteries . 
The chip is advanced 
because we have the advanced features . 
The case , it will be  the material will be rubber , suppose . 
Wouldn't the b the design we talked about . 
Uh user interface , type . 
<other> Well 
I think we took all the components separately what we want . 
Um let's see um 
supplements . I'm not sure what they mean by that . 
Anyway , um 
apparently you guys , you should work together on the final design , both on internal and external design . 
So  Yeah , 
you should you should probably find out how the product will fall into the market , how uh  what's gonna happen with the final design as we have it now . 
So  <other> Yeah , 
of course you've got your specific instruction as usual . 
So  <other> 
Wanna spend some more  
um I think we're in a  pretty much in agreement actually , 
which is good . 
So  
Lef 
let's see , 
where the pen go ? 
Here . 
Yeah uh 
open your thing again . 
Let's see what  if you can come up with anything new . 
Um I'll just do a next one . 
So what would give us your ne your design would be  
the lights would be on top , 
right ? 
Uh one on each one on each side . 
Is it is it the lights for for <other> finding the  finding remote 
or lights that it  that  
<other> 
Yeah , 
I think that should just be a simple LED or something . 
Like  <sound indicating ambivalence> that 
that's not that important of course . 
It just  like a matter of a  <figurative noise>  a beep if you pre that you just know that that there's context . 
So I don't think that's super important . 
But  
Hmm . <other> <tongue clicks> 
Uh sh Oh . 
Let's see , 
I'll just make  
One light here . 
And just make it red now . 
But it could be any colour . 
So  
Okay , whatever . Fine , anyway . 
What do we have here ? 
M I'll make it  
um are we gonna use square buttons or round ones actually ? 
Personally I would prefer round ones . 
Yeah , 
for  
Okay . 
Okay , 
I assume it for  
so we take a r take a round power button right here . 
<whistling> Whatever . 
Uh back to black . 
Uh not too big though . 
See this would be good . 
Um let's see . 
Are these for any extra controls ? 
Okay . 
<other> Okay . <cough> 
If we go for for round buttons in general , do we want to  the menu key in the middle to be round ? For example , 
if you  
let's see , 
put it  this here . 
I think we'll go with the triangles 
that  
Come on . 
Triangles are good . 
Yeah , 
they're a little too big now . 
But <other>  
Anyway , 
okay . So 
do you want for example a round button in the middle or square one ? 
I'm not sure uh , 
I just just came up with it . 
This aligns nicely . 
So  Okay . 
We'll just take the take the round button , suppose . Uh oh the square button , 
sorry . 
<other> 
I suppose so . 
Okay . 
So 
there's our numbers . 
Think we need an extra button here of course for  yeah , like you had for the higher numbers . 
And you could include a button here for the mute , I suppose . For something else , 
just to mirror mirror the effect with this . 
That's not necessary 
because it  
you can take this away , 
but there  it looks like there's a hole there , 
just to mirror the effect . 
Okay , so 
we have a few  
Nah , 
I think it it would be nice to put the logo here , for example , if you have some buttons here . 
We could put a logo here 
because it's very  always in your field of vision . If you're watching it , the L_C_D_ screen , blah blah . 
Well 
we could we could include either here or here , for example . 
But you think here or here ? 
I know . 
No , 
we could put this one as favourite channel for exam 
What are these for ? 
Okay . 
What ? 
You're accustomed to eleven ? 
My uh  
okay , have it your way . 
I mean , think this looks rather like like there's something missing for example . 
I mean why wouldn't you include a  
'cause there is a um a piece of electronics under there anyway . 
So why not give it a function . 
Let's say I mean could be anything . 
But  th 
No , I don't think  
because this is a zero . 
But you want zero to be mis-aligned with the rest . 
Anyway , so 
this is the basic design , we wanna have 
um on and off  
what are we missing ? 
If it looks um  
Okay , 
what I'm gonna draw . 
So  Um 
so we want the remote to be the s the side view actually , 
probably think you want the curve to be here . 
Just gonna be sh 
Yeah . 
Want this straight or what ? 
Let's keep it at this . 
So it would be like this . 
Do we want something interesting with it 
or  
see . 
Would give us a light here . 
Maybe it's boring . 
You want it curved or what ? 
Maybe you want  
Should like this ? 
Will give us design problem 
because we have  <sigh> 
It can be curved . 
Okay ? I think so . 
That's why I asked you . 
Okay . So  
Oh crap . 
Yeah . 
Oh . 
Anyway , so 
you want to  a little more like this ? 
And just s s 
Stop the curve here 
or continue it  
So we have our L_C_D_ screen . 
Let's see . 
In  
Bana 
it's banana vision . 
So you have your L_C_D_ screen right here , suppose . 
<other> Um that would make  
We use the colours now . 
But  Um  
<laugh> 
You got sponsor , now you get a free one with every pack of Chiquita . 
So it would give the buttons here . 
I suppose I suppose we can put 
um  let's see . Um  
Uh I suppose we can put the batteries in here 
because it has the most space , for example . 
I don't think so 
because it's the biggest part of the  uh of the uh  
Let's  
I think it's possible . 
I think it's the best place  
yeah , 
you could also put 'em here . 
But <sound indicating ambivalence>  
Okay , 
so we put the batteries here . <other> 
<figurative noise> That's fine . 
Yep . Blah . 
Um , any other com what 
what are we missing here ? 
Something  
a speech recognition . Um 
where do we want the microphone , for example , to be ? On the side or on the  or , for example , on top ? Like here . 
To be  
Okay , 
I w thought maybe it's either be here or  
because it's mi it might interfere with the transmitter , 
I'm not sure . 
But  
'Cause transmitter would be here . 
Why uh  
once again , like you said , the component can be somewhere at the bottom while we wire the microphone up there . 
Anyway . <figurative noise> 
Um  yeah , 
it could be  either be here 
or make a double microphone . 
I wouldn't mind . 
<other> 
It's able to talk to you . 
A speaker sensor . 
I think so , it  I think it could . 
Yeah . 
I mean it could be a  
all this stuff could be integrated into the L_C_D_ screen , 
which you could navigate with this , I suppose . Navigate through everything . 
If you have  I think you sh I think the advanced options should be  
I think it sh the advanced option could also be integrated in the L_C_D_ screen , of course , 
because you don't have to have a button for everything . 
You can just navigate through th m your menu that you have here for advanced options with this . 
Think that would be fine . 
So that's w m would be making use of the L_C_D_ screen . 
Mm . 
Beep . 
Um , so 
the flashing of the beep , we have well anything . 
We could  <other> 
Yeah , 
but you could put a speaker or something  on on the side for example . 
For  
how do you draw that again ? <laugh> 
Uh whatever , looks stupid . 
I think this is pretty  
<cough> I think you have to stay here 
because we are supposed to  five minutes to finish the meeting . 
Oh , 
like my  
the info that I got was that you're  uh we're gonna work on our own 
because you're gonna do the market market uh analysing   <other> 
I'm supposed to do the little work on the year-end report . So  the project report . 
Hmm . Okay , 
I think we're  
everybody satisfied with the with the current design we have ? 
So we're s supposed to be rubber . 
I think  
well , 
I think the the remote control is gonna be black 
because we we forgot to talk about  I mean the the company colours are important apparently . 
So 
we have the logo up there . 
So are we gonna  
base colour is black ? 
And yeah , 
of course we could use yellow buttons or yellow navigation or whatever . 
Yellow 
but yellow control . It's  
Okay . 
Well , 
don't don't stick yourself on the covers right now . 
But don't stick yourself on the cover 
because  
Nah . 
Yeah , 
but the info . 
I think we should go with uh with the company colour 
because what specific info that I got from the project board . 
So I think we should go with that . 
They want something trendy . 
I think we should  th 
then take it  take yellow . Take what you c yellow remote control . 
So 
let's see if if we can do the LED onto it . 
<figurative noise> 
Uh oh  . 
That's up to you guys . 
You know what ? 
I'm not gonna do this . 
You doodle a  doodle us a nice nice design for for the next meeting , 
we'll be done . 
I think we're all happy now . 
Stupid scroll-wheel . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
'Kay 
I'm not sure uh  I really , I'm no 
I have no clue what we could use the scroll-wheel for . 
It takes space , a lot of space . 
And it could  
I'm not sure 
if it  if it has no function , why even put it there ? 
And th that's just so much things that make it look flash 
I think channel selection would be annoying 
because it just c you could scroll past the channel 
or  
Hmm . 
 . 
No r no scroll-wheel . 
Okay . Um 
I don't see anything missing really . 
<laugh> Yeah , 
we should  
too bad we don't have the finance . 
We could've  
Yeah , 
it's  
I'm not sure if we're if we're gonna get finance anyway 
because I thought we cou I thought it was gonna be an issue at the first time we started . 
I thought it was gonna be a cost issue which material we were gonna take relative to the advanced chips or anything . 
So you just do whatever you like 
and uh doesn't care what it costs . 
I think we're  
rubber is not expensive . Definitely . 
You can make rubber in any colour . In any colour . 
So  
I mean you can't make yellow titanium , 
but you can make yellow rubber . 
Uh yeah 
we can make uh  
for example it's just something you can click on it 
like uh  that's  but it's not som not  
apparently that's not something we're working with in the basic design . 
So  . 
Yeah , it could be . 
It can be done , 
for e
