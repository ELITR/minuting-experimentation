Did you manage ? 
Okay . 
Ah . <laugh> 
Hello . 
No , 
just uh ask if if he could manage . 
I have a lot of new information . 
Hey , 
everything alright . 
Did you manage ? 
Okay . 
Do you have a lot of new information ? 
Do you have a lot of new information ? 
<other> That's true . 
<other> Huh . 
Alright . 
I have a lot of new information . 
I have a complete list of uh everything that we can use , all the components that all av available . 
I have no  
I still don't have any finance information , 
but at least we have a lot more to go on now 
Yep , that's right . 
Let's see where my presentation is . 
Okay , um 
this I mentioned before . 
Every feature for our remote control needs   to have their own operating electronic devices . 
We need to take care of that . 
Then warning , uh there has to be a chip in our remote control . 
And the chip requirements uh needed for a normal button uh is just a simple chip , 
uh scroll-wheel ,  and L_C_D_ is an advanced . 
Of course this is more expensive than this . 
So we have to decide on that in a minute . 
The available uh components for energy are , we have a basic battery , a hand an uh dynamo , like in uh old torches . 
We have a kin uh kinetic provision , then you have to shake the remote control to get the energy . 
And we have solar cells . 
<other> I suggest that we uh decide on that one uh immediately . 
Then I have all lists . 
So  
My personal uh fav favourite is the kinetic provision 
because uh I ha 
I think so , yes . 
Yes . Yes . 
Because I had the information uh you take uh the remote control , you pick it up at least two times a day . 
So then it's already shaken and gives energy . 
 . Or  
Think  
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
<other> 
Other options are solar cells , hand dynamo and basic battery . 
<other> Only basic battery ? 
Okay , 
but I think this is not a r 
<other>  . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
but I think this rules out our unit  our rechargeable unit . 
This is really  a really basic battery , a normal battery . 
Huh ? 
Okay , 
that's uh   . 
Okay ? 
Okay , 
but then we don't offer a re-chargement function . 
That's what it says . 
Exactly . 
Alright . Right . Yep . 
Next one is curving . 
Uh we can make a model that has one curve , two or three . 
And uh  
uh th uh the shape . 
Of course uh the more curves the more expensive . 
Exactly . Yes . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . I think one curve is uh fine . 
More expensive . 
More difficult to make . 
Exactly . 
And I believe even that the r the number of options we have on putting things in it uh goes down with  
exactly . <other> 
Material . I have to offer a plastic , rubber , wood or titanium . 
Uh if we choose plastic , we cannot choose solar cells for energy . 
If we choose titanium , uh we cannot use more than one curve . 
But we don't have that so fast . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
No . 
But I think wood is not an option either . 
Okay . 
Hmm . 
Okay . 
My personal thought was uh rubber 
because I had an email , I believe it was from you , uh f against falling . 
Hmm . 
Okay . Uh  
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Mm . I think we have to decide on this anyway . 
Uh because if we make removeable covers , it has to be one of those mat materials . 
We have no more than this . 
So  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Alright . 
Then I proceed , 
but I need to know after this meeting . 
So  
Interface , uh I have four things to offer , 
pu 
uh normal push-buttons of course . Um uh we have a lot of expertise on that one . We have a large history , our company , on push-buttons . 
Scroll-wheels , uh those can be pushed as well , 
although that is more expensive . 
Um liquid crystal colour display 
and um  
What is this ? 
Okay , 
and if we use rubber , I already mentioned that , we can only use rubber buttons . 
So rubber can only match with rubber . 
Which one of those are we gonna use ? 
Huh . 
No . 
I think the channels . 
Oh . 
Yeah . 
 . 
Huh ? 
Huh . 
Hmm . But  
Huh ? Oh . Ah so 
but it looks cool . 
Mm no . 
Oh . Ah . 
flashy and  
yeah . 
I think would be cool , scroll-wheel . 
It's not that much  
uh if we take a normal scroll-wheel without the pushing , then it's not expensive . 
We can do that . Think . 
Ah we don't need it , 
but it's  uh it's design  a design thing . 
I think they are looking for that . 
Of course we have uh a young target group . 
So they might find that attractive in a remote con 
Okay . 
So push-buttons we will use . 
Uh L_C_D_ screen ? 
Is that s 
Uh I only know that if we are using that , we need ano uh an advanced chip in it . 
And that is more expensive . 
I have no idea . I have no absolute numbers . 
I only have  
Yeah , 
but I don't think room is really an issue . 
<cough> 
Mm-hmm . Okay . 
Electronics , 
uh the first one is the chip . 
Uh that's no longer an option , 
it has to be an advanced one now . 
'Cause we have the L_C_D_ screen . 
Then we have an infrared sender , 
I think that's basic , 
we cannot do without . 
Otherwise it's not s a remote control . 
And we have the sample sensor and speaker , the voice recognition thing . 
Are we gonna do that or not ? 
I only have uh uh relative information . 
Oh 
how did you  
That goes also for the scroll-wheel , by the way . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
But don't we have any w uh information about scroll-wheel ? Scroll-wheel . If people would like that . 
That's strange , 
because that's the same story . 
It's it's not necessary like an L_C_D_ , 
but it's just  it adds something to the design . 
Hmm . 
No 
Oh  that's r 
But I think uh we now already have to uh implement uh an advanced chip . 
So it's m 
No , 
but that's that's okay . 
  
There is still time . 
Yes , 
this was uh the last M_S_ . 
I have a clear picture . 
<other> 
Hmm . 
Hmm , I agree . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
No . Yeah , uh I agree . 
Okay , agreement . 
Mm-hmm . 
That's true . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Oh , that's true . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
But I think , according to my information , this would be two curves . 
We have one left and one right , 
and that disables  what was it again ? 
It's some it's something that we cannot do then . 
<other> 
that's not a problem . 
That's only for the titanium . 
Okay , 
We don't have  . 
<other> Yes 
Then w 
yeah , 
but we don't have that . 
So we have  
We have no  . 
But they uh  
They th 
these wha are what they call the curves . 
This side , this side , this is how they count . 
No no . 
This is what they uh what they mean . 
Okay , that's not really a good  . 
It's like this . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Yep . 
So 
I can uh qui 
oh . 
I can quickly make a conclusion of what we have decided so far . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Me too . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
I would prefer round . 
But doesn't matter , doesn't matter . 
That's not a big deal , think . 
Hmm . Hmm . 
Huh . 
It can be curved . 
Yes . 
I would curve the whole actually . 
I would curve the whole . 
Like um  like it hangs over your hand a little bit . 
Then it will bounce 
and you don't drop it so easily . 
Yeah , something like that , yes . 
Yes , exactly . 
I think continue like that . 
Then there's also enough room for the electronics . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Let's make it yellow then . Uh  
Maybe once we can make a special edition in according with Chiquita . 
Have ourselves sponsored . 
Uh but it's a good trade-off for them if they can have their logo on it . 
Mm-hmm . 
They might wanna be the first ones to uh  
Oh , perhaps they can use it . 
Or give a special edition 
uh with with  
Mm . 
I think this is possible . 
Huh . 
It doesn't matter . 
You can actually uh place a chip for the L_C_D_ screen and  at the bottom , 
and and wire it . 
Doesn't matter . 
I think on top . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
It is , I believe , also able to talk . 
I have a sample uh sample sensor and the speaker sensor . 
Uh the speaker sensor we already have , 
but s I don't know what they exactly mean by a sample sensor . 
Could it talk back ? Like uh g uh give confirmation or something . 
I think it can . 
I think if you have a a speech recognition component , then a s speaking component is not that hard to to put in either . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . But  
Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
We already have a sound component , by the way , for the beep . 
So  
beep . 
Hmm . 
I'm not sure . 
I should be getting new information , I guess . 
Yes . 
But we have 
any company logo . 
We have  
yes , 
but  
and yellow . 
. I would take a yellow remote control . 
I would change 
To have it flashy , 
to have it  
it's for young people . 
Need do be different . 
Hmm . 
<other> But we need to be different . 
Mm-hmm . 
 
Huh . 
It's either black cover with yellow buttons or vice versa . 
And I would say take a yellow cover and black buttons . 
To be different . 
Yeah , 
we have so many colours already . 
So  
I think it's good thing to be different 
than  
Oh no , 
that  
Well  Mm-hmm . 
I still don't have my scroll-wheel though . <laugh> <other> 
Uh that's   <laugh> 
Nah , that's true . 
No , forget it . 
No look , 
it  
No , that's not my point . 
It's not because it's functional , 
but it's just to add to the design , to have it flashy . 
It it has no function , I agree . I agree . 
Oh , 
so many things have no function , just design . 
Mm-hmm . Hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Let's vote on it . 
Then we don't have to talk about it any longer . 
What do you want ? 
In 
or out ? 
Okay . 
You are out of course . 
You are  
okay , clear . 
<other> I have all my answers , yes . 
Hmm . 
There is  
I have one question . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
I only have one question with the material , 
but I don't have information that . 
We've chosen rubber . 
No , 
but can we make yellow rubber ? 
I think so 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
Hmm .
