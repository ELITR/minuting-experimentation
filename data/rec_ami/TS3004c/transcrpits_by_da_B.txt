It's  
It won't wake up . 
Yeah . 
I was a bit early . 
Like  
What ? 
No , 
I just came in . 
Uh normally I was one of them . 
Come on . 
Why won't it wake up ? 
Is it on ? 
But how ? 
Ah , 
there it is . 
Uh . 
Yeah , 
I received an email as well . 
Which one was mine ? 
The minutes . 
No , 
just tell us . 
Yes . 
Hmm . 
Yeah , more . 
Well , 
I'll I'll get back on it . 
Spongy . 
Spongy , like sponge . 
Uh soft materials . 
Yeah , but  Yeah . 
Soft , sponge . 
Yeah , 
but  
Yeah . 
How are you gonna make it ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I'll get back on that . 
Well , 
I got f also an email from 
the the technology department . 
They have done uh research about it , 
and uh even more possibilities now with speech . 
So they recommended using it . 
Well  
I'll check what they exact mean . 
So uh  
Yeah , 
th that's the only problem . 
I d 
They don't say how much it will cost , 
so  Um but uh 
if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well . 
Since you have to uh configure speech thing . 
Yeah , 
that's that's something I dunno . 
Yeah , 
so uh 
we gotta de 
We have to decide on that . 
Mm uh  
L_D_C_ doesn't require  
Okay . 
And speech recognition ? 
Advanced  . Yeah . 
I'll I'll give you my design . 
Yeah okay . 
So 
we  <other> 
Well 
we can  
I had uh to make a sort of a design . 
So I did some searching on the internet . 
I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . 
I think we should um  
This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . 
I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones . 
More modern . Y yes . 
Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 
'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out  both sides . 
And here you just have one , few buttons . 
So that's that's the main difference . 
But looks 
uh I definitely think we should go like this . 
And then changeable fonts , 
so  
It's the most important part , I think . 
But  
And the home base is something like that , something simple . 
Well 
and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . 
Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons . 
Yeah , text button , 
maybe there and there . 
And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . 
I don't find it very usable , 
but it's  
Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well . 
So  
and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . 
They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten . <other> 
And I think  
No no . 
That th there is no display there . 
But it's on the place of the display . 
And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part . 
So the focus is on these two parts . 
So you don't see all the buttons you else need . 
Uh well um  
This is how it is now . Um  
Here uh  Well we have volume . 
Yeah . Well 
here we have also side scrolls . 
I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use  
For volume ? 
Well 
then we can even simplify it more . 
By just putting the volume on the side . 
And and just channel buttons here . 
But I think uh  
Well . Yeah , well 
it's  Basically it's it's here . 
They're on top ? 
You mean uh these to the low ? 
Oh okay . 
Well , 
yeah . 
Mm  Maybe . I dunno , 
but yeah we'll  
Yeah , 
maybe it's not easy if it's below . 
It's harder to zap . 
So I think uh it should be should be easy to  . 
I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top . 
And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh <other> you don't see 'em very good . 
<other> I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . 
So the focus gets on these parts and not on there . 
But uh the position of course can be different . 
It's s 
We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use . 
So we can uh switch these to  
I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half . 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
maybe  <other> 
Those two , yeah . 
And uh , yeah , 
you have to make sure it's easy to uh  
Yes , 
it has to be big enough 
so you can hold it , 
right .  
Well 
that's that's my findings . 
So uh 
my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . 
And uh well um 
if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we  I don't think we should put it on top then . 
I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open . 
To use  
So 
if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . 
Which won't look good on the front side I think . 
So 
that's something we have to decide on . 
Yeah . 
What we're gonna do . 
Okay . 
Yeah well uh 
iPod is trendy . 
And it is well curved  square . 
Okay . 
So not  <other> 
Yeah okay . 
Not uh the old uh box look . 
Mm  <other> Yeah , 
it's  
Black yellow control . <laugh> 
Yeah , but uh <laugh> 
I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . 
But  
Yeah , okay . 
Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So  
Yes . 
So  
Yeah . But with all with logo on it . 
 Yeah . 
Well 
one of the options . 
You can  
Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it . 
So you can just replace them I think . 
That was the idea , 
or just uh release one . 
Yeah , uh  
Or just uh sell different ones . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I uh I dunno . 
A more  
Yeah , 
just uh  
I think uh rubber really has an odd look . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
like mobile phones . 
Like uh the iPod . 
Uh just  
<other> I dunno what uh kind of material it is . 
But  
Oops . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh  
Yeah . 
Or it runs the whole  
Yeah , 
you can halfs transparent , 
or just that it's comes out a bit . 
Different , I think , also . 
Blue or red . 
Whatever you want it , I think . 
Uh depends on the colour of the  
Yeah , that's true . 
But  
Yeah , it can . 
'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well . 
I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone . 
And I can change the colour of it . 
Well , 
we don't put put in any fancier technology yet . So  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I'm sure we can fit in . 
Yeah . 
Yeah okay . 
We just  
Yeah , 
we have to make sure to uh  
Yes . Yes . 
Re recharger . Base station . 
Yeah , batteries . 
Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think's best . 
So 
if you hold it , it gets powered . 
 
Mm . So 
we need uh two D_ . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
 Uh  For channels it's not handy , 
because you scroll too fast . 
Okay . 
Uh I don't think a rubber case looks  
Yeah , okay . 
That  Uh fruit and veg , or  
Yeah , 
fruit and veg can be just the covers . 
So you can  the the spongy  
yeah , 
I dunno . 
I can't imagine a soft remote control . 
I just can't imagine it . 
Yeah , I think . 
Titanium . 
It's mentioned here uh . 
Okay . 
 
Yeah . 
We have batteries . 
Regular . 
Yes . 
User interface concept . 
I dunno either . 
Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board . 
So we're staying here ? 
Okay , 
so 
now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ? 
Yeah , uh 
I dunno . 
But the iPod and etcetera , M_P_ three players , mobile phones . 
Just a bit 
cur 
Okay , 
I'll see if I can see any of those . 
Yeah , 
you   
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
that's a little problem , of course , as well . 
Yeah , 
maybe you just have to make it uh  That's not scrollable too easy . 
Uh wh what is the middle part ? 
Numbers , okay . 
Yeah , I agree as well . 
Use the dz 
Yeah , that's right . 
Yeah , 
I think uh zapping is the highest priority . 
And then you use those uh  
Yeah , of course uh . 
Yeah . 
I I think it's  
It's it's obvious , I think . 
Yeah , 
I think  
No , 
uh I think  
Yeah . 
I think it's s so simple 
you just  
Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it . 
Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ? 
No , 
you have uh  It is  
Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic . 
You have to look at that image of the iPod . 
More that uh kind of style . 
Not not the old grey black  
Where you can put a ve Uh we have  
If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo . 
 
Maybe you can buy separate ones 
and uh  
Yeah . Um 
I think  
Yeah . 
That's your choice , I think huh . 
Yes . 
Yeah , I think so . 
But th Yeah , that can be very simple . Least . 
Yeah , 
just where you're around something . 
Li 
Yeah , 
we had one example . 
Mm . Mm . 
Which w 
Here you see one that's very round . 
So 
I think that can be all kind of shapes . 
Yeah , so 
y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod  . 
But  
More rounded . 
Yeah , 
I think it will just look like more like this one . 
Since it's  
This is also rounded . 
I think i 
Yeah okay , 
tho those are al already a bit cornered . Mm   
Yeah okay , 
but then we have to think of something totally new . 
I've uh  I had a lot of picture of old ones . 
And all curves have already been done . 
Yeah okay , yeah well  
Yeah . I know we can do a lot more , 
but  
 I think it will only look more like the old remote controls . 
Yeah . 
Yeah okay . 
But uh I had a lot of pictures  
Oh I can show you here <other> what the old ones look like . 
Curves , curves . 
You've more  there as well . 
It wasn't very small one . 
 very simple . 
That is for elderly . 
I think if w My opinion . If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look . 
So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours . 
And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new . 
No rubber buttons or something . 
Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player . 
Yes . Just a simple scrollb 
Doesn't have to be . 
Yeah . No . Spongy 
and  
Mm . 
Yeah ,  idea . 
But <other> you're  
If you look at the way remote controls are now  
And if you make it look like the iPod  
Yeah okay . 
So 
that's already a very big change 
compared to  
Ye yeah . Well uh  
Could . 
No , 
I think  Oh . 
Think the scroll wheel <other> won't be very big . 
Since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big . 
So it will just be a small 
small scroll wheel . 
So it won't uh stick out much . 
Yeah okay . Well , 
maybe we can just open images there , 
and I'll paint and paint . 
I'll be able to do a better job . 
Bu 
Yeah , I agree more like iPod  . 
Yes . 
Just a  
Speech . 
Yeah , 
do we s keep that ? 
Yeah , I think  
Well uh 
then it w <other> 
Well 
that's very easy . 
We already have uh the beeping of the  home station , 
so  
Uh strange that I received <laugh> the information about that . 
So 
shall we  it open then ? 
So we can put all the  
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Oh yeah , 
I  
No . 
I just I just received the  
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . 
This is a very small electronic unit , 
will give a standard answer after it recognise a question . 
Doesn't say . 
Just  You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample . 
Because 
uh  So 
it works like uh good morning remote control , 
and then the remote control says good morning . 
Yeah uh 
th that's just  It's a  
No . 
Yeah , 
it  
Well 
that's integrated in the chip , 
so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it . 
I dunno , 
but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well . 
Well 
it it would be would be a good feature feature . 
Okay . 
No no worries about the cost , etcetera . 
And there's a chip in it that will  
Okay .
