D:  Bonjour . 
B:  It's  It won't wake up . Yeah . I was a bit early . Like  
D:  Why ? 
B:  What ? No , I just came in . Uh normally I was one of them . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  Come on . 
D:  Check check check check . 
A:  Hello . Oop . 
B:  Why won't it wake up ? Is it on ? 
D:  The power light doesn't work . You turned it off . 
B:  But how ? Ah , there it is . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Uh . 
C:  I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials . So I'll discuss them with you . Yeah . 
A:  Okay , we're just going to the  later . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah , I received an email as well . 


A:  So we're going to talk about the conceptual model . 
D:  <other> Oh . 
A:   
D:  Hmm . 
B:  Which one was mine ? 
A:  So that's me . Uh okay . So  Uh okay . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay , so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes , minute .  What's it called , I dunno . Whatever . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  The minutes . 
A:  Okay , so we just talked about uh  Oh you want me to show that there or  
D:  Uh  
B:  No , just tell us . 
C:  Mm no . 
A:  Okay , we just talked about it looks . Has to look nice . Usability is very important . People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . Um  It has to be very basic , not too many buttons . Light switches on if you use a button . Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility . And it has to be easy to learn . That were the things I uh make minutes of . And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text T_V_ button . That are the functions . That right ? 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yes . 
A:  Okay . 


A:  So I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh presentation of your  
D:  Shall I start ? 
A:  Yeah . 
D:   <singing> No . Okay well  I received an email  Okay . I searched the web , uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe , I forget it . 
A:  But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea , because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . So it has to be <laugh> flexible . 
B:  Yeah , but  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there . But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . So spongy means y Yeah . 
C:  It's like a sponge . 
B:  Soft , sponge . 
D:  So it's also a stress-ball . 
A:  That's a good  That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea . Is it a bit like like the the the the  remote control ? 
C:  Yeah , somewhat like  
B:  Yeah , but  Yeah . How are you gonna make it ? 
A:  R_ soft . 
D:  Uh  
C:  Yeah , I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Okay ? 
A:  <cough> 
D:  What do I think ? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . Because it's uh it's hot . And uh some basic uh colour fronts . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge . <other> Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has . Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh  Yeah , I dun dunno . We have to discuss about that . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh y yeah . Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget . 
B:  Yeah , I'll get back on that . 
D:  So  
C:  Hmm . 


B:  So we  <other> Well we can  I had uh to make a sort of a design . So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . 


C:  Okay , the component design . I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . 




A:  We have to stop now . Okay , just  We have to stop it now . 
B:  no worries about the cost , etcetera . And there's a chip in it that will  Okay . 
D:  Fine .
