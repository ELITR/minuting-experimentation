Bonjour . 
Why ? 
Okay . 
Check check check check . 
The power light doesn't work . 
You turned it off . 
Okay . 
<other> Oh . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
Uh  
Shall I start ? 
 <singing> 
No . 
Okay well  
I received an email  
Okay . 
I searched the web , 
uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . 
It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe , 
I forget it . 
Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . 
So it's very important for us to create something new . 
So 
what Michael just said , 
it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . 
Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . 
Uh this uh aspect is the most important one . 
Uh it came out of the research . 
It uh is twice important as the following . <other> 
The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative . 
Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . 
And then uh that uh  This is a point of discussion , 
because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition . 
But um <other> this is the second uh important uh aspect , 
and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative . 
<other> Uh maybe maybe something new . 
We have to discuss about it 
s 
uh  Okay , uh  
features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . 
And that's very hard I think . 
Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . 
But uh that was an overall uh point . 
We already discussed that . 
Um I've got one picture . 
Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy . 
So I took uh that part of the webpage . 
And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari <other> uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . 
This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . 
But it's about uh clothes and shoes . 
But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy . 
But spongy , what what does spongy says ? 
Spongy . 
Okay . <laugh> 
Yeah . Yeah , 
it's something that uh it stand there . 
But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . 
So spongy means 
y Yeah . 
So 
it's also a stress-ball . 
Uh  
Okay ? 
What do I think ? 
Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , 
I think about changeable fronts . 
Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . 
Because it's uh it's hot . 
And uh some basic uh colour fronts . 
<other> Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . 
Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge . <other> 
Uh or uh , yeah , 
just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has . 
Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh  
Yeah , 
I dun dunno . 
We have to discuss about that . 
Uh y yeah . 
Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . 
Yeah , 
how do we do that ? 
Maybe speech ? 
We ma must have some kind of gadget . 
So  
Intro 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
that's the problem . That's the main problem . 
So  
Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations . 
Okay . 
Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then . 
 
Oh . 
It's mass production . 
So you can say , you can   
Yeah . 
But how 
uh we we're gonna make many of those . 
So we can start a mass production , 
and then the cost will still will be  . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
That was this ? 
No , I don't uh  I don't like it . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Square . Like . 
Mm . 
Oh yeah . 
<other> Uh uh  
Yeah . 
The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the <other> uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself . 
It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape . 
Uh it's n doesn't  Is <other> uh a button uh um  <other> 
How do you say it ? 
It it didn't it i 
it don't come out of the <other> on the background . 
It is in uh the c a remote control uh  
Yeah . 
<other> 
 Yeah . 
Uh i  <other> 
Yeah , 
but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ? 
You  
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
 
Okay yeah , 
you can you can change  
Yeah . No . 
Ah 
cool . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Mm  
Uh but we have to do something about the trend . 
The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh . 
And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two . 
Uh yeah i Just  Just on front . 
Neith uh I don't like it uh neither . 
Yeah , 
that's not not  It's not al uh always the same . 
Every remote control's uh different . 
Yeah , 
we have to care that it r uh looks really new . 
Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control . 
'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside . 
Yes . Okay . 
And a bit uh  
Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have  
Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? 
Uh five or something ? 
Or more 
or  
And um uh <other> 
uh buy the product . You buy , you get one . And uh basic . 
Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project . 
Yeah , 
you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station . 
Yeah . <other> 
Yeah , 
we can b 
It c it could be just just a square , just a packet . 
Yeah , 
but that's a round one . 
Maybe we can choose then . 
Yeah . 
 
Yeah . 
What do we do wrong ? 
Hmm . Just just more like this and not uh a square . 
Okay . 
Yeah , it  
Uh it's very annoying . 
Okay . 
Uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> Uh the t the trend is 
spongy and fruity . 
But yeah . 
It's not not a lot of trends I uh I found uh  
Uh  
It  The th th 
Yeah . 
There is one  
There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , 
and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself . 
It must have uh uh uh a very different  
Yeah , they're all the same . 
Uh yeah , 
but uh if you the f uh front , the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow . 
No . 
If you set the pen yeah , he will draw here . 
Doesn't work . 
Yeah , I'll see it . 
Uh  
No . 
Oh 
that's hard . 
But  
Uh the ma the main points I I I uh just said . We have to be original and uh technological innovative . 
Becau 
Yeah . 
But  
<other> Ma 
But we don't have any f information about the cost . 
We started with information about the cost was now th 
And how much is the chip ? 
The the the  
And how how does it work ? 
Is it  
No . 
Does it say does it say something back ? 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Um  
Yeah . 
Fine .
