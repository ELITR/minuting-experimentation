Okay . 
I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials . 
So I'll discuss them with you . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Mm no . 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
Spongy . 
So rubber , kind of . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
It's like a sponge . 
Yeah , 
somewhat like  
Yeah , 
I've some uh material uh information , 
but I'll give you it later in my presentation . 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Yeah , well 
actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . 
But maybe it's cheap 
and it's easy to implement . 
Oh 
I got an email uh  
And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced . 
And  Um  
They say uh a display requires an advanced chip . 
And this is more expensive than all the other chips . 
So 
it's m the most expensive . 
Yeah , 
it says in the email . 
The display requires an advanced chip . 
Yeah , probably too . 
I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , 
but  
Well 
it d 
That's that's the most expensive chip , we need . If we're doing uh if we're doing a display . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
But it  
That's on on the display . 
I think it is on uh on the bottom too . 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah , 
I've I've got something of that uh too . 
Scroll . 
Yeah , 
or uh maybe uh  
The channel buttons are often used . 
And you can't use them now with your thumb , 
because the thing is not , it's not easy to control . 
Yeah okay , 
m maybe we cho should put that on top , 
and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom . 
Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons . 
But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . 
So maybe we can put that on the bottom . 
Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time . 
Yeah okay . 
That's that's good , 
but  
Yeah okay . 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
No , 
I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top . 
But uh we we can switch those two , 
yeah . 
Yeah . 
No . 
Yeah , 
we have to keep it simple . 
Okay , 
the component design . 
I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . 
So uh 
this was on the web site . 
If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours . 
Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not  Nothing square-like . 
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think . 
So 
we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing . 
Yeah . 
And um sports and gaming device style characteristics . 
I don't know exactly what that means , 
but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of 
looking , I think . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , mm 
n Not that weird , 
because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public . 
No , okay . 
That's a that's a sen 
That's just a matter of tastes , 
but  
We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think . 
Yeah . 
Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue 
and  
Okay . 
Well 
this is a remote control , a very old one . 
Um  <other> Then the components . 
The case has just a  Here's black . 
Yeah , I dunno . 
Maybe . 
But anyways uh it should be transparent . 
We decided that , 
huh ? 
S 
Okay . 
Yeah , we could do that . 
Yeah , 
but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent . 
So you can still th look through it . 
Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft . 
With the hard hard buttons . 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
it's it's all on one level . 
Yeah , 
on one level . 
Yeah , 
I know what you mean . 
So 
we have to keep it on the one level . 
Like th the top it's  
Yeah . 
Yeah , okay . 
Okay , 
it's chos 
So that should be hard plastic . 
Then the buttons ? 
I think . Or maybe  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
And um  <other> Then the L_E_D_ . <other> 
The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient . 
And back light L_E_D_s . 
So  
But I think we have to make the case transparent , 
otherwise the back light won't work . 
So if you put  
Okay . 
Yeah , 
but we can still make it transparent . 
So  
Or no 
Yeah okay . 
Good . 
And in green colour , the back lights 
or  
Yeah ? 
<laugh> 
No , 
but I think there are multiple colour LEDs . 
So  
I I know  I dunno . Is <other>  
Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive . 
I think it's  
Yeah , 
I dunno . 
Maybe it's too expensive , 
but it  I th I don't think so . 
Then uh some more technical things . 
I don't know what it is , 
but it should be there <laugh> I think . 
Um this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things . 
W <other> 
So we d we just need this and <laugh> this transistors and resonators . There's all these kind of things . 
Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls . 
So I guess we j we just need that . 
I don't know what they do 
or  
Nah , 
but they just said we need it . 
Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in . 
Yeah okay . 
Yeah 
but  
Yeah , 
but it i We don't wanna have a ar an  
How do you call it ? Accu . 
Y 
uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries . 
Okay . 
Not a separate  
Okay . 
And uh a chip , that's this one . 
Then uh I received some possibilities . 
Um for the energy source we can use batteries 
or a kinetic uh  Like with the pulse watch . 
So 
it operates on your wrist kinda . 
If you hold it . 
Yeah , 
I don't think it will work , 
and  
Or we can also use solar cells . 
But you mostly use it indoors , 
so  
Yeah , 
and and we can use the home station kind of thing . 
Um cases , 
flat , so uncurved . 
Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . 
And three D_ curved is also in depth . 
So 
that's possible . 
Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons . 
So we can't use the flat buttons . 
Yeah , I think . 
Um these kinda materials can be used . 
Yeah , I think so too . 
Yeah , 
scroll wheels um  
Yeah , that's good . 
We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to . 
But I think just the volume is enough . 
And uh the L_C_D_ . 
So 
we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ . 
Okay , 
then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . So th so the regular chip . 
Because we use scroll wheels . 
And um  Yeah , 
that was it I guess . 
Uh are are we using a a rubber case , 
or  
We haven't decided yet . 
L 
Yeah , 
i it it should be soft . 
You said so ? 
<laugh> So 
just hard plastic ? 
Okay . 
Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive . 
Yeah , 
you can make it curved or mm round . 
But just in two D_ , not in depth . 
Yeah . 
Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one . 
You have the simple one , regular and advanced . 
So it's b should be regular uh the second . 
I think I'll just check it . 
Yeah . 
Mm . Or should we do it in the next meeting ? 
So we should did it here ? 
Or should we do it in the next meeting ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> What ? 
Oh . Okay . 
Like a very big scroll-wheel . <other> 
Okay . 
Hmm . 
I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted . 
Yeah . 
I think it's probably better . 
Yeah , 
but maybe we can make a a plastic , 
so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . Only if you use your finger . 
I think in middle . 
Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle . 
Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below . 
Yeah , okay . 
Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , 
so  
Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up  
Yeah , 
but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , 
and down button is  <other> If you put them  
But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing . 
In uh  On most on most remote controls . 
So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time . 
I dunno . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
but i i it should be round in in shape . 
So  
<laugh> 
No , 
tha that will be  
Yeah , 
so top down . 
Hmm ? 
Do we have to design that w as well ? 
The docking station ? 
Hmm . 
Yeah , 
just a recharger . 
But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well . 
Oh yeah , okay . 
Of the remote control ? 
Yeah  
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
but we can we can do all kinds of uh  
As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes . 
Not in depth . 
Yeah , but <other>  Yeah , if if we want to make it kind of , yeah , new . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
but we could do a lot of , lot more curving . 
I would do it  
Like in this kind of shape 
or  
I dunno . I dunno if it's handy . 
This ? 
The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I don't know . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah , 
though that's a trend . If we want to make it . 
But yeah , 
I'm not a Trendwatcher , 
you are . <laugh> 
So  
<other> <laugh> 
Spongeball kinda . 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff . 
Yeah , 
but we're we're aiming at a young public . 
Hmm . 
Yeah , we could do that . 
Yeah . 
S <other> 
Uh yeah , 
I don't know . 
Yeah , I think so . 
And we we have to build in a microphone 
and  
Yeah , 
and I do I don't know anything about that . 
I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition , 
so  
Fine . 
Yeah , we probably do . 
No . 
Yeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost . But just a about the chip . 
I don't know how much , 
but  
Just in inexpensive or  
But i it's a separate chip . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
I don't know anything about this , 
but  Nah . 
I dunno . <laugh> 
<laugh>
