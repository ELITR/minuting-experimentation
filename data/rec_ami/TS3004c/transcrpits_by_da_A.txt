Hello . 
Oop . 
Okay . 
Okay , 
we're just going to the  later . 
So 
we're going to talk about the conceptual model . 
 
So 
that's me . 
Uh okay . So  Uh okay . 
Okay , so 
I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes , minute .  
What's it called , 
I dunno . 
Whatever . 
Okay , so 
we just talked about uh  
Oh you want me to show that there 
or  
Okay , 
we just talked about it looks . 
Has to look nice . 
Usability is very important . 
People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . Um  
It has to be very basic , 
not too many buttons . 
Light switches on if you use a button . 
Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility . 
And it has to be easy to learn . 
That were the things I uh make minutes of . 
And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text T_V_ button . That are the functions . 
That right ? 
Okay . 
So 
I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh presentation 
of your  
Yeah . 
But we already have the flashing flashing light 
on the  
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea , 
because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . 
So it has to be <laugh> flexible . 
That's a good  That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea . 
Is it a bit like like the the the the  remote control ? 
R_ soft . 
Okay . 
<cough> 
Yeah . 
<other> It's very uh difficult to to to do it . 
Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control . 
Okay . 
But that's definitely more expensive 
than  <laugh> 
Yeah , 
but a telephone   
Okay , yeah . 
But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros . 
So uh  
Yeah , 
just modern modern but still uh basic . 
Yeah , 
maybe the teletext tel 
No . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<cough> But it sounds very difficult to use . 
Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it . 
So you can't use your thumb for it . 
Yeah , 
down there . 
But it's not not the best best . 
Yeah , 
for volume . For volume , or a channel . 
Yeah , why not . 
And the channels as well . 
Oh 
yeah . 
Yeah , that's better . 
Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom . 
Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
Except from the on-off button . 
Yeah . Yeah , that's cool . 
Okay . 
We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look . 
Okay , so  
Hmm , okay . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the <laugh> remote control . 
So 
the colours also . 
So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow . 
Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black . 
We make i 
Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , it's cool . Yep . 
And still trans 
Still still transparent . 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
we make it som 
Maybe we have to make it from soft material . 
Uh I'm not sure . 
Yeah . 
Just give five with them , just in a box . <laugh> Five different  
Yeah . Cool . 
Yeah . 
It it could be like a Nokia , like  plastic . 
That's better prob 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that's cool . 
But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material . 
Just only the basic uh 
basic remote control from normal plastic , 
and 
the rounds of it from softer s 
I dunno . 
Y 
Cool . 
Yeah . 
Y i if you  The numbers could be can be  
Yeah , that's right . 
They can choose . 
Blue . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it . 
You have to choose  
Is it  
Okay . 
Yeah , okay . 
Maybe put some different ones in it . 
Doesn't matter . 
It's just  No , just some LED . 
Okay , cool . 
Just make it some different colours . Blue , red and green , or something . 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
we have to hurry up a bit , 
so  <laugh> 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
a recharger maybe . 
We still want to have a recharger , don't we ? 
Is that still the  
A recha 
Oh no . 
Uh  Battery . It's just a battery . Yeah . 
No , 
just rechargeable batteries . 
 
But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch . 
It's dark in the room . 
No . 
It's just batteries , 
that's cheaper  . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Definitely . 
But it doesn't really matter , 
we just make it plastic . 
The scroll wheels , that's cool . 
That's for the volume . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
I don't think that's an opportunity . 
Just skip it . 
Because we don't have time for that to to put it in . 
Yeah , okay . 
Okay . 
Oh 
just sk 
Maybe you have to skip that one as well . 
It's  
No . 
No .  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
But maybe the form has to be a bit different . 
Not the sh the square form . 
Just a bit 
more rounded . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that's right . 
So  
We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . What exactly . 
Because we have to know it . 
So the energy uh is the recharger . 
We already know that . 
Just a normal battery . 
Okay . 
The chip-on-print is a normal one . 
Okay , 
the case is just a plastic one . 
Yeah , re Yeah , regular . Yeah , okay . Yeah , regular . 
Okay . 
And we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel .  
That's pretty much it . 
And a flashy light . 
So uh 
I'm not sure . 
But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment . 
But  
Yeah . 
That's for the next one . 
That's for th 
Uh that  I think that's the next next meeting . 
But you definitely get a specific instruction . <laugh> 
But th think about something that's more rounded . 
Just  And more  
It has to be  
Uh a bit . Just just on the top or on the bottom . 
Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this . 
O um if you draw it like this , you get a  
What the fuck is it ? <laugh> 
Okay . Mm  
Doesn't work . <laugh> 
You see what I mean ? 
If I draw here  <laugh> 
It draws about four centimetres lower 
than  <laugh> 
Nah okay . 
Just  . 
Maybe you can make it like this . 
And this is all the wheel for volume . 
So that you just um  
It's all rounded , 
so you can do uh turn this one . 
Yeah , 
but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it . 
Maybe , I dunno . 
Okay , so 
we <other> have this at the moment . 
Okay , so 
we'd have this . 
Is that okay ? 
And  
Like this . 
And uh what's the channel choose ? Where do we uh put that ? 
Still on the bottom 
or  
That's the numbers . 
It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . 
Because you already have the volume here , 
so  
You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . Next to each other .  back and forth . 
So you can also can put it all on the top , 
and this , you keep this empty . 
Because you have to hold it as well . 
But that's not  
want to zap very quick , 
so  
Yeah ? Is this a opportunity , 
or you don't want a different  
Why ? 
But still the next  It's still the next one . 
Doesn't make  
Yeah , 
but fo from left to right is exactly the same . 
It ma it doesn't make a big difference . 
But it's exactly th 
I dunno . 
I  
You already have the volume on the side , 
so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake . 
So it's uh  
So 
but that's for that's for you , 
'cause it's  
Okay , so hmm . 
What did  What else we have to discuss about ? 
I dunno . 
Yeah . 
And the LED . 
Uh  Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh the logo was has to be on there . 
Yeah , that's right . 
Yeah , five . Let's give five . 
So 
y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? 
Is that is that a good good opportunity ? 
So 
you could put it like that , 
okay . 
Uh I'm not sure . 
But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . 
That's all . 
Yeah . 
Just round it up  . 
No . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
No , 
just just the corners . 
Okay . 
Shapes . 
<laugh> 
It's a bit annoying , 
isn't it ? 
<laugh> 
So 
we have to make a decision , 
what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have . 
And you have the scroll button inside . 
 Okay . 
But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? 
Of  
Skip that one as well . 
Okay . Yeah , it's cool . 
Rubber spongy . 
Okay , so 
we have s still one minute left . 
So just  
I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square . 
No . 
But I I think it's still for older people . 
You j still have older people . 
It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that , 
like f 
Whatever . 
Just you have a normal  
But i it is it is it is already fancy . Because of the lights on the bottom of it . That's already fancy . 
Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the <other> wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction . 
Yeah . 
It's right . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Maybe the ones we are going to draw there . 
Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has <laugh> if it can work better than this . 
Because it doesn't work properly . 
So maybe you have to ask her . 
Okay . Yeah . 
That's probably  
<laugh> Okay , so 
just finish it . 
So we make it a bit like m that one probably . 
Yeah . 
Is that okay ? 
Okay , 
only the colour and the flashy light 
and the  
We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition . 
Or keep that ? 
It's okay . 
But you'd definitely need a 
advanced chip . 
So  
Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well , 
okay ? 
Yeah . 
The function of that in there . 
Yeah . 
And we need a  
Probably we need a uh advanced chip then . 
But it doesn't say anything about it , 
does it ? 
It doesn't has to say anything . 
Just  You have to just talk to  
Okay , 
we have to stop it now . 
So just  
Okay , 
that's a r That's that's a advanced  
Yeah , 
we just decide not to put it in , 
because it's too difficult . 
Okay , we just put it in , 
because it's a good feature . 
We have to stop now . 
Okay , 
just  
We have to stop it now .
