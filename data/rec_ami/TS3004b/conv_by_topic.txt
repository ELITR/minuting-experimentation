A:  No , that's  I uh s I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only . So have you changed that part ? Um so  yeah , it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . It's it's still the same . Um  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Okay . 
D:  Okay . <laugh> 
A:  All these points uh we have to look at . You all know them . But uh there's another point . The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . So they're old and not younger people . So we have to look at that as well . 'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , I dunno . 
B:  Yeah , okay . 
A:  Uh so  


A:  So  yeah , that's it , so just you can do your presentation for uh  
B:  Which one first ? 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Oh it doesn't matter , just start with the  
B:  Okay . 
D:  Mm . Uh  
B:  Functional requirements , yeah . 
D:  Okay . Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it . Wait . Um I've used a marketing report on uh the site . Uh I think you've uh read it too . Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site . 
A:  I I didn't read i read it , so it's not for me , I didn't get it uh anyway . It's only for you . 
D:  You didn't read it ? 
B:  No , I didn don't thing we got it . Yes . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh okay , I I was the only one who get it . 
D:  Okay , this was uh my presentation . 
A:  Thanks . 
C:  Okay . 
D:  I don't  Yeah . You can ask some questions or something . 


A:  So Paul , you can do the next one if you want . 
B:  Okay . Yeah well  Uh . 
A:  It's on the on the uh net net uh thing , isn't it ? 
B:  There it is . Okay . Technical functions design . 
A:  Okay ,  we hurry up a bit , because otherwise we won't make it . Is it fin Are you finished ? Okay . 
B:  Okay , sorry . Well uh  Yeah , I I'm finished . I think we discussed everything . 


C:  Okay . Well , the working design . The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . 
A:  Yeah , I just want to talk some  about some more . So maybe you have to  Yeah ? Okay . 
C:  Yeah ? Okay . 


A:  So this  Oh , sorry . Wh what's that ? So uh  Oh , sorry . We have some new uh project requirements . We have to have a look what they are . They're still in um  Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . I'm not sure . I don't think so , but  
C:  No , and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use . 
D:  No . 
A:  Yeah , and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . It's only one button . So I don't think it is  We definitely should use it . Um  
D:  Uh . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Hmm . 
A:  Yeah , that's uh what I told you . The remote control should only be used for a television . So that's maybe easier . And um the the forty plus people , I already told you . Oh no , sorry . Oh , this is a problem . Oh sorry about that . The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . So it should be flashy or just more interesting . I'm sorry about that . I just I just didn't read it well . 
D:  <laugh> Okay . 
C:  Oh . Mm . 
B:  Okay , that's  It changes things . 
D:  <tongue clicking> 


A:  So does it make some decision about that ? <laugh> 
D:  Changes . 
B:  <cough> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . That kinda changes the whole situation . 
B:  Um  
D:  Uh  
B:  Well yeah , then we have to make some nice features . I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way , to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern . 
A:  That still stays . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  That's important I think and  
D:  L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think . 
B:  And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it . 
D:  Oh . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm ah  I I don't y you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you  
B:  So  
D:  Oh , I'm watching uh the channel one . Okay . <laugh> No , it's not  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable . So , but uh  Yeah . What other features can we put in ? 
C:  No . Yeah . I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . And uh then the usability is not that required , because the  Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think . 
D:  But uh some of you had uh something to read about um <other> uh speech uh recognition . About you said one and the television turns on one . Is that reachable maybe ? That's very  That's fancy . That's cool . Twelve and you've got twelve . 
C:  I didn't read  
B:  It's very fashion . 
C:  I didn't read any b Yeah . Yeah okay . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Only the numbers , only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing . But only the numbers , one to twenty or something . That should be cool . 
C:  I I know . Mm . 
A:  Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well . If it's possible . But  
D:  If it's possible , I dunno . I didn't read it . 
C:  Yeah , I don't know . 
A:  I don't think it's very expensive actually . Why should it ? You only have a microphone in it . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Uh if i if i I didn't have information about that . 
B:  Yeah , I think it's  
C:  Yeah . But it has to work . And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or  
A:  Nah , maybe  
D:  Ah that's a problem , but  
C:  And and uh w Yeah ? 
D:  Uh only in English . Only in English I think . 
B:  What  But uh I dunno how that works then . Uh does your uh  Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever 
C:  Yeah , it's probably my job to figure that out , but  
D:  No , that  
B:  uh one to have in channel one ? 
D:  Yeah , then th we have to think about that . But do <laugh> do we do it ? It's more if we if we do it . 
B:  Yeah , I dunno . So , is it very usable ? That's what I'm looking at . 
C:  And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing or  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Is  
A:  Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that . It  We have short time to to put it on the market , so that  
C:  Yeah , I dunno . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that . 
B:  Mm  Yeah well  <other> 
C:  Yeah , I think so .  
A:  We make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy .  
D:  Yeah , and uh and uh  
B:  It's  
D:  In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . Uh because we we have a lot of languages . 
B:  I d Yeah . I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  And and  Yeah , and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . I think so . 
D:  Yeah . A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns uh to one . Yeah , it's not uh  
C:  the remote away . Mm . Hmm . Mm . Yeah , okay . 
B:  Yeah . Well yeah , that's the right command . And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one , or something . Not just one , but  
C:  But  Hmm yeah , T_V_ one . 
D:  Okay , but th that becomes your f Uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition . 
B:  Well I dunno . But I don't think , it just ain't useful enough . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  So we have to make some decisions . So you can see on the uh  So we have to know what we're going to put on . Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? Do  If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , okay ? 
D:  Okay , no speech recognition . 
B:  Yeah , I think so . 
C:  Yeah , that's good . 
B:  Yep . 
A:  Okay , we just take that one . And what else , we have  
B:  Also the one in the dark . So uh  It lights up when it's dark ? I didn't  
A:  Yeah , but it's  Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same . If you push something , it it all lights up . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah yeah , it it mustn't work all the time . It uh uh it have to work only when you use it . So if you  No , if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off . 
B:  Yeah , but um  Yes , that's what I mean . 
A:  Or you can switch it on or something . 
B:  Or maybe when you  yeah . It lights up all . 
A:  Yeah , that's right . You have to  Yeah , that's right . That's what I said . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah . 
B:  Okay yeah . D Yeah , alright . Yeah . 
A:  And do we use a a  Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac ,  if you can look through it . Or just a normal remote control . 
B:  Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod . Different colours , uh maybe use even different fonts . 
C:  Mm , maybe it's a good idea . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh yeah . 
B:  Like uh phones . 
A:  Different colours . Okay , so y you just make it th through  You look through it ? Okay . 
C:  Hmm . 
D:  A see-through . Mm , that's cool . 
B:  Yeah . Uh as an option maybe . 
A:  And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal . We put in the the simple buttons on the top , and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there . 
B:  It's the standard  Yeah , uh  
D:  But you have  You had a lot of different buttons . 
B:  Yeah , we but we don't  We don't really have any complicated buttons . 
C:  Hmm . 
A:  Yeah , maybe you have you have to  Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one . 
B:  Yeah okay , but  Yeah , well w I think the buttons are very easy . With just uh standard buttons we just have so little  
A:  O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . Because you ne almost never use it . 
B:  No , I don't need don't need  Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something . 
C:  Yeah , but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext . So uh  
A:  Yeah , that's right . 
B:  I use teletext as well . 
D:  No , I use te teletext every day , I think . 
C:  Hmm . Okay . 
A:  Yeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Okay . 
B:  Yeah yeah , one level . And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons , I think the design is most important . You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  'Cause  simple buttons . If you put one above it , it's clear . 
A:  Okay . Okay . 


A:  So that's it for toda for  We're going to have a lunch lunch break . Um  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  How long is lunch break ? 
A:  So yeah , you know what you have to do . This is uh this is it . You get your meal and everything , so  
D:  Trendwatching . Okay . That's fine . 
A:  Yeah .
