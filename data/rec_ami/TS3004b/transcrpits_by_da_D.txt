<laugh> Okay . 
Fine . 
The names ? 
For for for my sur um 
Jens . 
Uh Damman . D_ A_ W_ . 
Uh uh M_ M_ . I mean M_ . Double M_ . 
Oh . <laugh> 
Sorry . 
<laugh> 
Okay . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Mm . Uh  
Okay . Well 
my name is Jens Damman , 
but we're in a group , 
and I I will start it . 
Wait . Um 
I've used a marketing report on uh the site . 
Uh I think you've uh read it too . 
Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site . 
You didn't read it ? 
Oh okay , 
I I was the only one who get it . 
Okay 
it was uh uh uh um um <other> a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users . 
And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof . 
So 
I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . 
So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . 
Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly . 
Yeah , 
I think uh uh that's a lot , 
so we have to make a beautiful remote control . 
Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . 
I think this fits uh at the <other> uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . 
Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . 
Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . 
Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . 
Well 
okay , that's uh normal . 
I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . 
But that's one of our requirements . 
Yes , 
fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . 
Um Martijn alr already said it . 
And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , 
but  
I don't think it's uh 
reachable . 
Yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah . 
That that's a good one . 
Um uh page two . 
Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . 
That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something . 
Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , 
so when you <claps twice> clap your hands it will beep or something . 
Uh you must find it uh quickly . 
Okay , yeah . Yeah , 
we can uh combine that . 
Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . 
Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this . 
It's only uh th thirty four of the <other> thirty four percent . 
But it's uh a tough one . 
Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think . 
Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . 
Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something . 
I don't  We we haven't  
Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point . 
Okay , 
last page . 
Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . 
We didn't uh think about that already . 
And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control . 
We already thought about that . 
Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . 
And 
but they're more critical . 
And older people uh want to spend uh more money . 
<other> But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , 
because they're in their old uh thinking way . 
And they want to keep the old uh things the old things .  
But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ? 
I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly , 
because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros . 
Um then  
I have my personal uh preference . 
Okay , 
that's <laugh> not very good , 
because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . 
I had a question about . 
But it's already out of the question , this . 
Um my point is , well , I <other>  If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . 
But it's the exercise . 
Yeah , only only for television uh  
On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . 
And we only make it for television , 
so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special . 
Okay , 
I told about the home station . 
Uh it must be simple , 
because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it . 
And I I found a motto . 
And we put the fashion in electronics . 
And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . 
We we have to make a <other> a new product . 
We have to be um  Yeah . One of a kind , I think . 
<other> The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style . 
Yeah , 
to k to keep it simple when you  
Sorry 
I thought about it , yes . 
Okay , 
this was uh my presentation . 
I don't  
Yeah . 
You can ask some questions or something . 
Mm-hmm . 
Um  
Forward . 
No . Uh  
It gets some seconds . 
Yeah , 
it's it's no it's not a  
It's what Paul says . 
It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two . 
It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two . 
It's only for television now . 
No . 
<other> 
Maybe we can give it out in different colours . 
You can choose blue or yellow 
or  
That's fa That's fancy . That's uh fashion . 
 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , 
that's active . 
I I think it's in the case that it's active . 
It's not uh  
I it's it's just uh the the  
Mm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Empty . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
An automatically search function for each television , or something . 
Uh I kno 
Oh , 
I have a modern one . 
And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , 
and the LED began to blink blink blink . 
And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . 
And then you know , oh it it's the right one . 
And you can stop it , 
and then it's okay . 
So you don't have to search for your television or your code . 
It uh search uh the pattern for itself . 
Yes . 
Changing the signal . 
Yeah , that's the right uh option . 
<whistling> 
 
Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . 
But one you can't see 
and one indicates that you use a button . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
and  
Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then . 
Okay . 
But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs . 
Everywhere in the r 
Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ? 
Yeah , okay . 
It must be around it then . 
Yeah , 
then  
Yeah . 
Not not not not here , but here . 
Maybe uh  
Okay . 
Yeah , 
I uh  
Yeah . 
Maybe what Paul said , uh under the  on the on the home station , uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control , that it beeps . 
Yeah , there must be sound in it . 
I dunno . 
Mm uh , 
twenty five Euros , I think we can make it . 
Bec 
Twelve and a half , okay . 
But but we only have to make it for television , 
and um we must have something special . 
So  
Uh . We have to give our customers some extras . 
No . 
Uh . 
<laugh> Okay . 
<tongue clicking> 
Changes . 
Uh  
L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think . 
Oh . 
Oh , I'm watching uh the channel one . 
Okay . <laugh> No , it's not  
But uh some of you had uh something to read about um <other> uh speech uh recognition . 
About you said one and the television turns on one . 
Is that reachable maybe ? 
That's very  That's fancy . That's cool . 
Twelve and you've got twelve . 
Only the numbers , only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing . But only the numbers , one to twenty or something . 
That should be cool . 
If it's possible , 
I dunno . 
I didn't read it . 
Uh if i if i 
I didn't have information about that . 
Ah 
that's a problem , 
but  
Uh only in English . Only in English I think . 
No , 
that  
Yeah , 
then th we have to think about that . 
But do <laugh> do we do it ? 
It's more if we if we do it . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
and uh and uh  
In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . 
Uh because we we have a lot of languages . 
Yeah . 
A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns uh to one . 
Yeah , 
it's not uh  
Okay , 
but th that becomes your f Uh uh 
because that's very hard for uh speech recognition . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay , no speech recognition . 
Yeah . Yeah yeah , 
it it mustn't work all the time . 
It uh uh it have to work only when you use it . 
So if you  
No , 
if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off . 
Oh yeah . 
A see-through . Mm , that's cool . 
But you have  You had a lot of different buttons . 
No , 
I use te teletext every day , I think . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Trendwatching . 
Okay . That's fine . 
Yo . 
<singing?> <laugh> 
 
 
Mm . Uh . 
 
 <laugh>
