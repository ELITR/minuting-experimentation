<laugh> I just forgot their name ,

So  
<laugh> I have to write it down . 
So  
Do you know them 
or  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah ,

And what's your name ? 
W_I_E_S_ z Z_ or S_ ? 
Uh uh zee  . Okay .

but your surname . <laugh> 
Your surname . 
Okay , 
thanks . 
Yeah , me too , 
so that's not  
No no no , 
I just fi first my  <laugh> 
So 
let's have a look , 
we have forty minutes , 
so it's it's more than enough . 
 Okay , perfect . 
So 
we have  
Oh no , 
what's that ? 
So so 
we have uh forty minutes for this uh for this second meeting , 
and we have to make uh sure that we going t that we are sure , that we are , 
that we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like  look like . 
Uh first I have the notes of the last meeting , 
so I showed uh show them to you . 
Oh , sorry about that , 
I just escape this one . 
How do I escape this ? 
How do I I escape this s uh presentation ? 
Ah okay . 
And show , 
sorry . 
Okay , so 
let's have a look s at this one . 
Okay , so 
the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um  Should be a univ uh universal remote control  
No , 
that's  I uh s 
I just got a email from the from the personal coach 
and it should be a T_V_ remote control only . 
So 
have you changed that part ? 
Um so  yeah , 
it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . 
It's it's still the same . Um  
All these points uh we have to look at . 
You all know them . 
But uh there's another point . 
The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . 
So they're old and not younger people . 
So we have to look at that as well . 
'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , 
I dunno . 
Uh so  So  
yeah , that's it , 
so just you can do your presentation 
for uh  
Oh it doesn't matter , 
just start with the  
I I didn't read i read it , 
so 
it's not for me , 
I didn't get it uh anyway . 
It's only for you . 
Yeah . 
The last point is quite an interesting  <laugh> 
So 
if we  
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
we should have the ten percent on the on the top , 
then you're you're  
<cough> 
So 
we have uh a new uh age of forty plus . 
People . 
So 
yeah , 
so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control , 
because  
Yeah . 
It's too  
Okay . 
Because it's too expensive . 
Yeah , probably . 
So it has to look uh uh uh unique , 
but  
Yeah . 
But old people are not looking for that . 
Not really . 
Okay . Yeah . 
Yeah . Okay . 
Thanks . 
So 
Paul , you can do the next one if you want . 
It's on the on the uh net net uh thing , 
isn't it ? 
So 
what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or  
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Maybe i maybe it's too complicated , 
but not sure  . 
It's a good idea , 
but  
Uh   
Uh mayb for me it's  
If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call 
sh 
Never . 
So  
And  
If I don't do it , maybe old people  <laugh> 
It's not , it's still not  It's not anymore n uh  
 
Just on the front as well . 
No , 
that's the only th the only thing you need . 
Just very simple . 
Uh  Yeah , 
I know what it is , 
but I think it's all too difficult for old people . <laugh> 
And how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ? 
Normally you can press one , zero or  
A ten plus 
or  
Okay . 
But do we still need a two level remote control ? 
Because if we only have that l only f 
No . 
Yeah . 
Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure . 
You'll also have to use a mute button 
to to  
Maybe , not  
I don't know where where you have to put it . 
Okay . Yeah . Yeah . That's right . 
Yeah . 
Does it have to be  Uh it has to be uh with different colours 
or  
It's like a iMac or something . 
<laugh> Just to make it  <laugh> 
But it looks cheap as well , 
because it's a small thing . 
It's only twenty five Euros . 
It looks very cheap if you make it  
Oh , 
you just  
I dunno what happened . 
Yeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right . 
Just  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay ,  
we hurry up a bit , 
because otherwise we won't make it . 
Is it fin 
Are you finished ? 
Okay . 
So 
we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ? 
Yeah , 
it's  I think it's usable . 
Yeah . 
Or just a green one , 
because it's  If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green . 
Yeah , that's right . 
But if you  
Red's l shows up like something's wrong , 
and green is like it's okay , 
you press the button . 
Yeah , I know . 
Okay , we make it red . 
You have to  
The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . 
Uh that's cool . <laugh> 
No , 
we have a recharger in it , 
so  
If we can still make that then  <laugh> 
But it's cool if it was green . 
Green or red or whatever , it is cool . <laugh> 
I just say  
Can you s just say it again , 
because I was just looking  
There's just a short  
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Okay . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<cough> 
Okay . 
So that's the LED , L_E_D_ . 
Yeah , okay . 
So 
we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one . 
To flash up your  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . 
So you see green if you push that button . 
Yeah , 
but if you u if you do that , you know that you're uh sending a signal . 
And it's  you also know which button you p 
Yeah , that's right . 
But it  
But does it make any difference for the energy you use ? 
You got still one LED . 
That looks different , yeah . 
The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ? 
If you push  
It lights up . Everything lights up . 
That's a good idea . 
It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much . 
It's f 
Yeah . 
Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well . 
It's only few LEDs . Only four or something . Four LED . 
Yeah , that's a good idea , okay . 
Everything agre 
Everyone agrees with that , 
or  
Okay . 
Yeah , 
and then you  
Okay , yeah . 
But you have to make a sound device in it then . 
But  
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Are you almost finished 
or just  
Okay . Okay . 
No worry . 
Yeah , 
I just want to talk some  about some more . 
So maybe you have to  
Yeah ? 
Okay . 
So 
this  
Oh , sorry . 
Wh what's that ? 
So uh  
Oh , sorry . 
We have some new uh project requirements . 
We have to have a look what they are . 
They're still in um  
Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . 
So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . 
I'm not sure . 
I don't think so , 
but  
Yeah , 
and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . 
It's only one button . 
So I don't think it is  
We definitely should use it . Um  
Yeah , 
that's uh what I told you . 
The remote control should only be used for a television . 
So 
that's maybe easier . 
And um the the forty plus people , I already told you . 
Oh 
no , 
sorry . 
Oh , this is a problem . 
Oh sorry about that . 
The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . 
So it should be flashy or just more interesting . 
I'm sorry about that . 
I just I just didn't read it well . 
So 
does it make some decision about that ? <laugh> 
That still stays . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well . If it's possible . 
But  
I don't think it's very expensive actually . 
Why should it ? 
You only have a microphone in it . 
Nah , maybe  
Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that . 
It  
We have short time to to put it on the market , 
so that  
We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that . 
We make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy .  
Yeah . 
Yeah . I think so . 
So 
we have to make some decisions . 
So 
you can see on the uh  
So 
we have to know what we're going to put on . 
Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? 
Do  
If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , 
so you can see what other but buttons there are , 
okay ? 
Okay , we just take that one . 
And what else , we have  
Yeah , 
but it's  
Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same . 
If you push something , it it all lights up . 
Or you can switch it on or something . 
Yeah , that's right . 
You have to  
Yeah , that's right . 
That's what I said . 
It's the same as the telephone . Yeah . 
And do we use a a  Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac ,  if you can look through it . 
Or just a normal remote control . 
Yeah . 
Different colours . 
Okay , 
so y you just make it th through  You look through it ? 
Okay . 
And so the buttons we have , 
this is , yeah , this is normal . 
We put in the the simple buttons on the top , 
and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there . 
Yeah , 
maybe you have you have to  
Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one . 
O 
but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . 
Because you ne almost never use it . 
Yeah , that's right . 
Yeah . For me too , it is . 
So 
we just keep it one level then ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
So 
that's it for toda for  
We're going to have a lunch lunch break . Um  
So yeah , 
you know what you have to do . 
This is uh this is it . 
You get your meal and everything , 
so  
Yeah . 
So , 
we're finished for t for this time . 
We're going to have some lunch . 
Yeah .
