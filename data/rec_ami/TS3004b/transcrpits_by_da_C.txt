Uh Martijn . 
What ? 
Uh Abbing . A_ B_ B_ I_ N_ G_ . 
I was a little short on time , 
but  
What ? 
Uh  
Just  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . 
So you might as well remember the number . 
Or not ? 
Yeah , okay . 
But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ? 
Yeah ? 
Yeah okay . 
But uh uh for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel . 
Yeah , 
but isn't it hard to remember ? 
Like favourite one and  
No , neither do I . 
Yeah , 
I dunno . 
Uh uh the p uh next and previous . 
Previous I know , 
but next channel ? 
I don't thi 
Li like a web browser , 
so  
Oh , okay . 
But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before . 
Like a web browser back button . 
Yeah , 
okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
w wouldn't it be a problem to uh  Because you h have to be fast enough . 
Maybe the elderly people  
Oh okay . Yeah . 
Yeah , 
but that's th mm  
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button . 
Because you n almost never use menu button . 
So  
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . Well , 
the working design . 
The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . 
Um  Basically 
I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , 
but uh I could figure it out . 
Um basically what happens is you press a button , 
uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . 
And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . 
So 
like you press a one , that circuit is closed 
and uh  
Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code 
to uh  
And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . 
That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . 
Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . 
That's un uh invisible to the human eye . 
And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ . 
However it has also an uh a visible uh diode 
that's uh blinking red if you look in it . 
And that's uh another diode , I believe . 
Because infrared is not visible . 
So 
that's er uh do two different things 
but  
Yeah . I I think so . <other> 
I I'm not sure if it's the same thing . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , when you press it . 
So  
Two ? 
Yeah , 
I dunno . 
Ma on on most 
on most uh uh remote controls it's red . 
So  
So 
I know . 
<laugh> I I think uh the batteries will be uh <laugh> a little  
Yeah , okay . 
Uh maybe . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
That it's working . 
That it's not not the batteries are low . 
Yeah , I know . 
Just to indicate it's working . 
And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . 
So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . 
So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . 
We have to really understand what patterns are used , 
so we can uh o On the  
Otherwise it won't work . 
No . 
I I uh  
The chip um uh is producing the pattern . 
So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to  
Yeah . 
That are working . 
Yeah , 
or  
I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . 
It wasn't explained there . 
Yeah ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Ah okay . 
Okay . 
Okay , yeah . 
So 
it uh  
We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . 
Because you have to  
Yeah . 
Uh okay . Well uh 
y you have this chip . 
That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern . 
But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different . 
So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one . 
And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically . 
So uh basically 
what you have to do is uh get these patterns right . 
And uh by d uh 
that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time . 
And um  
What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . 
And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , 
so  
And then he saves that setting 
and then um it's working . 
Okay . Well uh 
the components . 
Yeah , 
that's a bit technical , 
and I hadn't  I w 
I was a little short on time . 
Um but I think I understand it . 
Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically . 
Um that's connecting to all the components . 
Because it has to be fed with energy . 
Okay . Uh 
the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed . 
So basically 
when you press a button , a switch get closed . 
Um that's connecting to a chip . 
So the chip knows what button you pressed . 
And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . 
I didn didn't put the description by this one . 
Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light . 
Yeah . Yeah , 
and this is a LED too . 
But this one is producing infrared light 
that's invisible . 
And this one is producing normal light . 
Yeah  
Yeah , 
presu 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can  
Basically 
if the battery is low , it won't work . 
Huh , that's a good idea . 
Hmm . 
Yeah , 
but mm like when you push it 
n n 
Yeah . 
You have your finger over the button . 
So you can see  
Yeah . 
Or or m maybe on top of the  A green light is flashing 
or  
Yeah . There . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . We'll have enough power 
to  
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
B 
maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make . Especially for that kind of money . 
Because it's i it has to be  
Yeah . 
Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half . 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah , 
the the personal preference , I didn't fill it out . 
Because I was short on time . 
But um  
Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration . 
Yeah ? 
Okay . 
No , 
and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use . 
Hmm . 
Oh . Mm . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
That kinda changes the whole situation . 
Yeah . 
Mm ah  
I I don't y you'll use it often , 
because you can see on the television wh what channel you  
<laugh> 
No . 
Yeah . 
I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . 
And uh then the usability is not that required , 
because the  Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think . 
I didn't read  
I didn't read any 
b 
Yeah . Yeah okay . 
I I know . 
Mm . 
Yeah , 
I don't know . 
Yeah . 
But it has to work . 
And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or  
And and uh w Yeah ? 
Yeah , 
it's probably my job to figure that out , 
but  
And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing 
or  
Yeah , 
I dunno . 
Yeah , I think so .  
And and  
Yeah , 
and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh <laugh> 
the remote away . 
Mm . Hmm . Mm . Yeah , okay . 
But  
Hmm yeah , T_V_ one . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that's good . 
Mm , maybe it's a good idea . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Yeah , 
but younger people I think um more often use the internet 
and elderly people often use teletext . 
So uh  
Hmm . Okay . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah .
