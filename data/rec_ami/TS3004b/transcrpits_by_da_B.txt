Uh . 
Yeah , same here . 
Uh let's see . 
Which one was mine ? 
Good . 
Uh left . 
So  
Okay . 
Yeah , okay . 
Which one first ? 
Okay . 
Functional requirements , yeah 
No , 
I didn don't thing we got it . 
Yes . 
Uh . Maybe just a button on the home station . 
So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
but good usability , 
so you can use it . 
Unique . 
Yeah , I reckon  
Uh I think mm  
Uh  
Yeah . 
But uh we also have to stand out , 
'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . 
But we have to make sure that we're better usability , 
and stand out by just looks of it . 
So make it just a different colour or different shape , 
so  
Okay . 
Yeah well  Uh . 
There it is . 
Okay . 
Technical functions design . 
Okay , well , so 
we have s mm uh broad audience . 
Isn't  that isn't true anymore . 
But um we have elderly people , 
so we need to keep it simple . 
Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . 
Not too full , 
like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used . 
Yeah , 
I have it on the next page . 
But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . 
Um so 
the options that we put on there should be easy to use , 
and 'cause you have more room then , 
and for elderly people big buttons . 
Uh an icon on it or text on it , 
so it's very clear what that buttons does . 
So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . 
Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet 
or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control 
to find out . 
But there is already in a one done . 
Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to  . Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options . Um basic on-off . 
And I found an uh  
Could I think of favourites ? 
I always look up the same um pages on text 
and always have to click the number . 
But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button 
and you get on your  
No y 
Well 
it's  
It was just a thought . 
So 
I'm , I u  
I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six . 
Well uh 
what I was reading on the page . Uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television . 
So 
switch to channel six . 
So uh 
button six says says six . 
And if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row . 
Just numbers . 
That can be in the in the  
Well 
if you said a favourite  
Well 
i 
Never ? 
Oh . 
Oh are you ? 
Okay now , 
m maybe not . 
No , 
maybe elderly people uh . 
Right . 
They don't like new features . 
So maybe not . 
Um well 
play , pause . I dunno if that's usable 
when  
Not anymore for T_V_ . 
Right , 
on off . 
<other> I dunno , 
miss  Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ? 
I couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for T_V_ . 
Is  
Just the channel um uh  What I mean is uh  
Six seven eight or five . 
Um I dunno . 
I don't have  Uh I did  
Yeah , 
I don't think you use that . 
Y only when you want to go to  
Yeah , 
just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time . 
Yeah , 
I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . 
So you have that uh  
Yeah , the ten plus button . 
Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other . 
To just keep it simple and standard uh features . 
Uh yeah mayb 
But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it . 
But you can have a button that says um 
two two st two stripes . 
So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons . 
So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes . 
So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that  And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and  
So I I don't think so . 
Uh I just thought of another one . 
Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu . 
So you also need a menu button . 
And then uh navigation uh  
But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next , 
so you have 
four arrows . 
Yeah , okay , 
but um  
Yeah , a mute button . Yes . 
Don't think so . 
Yeah well , 
that's that's  I think that's the layers that produce . 
Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on . What we're gonna use . 
And later we can d uh do the design . 
Okay , uh 
now my personal preferences . 
Uh using the standards , basic  
Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . 
So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . 
So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out . 
Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls . 
Um  I dunno . Different colours um  
Yeah . 
Well 
why not ? 
Or  Yeah . 
Well , 
maybe you can look at uh mobile phones . 
Oh . 
Who ? 
They they're uh designed very well . 
And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller . 
You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it . 
But uh well , I think that's a good example . 
Okay , 
sorry . 
Well uh  
Yeah , I I'm finished . 
I think we discussed everything . 
Uh 
j Is  
Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ? 
So  
Yeah . 
Maybe uh  
Maybe depends on uh  
Yes . 
But maybe  
Well 
we don't have to make it red . 
Maybe integrate it in the design as well . 
Uh <laugh>  Oh , 
maybe it's it is would an e No . Just uh  
<laugh> 
Oh . 
Yeah , 
but it doesn't have to be red . 
It's just to indicate something's on . 
Yeah . 
It's it's not very important , 
so yeah . 
So mm  
So 
we have to uh make buttons for that as well , 
to make it uh  
Okay . 
Well , 
I I use a universal uh remote control , 
and  list of all the T_V_s you have , etcetera . 
And you have to put in a number , 
so it works on your T_V_ . 
<laugh> 
Okay , 
so we use that . 
Yep . 
No , y Yeah . 
No I don't think so , 
but  
Yeah , 
i it it will look different , 
and I think we need to find something else . 
Yeah . 
'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , 
and our uh motto also is  
Yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even . 
 Yeah , 
then then won't  Then you won't see it . 
 
Yeah , we're thinking about it . 
Uh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh 
everything lights up . 
Why ain't that on a remote control ? 
Yeah , 
if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it , it's  
Yeah , 
i if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote . 
No , 
I dunno . 
But if we use a battery station , 
which I think we will use  
Yep . 
And also it's  
Okay , 
it shouldn't take much  
Uh I th 
I think uh you also have uh <other> remote controls with a lot of options . 
But we lose about ninety percent of those options . 
So I think you can uh  
Yeah . 
I think we will save money with that . 
Yeah . 
Okay , 
that's  It changes things . 
<cough> 
Um  
Well yeah , 
then we have to make some nice features . 
I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way , 
to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern . 
That's important I think 
and  
And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , 
especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it . 
So  
<laugh> Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable . 
So , but uh  Yeah . 
What other features can we put in ? 
It's very fashion . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah , I think it's  
What  
But uh I dunno how that works then . 
Uh does your uh  
Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever 
uh one to have in channel one ? 
Yeah , 
I dunno . 
So , 
is it very usable ? 
That's what I'm looking at . 
Is  
Mm  Yeah well  <other> 
It's  
I d 
Yeah . 
I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition . 
Yeah . Well yeah , 
that's the right command . 
And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one , or something . Not just one , 
but  
Well 
I dunno . 
But I don't think , it just ain't useful enough . 
Yeah , I think so . 
Yep . 
Also the one in the dark . 
So uh  
It lights up when it's dark ? 
I didn't  
Okay . 
Yeah , 
but um  
Yes , that's what I mean . 
Or maybe when you  
yeah . 
It lights up all . 
Okay yeah . 
D 
Yeah , alright . Yeah . 
Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod . 
Different colours , 
uh maybe use even different fonts . 
Like uh phones . 
Yeah . Uh as an option maybe . 
It's the standard  
Yeah , uh  
Yeah , 
we but we don't  We don't really have any complicated buttons . 
Yeah okay , but  Yeah , well 
w 
I think the buttons are very easy . 
With just uh standard buttons we just have so little  
No , I don't need don't need  
Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something . 
I use teletext as well . 
Yeah yeah , one level . 
And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons , 
I think the design is most important . 
You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much . 
'Cause  simple buttons . 
If you put one above it , it's clear . 
How long is lunch break ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> Bye . 
<laugh>
