Okay . Um . <other> 
I'm gonna go for the bear 
which I'm  be able to draw very well , 
but I'll have a bash at it . 
Uh .

Ooh ooh

I think I've just knocked the microphone . <laugh> Um . 
We'll g then we'll go for a a s small small bear  . 
<laugh> 
Um <laugh> and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear 
like the jungle book characters and stuff like that .

<laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
 
Yes .  
Um I  with some remote controls the buttons were a little small 
so they're quite hard to press 
so maybe we make something with uh easy to press buttons . 
As that is the main function . 
Yes . 
Um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible . 
 is easy to use and see . 
Yes . 
 
 
 
Sorry , 
you go . You go . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yes . 
Yeah . 
Maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote . 
Or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself , 
or sort of the instructions that would come with it ? 
'Kay . 
<laugh> Or not . <laugh> 
 slide four  
Okay . 
<other> 
Yes . 
'Kay , yes . 
I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control , 
so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise . 
'Kay 
Okay , that's great .
