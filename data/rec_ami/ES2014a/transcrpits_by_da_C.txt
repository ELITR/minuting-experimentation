I'm Louisa . 
I'm the User Interface Designer . 
I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I don't mind . <laugh> 
Um . 
Let's see . 
Good job I got pockets today . 
Are we supposed to do this right now , do you think , or ? 
Oh . 
Right here we go . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat . 
Little smiley cat there . 
Um and this would be because they're very independent , 
uh they're very intelligent , compared to dogs maybe . 
Um <laugh> and they can be very very affectionate . 
Some people don't think so 
but I know very affectionate cats . Um . 
Um and they can look after themselves . 
<laugh> 
Shall I rub that out , actually ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
That's quite good . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Can I just check ? 
<cough> Is this just a television remote ? 
Because a lot of um systems are kind of T_V_ video combined now , 
or T_V_ D_V_D_ combined . 
And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house . 
So if you've got a combined system , it could be a combined remote . 
Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing ? 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> Comes to your whistle . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I think that might be back to the start . 
Um if you grab the kind of uh slide to the left and pull it down ? 
I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for . 
Is this a mun multi-functional one 
or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it ? 
Right . 
Okay .
