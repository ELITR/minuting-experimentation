<laugh> 
Right . 
Hello . 
Um I'm gonna go for the dog , 
and I'm gonna draw one badly as well . 
Uh . 
 looks like it's going to be a dachshund or something . 
<laugh> 
Right . There's my dog . 
Um <other> I like dogs because they're very loyal . 
And they're always happy , 
so whenever whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired , they're always coming up and they're always um quite excited . 
So um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog . 
And they're also good for exercise as well . 
You can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired . 
And and when they're tired they're quite cute as well , so . <laugh> 
Okay , that's why I like dogs . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Great . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
I've 
Okay . Yeah . 
Um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well . 
'Cause there's quite often lots and lots . 
And um sometimes uh they sort of  remote controls defeat their own purpose 
because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room . 
So  whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel , 
now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote . 
So so I don't 
we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room . 
That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but <laugh>  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
I mean we've done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are , 
and a lot of them sort of use you know they're like they're like mini laptops . 
So it's possible that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television , your stereo , 
and where  you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of  you can link it to that as well , maybe . 
Okay . 
If you just click return it should be okay . 
It'll get rid of the message . 
If you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message . 
Oh you've got  . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay cool . 
Okay cheers .
