Yes . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
No . 
Yes . 
Think I'll go first . 
<cough> 
'Kay . 
My name is Freek Van Ponnen . 
I'm the Market Expert . 
But you already knew that . 
Um I've done some research . 
We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab 
where we observed um users operating remote controls . 
Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . 
We had one hundred of these uh test subjects . 
Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved . 
Well 
these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . 
Um remotes are being considered ugly . 
F 
uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . 
Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . 
So  
Um in addition remotes were not very functional . 
Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . 
And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . 
So 
some things . 
Then we did some research to the most relevant functions . 
Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . 
The power button got a nine . 
And teletext got a six and a half . 
So these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control . 
Then there are some one-time use function . 
That's what I like to call them . 
That uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . 
Which are not really used very frequently , 
but are still considered to be of some importance . 
Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour . 
Then these are the  
This is the market . 
Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . 
Um  Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control . 
Um they like to use new f new functions . 
But they also are very critical . 
They won't spend their money very easily . 
So  Um 
the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market . 
They are not really very interested in features . 
But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . 
What I think this indicates for our um design . I think we should make a remote for the future . 
And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . 
Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , 
so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . 
Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . 
Um  The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ . 
Um this is certainly something to take into account . 
And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . 
So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design . 
Besides of course that the remote must look very nice . 
And the functionality  As a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , 
I think we should make very few buttons . 
Uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote . 
Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . 
'Cause they're used most 
and so they should be robust . 
They shouldn't break down easily . 
Um  Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room , 
it might be 
and I say might be 
because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . 
But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . 
And this would , could get a button in it 
which would send a signal to the remote 
which would then beep . 
So you'd know where it is in the room . 
And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . 
Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . 
This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . 
But up till forty five it remains feasible . 
This would also greatly increase the production costs 
but I think these are just some small factors we could consider . 
That would be all . 
Any questions ? 
'Kay . 
<cough> 
Yeah 
you should go to the top thingy . Slide show . 
Oh yeah . 
Hmm . 
Well 
it would certainly make a fancy design . 
So  
That is true . 
We would have to look into that . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
So 
is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ? 
Yeah 
'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature 
and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . 
And new T_V_s will have internet access on them . 
But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access 
within the next like twenty years is very slim . 
In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . 
So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . 
I'm pretty much against it . 
Yes . <cough> 
Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small . 
But I mean if I s if I see this , it's  I think we're just gonna go for another 
pretty 
and not innovative 
remote control . 
Yes 
but it's not the biggest part of the market . 
And besides that , they're not very critical 
so  
I mean they don't really care what the remote control is like . 
They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable . 
No . 
I think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . 
because they are critical 
and they they want to have a fancy remote control . 
People of forty plus , I mean they want it to work , 
but as soo as soon as it works it's okay with them . 
So  
I haven't heard of it . 
Hmm . 
<cough> 
Yes . 
Yes . 
But obviously the board tends to disagree . 
Yeah , also . 
I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext . 
Yes . 
Mm-hmm . 
But I don't think that's really an issue any more 
'cause  
Well 
might be . 
But I mean it , if it's only for T_V_ you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway . 
You need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , 
volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons 
but  
I think if you if you only l 
Nah . 
Think if you're gonna include teletext you do . 
I think many people like to use that . 
'Cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times . 
That's true 
but um I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast . 
And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . 
And I dunno if many channels would do have that . If many T_V_s have that . 
Mm-hmm . 
But I don't think  I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_ , you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible . 
'Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a T_V_ , 
which already only have the minimum number of buttons . 
I don't think there's much to be gained in that area . 
Yeah . 
That is true 
but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the T_V_ . 
'Cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a T_V_ there's simply not a lot of buttons required . 
There's not a lot of functions required 
so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either . 
So 
I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . 
That would that would cost a a big marketing expedition 
which was one of the arguments to make it only for the T_V_ 
because we didn't have the time to market a lot . 
Maybe . 
Well yeah 
I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons 
and  
But I don't think we should spend very much time in that . 
<cough> 
Yeah 
I think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a 
like to have extra in a new remote control . 
Yes 
well 
fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost . 
Yeah 
that was what I suggested . 
You have it on  
Yeah 
you have it's on some phones too , 
which have a docking station . 
And you just press a button 
and the phone goes ringing . 
So you know where it is . 
I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , 
and we're focusing on elderly people here 
which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , 
it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , 
which would explain a button if you press it . 
Which would tell you what it does . 
And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen , 
but  
Just a small screen 
with two  
Yeah . 
But I dunno if that would 
that would fit into the costs . 
No . 
I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters . 
Yeah . 
I think  
I think that would be a  
If we should do something like that it would be a , I think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company . 
And I think , I think there would be a good market for it . 
If we're able to really bring an innovative product . 
Yeah the really  
But I'd have to look into that a little more . 
'Kay . 
And with uh the little screen in it ,  which explains the buttons . You could  I think we n it would be a lot easier to 
adapt it to different cultures . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<cough> 
'Kay . 
That's good .
