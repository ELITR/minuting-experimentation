Okay . 
Everybody found his place again ? Yeah ? 
That's nice . 
Okay so 
this is our second meeting . 
And uh 
still failing ? <laugh> 
Uh now we're going um into the functional design . 
Um important thing of this phase is that we're going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . So that we can move onto the second uh phase . 
But first this phase . 
Um first an announcement . 
There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . 
So  
<laugh> There's our <laugh> ghost mouse again . 
That that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , 
that's because of this uh  
It's in wing C_ and E_ . 
So 
it should be over in a in a while , couple of days . 
But it's going to be cold anyway , 
so <laugh> I don't think you're gonna need it . 
Then our agenda . 
Now 
first the opening . 
Uh this time I will take the minutes . 
Uh you're going to have a presentation . All of you . 
Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations . 
So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , 
and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements 
uh which have been sent to me . 
And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include . 
So 
we've got forty minutes for all of it . 
So 
I suggest um let's start with the first presentation . 
Um who wants to be first ? 
Okay . 
So  
Just maybe it's easier if you um  
Yeah 
I think you will tell  your presentation as well . Just which function you have 
and what you're gonna talk about . <cough> 
Okay . 
Thank you . 
So 
anybody have um any questions until now ? 
About functional requirements ? 
Okay 
that's clear . 
 Now to the second . 
<cough> 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
you can take your time . 
We've got uh plenty of time , 
so  
 
Yeah . There it is . Yeah . 
One remote . 
 
<other> 
<laugh>  
Hmm . <other> 
'Kay . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Anybody has questions about the technical functions ? 
 
Yeah . 
Touchscreen . 
Huh . 
'Kay . That's nice . Uh  
Yeah . 
That's right . 
Uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation ? 
Uh  And then we  have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design . 
<cough> 
I think it's going to  
Uh it's not too much . 
Okay . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Thank you . 
Okay . 
Uh  Okay 
now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have 
and what we are doing right now . 
Um I'm the Project Manager 
so I'm here to mess things up 
and uh tell you some new uh requirements . 
Um that's , 
we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . 
Um that's because <other> uh it will be too complex 
and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions . 
So it has to be simple . 
Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , 
because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . 
And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control . 
Um internet is also mentioned  in a function we can use . 
Uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well . 
Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . Uh that's the the market we have to to to target , 
because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . 
Um this is uh a bit pity for the Marketing uh Expert . 
<laugh> Because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . 
So we have to find a market which is above forty plus 
uh but which will suit our 
uh remote control , 
and the other way round . 
And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . 
So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . 
And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . 
So 
I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . Um  
<other> 
Against the no teletext ? 
Um  
Yeah 
it's it is  
Standard remote . 
No 
I think we can 
I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons 
which were also mentioned . 
Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach 
because it is forty percent of the market . 
And um 
if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now . 
No . 
But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think   the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it . 
So 
let's try it . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
It's a big success . 
Very big success . 
Yeah . 
Uh . I think so as well . 
Uh I simply think um 
uh that the new products we are gonna make , uh spef specifically design , are designed for uh younger people , 
uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . 
And I think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls . 
<other> 'Cause what you told is the channel selection is important . Volume selection , power and teletext . <laugh> 
Okay . Um  
No 
we we haven't voted yet , 
so  <laugh> 
Uh I think teletext can be uh 
um can be a function as well . But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost , 
because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well , 
but I don't think it will be a problem . 
Or is teletext a  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So 
I suggest uh  
Yeah . 
Is anybody um really against teletext ? 
No ? 
Just that , that we just keep the teletext . 
I think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles . 
Maybe we can make that um another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , 
which is instantly on the remote control . 
For elderly people they can think , oh I wanna have subtitles , 
and they push the button 
and they get the big subtitles . 
Um so 
I think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . Um  
Functionality should be few buttons , you said . 
I think uh that's very important we have a few buttons . 
So to keep it simple . 
No . 
Yeah . 
But do you need  
But do you need the buttons for one to zero . 
Maybe c we can  
Maybe we can use uh  
No , 
maybe we can implement the scroll button ? 
Or a joystick like ? 
There are other ways too . 
Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or  
That's right . 
 the numbers yeah . 
Yeah 
they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , 
and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it . 
But I think there won't be very much buttons . 
Or there don't have to be a lot . 
The number of buttons ? 
I think it's very important in the in the design . 
You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . 
And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with  
To operate only the T_V_ yeah . 
No . 
So . 
'Kay . 
So 
we can  
Yeah . That's right . 
Yeah . 
So 
you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station . 
Uh uh like other functions . Instead of f of less buttons . 
Mm . No . 
Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ? 
'Cause it can be  
No . 
Yeah . 
Because I think that's uh  
That's a good advantage point as well . If we have a fancy-looking docking station 
or very   
That's a nice requirement . 
Docking station . 
I think so . 
Yeah . 
That's a good point . Um  
You said they easily get lost as well . 
Yeah . 
So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . So 
audio signal should be possible as well . 
I think it's not too expensive . 
 Uh another 
point is the L_C_D_ screen . 
Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much , 
because  
Yeah . 
It will be too much as well . 
Yeah . 
Based . 
Just the L_C_D_ . 
Oh just the normal screen . 
That's a good idea . 
So  
Some extra info . Feedback . 
Yeah . I think that's a good idea as well . 
As the small screen . 
Extra button info . 
I think that should be possible as well . 
Um <other> let's see what did we say . Mm . More . 
Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . 
Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions  
Yeah . 'Kay . 
And default materials . I think that's a good idea as well , 
because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one . 
So that doesn't really matter . 
So 
I think we nee 
Uh let's um specify the target group . 
Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . 
Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . 
Uh what do we want ? 
If we want um a  with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can 
target the real elderly people . 
Yeah . 
So 
that's the  
 Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example . 
Yeah . 
Sixty . 
Okay . 
And different cultures . Are we  
Okay . 
No . 
We've got five minutes left <other> just now . 
Small warning . 
Should  
Yeah . 
In different languages , you know . 
Yeah . 
or you have to put a language button in it , 
but that will be a bit unnecessary I think . 
It's better to put it on different markets with it all . 
Okay . So 
that's the the target . 
Uh then a few small things . 
Uh okay . 
I will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder . 
<other> Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept , 
User Interface Designer the user interface concept , 
and the trend-watching . 
So 
just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group , <other> uh requirements , and the trends which are uh going on . 
And uh specific instructions will be sent to you by uh the personal coach . 
So um 
I thank you for this meeting . 
And I think we have a lunch-break now . 
So 
that's a good thing .
