Okay . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Uh okay . Um 
I've been looking at uh the user interface of it . Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it . Um  
Okay . 
Mm ? 
Oh . 
Uh . 
Okay . 
Um yeah . 
I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control . 
Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet 
and  not much information about it ,   Um about uh interface 
but uh  Uh  Yeah 
I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control . 
Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television , uh stereo . 
So um  
But uh it must be uh user-friendly . 
So um uh 
you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh  Yeah . Uh uh uh  Yeah . In one um remote control . 
But um  
Yeah . 
Um yeah . 
Got uh many functions in one uh remote control , 
um but um yeah 
you can see , this is uh quite simple uh remote control . 
Um few uh buttons 
but uh  This uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons . 
Um uh people uh don't like it , 
uh so um  
Well 
what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are . 
So uh 
like uh the on-off uh button . Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button . 
Uh everybody everybody knows it 
so uh uh you don't have to change that . Um  
My personal uh preferences um . 
Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device . 
So um  
Wh what I was th uh thinking about was um you've got um  Uh this the remote control uh <laugh> 
and uh you got here the general functions , uh like uh the on-off button uh sound uh <other> I dunno um  
And um here you've got a s kind of a display . 
It's a touchscreen . 
So um yeah 
you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh  . 
And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device . 
So um 
this button is for a D_V_D_ 
or <other>  
So um 
for every um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons . 
So uh 
you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device . 
So uh 
that's uh my uh idea about it . 
Um yeah and  
Uh let's see . Uh yeah . So 
a touchscreen . 
Uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um . 
We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh 
for 
um yeah . 
Everybody uh have to use it so  Uh ol even even old people um young people . 
So uh 
we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large . 
So uh  Um  
Yeah . Uh yeah . 
That was uh my uh part of it . 
So  
N I I don't think so . 
Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . S um it's uh not uh in colour or something . 
Uh it's just uh um one colo Uh 
yeah . 
Uh I seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago . 
Uh you got uh yeah quite an uh a kind of uh touchscreen um and it's uh <other> for uh twenty uh Euros or uh less uh . 
So it's possible . 
Yeah . 
Yeah that's true . 
Uh . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
 forty  
Yeah . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
 
Mm . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles . 
So it's  
Yeah . 
It's  
Mm . 
Yeah yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
If it's only for televi 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So we can s we can skip the display , 
so uh we don't need it . 
Uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
No .
