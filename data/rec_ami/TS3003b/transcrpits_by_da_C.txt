No . 
<laugh> 
Well 
I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros . 
But the  It wouldn't be very robust . 
It's very fragile 
and you can get scratches on it . 
That's  . Okay . 
Okay 
I've got a presentation about the working design . 
Um first about how it works . 
It's really simple of course . 
Everybody knows how a remote works . 
The user presses a button . 
The remote determines what button it is , 
uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . 
The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . 
So 
we've got um the the plate . 
It gots conductive disks for every button . 
When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , 
goes to the LED 
and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ . 
It's a very simple device , technically speaking . 
So 
this is a schematic overview . 
You've got the buttons . 
The power source . 
And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . 
The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . 
When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . 
Well um 
I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . 
Keep the inner workings simple , 
so it's robust . 
Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , 
because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . 
And uh you only have to design a remote once , 
and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . 
So 
it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . 
That's it . 
<laugh> 
I think that if we're  If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um  I don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ? 
Yeah 
if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think . 
We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . 
We just 
change our focus on the project , 
and I think we can uh we can sell this . 
No . 
Uh that's a good idea . 
Yeah . 
And besides that it's um  
If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . 
They're not used to using scroll buttons . 
So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout . 
It should be possible yes . If it's not too fancy . 
And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible 
yeah . 
Yes . 
So 
we're just gonna focus on the extras ? 
Yeah . 
Like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound . 
Yeah . 
Y i 
um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 
'cause 
it's uh  
 
Well 
I don't think they have different television sets uh 
in uh every country . 
'Cause  
Yeah . 
Yeah .
