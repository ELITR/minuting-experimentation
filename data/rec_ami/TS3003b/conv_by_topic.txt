A:  Okay . Everybody found his place again ? Yeah ? That's nice . Okay so this is our second meeting . And uh still failing ? <laugh> 
D:  Yes . Yeah . 
A:  Uh now we're going um into the functional design . Um important thing of this phase is that we're going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . So that we can move onto the second uh phase . But first this phase . Um first an announcement . There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . So  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> There's our <laugh> ghost mouse again . That that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that's because of this uh  
B:  Okay . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  It's in wing C_ and E_ . So it should be over in a in a while , couple of days . But it's going to be cold anyway , so <laugh> I don't think you're gonna need it . Then our agenda . Now first the opening . Uh this time I will take the minutes . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  No . 
A:  Uh you're going to have a presentation . All of you . Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations . So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me . And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include . So we've got forty minutes for all of it . So I suggest um let's start with the first presentation . Um who wants to be first ? 
D:  Yes . Think I'll go first . 
A:  Okay . So  
D:  <cough> 
A:  Just maybe it's easier if you um  Yeah I think you will tell  your presentation as well . Just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about . <cough>

D:  'Kay . My name is Freek Van Ponnen . I'm the Market Expert . But you already knew that . Um I've done some research . We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls . Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . We had one hundred of these uh test subjects . Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved . Well these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . Um remotes are being considered ugly . F uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . So  Um in addition remotes were not very functional . Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . So 
B:  Mm . 
D:  some things . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  That would be all . 
A:  Thank you . So anybody have um any questions until now ? 
D:  Any questions ? 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  About functional requirements ? Okay that's clear . 
C:  No . 
topic_description:	marketing expert presentation_None


D:  Then we did some research to the most relevant functions . Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . The power button got a nine . And teletext got a six and a half . So these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control . Then there are some one-time use function . That's what I like to call them . That uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . Which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour . 
topic_description:	user requirements_None


D:  Then these are the  This is the market . Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . Um  Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control . Um they like to use new f new functions . But they also are very critical . They won't spend their money very easily . So  Um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market . They are not really very interested in features . But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . 
topic_description:	user target group_None


D:  Um  What I think this indicates for our um design . I think we should make a remote for the future . And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . Um  The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ . Um this is certainly something to take into account . And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design . Besides of course that the remote must look very nice . And the functionality  As a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , I think we should make very few buttons . Uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote . Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . 'Cause they're used most and so they should be robust . They shouldn't break down easily . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


D:  Um  Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room , it might be and I say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . And this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . So you'd know where it is in the room . And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . 
topic_description:	how to find when misplaced_None


D:  Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . But up till forty five it remains feasible . This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider .

topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


B:  Uh okay . Um I've been looking at uh the user interface of it . Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it . Um  
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Um yeah . I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control . Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet and  not much information about it ,   Um about uh interface but uh  Uh  
B:  That was uh my uh part of it . So  
A:  Okay . Anybody has questions about the technical functions ? 
A:  <cough> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  I think it's going to  Uh it's not too much . Okay . <laugh> 
topic_description:	interface specialist presentation_None


A:  Yeah you can take your time . We've got uh plenty of time , so  
B:  Okay . Mm ? 
D:  Yeah you should go to the top thingy . Slide show . Oh yeah . 
B:  Oh . 
A:   
B:  Uh . 
A:  Yeah . There it is . Yeah . 
B:  Okay . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


B:  Yeah I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control . Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television , uh stereo . So um  But uh it must be uh user-friendly . So um uh you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh  Yeah . Uh uh uh  Yeah . In one um remote control . But um  
A:  One remote . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:   
B:  Um yeah . Got uh many functions in one uh remote control , um but um yeah you can see , this is uh quite simple uh remote control . Um few uh buttons but uh  This uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons . Um uh people uh don't like it , uh so um  
A:  <other> 
B:  Well what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are . So uh like uh the on-off uh button . Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button . Uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that . Um  My personal uh preferences um . Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device . So um  Wh what I was th uh thinking about was um you've got um  Uh this the remote control uh <laugh> and uh you got here the general functions , uh like uh the on-off button uh sound uh <other> I dunno um  And um here you've got a s kind of a display . 
A:  <laugh>  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  It's a touchscreen . So um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh  . And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device . So um this button is for a D_V_D_ or <other>  So um for every um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons . So uh you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device . So uh that's uh my uh idea about it . Um yeah and  
A:  Hmm . <other> 'Kay . 
B:  Uh let's see . Uh yeah . So a touchscreen . Uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um . We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah . Everybody uh have to use it so  Uh ol even even old people um young people . So uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large . So uh  Um  
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Uh yeah . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


C:  Well I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros . 
A:   
B:  N I I don't think so . Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . S um it's uh not uh in colour or something . Uh it's just uh um one colo Uh yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Touchscreen . 
B:  Uh I seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago . Uh you got uh yeah quite an uh a kind of uh touchscreen um and it's uh <other> for uh twenty uh Euros or uh less uh . So it's possible . 
A:  Huh . 
D:  Hmm . 
A:  'Kay . That's nice . Uh  
topic_description:	project budget_None


D:  Well it would certainly make a fancy design . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  But the  It wouldn't be very robust . It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it . 
D:  So  That is true . 
B:  Yeah that's true 
A:  That's right . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  Uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation ? Uh  And then we  have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design . 
D:  We would have 
B:  . 
D:  to look into that . 
B:  Uh . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  That's  . Okay . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


C:  Okay I've got a presentation about the working design . Um first about how it works . It's really simple of course . 
C:  That's it . 
A:  Okay . Thank you . 
topic_description:	industrial designer presentation_None


C:  Everybody knows how a remote works . The user presses a button . The remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . So we've got um the the plate . It gots conductive disks for every button . When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ . It's a very simple device , technically speaking . So this is a schematic overview . You've got the buttons . The power source . And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . Well um I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . Keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust . Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . And uh you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . So it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


A:  Okay . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  Uh  Okay now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . Um I'm the Project Manager so I'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	new requirements_None


A:  Um that's , we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . Um that's because <other> uh it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions . 
B:  Okay . Mm . 
A:  So it has to be simple . Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Um internet is also mentioned  in a function we can use . Uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . Uh that's the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . Um this is uh a bit pity for the Marketing uh Expert . <laugh> Because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . So we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  uh remote control , and the other way round . 
topic_description:	user target group_None


A:  And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  So I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions . Yeah . 
C:  So we're just gonna focus on the extras ? 
A:  I think so . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Yeah I think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  like to have extra in a new remote control . 
A:  That's a good point . Um  
A:  Extra button info . I think that should be possible as well . Um <other> let's see what did we say . Mm . More . Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions  Yeah . 'Kay . And default materials . I think that's a good idea as well , because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one . So that doesn't really matter . So I think we nee 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  No . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters . 
A:  We've got five minutes left <other> just now . Small warning . 
B:  So 'Kay . 
A:  Okay . So that's the the target . Uh then a few small things . 
B:  Right . No . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <cough> 
topic_description:	discussion_None


D:  So is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ? 
A:  <laugh> Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . Um  
B:  <laugh> Mm . 
topic_description:	new requirements_None


D:  Yeah 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . And new T_V_s will have internet access on them . But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access 
A:  <other> 
D:  within the next like twenty years is very slim . In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  I'm pretty much against it . 
A:  Against the no teletext ? 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Yes . <cough> 
A:  Um  
topic_description:	look and usability_None


D:  Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small . But I mean if I s if I see this , it's  I think we're just gonna go for another 
B:   forty  
A:  Yeah it's it is  Standard remote . 
D:  pretty 
A:  No I think we can 
D:  and not innovative 
A:  I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which were also mentioned . Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market . 
D:  remote control . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  And um if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now . 
D:  Yes but it's not the biggest part of the market . 
A:  No . 
D:  And besides that , they're not very critical so  I mean they don't really care what the remote control is like . They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable . 
B:  <other> 
A:  But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think   the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it . So let's try it . 
D:  No . I think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  People of forty plus , I mean they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works it's okay with them . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	user target group_None


C:  I think that if we're  If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um  I don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ? 
D:  So  
A:  Yeah . It's a big success . 
C:  Yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think . We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . We just 
D:  I haven't heard of it . 
A:  Very big success . Yeah . 
D:  Hmm . 
A:  Uh . I think so as well . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  change our focus on the project , and I think we can uh we can sell this . 
A:  Uh I simply think um 
B:   
A:  <other> uh that the new products we are gonna make , uh spef specifically design , are designed for uh younger people , uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . And I think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls . <other> 'Cause what you told is the channel selection is important . Volume selection , power and teletext . <laugh> Okay . Um  
D:  <cough> Yes . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Yes . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  But obviously the board tends to disagree . 
A:  No we we haven't voted yet , so  <laugh> Uh I think teletext can be uh 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  um can be a function as well . But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost , because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well , but I don't think it will be a problem . Or is teletext a  
B:  But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles . So it's  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , also . 
A:  Yeah . So I suggest uh  
D:  I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext . 
B:  It's  Mm . 
A:  Yeah . Is anybody um really against teletext ? 
C:  No . 
A:  No ? Just that , that we just keep the teletext . I think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles . Maybe we can make that um another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . For elderly people they can think , oh I wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles . 
B:  Yeah yeah . 
C:  Uh that's a good idea . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Um so I think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . Um  Functionality should be few buttons , you said . 
D:  Yes . 
A:  I think uh that's very important we have a few buttons . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  So to keep it simple . 
D:  But I don't think that's really an issue any more 'cause  Well might be . 
B:  If it's only for televi Yeah . 
D:  But I mean it , if it's only for T_V_ you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway . You need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  No . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but  
A:  Yeah . But do you need  
D:  I think if you if you only l 
B:  So we can s we can skip the display , so uh we don't need it . 
A:  But do you need the buttons for one to zero . Maybe c we can  
D:  Nah . 
B:  Uh  
D:  Think if you're gonna include teletext you do . I think many people like to use that . 'Cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times . 
A:  Maybe we can use uh  
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  No , maybe we can implement the scroll button ? Or a joystick like ? 
B:  Mm . 
A:  There are other ways too . Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or  
B:  Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
D:  That's true but um I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast . And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . And I dunno if many channels would do have that . If many T_V_s have that . 
C:  Yeah . And besides that it's um  If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . They're not used to using scroll buttons . So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  That's right . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm . 
A:   the numbers yeah . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


A:  Yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it . But I think there won't be very much buttons . Or there don't have to be a lot . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  But I don't think  I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_ , you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible . 'Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a T_V_ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . I don't think there's much to be gained in that area . 
A:  The number of buttons ? I think it's very important in the in the design . 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with  
D:  That is true but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the T_V_ . 
A:  To operate only the T_V_ yeah . 
D:  'Cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a T_V_ there's simply not a lot of buttons required . There's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either . 
A:  No . 
B:  No . 
A:  So . 
D:  So I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . 
A:  'Kay . So we can  
D:  That would that would cost a a big marketing expedition 
A:  Yeah . That's right . 
D:  which was one of the arguments to make it only for the T_V_ because we didn't have the time to market a lot . 
A:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  So you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station . 
B:  <other> 
A:  Uh uh like other functions . Instead of f of less buttons . 
D:  Maybe . Well yeah I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and  But I don't think we should spend very much time in that . 
A:  Mm . No . Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ? 
C:  It should be possible yes . If it's not too fancy . And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible yeah . 
A:  'Cause it can be  
B:  No . 
A:  No . Yeah . Because I think that's uh  
B:  No . 
A:  That's a good advantage point as well . If we have a fancy-looking docking station or very   That's a nice requirement . 
C:  Yes . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  Docking station . 
D:  <cough> 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


A:  You said they easily get lost as well . 
D:  Yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost . 
A:  Yeah . So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something . 
D:  Yeah that was what I suggested . You have it on  Yeah you have it's on some phones too , which have a docking station . And you just press a button and the phone goes ringing . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Hm . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  So you know where it is . 
B:  No . 
A:  Yeah . So audio signal should be possible as well . I think it's not too expensive .  
topic_description:	how to find when misplaced_None


A:  Uh another point is the L_C_D_ screen . Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much , because  
C:  Y i um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 'cause 
A:  Yeah . It will be too much as well . 
C:  it's uh  
B:  Mm . 
C:   
D:  And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen , but  
A:  Based . 
B:  Okay . Yeah . 
A:  Just the L_C_D_ . Oh just the normal screen . 
D:  Just a small screen with two  
A:  That's a good idea . So  Some extra info . Feedback . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . I think that's a good idea as well . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  But I dunno if that would 
A:  As the small screen . 
D:  that would fit into the costs . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


D:  I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . Which would tell you what it does . 
A:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  Uh let's um specify the target group . Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . 
B:  Mm . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh what do we want ? If we want um a  with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can
