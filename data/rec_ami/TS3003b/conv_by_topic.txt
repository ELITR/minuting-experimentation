A:  Okay . Everybody found his place again ? Yeah ? That's nice . Okay so this is our second meeting . And uh still failing ? <laugh> 
D:  Yes . Yeah . 
A:  Uh now we're going um into the functional design . Um important thing of this phase is that we're going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . So that we can move onto the second uh phase . But first this phase . Um first an announcement . There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . So  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> There's our <laugh> ghost mouse again . That that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that's because of this uh  
B:  Okay . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  It's in wing C_ and E_ . So it should be over in a in a while , couple of days . But it's going to be cold anyway , so <laugh> I don't think you're gonna need it . Then our agenda . Now first the opening . Uh this time I will take the minutes . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  No . 
A:  Uh you're going to have a presentation . All of you . Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations . So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me . And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include . So we've got forty minutes for all of it . So I suggest um let's start with the first presentation . Um who wants to be first ? 
D:  Yes . Think I'll go first . 
A:  Okay . So  
D:  <cough> 
A:  Just maybe it's easier if you um  Yeah I think you will tell  your presentation as well . Just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about . <cough> 


D:  'Kay . My name is Freek Van Ponnen . I'm the Market Expert . But you already knew that . Um I've done some research . We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls . Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . We had one hundred of these uh test subjects . Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved . Well these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . Um remotes are being considered ugly . F uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . So  Um in addition remotes were not very functional . Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . So 
B:  Mm . 
D:  some things . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  That would be all . 
A:  Thank you . So anybody have um any questions until now ? 
D:  Any questions ? 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  About functional requirements ? Okay that's clear . 
C:  No . 


A:   Now to the second . 
D:  'Kay . <cough> 
A:  <cough> 


B:  Uh okay . Um I've been looking at uh the user interface of it . Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it . Um  
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Um yeah . I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control . Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet and  not much information about it ,   Um about uh interface but uh  Uh  
B:  That was uh my uh part of it . So  
A:  Okay . Anybody has questions about the technical functions ? 
A:  <cough> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  I think it's going to  Uh it's not too much . Okay . <laugh> 


C:  Okay I've got a presentation about the working design . Um first about how it works . It's really simple of course . 
C:  That's it . 
A:  Okay . Thank you . 


A:  Okay . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  Uh  Okay now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . Um I'm the Project Manager so I'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 


A:  So I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions . Yeah . 
C:  So we're just gonna focus on the extras ? 
A:  I think so . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Yeah I think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  like to have extra in a new remote control . 
A:  That's a good point . Um  
A:  Extra button info . I think that should be possible as well . Um <other> let's see what did we say . Mm . More . Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions  Yeah . 'Kay . And default materials . I think that's a good idea as well , because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one . So that doesn't really matter . So I think we nee 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  No . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters . 
A:  We've got five minutes left <other> just now . Small warning . 
B:  So 'Kay . 
A:  Okay . So that's the the target . Uh then a few small things . 
B:  Right . No . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <cough> 


A:  Uh okay . I will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder . <other> Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept , User Interface Designer the user interface concept , and the trend-watching . So just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group , <other> uh requirements , and the trends which are uh going on . And uh specific instructions will be sent to you by uh the personal coach . 
D:  'Kay . 
A:  So um I thank you for this meeting . And I think we have a lunch-break now . 
D:  That's good . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  So that's a good thing . 
D:  <laugh>
