Fantastic . <laugh> 
<other> 
Titanium . <other> 
Expensive . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other>  
I don't know , 
I think verbally we can  we can pretty much sell . 
Hmm . 
Uh from her side , I don't think uh there's too many more questions . 
If you can come to the  
Okay , 
from the marketing  yeah , from the marketing side , just to to give an idea what the management is looking for , I was looking for a a remote control to have a s 
I have a sales price of twenty-five Euro , 
with a production price of uh twelve and a half Euro . 
For what uh I think from what we're trying to find , we're tr we're looking for , I don't think that price is exactly in the market . 
Okay ? 
I'll explain myself here now 
in the sense that uh in a  
in the recent surveys , uh from the ages  fr from fifteen to thirty-five , eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy . 
Twenty-five Euros , uh that's that's a preson reasonable price . 
That's a market price right now . 
Now if we're gonna take a risk , and push this up a bit , make it more expensive , 
but give them added things that they don't have now , 
then it w it could possibly sell . 
Obviously the risk is there . 
Too expensive , they're not gonna buy . 
But , I think uh there's one other thing interesting  two things that are interesting  
is that uh from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group , which always spends more money on trendy new things , speech recognition is requested . 
And we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote . 
Obviously , we can't make a remote into a computer , 
but maybe simple commands . 
I dunno , 
louder , softer , on , off . 
That might be a possibility , even though it costs more , to be the first on the market to produce this . 
Thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use . 
So we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly . 
<other> Uh fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time . <laugh> 
So maybe one word speech recognition commands , 
say remote , and there's a beep beep beep , 
and they can find it through , you know , ten tons of newspapers , magazines , whatever you have at home . 
But , in the cost that uh the management is looking for , that's not gonna be possible . 
But if it's trendy , 
if it's fancy , 
it's got some colour to it , 
if it's very easy  easy to use , 
if it's got simple remote  speech remote uh control , like I said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep , 
I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset 
'cause I can't turn the T_V_ on . 
So we're gonna have to look at it in a <other> in this global idea , with the ideas of the industrial uh design . 
But , price obviously we have to talk about . 
Speech recognition . 
Mm . 
Because tha w <other> with speech recognition uh th I'm not that good at that idea 
but th <other> 
if it's a one-word recognition , 
'cause I know with telephones and cars and things I've seen in the States , 
 a friend of mine says call Mom , 
and it calls up Mom . 
'Kay 
the radio can be on and everything . 
Because I think s with speech recognition , if uh the the remote or like the telephone <other>  it has a exact word that it has to hear . 
I don't think it would come through a sentence in a television . 
If somebody's speaking on the se the television , they're not gonna stop and say remote , 
okay . 
So I think that uh something could be designed to recognise single word  
Like the t like the telephone . 
No 
because I  this is this is years ago in the United States 
where we're driving down 
and he said call home , 
and the telephone called immediately <other> 
so well , 
that's kinda cute . <laugh> 
From from your side uh , you're gonna have to go back the management 
and s be more s precise . 
What do they want ? 
Uh <other> , a risk , take a risk on the market ? 
Something that's gonna cost more , but could very easily s make a boom in the market ? 
Because it has to be something totally different , 
has to be total totally new . 
Something that nobody has right now . 
And it's gonna cost . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Sure . Sure . 
Obviously . 
If the bottom line is positive . <laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yes . Mm . 
<other> 
Hmm . 
Individual actions . <other> 
<laugh> She's objecting . <laugh> 
Oh 
th <other> we s we still have  
Yeah . 
Right . 
Agreed . <laugh>
