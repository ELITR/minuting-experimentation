I've , I've definitely eaten it before . 
I didn't know was edible . <laugh>  . 
Actually that makes sense , 
because I remember like , peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the  colouring and make some sort of sort of dough . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
We've got some  . 
Yeah , it's pretty exciting . 
So , 
everything uh that we wanted 
we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , 
very simple and easy to use , 
yeah , double curved , 
um but also something that was gonna jump out at people , 
something that would be different uh , 
separate it from the other remotes out on the market . 
So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here . 
So , basically , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , <other> the thumb button is the power button . 
Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , 
ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down . 
That's the lock button , 
has a L_ L_ on it 
and then the M_ is a mute button . 
And then it also has digit 
For muting the uh  
Um and then then you can also  there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . 
So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , 
but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different . 
So all the , I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them . 
So you don't you  
Yeah . It should be . 
And it's also conformable to the size of your hand . 
I mean if that's too big , it's a rubber remote , so you can , you know 
change that . 
So d does that uh what  mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it  
Ah , that's good thinking , yeah . 
Yeah , if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes . 
<laugh> Yeah , I didn't I didn't think about that , but I'd  yeah ,  . 
Uh-huh . 
Yeah . 
Do you think it says <other> R_R_ ? 
<laugh> 
Fashion to electronics . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue . 
Plus red , which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh . 
So that's that's <other> our end of things 
wha uh  
That's  
Yeah . 
The costs , was that what you said ? 
<laugh> 
But it's edible . 
<laugh> 
That was the main criteria from the last meeting , it had to be chew proof . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I mean , <other> these these ones on the side are curved kind of , so  
The buttons are rubber . 
That's cool . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah , 
have some have some . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Oh , sorry , one . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
That was our main technological innovation 
w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new . 
It's ergonomic , 
but that's not  that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing , yeah . 
It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , 
maybe , yeah , I dunno . 
Maybe three , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two . 
Yeah . 
That was great . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> It is very bright , yeah . 
It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something , you know . 
Maybe it will . Uh . 
You think it could lost  
Mm . 
Okay . 
Yeah , anything , I mean . Okay . It's bigger than the average mobile , I guess . 
But , yeah , it can get lost . 
Yeah . 
Okay , yeah , two is fine . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion , 
but we we kept  we tried to keep it cool and and 
just just  
<laugh> We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and  
Now you guys have been a a great team . 
Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams ,  . 
Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
So at this stage , I mean , is this the last meeting of the project ? 
We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something ? 
<laugh> 
So there's no way to like predict what our  
'Cause we had a  
we originally had a <other>  As far as our financial uh um goals , we had a specific number for profits that we wanted . 
It was fifty mil fifty million  
I don't remember . 
But there's not a way to compute that , 
I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ? 
Uh . 
Hmm . 
But we have a vested interest  
prof profit sharing <other> . 
I think actually  and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know . 
We're not we're not you know , tying tying our cart to that one horse  . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
It make watching T_V_ healthy . 
<laugh> 
Uh . 
Right , you too . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . <laugh> 
That's it . 
I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence . 
Should we call the day then ? 
Uh , right . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Your moment to shine . 
Right , 
I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step . 
<other> 
I guess we should end this , since we're off off topic . 
So . Shall we  
Right .
