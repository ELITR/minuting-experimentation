Play-Doh's edible . 
Did you know that ? 
It's definitely  
Yeah . 
It's it's chew proof . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> Right . 
Everybody everybody ready ? 
Okay , let's have your um  let's get  have the uh presentation ? 
Nice . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
 what button ? 
Um . Oh mute . 
Okay . 
That certainly does . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
'S great . 
I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , 
but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one . 
But , that's I don't see why that's not possible . 
Yeah . 
 They make left-handed scissors , you know . <laugh> 
Yes s 
Mm . Sure . Sure . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But um other than that , 
I mean uh and that's um , you know , that's just something , 
I think I think it's great , yeah , great idea . 
I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable . 
<other> Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah , very good , yeah . 
It's come up with what we've you know , the things that's what we've  what we were looking at doing , hasn't it , 
 all seems to be there . 
Well done . 
Um before we move on  
I need that cable . 
Thank you . 
Yeah . Um . 
One thing I do need to do  we need to look at , is the costs . 
Well , yeah . <laugh> 
 um  
Yeah . 
Uh right . <other> 
Okay , now I think we'll do this  
I could do  you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you , 
but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , 
so we're going for the kinetic power . 
<other> And the electronics , we decided on it being just a simple , the easiest thing that's inside it . 
Ooh . 
So  the case , we've gone for the double curved . 
Um 
and it's made out of rubber . 
<other> The interface is push-buttons . 
And button supplements 
well they're in diff special colours , 
aren't they ? 
So  special colours . 
Special form , 
yeah , they're a special form there in shapes and stuff . 
Yep . 
Yeah . 
Um . 
Are they made out of any special material ? 
No they're not . 
They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything , they're just simple  
Okay . Right . 
So let's see if that comes within budget . 
And it does . 
That is gonna cost uh  
Yeah . 
That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make . 
And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty . 
So , 
this is all very very good . 
The bosses will be very pleased . 
Okay , let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you . Uh . 
<other> Save it in  save it in the uh <random noise> my documents . 
Splendid . 
Okay . 
So uh , that's  done with this with this um doodah , 
so you're  . Gonna do  what you were gonna do , 
your evaluation . 
<other> 
F_ eight . 
 I love the smell of that Play-Doh . 
<laugh> I cou  . <laugh> 
I would give it a seven . 
Oh sorry , one , d yeah . 
Yeah . 
 . 
Yeah , but that's not a technological thing , that's another thing , i that's another marketing thing . 
So on the technical side of it it  
Easy to use . 
I'd say it's I wouldn't  
not if you're left-handed it's not . 
I would give it a I would give it a two , 
'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but  
Yeah . 
Give it a t give it a two . 
Cost . 
It's come in under budget . 
So that's a definite one . 
Amount of buttons . 
Contains only the necessary buttons . 
Yeah . 
So it's anti-R_S_I_ . 
I don't think it's gonna get lost easily . 
 two . 
I mean it  
No , I mean 
I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but  
Okay . 
Alright it's all all systems go . 
<laugh> We can't fail . 
<other> 
 . 
Well done , Reissa . 
Okay , I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it , 
you know , both individually and as a team . 
You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments , 
um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , 
psp , you know , especially you two . 
That's all , you know , gone very very well 
and and 
and be you know , has been good communication going on . <other> 
<laugh> Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about ? <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Fantastic . 
I think  So 
I I , you know , 
and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , 
we haven't  we're not just rehashing an old design . 
Yeah . 
You know , maybe this isn't a simulation , 
maybe this is actually  so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just , yeah ,  they get   
Yeah . 
Yeah ,  two years' time this will be on the market . 
Ex exactly that product 
um thum  
we'll go , yeah , we designed that and no-one will believe us . 
<laugh> But um  
No , 
I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in . 
<laugh> Or six , uh  
I haven't got message . 
It gets handed over to another department . 
What our what our project was was to come up with the product , basically . 
 the for the 
 and just basically is it it come  can  is it within budget . 
When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and , you know , the b the profits and all that that's other departments  
it's another team that actually work out the mai the  
oh yeah , 
the  all the guys in the profit sharing , yeah . 
<laugh> Um . 
Yeah , that's it . 
You know , we've we've we've made i we've made 
we've designed the product , 
we've ma we've got the prototype , 
it's within budget , 
it's  does everything that we wanted it to do . 
It's new , it's it's um 
something that uh <other> that isn't out there already . 
<other> <laugh> Yeah . 
Well , this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that , 
it's  that it's um , 
hang on , 
I wrote it down here somewhere  
Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off . 
Um that , you know , it's marketable in the sense that it's  whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury , our one does the complete opposite , you know , 
so that's something that's new , 
which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new . 
Yeah , and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_ , you can f throw it about , you know . 
It's fine , it's kid proof . 
Well , you can break the ornaments , but you won't break that . 
<laugh> Yeah . So all in all , I think we've done very well . 
Well done everybody . 
Um . Drinks are on the company . 
In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
That's it . 
Well , as far as I t as far as I know . Um . 
No . 
Anyone wanna play I spy ? <laugh> 
Yeah , I guess . 
I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire . 
Um . 
It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before . 
But I'm not the authority to say that it is . 
Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ? 
The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ? 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
I thi you know , I'd I'd n yeah , 
as we said earlier , I've not  never seen that before . 
 something that t the whiteboard 
thingy , 
<other> that's great . 
Um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing . 
I mean it's i or in such a new idea . 
It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not  
it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Mm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah .
