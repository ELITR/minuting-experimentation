D:  It's Play-Doh . 
A:  Play-Doh's edible . Did you know that ? It's definitely  
D:  Because kids  yeah . 
B:  I used to eat it . 
C:  I've , I've definitely eaten it before . I didn't know was edible . <laugh>  . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  But um , it's it's made edible 'cause , yeah . 
A:  It's it's chew proof . <laugh> 
D:  It's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , normal babies . <laugh> 
C:  Actually that makes sense , because I remember like , peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the  colouring and make some sort of sort of dough . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh yeah it is , yeah . Oh yeah . 
topic_description:	chitchat_None


A:  <other> Right . Everybody everybody ready ? Okay , let's have your um  let's get  have the uh presentation ? 
C:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
B:  Yep . 
C:  We've got some  . 
B:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


B:  We've got a cool prototype . 
C:  Yeah , it's pretty exciting . So , everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , yeah , double curved , um but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different uh , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here . 
B:  Double curved . 
D:  <other> 
A:  Nice . <laugh> 
D:  That is cool . 
C:  So , basically , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , <other> the thumb button is the power button . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
C:  Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down . 
D:  What's the big blue thing ? 
C:  That's the lock button , has a L_ L_ on it and then the M_ is a mute button . And then it also has digit 
D:  Oh cool . 
A:   what button ? Um . Oh mute . 
D:  And mute . 
C:  For muting the uh  Um and then then you can also  there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  Okay . That certainly does . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  So all the , I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them . So you don't you  
A:  Mm . 
B:  Which is ant anti-R_S_I_ . 
C:  Yeah . It should be . And it's also conformable to the size of your hand . I mean if that's too big , it's a rubber remote , so you can , you know 
A:  Mm . Yeah . 'S great . 
C:  change that . So d does that uh what  mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it  
D:  Oh it's so cute . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  So that's that's <other> our end of things wha uh  That's  
A:  Yeah , very good , yeah . It's come up with what we've you know , the things that's what we've  what we were looking at doing , hasn't it ,  all seems to be there . Well done . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  And all the playing around is uh  
topic_description:	presentation of prototype(s)_None


A:  I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one . 
C:  Ah , that's good thinking , yeah . 
B:  Oh right , yeah . 
A:  But , that's I don't see why that's not possible . 
C:  Yeah , if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes . 
A:  Yeah .  They make left-handed scissors , you know . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah , I didn't I didn't think about that , but I'd  yeah ,  . 
D:  Yeah , but then but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ? 
A:  Yes s 
B:  Yeah , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer <other> for the whole  the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse . 
A:  Mm . Sure . Sure . 
D:  Yeah , I'm sure they'll be able to  
C:  Uh-huh . 
D:  I mean it's only pressing buttons , you don't have to do anything , you know , extraordinary . I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Imagine d are you right handed ? 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Imagine you're doing it with your left hand , I don't think it's too  
D:  Yeah , it's not  
B:  But we can have both uh  
D:  Yeah . Have them in stock . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Make 'em more appealing as well . 
A:  But um other than that , I mean uh and that's um , you know , that's just something , I think I think it's great , yeah , great idea . 
C:  Do you think it says <other> R_R_ ? 
B:   I think it does . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable . 
C:  Fashion to electronics . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue . Plus red , which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh . 
A:  <other> Yeah . 
D:   . <laugh> <other> 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> There you go . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  Um before we move on  
D:  Yeah , I'm just  do you wanna plug in ? Okay . 
A:  I need that cable . Thank you . Yeah . Um . One thing I do need to do  we need to look at , is the costs . 
C:  The costs , was that what you said ? 
B:  Play-Doh is very cheap . <laugh> 
A:  Well , yeah . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm . 
A:   um  
D:  Play-Doh won't last very long everybody'll go like , oops , it's gone . <laugh> <other> 
C:  But it's edible . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
B:  Chew proof . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Well , they'll buy more of them if you eat them ,  . 
C:  That was the main criteria from the last meeting , it had to be chew proof . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Uh right . <other> 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  Okay , now I think we'll do this  I could do  you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you , but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we're going for the kinetic power . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh ho-ho . Yep . 
A:  <other> And the electronics , we decided on it being just a simple , the easiest thing that's inside it . Ooh . So  the case , we've gone for the double curved . 
B:  <other> 
A:  Um and it's made out of rubber . <other> The interface is push-buttons . And button supplements well they're in diff special colours , aren't they ? So  special colours . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  It's better for  
A:  Special form , yeah , they're a special form there in shapes and stuff . 
C:  Yeah , I mean , <other> these these ones on the side are curved kind of , so  
D:  And special material . 
A:  Yep . Yeah . Um . Are they made out of any special material ? No they're not . They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything , they're just simple  
B:  Rubber . 
D:  Well they're rubber , aren't they ? 
C:  The buttons are rubber . 
A:  Okay . Right . So let's see if that comes within budget . And it does . That is gonna cost uh  Yeah . That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make . And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty . So , 
B:  Yeah .  . 
D:  We're under budget . 
C:  That's cool . Yeah . Yeah . And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected . <laugh> 
A:  this is all very very good . The bosses will be very pleased . 
A:  Splendid . Okay . 
topic_description:	costing_None


A:  Okay , let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you . Uh . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> Save it in  save it in the uh <random noise> my documents . 
D:  It's already saved , I think . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  So uh , that's  done with this with this um doodah , so you're  . Gonna do  what you were gonna do , 
D:  Thank you . Mm . 
A:  your evaluation . 
D:  Oh , yeah . This is where we all get to <other> I get to write on the , oops , on the board . Right . Oh . 
A:  <other> 
D:  'S function  
A:  F_ eight . 
D:  Okay . 
A:   I love the smell of that Play-Doh . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah , have some have some . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  <laugh> I cou  . <laugh> 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


D:  Okay . So , <other> evaluation . We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria . I've got the criterias . And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven , one being true , so it's it's more like it's  fits the criteria , and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria . And the criterias are , and I'll draw this up on the board  <other> so we have a box   . And this is false , this is just like to keep you informed . So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle . <other> So the first criteria . Do you all get what we're doing ? Okay , cool . Okay , first criteria , look and feel . So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ? As it  is it colour-wise and is it spongy ? So what mark should we give for that ? 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm . 
A:  I would give it a seven . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  As in it's not . 
C:  Oh , sorry , one . <laugh> 
A:  Oh sorry , one , d yeah . 
B:  A one . 
D:  A one a one . So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one . Second criteria , new technology . Have we implemented new technology ? As in the new high-tech <other>  
B:  Well , the kinetic thing , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new . 
A:   . 
D:  So it's  . So we'll give it a  
B:  Well so the um  
D:  <other> 
C:  It's ergonomic , but that's not  that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , but that's not a technological thing , that's another thing , i that's another marketing thing . So on the technical side of it it  
B:  Yeah . Yeah . True . 
D:  Yeah . I'd say it's about a a twoish ? Two . Three . 
C:  It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , maybe , yeah , I dunno . 
B:  Two . Yeah . 
C:  Maybe three , yeah . 
D:   three . So criteria three is is it easy to use ? I think it's a one , I think . 
A:  Easy to use . I'd say it's I wouldn't  not if you're left-handed it's not . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  I would give it a I would give it a two , 'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but  
C:  Mm . 
D:  Two , so it's  
C:  Okay . 
D:  But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then ? 
B:  Mm . 
C:  If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Give it a t give it a two . 
D:  Yeah , okay . <other> 'Kay , criteria four is costs .  <other> 's great . 
A:  Cost . It's come in under budget . So that's a definite one . 
C:  Yeah . That was great . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Amount of buttons . 
D:  Like the amount of buttons , 'cause people like a lot le like  
A:  Contains only the necessary buttons . Yeah . 
D:  So it's a one ? 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Um criteria six . R_S_I_ is it good against ? Yes . Very good . It's one . And criteria seven , which is the last one , does it get lost ? Is it easy to get lost ? 
B:  <other> Yes s yeah . 
A:  So it's anti-R_S_I_ . 
B:  It's yellow . 
C:  <laugh> It is very bright , yeah . 
A:  I don't think it's gonna get lost easily . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  No ? But it is smallish . 
C:  It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something , you know . 
B:  Two . 
C:  Maybe it will . Uh . 
B:  T 
D:  Mm . I think i it would , could be , could get lost . 
C:  You think it could lost  
A:   two . 
D:  Mm . Yeah . I mean it's not fully it's not fully  like you can't say  I mean , it's not a one , definitely . 
C:  Mm . 
A:  I mean it  No , I mean I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but  
C:  Okay . Yeah , anything , I mean . Okay . It's bigger than the average mobile , I guess . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  But , yeah , it can get lost . 
D:  The mobiles get lost all the time . 
C:  Yeah . Okay , yeah , two is fine . 
D:  But then you ring 'em and you find them . <laugh> So  
B:  Mm . Mm . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Yeah . So , that's that . So that's the evaluation , so I'd say  Yay . 
B:  <laugh> We've , we've done well . 
A:  Alright it's all all systems go . 
D:  It's like <other>  like a number one . Um . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Number one product . 
C:  Mm . 
A:  <laugh> We can't fail . 
D:  All done , thanks . We fitted all the criterias . <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  <other>  . 
D:  Yeah , so  
A:  Well done , Reissa . 
D:  So that's that one . 
topic_description:	evaluation of prototype(s)_None


A:  Okay , I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it , you know , both individually and as a team . You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments , um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , psp , you know , especially you two . That's all , you know , gone very very well and and and be you know , has been good communication going on . <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion , but we we kept  we tried to keep it cool and and 
B:  <other> 
A:  <laugh> Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about ? <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  just just  <laugh> We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and  
B:  Well . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  You know  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Fantastic . 
C:  Now you guys have been a a great team . Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams ,  . 
B:  It is  . 
D:   been cool . 
A:  I think  So I I , you know , and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , we haven't  we're not just rehashing an old design . 
D:  <laugh> In four diff in in four meetings . Funny , all designer meetings could be this quick . 
A:  Yeah . You know , maybe this isn't a simulation , maybe this is actually  so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just , yeah ,  they get   
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote . <laugh> 
D:  They're using our ideas . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Yeah ,  two years' time this will be on the market . Ex exactly that product um thum  we'll go , yeah , we designed that and no-one will believe us . <laugh> But um  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> So at this stage , I mean , is this the last meeting of the project ? We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something ? 
D:  Yeah .  
A:  No , I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in . <laugh> Or six , uh  
D:  <other> 
B:  Y Oh really ? 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Just start summarising now . 
C:  So there's no way to like predict what our  'Cause we had a  we originally had a <other>  As far as our financial uh um goals , we had a specific number for profits that we wanted . It was fifty mil fifty million  
D:  Was it was it fifty or five ? 
C:  I don't remember . But there's not a way to compute that , I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ? 
A:  It gets handed over to another department . What our what our project was was to come up with the product , basically .  the for the  and just basically is it it come  can  is it within budget . When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and , you know , the b the profits and all that that's other departments  it's another team that actually work out the mai the  oh yeah , the  all the guys in the profit sharing , yeah . <laugh> Um . 
D:  Depends how much we sell . 
C:  Uh . Hmm . But we have a vested interest  prof profit sharing <other> . 
A:  Yeah , that's it . You know , we've we've we've made i we've made we've designed the product , we've ma we've got the prototype , it's within budget , it's  does everything that we wanted it to do . It's new , it's it's um 
D:  We finished an hour earlier . <laugh> 
A:  something that uh <other> that isn't out there already . 
C:  I think actually  and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know . We're not we're not you know , tying tying our cart to that one horse  . <laugh> 
D:  Mm . 
A:  <other> <laugh> Yeah . Well , this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that , it's  that it's um , hang on , I wrote it down here somewhere  
D:  Mm . Definitely . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off . Um that , you know , it's marketable in the sense that it's  whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury , our one does the complete opposite , you know , so that's something that's new , which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new . 
C:  Mm . Mm . Mm . It make watching T_V_ healthy . 
A:  Yeah , and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_ , you can f throw it about , you know . It's fine , it's kid proof . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them . 
C:  Uh . 
A:  Well , you can break the ornaments , but you won't break that . <laugh> Yeah . So all in all , I think we've done very well . Well done everybody . 
D:  No  . 
B:  Mm yep . 
D:  Yay . 
C:  Right , you too . 
A:  Um . Drinks are on the company . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Cool . 
A:  In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to . <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> Mm . <laugh> 
B:  Glad to hear that . 
A:  That's it . Well , as far as I t as far as I know . Um . 
C:  That's it . 
D:  Yep . 
A:  Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ? The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ? 
D:  I love it . <laugh> I love it . <laugh> I think it's cool . <other> Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and  it's cool . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> 
D:  Being watched . Um  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Your moment to shine . 
D:  <laugh> Wow . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . I thi you know , I'd I'd n yeah , as we said earlier , I've not  never seen that before .  something that t the whiteboard 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  thingy , <other> that's great . Um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing . I mean it's i or in such a new idea . It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not  it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  Right , I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . Mm . 
C:  <other> 
D:  Logitech .
