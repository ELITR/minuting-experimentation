Okay . 
So , <other> evaluation . 
We're gonna do it all together 
so we evaluate each criteria . 
I've got the criterias . 
And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven , 
one being true , so it's it's more like it's  fits the criteria , 
and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria . 
And the criterias are , 
and I'll draw this up on the board  <other> 
so we have a box  
 . 
And this is false , 
this is just like to keep you informed . 
So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle . 
<other> So the first criteria . 
Do you all get what we're doing ? 
Okay , cool . 
Okay , first criteria , look and feel .

As it  is it colour-wise and is it spongy ? 
So what mark should we give for that ?

Yes . Very good . 
It's one . 
And criteria seven , which is the last one , 
does it get lost ? 
Is it easy to get lost ? 
No ? 
But it is smallish .
