Okay . 
Hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing . 
Um I'm Mandy and I'm the Project Manager . 
And I know all your names again , Courtney , Fenella and Amber . 
Alright . Okay , 
so first let's go through this PowerPoint . 
I wonder what button I press ? 
Yeah ,

Okay , here is our agenda for this meeting . 
Um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions . 
<other> We're gonna get to know each other a little bit better . 
Um tool training , we're going to , I guess , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . 
Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting . 
Okay , here is our project . 
We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original , trendy and also user-friendly . 
And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um  
We're gonna have  discuss the functional design first , <other> how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate T_V_ , blah blah blah . 
And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . 
Same thing with conceptual design . 
Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet . 
That's pretty much the the whole process for today . 
And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . 
Okay . Alright . 
First we're gonna start off by using our tools . 
And the whiteboard thing , do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here . 
Alright , let's go forward then . 
Um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal . 
Even if you are not a good drawer like me . 
<laugh> Alright . 
Um . 
Bless you . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Oh do I . 
<laugh> 
'Kay , about one more minute . 
<other> Okay . 
Okay . 
And who would like to start us off ? 
Alright . 
<laugh> Only if they're piranhas . 
Alright . 
Who wants to go next ? 
No , it looks like a cat . 
I love cats , too . 
I'm a cat person . 
Uh . 
If you're around one  
I had a roommate who was um allergic , but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it , you know , 
it's weird . 
Okay . <cough> 
Okay , Fenella ? 
Badger . Good choice . 
Why a badger ? 
<laugh> 
Alright . 
Okay . 
And I'm last . 
'Kay . Look at my sad sad giraffe . 
No , no , no , 
it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur , 
but whatever . 
I don't know even much about giraffes , but I just love the way they look . 
They're just such odd creatures , you know . 
I I like that they're so unique and individual , I guess . 
I don't know much about their behaviour or anything , though . 
Only seen a couple in zoos . 
Yeah , but you can appreciate the way they look . 
Okay . Alright . 
Guess we're getting straight back into business here . 
Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro , 
and our profit aim is fifty million Euro . 
We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States , in Europe , in Asia . 
And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote . 
Okay . 
So we're gonna talk for a little while . 
Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss . 
Expe our experiences with remote controls um , our first ideas about this new remote , 
anything that you can bring to the table for this project . 
So . 
Yeah . 
You wanna start us off ? 
Anybody have anything to offer ? 
Right . 
TiVo . 
They're never universal . That's right . 
Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product , D_V_D_ player , say , usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the  
Yeah . Yeah . 
Something from Sam's club . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
'Kay , 
and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand . 
If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't  Nobody wants to buy those any more . 
They want the ergonomic ones . 
Yeah . 
Ones that ones that look high-tech , too . 
Right . 
So that people like my mother can use it . 
Yeah . 
'Kay . 
Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that  
Yeah  . <laugh> That's true . 
Do some of them use triple A_s though ? 
Okay . 
Okay . Yeah . 
But that has to do with the size of it too . 
Well , w as long as we know that issue is  
Here we can  
Triple A . 
But 
it's okay , we don't have to decide about it now , 
just as long as we remember battery type and size is important . 
Hey . 
Anything else ? 
Alright . 
Moving along . 
Oh , 
we're closing the meeting . 
Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes . 
Here's what we're going to do . 
Um the I_D_ , 
which is who ? 
Okay , 
you're going to think about the working design . 
What do you think that means ? <laugh> 
Okay . 
And U_I_D_ , the technical fun functions design , 
making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things . 
Okay . 
And the marketing person , that's Courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification . 
I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for . 
Right ? 
I would think so . Okay . 
And you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while . 
Okay , so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting ? 
Okay . This meeting is officially over .
