Very artistic .

Uh , it's p 
It's pretty good uh  
 <laugh> An artist . 
Think you uh picked the wrong uh function . Wrong job . 
<laugh> 
Wha 
<laugh> That's enough , 
thanks . <laugh> 
I wonder . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I'm gonna design a remote uh <laugh> remote control animal . <laugh> 
<laugh> Oh . <cough> 
Sorry . 
Yeah . 
That that might be easier . 
But at the other hand , uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , 
and  
I think it's easier to draw . 
Yeah . With a pen than with a mouse mouse . 
Mouth . 
Oh , okay . 
Yeah . 
W with this paper it's too mu too expensive . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
It's a rabbit with uh broken legs ? <laugh> 
Yeah . It will do . 
Project Manager ? Uh  
Have you been uh counting the time ? 
Okay . 
Let's go on then . 
<laugh> 
It's pretty abstract . 
<other> <laugh> 
Like how much ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . I think so . 
Uh but I have some points . 
Can I show them on the on the big screen ? Maybe ? 
Yeah . Yeah , I can find  Uh . 
Screen ? 
Okay . 
Okay , 
I have some uh points from marketing point of view . 
Um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive , uh small , fairly cheap . 
Uh it's pretty cheap , twenty five Euros . 
Uh brand independent . Um I think , it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your T_V_ or other thing is . Um  
Five minutes ? 
Okay , 
I'll wrap it up quickly . 
Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose . 
Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose . 
And uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , 
and distinguish from uh from current products . 
Um maybe some other technology than infrared . 
Uh I rather find it very annoying um , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it . 
Um <other> think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth . 
That might be a little bit uh expensive . Um  
And something like an L_C_D_ screen . 
Um uh like I said here um  Maybe it's easy . 
It's nice as an added feature feature , 
that um , <other> when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or  
From my point of view , yeah . 
Yeah , 
it has to be 
uh  Yeah , 
our company is very uh good in making new innovative uh things . 
So i i i i 
To the current market . 
Look , 
<other> you got some cheap uh remote controls there . 
They just uh  
Yeah , 
you got a dozen of 'em . 
But when you enter a new market with a remote control and 
uh wanna gain market share 
you have to do something special , I think . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , of course . 
But it's  
But but this is just from marketing uh aspect . 
I don't know anything about user interface or <laugh> design . 
<laugh> 
<other> Mm uh 
I I don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . Uh  
I think th that's a pha 
Yeah . 
That's a phase further . 
Ju just uh 
make some mock-ups , some some general ideas . 
And and then we can plan  
Yeah . 
We can plan further , I think . 
Mm yeah . 
I don't know . 
You decide . <laugh> 
You're the Project Manager . 
Uh tha that's a same step further . 
Yeah . 
Uh . 
Yeah . 
Like 
we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . 
And then in the next meeting we decide 
w what it's gonna be . 
A 
And then you s then you can delete uh 
the o the obsolete uh details . 
I think . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Damn . 
Success ? <laugh>
