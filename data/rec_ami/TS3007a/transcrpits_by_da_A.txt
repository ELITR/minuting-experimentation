Hello . 
Good morning . 
Uh before I start with the with the meeting I have a few things to tell you about the the setting we're in , 
uh because we're uh being watched by uh Big Brother . 
So um  
Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
This 
uh  These are cameras , 
so are these . 
This thing uh that looks like a pie , 
are actually all microphones . 
So 
you must be careful with uh with uh all this . 
And uh as I can see you uh you have placed your laptops uh exactly on the place where it must be . 
And that has to do with the camera settings , 
so we don't have our uh laptops in front of the cameras . 
And  
Indeed . 
So they can see our faces . 
<other> Okay . 
Welcome at the kick-off meeting . 
My name is uh Danny Wolfs . 
<other> Uh this is the agenda for today . 
Uh first a little opening . 
Uh I will introduce myself , 
uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself . 
Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance , acquaintance to uh to to ourselves . 
So uh we get to know each other . 
Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards . 
Then the project plan . 
What we're going to do , 
and how we're going to do it . 
Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end . 
<other> Okay uh , 
my name is uh Danny Wolfs . 
I'm the Project Manager . 
What's your name ? 
User interface , okay . 
Industrial , yes . 
Okay , 
thank you . 
First a little about the project aim . 
Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control . 
Uh maybe you have read uh read the website . 
It's a very uh , yeah , very uh ambitious uh company . 
They uh they wanna do something else . 
I w 
Uh there must be a new remote control . 
Uh first of all uh it must be original , uh and trendy . 
That's two things really uh close to each other . 
But at the same time uh user-friendly . 
And they have uh  
Yeah , 
that's uh very important uh for them . 
Uh there are three stages . 
There is a functional design . 
So uh 
what are we going uh to uh to do ? 
What are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote ? 
And why are we going to do it ? 
Then the conceptual design . 
How are going to do it ? 
<other> And that's uh really global . 
Uh because at the detailed design , how , part two , uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of  If it's uh it's possible technical-wise . 
Uh each stage is uh <other> uh is broken up in two uh two stages , individual work and a meeting . 
So it's uh it's very straightforward . 
<other> Okay , 
the tool training . 
We have two smart boards . <other> 
This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had . 
Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing . 
So uh 
we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme . 
<other> This is called a smart board 
thing uh  
Yeah , 
it speaks for itself . 
Um and as you uh may have heard , the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen . Not in y the the My Documents . 
So if you wanna show something , put it in the shared folder . 
<other> Uh  This uh is  very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . 
Well , 
I don't uh gonna explain it all , 
because I think you know uh how it works . 
Um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here , uh all must be saved . 
We we may not delete anything . 
So uh if you have uh drawn something , save it . 
Never delete it . 
That's a very important uh thing . 
Okay . Uh 
little uh little <other> kinda exercise to uh know each other . 
<laugh> At uh the white board on the left . Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal , 
<other> and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal . 
Uh important is that we use different colours , <other> and uh different pen widths . Widths . Widths . 
Yes ? 
Yeah . 
No no no . 
It's uh it's uh <other>  I I 
I must do it . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
'Cause we uh really don't know each other , 
and uh it's kinda new . 
So getting used to each other , we can uh have a little fun then , 
before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff . 
That kind of thing . 
Would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal ? 
<other> Okay , okay . 
Yeah , okay . 
Drawing goes with uh this thing . 
Do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here . 
That's uh important . 
So hold it uh like this . 
Yeah , kinda . <laugh> 
So , <other> um  
You must p p uh push a little uh  Good . 
Because  
And uh wait uh wait a few seconds . 
It's not uh fully real-time , 
so uh watch it . 
Oh yeah . 
Well 
I'm gonna paint in the red . 
Oh . 
That's the background colour . <laugh> 
Well , 
undo . 
Um  
The pen ? No . 
One minute please . <laugh> 
Yeah , that's the one . Well , five . 
Okay . 
<other> 
<laugh> My favourite animal huh ? 
Yeah , 
you can guess what it is . 
<laugh> May uh paint uh next . 
<laugh> No , it's not an orc . <laugh> 
You don't see it uh at the ears ? 
You have an orc at home ? 
Thank you . 
So 
it's a cat . <laugh> 
Simba . 
'Cause uh we have a cat at home 
and he's called Simba . 
'Cause he looks like the uh the the lion from The Lion King . 
So we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion . 
He's happy with us , 
so uh 
he's smiling . 
No , 
only the face . 
Because we have we have twen twenty five minutes . 
So we uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay , 
who wants to go next ? 
Yeah ? 
So 
choose a colour , 
choose a pen width 
and draw 
a  
Yeah . 
Save it , okay . 
Kind of firm touch . 
Yeah . 
Because uh my cat is red uh at home . 
And I have red hair , 
so uh must be red . 
<laugh> 
It is a turtle . 
Why a turtle ? Why ? Tim ? 
<laugh> You watched it a lot ? 
You watched it a lot ? 
It's a scared turtle . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Okay , Tim . Thank you . <laugh> 
Jurgen , you want to go next ? 
Format ? 
And then you have the the current colour , 
you can change . 
So no red or green . 
And uh line uh width . 
I had five . 
Tim had  
Uh Tim , what kinda line width did you have ? 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
It's a dog . 
Okay . 
Why a dog ? 
You have a dog at home ? 
Had a dog ? 
Yeah ? 
Ah . 
You have an artistic uh inner middle . 
 <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
So I think you can see it's real uh really a easy programme to use . Not difficult at all . 
Okay , 
thank you . <laugh> 
Janus ? The last one ? 
Yeah . 
After a cat , a turtle and a dog . 
I think he's gonna draw an elephant . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Uh-oh . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
 
No . 
Better to draw with a with  
<laugh> 
But what is he uh ? 
Is it a rabbit ? 
Do you have a rabbit at home ? 
Is it a white rabbit f 
It's the white rabbit from The Matrix . 
Okay , then yeah . 
Okay . 
Finishing touch 
and then we're going further . 
Yeah ? 
Yeah , a little . <laugh> 
Well , 
I think the dog is the the most uh artistic . 
Don't choose for youself . 
That's selfish . 
Okay , 
now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff . 
<other> Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro , 
and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro . 
So uh 
from my point of view , I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech , high definition , uh ultra modern uh kinda remote , for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro . 
<other> Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million Euro . 
So that's a lot . 
We have to sell uh a lot of uh  
Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five , uh uh you got two million , two million remotes . 
But our marketing range is uh , market range is international . 
So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh 
we can sell our r remotes to . 
At least that uh countries which have uh a television . 
Um  So 
now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things . 
You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home . 
What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature . 
What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . 
Um so uh 
let's uh let's uh discuss a little . 
I'm gonna join you at the table . 
<other> Well 
what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control ? 
Okay . 
So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio 
and  Or just only  
If you have them on uh  I can uh  
Okay . 
Oh , 
in case you want it  This is a dead kind of fly . Between the the the , yeah , the the uh  
Yeah , be The screens . 
<laugh> No no no . 
Only  
All the drawings go there , at the left uh  
 
Oh , that pen drawings . 
Uh no , 
I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Five minutes . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . Okay . 
Okay . 
So it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh 
remote ? 
Yeah , 
it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ? 
Yeah . 
So yeah , 
I I agree with you . 
So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to  
Yeah . 
No . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But we have to keep an eye that it's  
Uh at the beginning of such a project , it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool . 
<other> Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh  
Yeah okay . Yeah . Okay . 
 And that's because we have him . <laugh> 
Okay , 
uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes . 
So uh 
you uh will have uh individual actions 
where I presume uh will be some feedback , uh via the m the mail . 
Um <other> the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design . 
<other> Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions . 
So 
that's the thing we uh discussed . 
Yeah ? 
Okay . 
Um wha 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But maybe , because uh you are working on the user requirements , 
you are working on the technical functions , 
we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh  
How do you call it ? Uh  
Uh a little plan on on what we're going to do . 
So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all . 
Some basic things we co we want to going to do . 
Uh I think that's well uh  Yeah . 
Will come in handy . 
Okay . 
W <other> He says  
Yeah . 
Well , 
th that's that's really a step further . 
But if you say uh <other> is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose , that's a  
Why ? 
Why ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
So uh 
each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important . 
And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting . 
I must finish off now , 
so it's over . 
You uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach . 
And I see you in uh thirty minutes . 
Thank you . 
<laugh> Be careful .
