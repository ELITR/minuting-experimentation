A:  uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself . 
A:  Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance , acquaintance to uh to to ourselves . 
A:  Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards . 
A:  Then the project plan . 
A:  Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end . 
A:  Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control . 
A:  Uh first of all uh it must be original , uh and trendy . 
A:  But at the same time uh user-friendly . 
A:  Uh there are three stages . 
A:  There is a functional design . 
A:  Then the conceptual design . 
abst_sum - abstract: The Project Manager introduced the aim of the project and gave a brief agenda for the entire project.

A:  the tool training . 
A:  Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing . 
A:  This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had . 
A:  We have two smart boards . <other> 
A:  Um and as you uh may have heard , the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen . Not in y the the My Documents . 
A:  <other> Uh  This uh is  very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . 
abst_sum - abstract: He then introduced and explained how to use the meeting-room materials.

A:  little uh little <other> kinda exercise to uh know each other . 
A:  <laugh> At uh the white board on the left . Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal , 
A:  <other> and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal . 
A:  Uh important is that we use different colours , <other> and uh different pen widths . Widths . Widths . 
A:  and he's called Simba . 
D:  <laugh> Miniature size ? 
A:  So we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion . 
A:  It is a turtle . 
D:  Um  'Cause I liked Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles . 
A:  It's a dog . 
B:  we had a dog , a few years ago . 
B:  when it died we didn't get a new one or something . 
A:  It's the white rabbit from The Matrix . 
C:  Yeah , exactly . <laugh> 
abst_sum - abstract: The group acquainted themselves with the materials by drawing on the smartboard.

A:  <other> Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro , 
A:  and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro . 
A:  from my point of view , I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech , high definition , uh ultra modern uh kinda remote , for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro . 
A:  <other> Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million Euro . 
A:  Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five , uh uh you got two million , two million remotes . 
abst_sum - abstract: The Project Manager presented the project budget and explained that the device would not be made very high-tech due to the small budget.

A:  But our marketing range is uh , market range is international . 
A:  So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh 
A:  we can sell our r remotes to . 
abst_sum - abstract: He explained that the device would be sold internationally.

A:  now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things . 
A:  You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home . 
A:  What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature . 
A:  What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . 
B:  I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . 
B:  And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . Uh  
A:  So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio 
D:  Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose . 
D:  And uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , 
D:  and distinguish from uh from current products . 
D:  Um maybe some other technology than infrared . 
D:  Uh I rather find it very annoying um , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it . 
D:  Um <other> think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth . 
D:  That might be a little bit uh expensive . Um  
D:  And something like an L_C_D_ screen . 
D:  that um , <other> when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or  
A:  it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ? 
D:  <other> you got some cheap uh remote controls there . 
D:  you got a dozen of 'em . 
D:  But when you enter a new market with a remote control and 
D:  uh wanna gain market share 
D:  you have to do something special , I think . 
A:  Uh at the beginning of such a project , it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool . 
A:  <other> Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh  
B:  And and the price .  
abst_sum - abstract: The group discussed their initial ideas of features to include in the design; the Marketing Expert discussed usability features, such as the ability to control multiple devices and an LCD screen, to make the product unique.

D:  Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose . 
A:  uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes . 
A:  you uh will have uh individual actions 
A:  Um <other> the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design . 
A:  <other> Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions . 
abst_sum - abstract: The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to work on the working design and the User Interface Designer to research the technical functions.

B:  we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make . 
C:  I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually . 
D:  That's a phase further . 
D:  make some mock-ups , some some general ideas . 
A:  But maybe , because uh you are working on the user requirements , 
A:  you are working on the technical functions , 
A:  we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh  
B:  Consensus on the , what we're gonna do . 
A:  So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all . 
D:  I don't know . 
B:  if the technical functions have to be designed , I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be . 
A:  th that's that's really a step further . 
D:  we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . 
D:  And then in the next meeting we decide 
D:  And then you s then you can delete uh 
D:  the o the obsolete uh details . 
A:  each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important . 
A:  And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting .
