topic_description:	other_participant names


A:  First a little about the project aim . Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control . Uh maybe you have read uh read the website . It's a very uh , yeah , very uh ambitious uh company . They uh they wanna do something else . I w Uh there must be a new remote control . Uh first of all uh it must be original , uh and trendy . That's two things really uh close to each other . But at the same time uh user-friendly . And they have uh  Yeah , that's uh very important uh for them . Uh there are three stages . There is a functional design . So uh what are we going uh to uh to do ? What are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote ? And why are we going to do it ? Then the conceptual design . How are going to do it ? <other> And that's uh really global . Uh because at the detailed design , how , part two , uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of  If it's uh it's possible technical-wise . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh each stage is uh <other> uh is broken up in two uh two stages , individual work and a meeting . So it's uh it's very straightforward . 
topic_description:	project specs and roles of participants_None


A:  <other> Okay , the tool training . We have two smart boards . <other> This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had .

D:  <laugh> Speaks for itself . 
A:  thing uh  Yeah , it speaks for itself . Um and as you uh may have heard , the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen . Not in y the the My Documents . So if you wanna show something , put it in the shared folder . <other> Uh  This uh is  very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . Well , I don't uh gonna explain it all , because I think you know uh how it works . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here , uh all must be saved . We we may not delete anything . So uh if you have uh drawn something , save it . Never delete it . That's a very important uh thing .

A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh-oh . 
B:  Uh-oh . Oh , he is the artistic  design . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <other> 
D:  I'm gonna design a remote uh <laugh> remote control animal . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Remote control animal . 
C:  <laugh> Exactly . Uh  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Oh . <cough> Sorry . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Well with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there uh . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:   
D:  That that might be easier . But at the other hand , uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , and  
A:  No . 
D:  I think it's easier to draw . Yeah . With a pen than with a mouse mouse . 
A:  Better to draw with a with  
B:  Than on the , with  Yeah , I m I mean like uh like on here , drawing drawing uh . And then displaying on screen , but  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Mouth . Oh , okay . Yeah . W with this paper it's too mu too expensive . <laugh> 
A:  But what is he uh ? Is it a rabbit ?

D:  <laugh> 
A:  Do you have a rabbit at home ?

D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Oh , sorry . <laugh> 
A:  Don't choose for youself . That's selfish . 
topic_description:	drawing exercise_None


A:  Okay , now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff . 
D:  It's pretty abstract . 
A:  <other> Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro , and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro . So uh from my point of view , I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech , high definition , uh ultra modern uh kinda remote , for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro . 
D:  <other> <laugh> 
A:  <other> Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million Euro . So that's a lot . We have to sell uh a lot of uh  
B:  Yeah , how much is it ? Hundred million uh remotes or something ? 
D:  Like how much ? 
A:  Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five , uh uh you got two million , two million remotes . But our marketing range is uh , market range is international . So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh 
B:  Oh yeah . 
C:  Twenty million . Two million , oh yeah , two million . Yeah . 
A:  we can sell our r remotes to . At least that uh countries which have uh a television . 
D:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	project budget_None


A:  Um  So now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things . You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home . What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature . What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . Um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little . I'm gonna join you at the table . 
A:  So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to  
B:  <other> We  
D:  So i i i i To the current market . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Look , <other> you got some cheap uh remote controls there . They just uh  Yeah , you got a dozen of 'em . 
A:  No . 
D:  But when you enter a new market with a remote control and 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  uh wanna gain market share 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  you have to do something special , I think . 
A:  Yeah . But we have to keep an eye that it's  Uh at the beginning of such a project , it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool . <other> Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh  
D:  Yeah . Yeah , of course . But it's  But but this is just from marketing uh aspect . 
B:  And and the price .  
A:  Yeah okay . Yeah . Okay . 
D:  I don't know anything about user interface or <laugh> design . 
B:  <laugh> Okay . 
A:   And that's because we have him . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> And and him . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  And him . <laugh> 
topic_description:	discussion_None


A:  <other> Well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control ? 
B:  Um well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . Uh  
A:  Okay . So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and  Or just only  
D:  Yeah . I think so . Uh but I have some points . Can I show them on the on the big screen ? Maybe ? 
A:  If you have them on uh  I can uh  
D:  Yeah . Yeah , I can find  Uh . 
A:  Okay . Oh , in case you want it  This is a dead kind of fly . Between the the the , yeah , the the uh  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Screen ? Okay . 
A:  Yeah , be The screens . 
B:  Is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen ? 
A:  <laugh> No no no . Only  All the drawings go there , at the left uh  
B:  Uh but um which  The ones we made on the  
A:   Oh , that pen drawings . Uh no , I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there . Yeah . 
B:  Oh , only in Word , okay . 
D:  Okay , I have some uh points from marketing point of view . Um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive , uh small , fairly cheap . Uh it's pretty cheap , twenty five Euros . Uh brand independent . Um I think , it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your T_V_ or other thing is . Um  
A:  Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Five minutes . Yeah . 
D:  Five minutes ? Okay , I'll wrap it up quickly . Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose . Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose . And uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from uh from current products . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Um maybe some other technology than infrared . Uh I rather find it very annoying um , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it . Um <other> think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth . 
A:  Okay . Okay . 
D:  That might be a little bit uh expensive . Um  And something like an L_C_D_ screen . 
B:  For what purpose ? 
D:  Um uh like I said here um  Maybe it's easy . It's nice as an added feature feature , that um , <other> when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or  
A:  Okay . So it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh 
D:  From my point of view , yeah . 
A:  remote ? Yeah , it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ? 
D:  Yeah , it has to be uh  Yeah , our company is very uh good in making new innovative uh things . 
A:  Yeah . So yeah , I I agree with you . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  Okay , uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes . So uh you uh will have uh individual actions where I presume uh will be some feedback , uh via the m the mail . Um <other> the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design . <other> Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions . So that's the thing we uh discussed . Yeah ? 
B:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	closing_None


B:  Um one thing uh , we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make . Do we  Are we going to use um it it for multiple systems ? Or uh  We should have some agreement on that before we  
A:  Okay . Um wha 
D:  <other> Mm uh I I don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . Uh  
C:  I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually . 
D:  I think th that's a pha Yeah . That's a phase further . Ju just uh 
B:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  make some mock-ups , some some general ideas . And and then we can plan  
B:  Ah okay . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  We can plan further , I think . 
A:  Yeah . But maybe , because uh you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh  How do you call it ? Uh  
B:  Consensus on the , what we're gonna do . 
A:  Uh a little plan on on what we're going to do . So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all . Some basic things we co we want to going to do . Uh I think that's well uh  Yeah . Will come in handy . 
D:  Mm yeah . I don't know . You decide . <laugh> You're the Project Manager . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . W <other> He says  
B:  Well yeah , if the technical functions have to be designed , I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be . Or do we use it a text screen ? Or uh will it be with uh with bluetooth or  
A:  Yeah . Well , th that's that's really a step further . But if you say uh <other> is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose , that's a  
B:  Okay . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Uh tha that's a same step further . 
C:  Yeah , actually it is . 
A:  Why ? 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Why ? 
C:  <other> Then looking at individual components , so that's actually a f step further . 
D:  Uh . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Like we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . And then in the next meeting we decide 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , we can take it from there . Yeah , I agree uh , we can take it from there . 
D:  w what it's gonna be . A 
A:  Okay . 
D:  And then you s then you can delete uh 
C:  Or edit . 
D:  the o the obsolete uh details . 
A:  Okay . So uh each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important . And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting . 
D:  I think . Yeah . Yeah .
