Yep . 
Well 
there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there 
<laugh> 
Ah 
that's it , 
yep . 
And then you have to press function F_ eight 
I think it is on your laptop . 
That's it . 
Repetitive strain injury . 
Repetitive strain injury . 
So if you  
Cheers . 
Here we go . 
Right so 
I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um . 
We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . 
It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , 
so i it's basically a communication device . 
We we tell the remote control what we want to do , 
it sends a message to the television 
saying change the channel , 
change the volume , 
uh yeah , 
adjust these settings , 
adjust the brightness . 
Um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ? 
First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . 
We need to know what our final product is gonna be like , 
so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does , 
uh how it works , 
and what the end-user is gonna want from this product . 
Um . Oh , 
a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , 
um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about 
h how well these particular prototypes work , 
uh sorta find out what people think of 'em . 
Um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience . Um , 
and different different people sort of prefer different things . 
Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment . 
When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . 
So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design 
uh so that we're not completely shocking people . 
But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas 
uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out . 
Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . 
Uh the first of these is is technological 
ye 
uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is . 
The second is is economic , 
uh we need to find a balance between features and price . 
So 
as you mentioned 
things like voice recognition would would add to the price 
uh but it would also im improve the design of the product . 
So 
I had a look on the  on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . 
In analysing these we can consider what what things  what's good about them , 
uh what things do they get right , 
what's bad about them , 
what's wrong with 'em , 
um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found 
and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls . 
Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum . 
Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control , 
so it's one that's got lots of buttons , 
it's it's fully featured , 
everything you might possibly want to do is there , 
you know , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , uh freeze frame . 
Yeah , 
it's it's fully featured 
and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , 
but once you've learned it you can  you can do whatever you want with your T_V_ . 
The one on the right is a lot more basic . 
It's just got the essential functions of the T_V_ changing the channel , play , stop , volume . 
It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , 
but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts . 
There are disadvantages , 
you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture . 
Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control . 
So we've got to to find our  find a way of striking a balance between the two . 
Um as I said before , remote controls are subjective , 
different people want want different things . 
Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple , 
it it's easy to use , 
uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel . 
It it does everything that I need it to uh , 
as I said before , I'm quite lazy , 
I don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television . 
I also want something that that looks cool , 
um and that that feels good , 
that's ergonomically designed . 
<laugh> 
I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool . 
And I think that's that's why companies like Apple've 've 've made a lot of progress . 
Uh that was just on the d on the company web site , yeah . 
<laugh> 
What's up ? 
Lefty loosey . 
Uh . 
<laugh> Never heard that before , 
that's good . <laugh> 
I'll think of that every time now . 
<laugh> 
You don't have it in the States ? 
Oh , 
I didn't realise . 
Um yeah , 
it's like a  
I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser . 
Um you have like you have uh numbers on your remote control , 
uh y and you type in the page number you want , 
so like you type a hundred on your remote control and 
this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it . 
And you just type numbers to go to different pages 
and it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing . 
Yep , 
news headlines . 
It's earl it's pretty old technology . 
It's like nineteen eighties . 
<laugh> 
Right . 
So what's our corporate image like ? 
It's  It's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics . 
It's like double R_ . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Is it  is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television 
or is it something that comes w with a television ? 
'Cause that would affect the way that we market it . 
Right . 
Right , okay . 
Yeah . 
Um . 
I I would say no , 
because it's gonna add too much to the price . 
Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product , people are gonna be paying 
uh , well , uh 
we've got a price limit of  was it twelve twelve and a half Euros for  to produce it ? 
And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
The remote  
There are remote controls like that , 
yeah . 
Like some T_V_s they have a sort of uh a sliding screen on the remote control of it 
that hides all the complicated buttons . 
So if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it , then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down 
and there's all the  all the special buttons . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I think that's a good idea , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Si simplicity and fashion . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
It's , yeah , it's pretty it's pretty high-tech . 
 
It's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , 
who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote . 
Yep . 
I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages . 
I mean , we we said simplicity is is one of the features , 
so it's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , 
and that might be older people , 
but then we've also got fashion , 
which is something that definitely appeals to younger people . 
Yeah . Yeah aim for a  an income group . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Which are kind of hidden away in some way 
or well not hidden but they're uh they're not as prominent as the main features . 
We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all . 
I suspect the remote control does need a battery , 
but 
I dunno if you can  
Yeah . 
Yeah , without the energy , yeah . 
Yeah , that's that's possible . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
<laugh>
