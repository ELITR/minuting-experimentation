Here we go . 
Welcome everybody . 
Um , I'm Abigail Claflin . 
You can call me Abbie . 
'S see . PowerPoint , that's not it . 
There we go . 
So this is our kick off meeting . Um 
and I guess we should all get acquainted <laugh> . 
<other> Let's  shall we all introduce ourselves ? 
I think we'll get around to that , yeah . 
So this is just introductions yeah . 
Okay . 
I forgot to s say I'm the Project Manager but I figured you all knew that already , 
<laugh> um so . 
Okay . 
Um so f here's our agenda for today . 
Um we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close . 
<laugh> Um so . 
So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . 
And to do this , we have to  um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . 
So . 
We'll get to that . 
Oh there it is . 
Right . Functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . 
So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . 
Um <other> so we're gonna try out our white board . 
If we'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal . 
Okay . 
<other> 
Yeah . Both . Yeah <laugh> . 
Any volunteers ? 
Does anyone know what they wanna draw ? <laugh> 
<laugh> I don't think so . 
 
A dolphin . 
<laugh> 'S like playing Pictionary . 
<laugh> So what characteristics do you like about your animal ? <laugh> 
<laugh> 
They're graceful . 
Sleek <laugh> . 
I don't know how intelligent that one looks <laugh> . 
Yes . 
<laugh> Does anybody else wanna draw their animal ? 
<laugh> 
<other> . 
Uh-oh there goes the ten . 
<laugh> It's a cat . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Do you wanna  anything ? 
I dunno if the the  
ah . 
A horse . 
That's very good . 
 Yeah . 
This cord's   
Uh . Right . 
Actually I haven't thought of anything yet <laugh> . 
Uh  
It's a pig . 
<laugh> So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's 
water resistant , strong and furry . 
What do you think , yeah ? 
This is  
yeah , well like a cat , you know , soft yeah . 
<laugh> Although  
uh I'll just put there . 
Right . 
 Oh my gosh , this is disastrous . 
Sorry about that . 
<other> Okay . 
<other> So moving on . 
Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro 
and profit aim is fifty million Euro . 
So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country <laugh> . 
Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally . 
Um selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro . 
Anyone a mathematician ? <laugh> 
So f that's a fifty percent um uh . 
Um , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show . 
Experience with remote control . 
So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . 
Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not  yeah . 
What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it 
and you could  
I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . 
You know like a portable phone has a base , 
like just to have a home for it . 
<laugh> 'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_ , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_ , so  
Yeah <laugh> . 
 
Yeah . 
Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ? 
Like 
Hand 
hand held size , yeah . 
Not not huge , but <laugh> 
Huh . 
<laugh> 
Little homing device . <laugh> <Makes buzzing sound.> Um . 
Okay . 
So what do we think this remote control should  
Five minutes . 
Till the meeting  oh right . 
This is what we have left . 
Um , oh we just  
Yeah . 
You  
what if um may be a little fancy 
but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . 
Like the way a mobile phone does . 
So you could like um  like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can  the way you do it on your radio is that you uh  
what do you call it  
s y yeah but you can programme , 
so you can programme like your favourite channels , 
so like if you had a s 
That's something we could decide . Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Right . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
I mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point  twelve fifty for  to actually make the device . 
Um but it's something to think about , yeah . 
I mean we'll have to see how much that would be . 
Yeah . 
Oh I was just  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your  
like that's another  
Um . We should probably start wrapping up , 
um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . 
Um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , 
which will be in another thirty minutes . Um . 
So . 
Yeah . 
The Industrial Designer , 
what does that stand for , I_D_ , 
yeah 
<laugh> um is going to be looking more into the working design . 
So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . 
The 
something , 
what is the U_I_ ? 
Yeah , what does it stand for again ? 
User Interface Designer . 
So that's gonna be 
more technical . 
I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w 
Yeah , yeah . 
Um , I guess you'd have to find out <other> . 
Mm . 
And the M_E_ , what does that stand for <laugh> ? M 
Marketing , right . Um <laugh> . 
So we'll be working on the user requirements , um  
Yeah . 
So I guess that wraps it up . 
I'll see you all in thirty minutes . 
I just did .
