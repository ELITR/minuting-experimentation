He's a  <other> I dunno um they're  I think it's cool the the um <other> the interaction that or the th things that  the reasons people seem to like you know  you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they're like oh look there's dolphins and it's kinda like <laugh>  but they're you know they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals , but they swim .  <laugh>

B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  <other> 
B:  I don't know . They sleep all day , <laugh> they're easy to draw <laugh> . 
A:  <laugh> Do you wanna  anything ? I dunno if the the  ah . 
D:  Uh yeah . Well I had the cat as well , but uh I've got a spare one . 
B:  I think the pen is running out of  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  So I'll use the spare one . Um but it's harder to draw  um . 
C:  And the pen's dying <laugh> . 
D:  Um . 
A:  A horse . 
D:  Uh . 
C:  Horse . 
D:  Um I don't <laugh> really know how the legs go , but anyway I will do that . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  That's very good . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Um , and the main reason is they're pretty . I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment , and I like the way they run and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals . And I like the way um they feel , sort of under under the hand , I think that's pretty much it . Um  
A:   Yeah . This cord's   Uh . Right . Actually I haven't thought of anything yet <laugh> . Uh  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  It's a pig . <laugh> So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  water resistant , strong and furry . What do you think , yeah ? This is  yeah , well like a cat , you know , soft yeah . <laugh> Although  uh I'll just put there . Right . 
C:  And furry . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Textile  tactile , <laugh> tactile remote control . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  You're dragging a  you have a tail <laugh> . 
A:   Oh my gosh , this is disastrous . Sorry about that . <other> 


A:  Okay . <other> So moving on . Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro . So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country <laugh> . Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally . 
C:  Sorry can you just say that  what's the  what are our price goals again ? 
A:  Um selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro . 
C:  Okay . 
D:  How many should we sell then ? <laugh> Um , a lot , two two two million ,  two mi no , more f four million . 
A:  Anyone a mathematician ? <laugh> 
B:  Two million . 
D:  Four million . And it  well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million . 
B:  <cough> Oh , yeah . 
D:  <laugh> It is a lot . Uh . 
A:  So f that's a fifty percent um uh . 


A:  Um , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show . Experience with remote control . So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have . 


A:  Um . We should probably start wrapping up , um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . Um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes . Um . So . Yeah . The Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I_D_ , yeah <laugh> um is going to be looking more into the working design . So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . The 
B:  Yeah I think so . 
A:  something , what is the U_I_ ? Yeah , what does it stand for again ? User Interface Designer . So that's gonna be 
B:  User . 
C:  That's me . Uh , User Interface design . 
A:  more technical . I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w 
C:  So technical function . 
B:  The working design is the structure . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  What is technical functions exactl I I don't really know what  
A:  Um , I guess you'd have to find out <other> . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:   
D:  It says on that email but it  
B:  Um . It was in the email . I wrote down what mine were . 
C:  It does but it  I just don't really  
D:  It said um  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  It said  
C:  <other> What effect should the thing ha should it have , okay . Alright . And working design . Okay . 
D:  Yeah like  Be a medium between you and the telly I think , that's uh
