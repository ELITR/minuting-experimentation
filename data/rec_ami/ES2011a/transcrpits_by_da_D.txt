Hi I'm Chiara , I'm the um Marketing Expert . 
Um , would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? 
We'll get round to that later . 
My name is Chiara and I'm the Marketing Expert . 
I think both . <laugh> 
Who starts ? 
We ought to decide who starts and <laugh> all that . 
No ? 
Uh-huh . 
Uh yeah . 
Well I had the cat as well , but uh I've got a spare one . 
So I'll use the spare one . 
Um but it's harder to draw  um . 
Um . 
Uh . 
Um I don't <laugh> really know how the legs go , 
but anyway I will do that . 
Um , and the main reason is they're pretty . 
I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment , 
and I like the way they run 
and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals . 
And I like the way um they feel , sort of under under the hand , 
I think that's pretty much it . 
Um  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
How many should we sell then ? 
<laugh> Um , a lot , 
two two two million , 
 two mi no , 
more f four million . 
Four million . 
And it  
well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million . 
<laugh> It is a lot . Uh . 
Um , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find 
bec yeah <laugh> bec 
Yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
Yeah . 
And even I think a little light . 
Um or even a  maybe a vib a vibrating thing . 
I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa . 
In which case you're going to be l 
but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound  
I don't know if it's expensive maybe to  
Maybe call is enough . 
But yeah . 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall . 
But that would really make it more expensive . 
But it's only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall . 
Something like that . 
And the other thing is  
Not  
well it needs to be sort of  
Yeah . 
I don't think you need a  
But definitely not  well I don't know . 
No , it can't be , uh-uh . 
<laugh> Like spaceship . 
Oh dear . 
Yeah , yeah yeah . 
Yeah . 
Select . Uh . 
But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen . 
Because  
Because , I don't know if it's  <laugh> 
I think it's e expensive , 
if you have  
if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote , 
and then use the telly as a screen . 
But um  
But yeah for sure . 
Something like not  it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do , 
is that what you mean ? 
Right . Mm . 
Yeah . 
But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap . 
Yeah . 
Or some  it i 
we can find out probably on the internet <laugh> how much it's  
Um . Yeah , 
and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um  
What was the word ? 
Water resistant . 
No but it's  
I thought , ah , spot on . 
Good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel , 
maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot . 
That's quite annoying . 
Yeah , clip . 
Ooh <laugh> . 
Um . 
It says on that email but it  
It said um  
It said  
Yeah 
like  
Be a medium between you and the telly I think , 
that's uh  
Marketing . Oh it's written here , but um . 
Okay .
