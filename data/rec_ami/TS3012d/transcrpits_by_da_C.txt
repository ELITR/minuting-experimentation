I think it's more or less the same as we had . 
No much s 
No no no , not at all . 
Hmm . 
Yeah , of course . 
That's uh the integration story again . 
No , uh 
this is just a description of what we see there . 
So  
Speaks for itself . 
Hmm . 
I d 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Huh . <laugh> 
<other> 
Okay , 
but there's another problem . 
But there's another problem . 
If we take another cover , for instance black , then we also need another button frame , 
'cause black and black doesn't work obviously . 
Huh . 
Huh . Yeah . 
I agree . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Right . 
Mm-hmm . 
Or say let's lose rubber , take plastic . 
Yes . 
Although we are demolishing a little bit the style . 
But  
Yeah . 
Can we then not also uh change the material ? 
We take plastic for the basic cover 
and  
We can put those to the to the other covers . 
That's true . 
But  
okay . 
But what do you then suggest we'd lose ? 
Because we have to lose two things and  I guess . 
Yes . 
Okay , 
and that's enough ? 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Perhaps we should make m 
Huh . 
Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost . 
And that's  uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost , that they know that . 
Perhaps they decide tha 
Of course . 
Perhaps  they uh  
no , 
but perhaps they think uh okay , the cover is such a nice idea , uh let's  that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs . 
We ca we uh we can at least tell them that  
You don't know that . 
Huh . 
No , I'm not uh talking about that cost  
but the one that g has given us the order to design this . 
We could at least m uh make it like this , like you said , 
and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know . It is an  still an option , but <other> not for this price . 
Exactly , 
but  
Hmm . 
I'd say lose the curve and the colour 
and  
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
<other> Oh . 
I agree . 
No . 
Hmm ? 
Yes . 
Huh . 
Hmm . 
Me too , I felt a bit blind throughout the project , 
because in the beginning I had no list of available materials , 
and then I d had not list of available c finances . 
So  
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
One . 
Hmm . 
Manual . 
I think the L_C_D_ display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control , 
but then again , it's for young people . 
So  
Yeah , 
I th 
Exactly . 
No , that's true . 
I think it won't be a big problem . 
Ah . Um  
With the more important functions on . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
 the menus uh  
Things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu , 
because we have no buttons for those . 
Yes . 
Mm . 
Yes . 
Nah , it's not really  only an extra . 
No menus . 
Think about  
Hmm . 
But  M 
Changing covers is also trend that we followed . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
Six . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm , of course . 
Mm-hmm . 
But I think for this price , this is  it's really a reasonable product . 
It's a good product . 
Oh . Oh . Yeah . 
But if pep people really want speech recognition , then they must be prepared to pu to pay more , 
because it's cannot be done for this . 
Hmm yeah . 
Ah 
but for this price uh you cannot ask that . 
You cannot th think of that   
No , it's not . 
Mm-hmm . 
Oh It's also more attractive . 
Hmm . 
Yes . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
Huh . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
That's the same thing that I had in the beginning . 
Everybody was using materials that s I didn't have . 
So  
Oh . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
But there's uh also one problem with this I noticed . 
Uh you have to finish a page before going to a n 
Oh . 
Okay , 
I saw that uh  
Hmm . 
Yeah , 
but I made  
Okay , 
but I made three pages 
and they were not finished . 
And when the third one was finished , I wanted to download it 
and then it was not possible anymore , 
because you have to close all the pinnits uh the pages before going further .   
Exactly . 
So we cannot work on more than one page at same time . That's not possible . 
You have to finish it completely , 
then download it , 
it's  
then start a new one . 
That's not very uh handy , 
but if you know that , then it's not a problem . 
<other> 
Hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Ah . 
Well  
Hmm . 
Huh . 
Yeah . 
 . 
Yeah ,   
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
No . 
 . 
<laugh> Okay , 
bring out the beer . 
I have no more email . 
My coach is uh being very silent now . 
No , 
we haven't think above  about that . 
Huh . It's better than thi I think than a serial number . 
Sony uh T_R_ something uh f means nothing to me . Uh  
Like fruit names . 
<other> Uh at least it's not something with numbers . 
Numbers are so meaningless to the people . 
I mean  
<other>  . 
Real Reaction . 
Real react . 
The Real Reactor , I don't find that uh that bad at all . 
Yeah . 
Because our name is Real Reaction . 
I'm looking for things in the name . 
So that the first three letters are s the same . R_E_A_ R_E_A_ . 
The triple R_ . Real Reaction remotes control . Triple R_ . 
 ? 
 yeah . 
Yeah , 
that  
 .  . 
I think  triple R_ . 
Doesn't sound  ? 
Yeah . 
Ah . 
I think I like it like this more . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
I would  huh . I would lose the C_ 
and just name it triple R_ . 
It sounds like uh thinking about two different things and combining it . 
I would just say triple R_s triple R_ 
That's also short , catchy . 
Banana . <laugh> 
 . 
Yes . 
 did you do now ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Mm-hmm . 
The boss is always the last one to go home . 
So  
See you in a minute . 
Okay . 
Can't we take this one ? 
Otherwise we have to do it all over again . 
Is it okay if I try ? Is that okay with you ? 
I'll put it back in a minute . 
Okay , 
it has been saving something , 
but where to I don't know . 
Oh , can I say exp 
yes , I can . 
Export as J_ PEG . 
 . 
Okay , 
can I not put this wherever I wants . 
My document is the wrong one , huh . 
 . 
I don't think so . 
Document and settings . 
That's a pity . 
That means that we have to gonna draw it again . 
Are you gonna do that ? 
Okay . 
That  
Yes . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yes , that's correct . 
<other> Okay . 
No . 
Oh , it's export . 
Okay . 
Oh , of course . 
Sorry .
