Uh we don't have any changes , 
do we ? 
So no . 
<laugh> 
It's basically what we agreed upon , 
but just a little bit more specified . 
Uh s 
Final design . 
<other> Basically in   what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , 
as you can see right over here . 
We chose a different type of colour for the menu . A bit darker yellow 
so that it com really shows in this keypad . 
If you put them all black , it's not really that good a contrast . 
So  
Probab 
Yeah . 
That's the be 
And it  I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber 
than to uh  
So we have it's a bit round shaped , 
that's what we had 
uh  
We chose the buttons to be uh teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute . 
So that's basically what we chose there . 
If you have anything to add , please interrupt me . 
<other> Oh . 
That's pretty much it . 
Oh sorry . <other> 
I'd say that too . 
Uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample , 
which you can't do with a normal remote control , 
which people already do . 
So  
Well , 
I'd  I tend to disagree with you on that , 
because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this . 
So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . We do . 
We could take out a curve indeed . 
I think the colour is more important than the really the curve , 
because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control  
So black and grey is okay . 
<other> Which we can fabricate , 
okay . 
No , 
we basically  
We need to stick to that . 
But they don't  
Well  
And if we  
So which curve is that 
ba 
that's basically that curve . 
So we could u still have the comfort . 
I second that . 
<other> No , 
that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control . 
So that's not really that   
I would  
Yeah . I would say  I would agree with you on the colour , 
because that's an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money . 
So we can always do that . 
Which is basically what we discussed . 
Yes , 
we could have  
Well 
I hope it sells . <laugh> 
Which are basically accessible through the menu button . 
Yeah . 
Which is not an option . <laugh> 
To make it that way , yeah . 
Mm yeah . 
And it's pretty straight-forward , 
you have a navigation  no keys to navigate through the L_C_D_ menus . 
So  
One I d no , 
actu 
No , 
it it is pretty straight-forward . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well , 
basically the menu options indeed . 
But  
No . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Two or three . 
So  
You can  seven . <laugh>  <laugh> 
Or we could say it  <laugh> 
Or we could say neutral , 
we  'cause we scratched the  
C 
No , we don't have the colour . 
So I  
Yes , 
but the end product  So  
<other> 
Maybe we should go with a two then , 
because it's not perfect , 
because we can't do it initially , 
but we  <other> 
Yeah . 
Overall score . 
Ten , sixteen , divided by  
Is two two third . 
There's  
Yeah , 
if we make it into a four , as in neutral , because we didn't implement it , so we can't say that we  <other> that it's really not well implemented . We come out on a average of two one eighth . 
So 
which is pretty w good . 
It's at least on the positive side . 
So  
We could definitely have done better if we've had more resources , 
but  
Yeah . 
True . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
So did you  
Yeah . 
And we could share information which we received . 
Yeah . 
Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher , 
because  
The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that . 
So  
Oh can you ? Okay . 
Yeah , well 
it could also possibly be  well , is it a more real-time information base , 
so we can all see <other> which information is available to one another . 
Well , 
I personally did not have that , 
but  
That's probably your l description . 
you had that as well . 
But I also didn't  not really . But still , 
Is that we finished up the design 
and then we checked the website , 
and then there was just extra information . 
There was a little delay in the   bit of a c crucial delay . 
How much time do we have for this anyway ? 
Champagne . 
<laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
Product name . 
The bana 
'cause it's not yellow anymore . 
Well , uh 
I was going for the R_C_ deluxe , 
but it's not really a catchy name or anything , 
it's more  
Something with our  company name , 
can we do anything with that ? 
Maybe there's something on the website which will help us out . 
The reaction deluxe . 
<laugh> Is that a name or a c campaign ? <laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Or the  
The real reactor . 
You should write it down as a  an option . 
<laugh> 
So that's one option . 
Should I write the banana down or  <laugh> 
Sure ? 
Well 
I  
Uh do you mean it like  
You mean it like this ? 
Dash C_ ? 
Like a C_ right now or a dash in a C_ ? 
<laugh> 
Is it triple R_C_s ? No . 
Well , 
that's another option . 
Okay , so 
which ones are we going to scratch definitely ? 
<laugh> I say this one as well . 
Triple R_ ? 
Triple R_ it is . 
<cough> 
Yeah , sure . 
I don't really know whether we can save it as a picture or no . 
Sure . 
Network places . 
<other> 
I wouldn't pick that one , no . 
Sure . 
Oh . 
I see you later .
