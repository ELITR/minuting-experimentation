Can I close this ? 
Oh , okay . 
<humming> 
There we go . 
Okay , 
here we are again . 
Detailed design  
oh , come on . 
Well  Ah 
 s 
Forgot to insert the minutes , 
but it's about the same thing we discussed before . Uh  
Could open that anyway , think . 
Other design  
anyway , we took as  we took w we took rubber as as the material last time . 
We also  that you're just busy with it . 
Took the advanced chip to t uh implement the advanced features . 
Well , 
we discussed the design , 
no sharp corners , we rounded it off , 
like you see on the  other screen , 
which is fine . 
Um  we agreed that the colour should be b uh yellow and black . 
Yellow in the back because it's m trendy , more trendy than black anyway . 
So <other> 
then we ca 
yeah . 
We agreed that we would implement both the L_C_D_ and speech recognition , 
but I'll get to that in a moment . 
'Cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway . 
So so , 
like I said , we had no insight in finances , no prices , 
but we have 'em now , 
and it's bad . 
Anyway . 
We are 
Oh . 
Prototype presentation , well first 
you guys built the prototype . 
So <other> 
you could   could present that . 
But um let's see what be handy to do . 
Nee  no , 
you just go ahead and present 
the  w 
we'll scrap it later 
because  
 What ? 
Oh 
that's 
hasn't changed that much , huh ? 
I didn't expect anyway  . 
You just coloured it . <other> 
Mm-hmm . 
I like the menu . 
Mm-hmm . 
And I suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber . It's it's part of the rubber , I suppose . 
I think that's more I think that's more durable anyway than printed on to  
<other> Oh yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
<other> Okay . 
Now it's my time to ruin everything . 
Well , 
not ruin everything , 
but  
no , nah . 
Finances , 
that's what we have here , what you drew . 
We have battery power , 
we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . The sample sensor and uh  for speak recognition anyway . 
which is de o one of the most expensive parts . 
So which  you see the  
So  well , 
we have sin one curve , <other> a design . Rubber design . 
And we had a special colour . Suppose yellow is a special colour . 
So just half a Euro for  
 You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display . 
You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost , 
which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use . 
So , 
easy . 
What do we scrap . 
Well 
think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition . 
Because the L_C_D_ has more support on customer side . 
There are ninety one percent of uh the people , or something like that . But ninety percent who favour an L_C_D_ display , 
and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition . 
I think it's also harder to  
 . So I ju 
I took that out . 
So  
and so it's still stuck with thirteen , 
so I had to take out the special colour I suppose . 
, I didn't see anything else I could take out . 
And , yeah 
Yeah , 
I could take out the push-buttons , 
but we need those . 
So , generally what I came up with , in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half Euros , spe scrap speech recognition 
and the separate covers can account for the  if people want it , 
we'll just  then we'll do it in black . 
We'll just deliver it in black , 
have the  
it has all the function that it's supposed to have , 
and if you want it  if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers . 
You make it d orange or whatever you want . 
It was a big issue , but  
I'll just go back . 
Uh 
let's just  let's see what 
 okay , 
let's just see what we  
no , 
we we have to be under twelve and a half . 
It  it's not  
uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half , 
so . 
I think you  
that's what you were ass assigned to do really , to to see how b th both those work together . 
So I think  yeah , it's  I think it's y one of the  
it's a good way to um to help people uh to make  to keep the product trendy too . 
Just keep  you just make new covers for the  for it , 
like we agreed before . 
And everything that's left is is the basic function that uh that we want our product to have . 
Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip . 
But we need that for the L_C_D_ display . 
Then again , we have the L_C_D_ display , which is also expensive . 
B 
yeah , 
but those go together . 
And yeah , 
we could take out the curve . 
Could  
we could take out the curve . 
Is that an option ? 
For you ? 
Yeah . 
<other> 
I think it's  it it does ruin it , 
but the fact that I t took that decision or t 
Took this example actually , not really decision , 
but the example is because we do offer the um <other> the possibility of adding your own custom covers . 
So you can change  any colour you want . 
So 
it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want . 
but I d it's 
something that's stuck into my mind is that  something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of  the spongy feeling of the  
You can take plastic , 
and it really makes it  also makes it different from the existing remote controls , 
because they're all plastic . 
So which in in turn  <other> 
Rubber would increase durability 
because it doesn't break . 
I al 
like I said , I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour , 
which would make this black a black and grey . 
Yeah , that's that that that's enough , 
because 
I guess those are the basic colours . 
So  Oh . 
I think those are basic col They want to  
To ensure the profit . 
That  that's th that's the order . 
We're just uh  we're the project team 
and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company 
which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this . 
But that's not for our  
that's not our decision to take . 
We have a budget of twelve fifty per product . 
So  
Stick that . 
I don't think it's really bad either . I mean if we we have the the backup of  or the backup design thing 
to have  
I think they would do . Th I think they do like 
because yo we  you  
we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea , 
because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , 
one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want . 
So 
I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect 
and keep the functionality between  of  within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget . 
So  
<other> Well 
I don't think  
Yeah . 
Is it worth  is it is it  
does it mean anything to the customer ? 
Like , it  like , we don't care  we don't care that you had to  
True , 
but we did we didn't get that . 
So I think it's  
it should either be a pack , maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something . 
But  
They could , but uh  
It's an option , but  
yeah , it's true . 
So actually uh it's not that much of an increase , 
but yeah . 
We cannot contact them . 
It's just the order that we got . 
So that's what we gotta go with . 
So it's either one fi just just to get it f 
just to get it through final , 
it's either <other> turned into plastic , drop the squishy feel , make it make it more breakable , 
um or turn it yellow . 
So  <other> 
It's uh something we have to decide on . 
I say lose the curve . Oh that's true , 
we could lose the c 
sorry . 
I forgot that , 
yeah , 
Uh the curve . 
So  <other> 
That's just this one just d this is the banana curve . 
So this would this would be straight . 
No , uh  no , 
that would be a curve inside the thing , I guess . 
No , 
would ju then it would just be a straight remote . Just like <figurative vocalisation> like that . 
Which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary . 
 we could make it yellow then , 
but  
You second that , you second that we lose the curve . 
Okay , yeah . 
So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve <other> 
to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak . 
So we keep the curve . 
So the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber . 
And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber , 
because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , um 
I guess people are willing to pay for that . 
So I think we can take that option and just  with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control . 
So I think that would still make it a nice product . 
Okay , 
we're final on that . 
So <other> 
it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing . 
But anyways we're here . 
Um yeah . 
This we discussed just now . 
That's just now  just  
we could just discuss how the project went . 
I mean , was kind of  
I sort of expected that everything would turn out this way , 
but because you  
yeah , 
everything cannot be for free . 
We didn't  
I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time . 
Because that was  I th 
it was really essential really 
to ma 
because we spent uh uh entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost . 
So we just put something  
I think it's really nor not in stroke with reality actually . 
So  
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I think   would have been . 
Materials would be ok 
at least the last meeting I would have expected had to have that . 
So I suppose  
Yeah , 
let's see if it sells . 
I mean I suppose this sells , 
because it's very  <laugh> very extended . 
But  
I suppose it sells , 
because it's good . 
I mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price , 
because we didn't know what it's gonna cost anyway . 
<other> 
Okay . 
<other> Have been met , okay . 
<other> Yeah . 
<other> 
They're stuck under menu . 
For the menu . 
I think those are totally met , 
because we we really took them for the  they have the feel they want , 
they have the simplicity they want . 
I think it's very uh very well met . 
Either two or one maybe . 
I think we took that  everything they wanted into consideration . 
So it could either be a two or a one . 
One and a half . <laugh> 
Just create our own option . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
It's perfect . Even for deaf people , 
yeah . 
It's  
I don't think it's perfect , but we did everything possible to to get it back . 
Because if it's stuck in you couch , you can see the light . 
Maybe you can hear it . 
But I mean we tried , 
so I think it  that's  that deserves a one . Definitely . 
<other> 
I'd use an  remote control . 
It's pretty straight-forward , uh-huh . 
I think  but we didn't even  
there was no issue on making a manual actually . 
We didn't   really discuss it , 
but 
I don't think it takes  
no , it really does doesn't take time to learn , I think . 
We took it s it's so easy , 
we have so little button , 
everything speaks for itself really . 
So I think that's  
yeah , 
we didn't  
it's either two or one , I guess . 
Maybe it's a two , 
because d uh the L_C_D_ is a little is a little new 
and there is  there are some option hidden under the menu button . 
So I might make this a two instead of a one , I guess . 
So just make that a two . 
You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way . 
I think so . 
I think it's perfect , the w where it is , what it can do , if it useful . 
I think so . 
No , 
y 
I mean in the L_C_D_ screen , the small screen . What does it display ? 
Well 
I thought it was I thought it was  
I thought that people wanted previews on their  
I'm not sure if that even possible , 
but  
'cause it's  this requires a quite quite a bit of band-width . 
I don't think it's possible really . 
they didn't really define in what should be used for . 
But the  
But I think in for example like T_V_ guides , I think that's  that th that you can transmit through it and everything . Just for extra information on your programmes . 
uh with configuring your remote control for favourite  your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that . 
But also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your  
So that could be done by L_C_D_ display . 
I think it's good . 
No , maybe it's not a one 
because it's  we're not using it perfectly . 
We didn't give it  I don't thing over-discussing . 
Now we gave it enough thought though . 
I think we d should just lower this . 
Maybe maybe it's a three though . 
We could've used it more effectively probably . 
<other> 
Yeah , 
we are using it , 
but it's not 
it's not poorly used , but it's not efficiently used , I think . 
We could have ev even lost <other> the selection button and uh done everything via L_C_D_ selection . 
It's  
now it's just extra to illustrate im uh extra features , 
but okay . 
Can you talk to remote control ? 
Well , 
it can't talk anymore . 
So we scrap that . 
Oh yeah  <laugh> 
Just to be a prick , 
but of course you can talk to your remote control , it doesn't do anything . 
But you c <laugh> you can talk to it . 
Well , 
we did take everything into consideration of course . 
Uh the shape i shape is i 
I think we  
yeah , 
I think that's okay . 
Yeah , 
 special co 
but we took into consideration the fact that it's customisable 
to the fashi 
We don't have it  
we do have it , 
it's just sold as a package . 
It does  
it's not part of the basic product . 
It  that 
that's what I call trendy . 
I mean the shape is trendy . 
The the sh the the functions are trendy . 
It's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model . 
Because you ha 
it's just not affordable at the moment . 
It's possible , 
but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour . 
<laugh> 
Overall score . <other> 
One two three .  sixteen . 
<other> Two two point some two point something . 
 . 
Two and two thirds . 
<other> 
It's okay , 
but <other> that's yo m 
mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition . 
'Cause yeah , that gives you a seven , 
which ruins your your average . 
Without that it would be like under  it wouldn't  yeah , it would be under two . 
So I think we have  even with this it's reasonable . 
Well 
I think it's  
two is okay . 
Yeah , two is pretty good . 
Definitely . 
Yeah , 
I think it's probably   I 
I do admit that we d <other> did miss a little  or didn't sp didn't talk   talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display . 
We could have used it more efficiently , 
we just didn't think of it that way . 
So 
  like I said , <other> changing channels , everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything . 
I think we div I think we did very well , 
uh ev even if you look at this score , we did quite well . 
It just looking for improvements what what you could have improved . 
So .  
<laugh> They sh they should get kids , and just stick 'em in T_V_ and say change the channel . <laugh> 
I don' think so . 
Uh it's just not  it it's not affordable . 
Or your sh you should lose the L_C_D_ screen probably , 
but I think that's  I think the L_C_D_ screen is more worth than speech recognition . 
Definitely . 
Okay , 
that was that . 
So that's the final product without the speakers , I guess . 
<whistling> 
Let's see , 
what was left in the the  Another one . 
Hmm . <other> Yeah , 
we evaluate the product . 
  General project , what's i in  
For example , I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created . 
We took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example , 
which I thought was pretty creative , 
because it was never never ever listed somewhere . 
Well  Anyways . Yeah , 
leadership is up to you . 
I mean perhaps I screwed up 
because I d <laugh> put a put a speech recognition into it . 
But that's not for me to decide . 
I think we did pretty well as team-work though . 
Because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime , 
because when I got the when I got the input for the financial results , initially of course I wanted to contact you . 
Say , look , this is  you're doing the wrong thing , 
you're s you're wasting your time now , 
because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford . 
So it would be better if y if there was more communication between uh  
because that's that's what would w you  what you would normally do , either call or email someone . 
So that was too bad 
con 
was impossible here anyways .  . 
It didn't have 
or didn't knew what they costs or whatever . 
There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them . 
So that was a little unclear I suppose . 
I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool . 
I think uh s especially for design issues , it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little  it's easier to share them . 
It's a little less  it  
the response time is le it's very bad . 
It's good to visualise everything , 
but I think the response time should  could be a lot better . 
Definitely . 
Yeah , it's true . 
No , you don't have to . No , you don't . 
I jin 
I didn't check the finish button . 
I just  
you just ditch it 
and you can copy it or whatever . 
Uh only if you uh check the notes or <other> press done . Then it um  then you can  then it exports to Word automatically . 
But it's not necessary to check either one of those two . 
You can just preview your p you can just preview your page in the in the programme . 
Okay , 
before starting a ne a new page . 
Okay , that could be b . 
Okay . 
Yeah , okay . 
That's  
Yeah , 
it's understandable , okay . 
<other> Any new ideas ? 
Yeah , 
more communication between <laugh> between uh  
that's the thing I noticed , that communication is very um very important , 
because if you get new information , it's essential f for the other team-mates to know that as soon as possible , 
because you would avoid making  doing extra work , 
because you were doing extra work now uh m working on the on the speech recognition , 
you have limitation both on the technical   on the d on the design side . 
So I think that could have been better . 
But that's  I think it's more of a a setting here that you cannot communicate than uh  than somewhere else . 
So  
Yeah , I think so . 
And l less p less spam probably . 
I'm not sure i I'm not sure you got spammed as well , 
but I get spammed like every t every two minutes there was a  there was another email about master classes or something . 
So  
which were totally useless actually . 
I thought I should probably look into them , 
<laugh> but they were all useless . 
So I just  
Oh okay . 
<other> 
I didn't have any uh more information , 
it's just always the same here . 
So that's that's kind of a  
It would change , but not for me . 
So I'd  I had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually . 
I couldn't do any research myself 
or  I see , that's  
yeah , 
w 
I could have done a little extra work probably , 
then  
<other> But I was busy enough anyway . 
So  
Any new ideas found ? 
Or is that a  'cause  <other> 
uh yeah , it's  well , 
probably is . 
I have no clue . 
That's like  oh,but it  <celebratory noise> <laugh> 
Should i 
if the project is evaluated and it was it was in b within budget , we should celebrate . 
So  <laugh> 
Uh okay , 
think that's about it . Uh  
I'm not sure what we should still do though 
uh t let's see 
what  
all your tasks were finished , 
right ? 
What you ha from your assistant . So let's  
Okay , 
I should  I think I sh 
I still have the the total report to finish up . 
I think we took very little time now , 
because  
<other> Yeah , 
we're in agreement , 
everything  
the design is okay . 
The one thing we missed though , we don't have a product name . 
How about you cook a  how about you cook up a product name ? 
Just  
oh , think of a catchy name . 
I'll be working on this until the beep  until it beeps . 
So  
What ? Fruit ? 
You don't want it to resemble a banana . 
It's not yellow anyway . 
It's not yellow anymore . 
It is curved , 
but  
No , 
it's  
Hmm . 
<other> 
Real Reaction future R_C_ . <laugh> 
Step into the future of of remote controlling your T_V_ . <laugh> 
No 
that's a that's a catchy slogan . 
Control your remote control . 
I go for future R_C_ probably . 
Something like  It's short f 
Real reactor ? 
Uh that that's 
That makes me think of different <laugh> products than a remote control really . 
I'm not sure . 
Real reaction in a real  
Real reactor . 
Didn't notice . 
Mm . 
I take f 
yeah , 
take a banana . 
Hmm . 
No , not like that . 
It should be it should be longer , 
because it's not a product name that you f print on a box . 
Just write out triple , like a word triple R_C_ , triple stripe  Oh . Triple dash R_ dash s s C_ . 
Yeah . 
<sigh> 
R_ dash C_ . 
Dash . 
Triple R_ or triple R_C_ ? 
How about do both ? 
Sure if it looks stupid . 
Uh I think that the the R_C_ together takes away the the the image of  it's a triple  
Uh the first the first one looks like it's a triple remote control , 
but it's only a single remote control . 
And it's especially on the triple R_ that's important . The Real Reaction Remote . 
  
Yeah , triple R_  yeah , you can  
<other> Yeah , triple R_ . 
Banana remote . <laugh> 
I think we're all in agreement about the triple R_ . 
I think triple R_ is cool . 
And it looks cool when you print it in font , looks pretty cool . 
Just like this  just  and you just print triple R_ , 
it looks  
doesn't look bad , 
it's short , 
it's okay . 
So 
have to write my report now , I guess . 
Um  Um  Yeah , so 
we have everything . 
We have the product , 
we have the costs , 
we have the possibility of everything . 
Okay . 
I think it's adjourned . 
That was a short meeting . But efficient though . 
Retire to my lair and finish the report . 
Probably . 
See . Okay , 
goodbye . 
Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report ? 
<cough>
