It's not saved yet . 
So  
Our beautiful drawing . 
Are we doing the the speech recognition ? 
Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well . 
Okay yeah . Well then then we're gonna put it in . 
Yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , 
but it should be uh  
<other> It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well . 
Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside . 
So you can make it very easy to use . 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it . 
 No . 
Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then . 
Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah . 
Okay . 
Good . 
Together ? 
I'll give comments . 
Speech recognition . 
Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something . 
Um so I've  
Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore . 
Yeah , you can  put 'em all on the back . That's for sure . 
That's uh  
We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . 
But  
You have a lot of room if you can slide it open . 
You  
Yeah I know . 
I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So  
But it's enough room . 
Uh well  
Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central . 
That was the the most important thing . 
So uh the best  place , 
the best reach place  
Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find . 
Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . 
That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will uh will show up . 
Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . 
It's <other> basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know . 
Yeah . 
Okay yeah , 
they   
Yeah okay . 
That's that's below that then . 
It's uh twelve buttons . 
Yeah okay , just we just missed that . 
But um I'll just uh  
I'll get back to later . 
F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . 
So um should be popular . 
Um  
The f uh the buttons creating ? 
Uh if you  
<other> That or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners . 
So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling . 
Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons . 
Colour changeable . 
Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . 
We have decided uh <other> in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it . 
And also in the num-pads , there's also colour  light behind it . 
So when you pre 
Yeah . 
We're going to implement . 
Yeah . 
Mm just a little  
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I um  
To your video device . 
Yeah . <other> 
Is i Ah okay . 
Um slides I think . 
It's 
You can do it that it claps open , 
but I think that's not solid enough . 
If that breaks then you're screwed . 
So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open . 
Um  
Uh i the the speech functions buttons . 
Menu button . 
With uh maybe uh arrows . 
So you can uh 
scroll in the , navigate the menu . 
Um  
 I think we can even put a  <other> 
We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels . 
So you have one left for the  
Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . That's used pretty often . 
If you have a Play Station , mm you use it every day . 
 
That was it . 
Uh  
It doesn't really matter . 
That's  
Yeah well we don't have any uh  
Hmm ? 
What else ? 
Uh menu buttons with arrows . 
S Just uh like  
Um I think it's best if we do . 
Mm where do we have  
Or there . 
Like on the normal uh  Like this . 
The menu button , yes . 
Well we don't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires . So you can't redesign it . 
Yep . 
Just press it once , the colour should uh switch . Press again , the colour switch again maybe ? 
Yep . 
Yeah , maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume . 
I just uh  The volume logo . 
Yeah .  
Yeah , we have that on the the text button . 
Uh why not ? 
No  
Whoa  
I think um  
Yeah , the three stages . Yes . 
No , it doesn't have to turn it off . 
Just don't   
Yeah . 
I dunno if   
Yeah , I think as well , but  Uh yeah . 
Yeah , 
in thi the the remote control in the 
the chip . 
Yeah , that's true . 
So yeah . 
Um do we need to fix that or  
Just like your telephone , hard plastic . 
I think just on the buttons . 
If you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space . 
I don't think the space is worth it . 
Mm . 
<other> Okay . 
Well I think we do  
If it's really uh , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think . 
Hmm ? 
Um basic colours , 
um yeah . Well you didn't say . 
Maybe um company colours ? 
Black . 
A bit a bit of yellow . 
Not not not yellow  , but just a bit of light yellow . 
Like white , also ni or uh always nice . 
Just um  
Yes . 
Yeah , grey . Just dark grey I think . 
Well we have changeable fronts , so  
So  
Yeah . 
It's hard to decide for us , but yeah . 
It it's  
At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls . 
Yeah . 
Mm . Not needed  . 
Yeah , not needed I think . 
Yeah . 
What do I think is necessary necessary item ? 
<laugh> Of course it's reachable . 
<laugh> Okay , maybe just some light uh to to light it all up . 
So you can see what's really there . 
Not just not re on the buttons or something . 
Just a green light or some blue light . 
To light it all up . 
Yeah . 
Well yeah . Uh semi-transparent . 
Yeah , w we've done a a lot of detail in light , so  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So I think it's easy to use , 
but  
And learnable is a bit  
Well y just uh f 
Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does . 
Yes . 
But the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn . 
<other> It's  Yeah it's  
Device . 
Okay . 
Maybe three then . 
Learnable's  
Yeah okay . Yeah . 
Yep , true . 
Then a two . 
And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide . 
But also slide that buttons come out , as well ? 
Okay . 
Yes . 
Different colours , so  
Yeah . 
That would  
And we didn't uh  
But then we also have the the home station . 
We are forgetting about that now , but  
We don't 
recharge . 
But that's more like uh now . 
I don't know . 
Uh  
Just save , save as ? 
<other> 
Okay . 
Yeah , it is . 
Uh untitled ? 
Yeah , it doesn't matter . 
Save . 
N 
Mm . I think we followed the latest trends . 
Oh right . Well uh fruit and vegetables , yeah . 
You can different front uh  
This is a a power indicator . So you can see how far it's charged up . 
To call . 
Um  
Okay . 
No no , I want that in . 
Yeah , th the speaker is very small as well , 
right ? 
Yes uh . 
Yeah , we can uh  <laugh> 
Um <other> different fronts , but standard front won't be , yeah . 
Yeah . 
This ? 
Oh , them . 
Is that uh included ? In the twelve Euro or 
Okay , then we then we need to use it . 
Yeah . 
Damn , solar cells are uh expensive . 
Okay . 
Mm uh i Yeah , I think so . 
I think uh everyone uh  already . So  
I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . So  
Of course there was . 
Yeah .  
One leader to check the time , etcetera . 
So more like a secretary . 
Uh I think we <other> we got wrong information at the wrong time . 
I think that was the m biggest problem . 
Like uh the prices . 
If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker . 
Yeah , and if you had uh fifteen Euros , then we would  it . 
We had to  
Yeah . 
I think uh everyone listen to each other . 
Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design . 
It was  
Just doesn't work . 
Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with , if it worked really well . 
Just not work too slow . 
Yeah , more accurate . 
Yeah , it's i It should be more accurate . 
And uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from , just with a mouse , from where you're sitting . 
Not just pointing out on it . 
Yeah . 
No use to draw on the board itself . It's just slows down . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , even harder to draw like this than black board style . 
Yeah . 
You cou You could draw on it , but not as main function . 
<laugh> We did it . 
New ideas found . 
Oh  
I just think if we uh  
I dunno . 
For remote control , a favourite for your text . 
That's for  . 
Yeah , this this is just the idea phase , 
the  
Yeah . 
Details uh  
<laugh> 
Quite early . 
Oh , what do we have to do now . 
Do we uh  
I thought we were done at four o'clock ? 
Yep . 
Mm we can do it afterwards , so  
<other> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
I found it as well . 
<laugh> 
<repeated lip smacking> 
One two three four five six seven cameras . 
Mm not bad . 
So that was it . 
This is  
<laugh> The old versions . 
They went for uh for a universal device . 
Yeah , but also a different device  . 
Then an L_C_D_ uh would be handy . 
Yeah , and touch screens for all our stuff , yeah . 
I do agree with that . 
Yeah , tu-dum . 
English is not so hard by the way . 
Well , leader ? 
Project Manager ? 
You do ? 
Yeah , you have to make a choice . 
Wow , that's pretty quick . 
Uh uh um  
You have to decide . 
It's the lower one . 
No no , the upper one is the bomb . 
Yes . 
<laugh> 
I knew it . 
No . <laugh> That's too much work . 
Come on . 
I challenge you . 
No , you gotta use the magic pen . 
Hmm . 
What if I put one there ? 
We'll see . 
I don't agree . 
Yeah , you had two choices . 
That's gonna be draw . 
Or not . 
I'll put it here . 
You are going to put it there . 
It's a difficult choice , either here or there . 
<other> Ugly . 
Oh  a pen . 
Yeah , but  
Then do it correctly . 
Stupid , the L_C_D_ screen . 
What ? 
Okay , I'm going to guess what you're drawing . 
No no , the new one . 
Uh they just don't save it . 
A house ? 
Yeah , you have to use the pen s stupid . 
No , not everything . 
Pen , select select pen . 
Okay . 
It's a house . 
A plant ? 
<laugh> Oh yeah , I can know it . 
It's a  
<laugh> Okay , that makes it easier . 
I think I know . 
No , wrong . 
I think I know what you're trying to draw , but it's wrong already . 
Yeah , you missed the right side . 
<laugh> 
No , you're wrong , you're wrong 
<sighs> 
<laugh> 
See where you're wrong now ? 
The entrance . 
Alright . 
You're correct . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , but  <laugh> I think  
Oh no you <other> made another mistake . 
No I w Okay , I'm not that whiny . 
But uh there was a big hole here as well , and there as well . 
That's a kinda big mistake . 
<laugh> Warning , finish meeting now .
