Okay . 
Okay . 
Oh , okay . Yeah . 
Yeah , and <other>  
Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? 
Or fold open ? 
I don't know . 
It's probably better . 
Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you  other functions . 
Yeah . 
Think that's better . 
<other> The  
Yeah , I I think so . I don't know . 
Ah okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , it's  Let's do it together . 
Okay . 
Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements . 
Uh the look-and-feel model . 
Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . 
Simply a square with uh round corners . 
So that's basically it . 
<other> Uh the material should be hard plastic . 
Uh colour changeable , and also transparent . 
And colour and transparent , or just transparent , 
I don't know . 
Um then the elements . 
Uh we have  
The functions are just basic . 
Like uh I've pointed them here . 
Mute function , on-off function , text functions . 
This uh switch channel . 
And this is the 
the num-pad . 
And the logo is over here , and the mic . 
And the scrollwheel , no ? 
You operate that with your pointing finger . 
So you hold it like this in your right hand and  
Uh I dunno . 
Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it . 
Yeah , or or on the slide function , I don't know . 
Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad . 
Yeah . 
Um the position ? 
Yeah , you write uh  
You wrote this , so . 
Yeah . 
But it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed . So y Because you can use your thumb then . 
Mm yeah . 
Yeah , okay . 
 just so you get that . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah , these are just basic functions , so  
All the non-basic are in  
Okay . 
Um  
Okay , maybe we use this button for the  
Yeah . 
<other> A second level ? 
Like a a new blank one or  Or just here ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
So what do we need ? 
Yeah , 
just  
God damn it . 
So this is the  
 
Extern or something . 
So here are multiple speech buttons , 
I don't know how many . 
I don't know the functions . 
Okay . 
What else ? 
What else ? 
Uh menu . 
Uh  With arrows . 
Like a normal um  
Yeah , with in the middle um a menu button . 
Okay . 
Yeah , okay . 
We can put those here . 
So did we miss anything ? 
Okay . 
Oh wh Here ? 
Okay . 
Yeah , or th or the  
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . You just switch it off and then  
Well w we thought of a text button . 
And if you press it again , you get the the the 
through view . 
Yeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off . 
So you can switch back from second to w first . 
Okay , okay . 
Yeah mm nee uh  
No , if i <other> 
uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on . 
Th i 
Yeah , I dunno . Okay . 
Yeah , those memory functions . 
Yeah . 
Was uh this logo for uh volume ? 
Okay . 
So that's it ? 
Mm . No no 
Yeah . Just hard plastic . So  
Uh I think just um  
Yeah , but  
I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons . 
In the bottom . 
No , evaluation is  
Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste . 
And what colours should the buttons be ? 
But can you change those too , with uh the switch ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . It's ju so subjective . 
One more thing . 
Are w are we changing uh  
Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too ? 
Or n no back light ? 
Yeah ? 
And and the switch channel is uh  There is a back light too ? 
Yeah . 
Hmm . <laugh> 
Yeah , just backlight . 
Not not the buttons . 
And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons . 
So the buttons are just grey . 
Okay . 
No , but you don't have to use that . 
And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer . 
That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it . 
Well , I think it is . 
So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function . 
Mm uh . 
The normal . 
<other> And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know  
Yeah . 
The speech function and the colour . Colour . 
<laugh> 
Mm it's pretty new , I think . 
Speech is new . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , we didn't draw that too , but  
Yeah , that's just a normal th s simple thing . 
Well it's a already in the folder . L like number seven . 
I think it is . 
<laugh> 
No , I think it is . 
Okay . 
Mm two , I think . 
Yeah . 
We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . So 
think that's a two or a one . 
Yeah , but s it  That's basically not not handy . 
And <other> I don't thi I don't see  
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah . <other> 
No . 
Yeah , you could make a a front 
a front that's that's like uh like a banana , <laugh> or something . 
Like a a f banana kind of front . 
No . 
Yeah . 
Eleven divided by six . 
We're not too hard on ourselves . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah , but uh we have to make a speaker then too . If you want to make it beep . 
<laugh> But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo . 
If you do uh  
Yeah , okay . 
Mm <laugh> okay . 
But uh is uh uh  
Okay . 
But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or  
Can we make that for uh h twenty cents ? <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , it's four . 
It's kind of weird that we <other> we get this information now , afterwards . 
Because  
<laugh> 
Sure . 
<laugh> Beautiful . 
Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity 
then there <other> we probably have been creative . 
Yeah . 
Huh . 
<laugh> 
No , I think  
Yeah . 
<laugh> Just normal discussion , I think . Not 
one leader or something . 
Yeah . And make notes . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , w we had so much information , that we get through email and just  
Yeah . 
Yeah , th that's weird . 
Hmm hmm yeah . 
So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right . 
Yeah . 
 Yeah . 
Yeah , i if if it would be faster , it would be great . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , and p just point with a mouse . 
Yeah . 
Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style . 
But you might as well do it in normal computer style . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And it's far too slow this way . 
No . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
What's that ? 
Hmm . 
Yeah , but still , you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this . Because we don't have any sizes and  
Yeah , but it  You can't possibly do that in such a short time , I think . 
Yeah , just brainstorming basically . 
<laugh> 
So are we finished ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Oh okay . 
It's now quarter past three . So  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Now we can look at this . 
<laugh> We're probably not supposed to look at this , but  
Yeah , from the previous group . <laugh> 
The touchscreen , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
Here are the basic functions in here , the selecting dev devices . 
Hmm . 
No . 
Yeah , this one . 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
This is a very interesting design . 
Well it has a L_C_D_ , I think . 
<laugh>  And what else do we have ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , everything . 
It wants to know what we do in our spare time . 
Warning . Finish meeting now . 
Warning . Warning . 
Okay . 
Boom-boa-ring-bing . 
Fill in the questionnaire . 
What now ? 
Okay . 
No more chit-chat . 
Yeah . 
Okay .
