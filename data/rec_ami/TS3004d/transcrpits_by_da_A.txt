Oh . 
Okay . 
So just f um  
So this is our agenda . 
You're  
F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me . 
Uh I didn't  
Oh yeah . 
So these are the  
So these are the um last notes we I made . 
If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . 
I don't have to put it in the report . 
Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially . 
So if you want to , it's okay . 
Okay , just <other>   
Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls . 
Maybe that's better . 
Yeah , that's that's a very good point . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
So this is okay ?  
Okay , 
so that's  
Uh I'll just have a look how much that is . 
But um  
Okay , for the  
Okay . 
No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So  
So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . 
So it's okay . 
So you can show your prototype if you want to . 
Okay , cool . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Mm . 
So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ? 
Yeah , speech recognition . 
Just  
Only one button to say it's on or off . 
So you can put it on the back as well if you want to . 
Okay . 
Yeah , you can put it separate . 
Okay . 
And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ? 
How do you want to implement that ? 
Just on the  
Maybe on the second level as well ? 
Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well . 
Yeah , as well . 
Just make make a   
Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
No no , just on  Down there . 
So uh  
Just uh if you s 
Yeah , y Maybe , yeah . 
For the bottom . 
No , you gotta slide it . 
Yeah , it's right . 
<cough> 
Yeah . 
You want to save that file as well ? The drawing ? 
Doesn't really matter . 
Just just uh  
<cough> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
 
Yeah . 
Or we just make it three buttons , all the colours on it . 
Just red , yel uh red , green and  
That's that's very easy , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
No , ma on on o on the on the  
Yeah . 
Just make it  
Yeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well . 
Oh just three stages , 
you  
Yeah , that's okay . 
Yes , that's to remember . 
Yeah , but that's that's uh  
That's a functionality for the television . <other> 
Okay . 
Yeah , but you have to search every time again . 
That's what what happening if you do it like that . 
But it's still the television that has to do that . 
No , that's what the television does . 
Okay , it's cool . 
Yeah , that's fine . 
Is this prich pretty much it , yeah ? 
It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway . 
Yeah ? Okay , cool . 
Mm mm mm mm mm . 
Yeah , I don't know what this means . 
But I think we just evela evaluated this one . 
Oh okay , you made some criteria . Okay , cool . 
Okay . 
You have some usability criteria or  
Okay . 
Look-and-feel ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Uh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea . It quite beautiful . 
It's  
We are actu We are the  
Flashy . 
But uh  
It's black . 
Yeah , yellow light . 
Do we have yellow light ? 
No , not really , but it's possible . 
It's  
Yeah , different colours . 
This is  
Oh , the same as th th the cover . 
But also th the light behind it . 
No , no . 
Make them  
No , just make them black or grey or something . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
just give it a one . It's okay . 
It's perfect . 
I think it's just what you want . 
Or not ? <laugh> 
Okay , just give it a two . <cough> 
Yeah . 
No . No , it's only on the number , behind the numbers 
and uh  
That as well , yeah . 
Yeah , but that's unnecessary . 
Yeah . 
It doesn't make  
No . Yeah . 
But  Yeah . Mayb Okay . 
Yeah , just only  Yeah , that's right . 
So  
Yeah , that's how I think . 
Ye 
Yeah , this  It is a one . 
It's okay . It's cool . 
This is a difficult one , because we we don't  Yeah , we don't know it about the  
Uh <other> it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use . 
It's  That's  
No . 
But the rest of it is very easy , 
because there are so so n 
So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use . 
And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device . 
But  
yeah . 
Okay , just  Easy to use is very cool , 
so just give it a two . 
No , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah . 
Okay . <other> 
Slide is not n is is not new . No . 
I already have a  
Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . And they all have a slide in it . 
So that's not new . 
Yeah . 
That's cool . 
Yeah 
for a  Uh for a f 
There are no games on it , that's that's  It's not a one , it's a two again . 
If you have  
Yeah . Oh yeah , that's right . Rechargeable . 
Yeah , just draw it afterwards .  
If you  
Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ? In the the project uh map ? 
Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
Uh save as ? 
No , that's not in the project . 
Oh yeah , okay . 
Smart board . 
Yeah , but this one . 
This one is not yet in the  
Oh oh . 
 
 
But you still have to draw the resi the recharger . 
Okay . And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? 
No , I think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one . 
But not  
No , just so it's still a two . 
Targeted audience . 
Uh we are the targeted audience ? 
Do we like it ? 
Yeah , but l younger than forty . 
So we we are exactly the targeted group . 
I think so , yeah . 
You get the fancy things for younger people . And you get the the aesthetic things for older people . 
So you want  
Yeah , you get different colours . 
So  
Oh . 
So that's eleven . 
<other> It's  
Yeah , it is one point eight three . 
Oh yeah , that's still  <other> 
Yeah , maybe we have to skip that one . 
Okay . 
So I just got a financial um  
 
You s <other> saved it or  
No . 
Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . 
If I forgot anything , just say it to me . 
It just is a battery . 
Yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . 
But okay . 
So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros . <laugh> 
So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker . 
So that's both . 
Yeah , and single curved curved . 
No , that's not on the list . 
But that shouldn't be  . 
Probably . 
I just  
The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was  
I'm not sure . 
See it's  
I think it's okay like this . 
It's hard to say . 
But maybe we have to um  
Yeah ,  okay . 
Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal . 
We get different ones , that's all . 
So you can put a recharger in it as well . 
<laugh> But this is expensive , the sample speaker . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that's included . 
Yeah , no . 
<laugh> Okay , so this is uh pretty much it this  . 
So  I just want you  
Yeah , we just made it . 
So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together . 
Okay . 
We can do some discussion about this . 
Was there room for creativity ? 
<laugh> Paul , was there room for crea creativity ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Okay , so the leadership  
Was there a leadership and  
Okay . 
What do you have to say about that ? 
I dunno . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , I know . 
<laugh> Okay , next one . 
Uh team work 
um  The 
the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard . 
We were not all  We were not um agree with every not agree with  . 
We're not finished . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , finance . 
But the teamwork was okay . 
Yeah . 
'Kay . 
Yeah , what I have to say about uh means . 
The smart board is okay . 
Digital pen is horrible . 
I dunno if you use it . 
But if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work . 
No . 
Yeah . 
It's the same for the presenta for the presentations . 
You can do it from here . That's much easier than standing there . 
And so you've  
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
like  . 
Okay . 
 I think  
Yeah , okay . 
So we made it in time . 
<laugh> And we made a remote control . 
<laugh> 
In the budget , yeah . 
I don't know what it mean . 
Just  
For remote control probably . 
No , for the project . <laugh> 
Yeah . But it's for the next team . 
We don't have to do that . 
Yes , 
I think just  I just write a final report . 
No , 
we have only four minutes left . 
Uh it's okay . 
Okay . 
 
You have to save everything , 
you know that , huh ? 
Okay , yeah .
