Oops . 
Mm-hmm . 
Means  
<other> 
Okay . 
 
Just just one thing now . 
Um y you need to have more uh one two th 
You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine . 
But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes . 
Okay , but  <other> It's rather important . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Ah . 
Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions . 
It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart . 
Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player . 
That function must be  
Yeah , maybe 
 Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions . 
And h how does the second level come out ? 
Uh it slides uh along ? 
From from the uh beneath ? 
Menu ? 
Scart ? 
Uh yeah . 
And so y you keep you keep one , you have one left . Yes . <other> 
Yeah . 
<other> It's a f <other> basic uh  
Yeah , to navigate . 
<other> 
<other> Mm okay . 
Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ? 
Uh and and you can hold it , 
you can hold it , and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons . 
 okay . 
Okay , yeah . Th Yeah . 
If we have enough place , uh then we can do that . 
Colour buttons . 
And then we choose green , uh blue and red or 
 Okay . 
Okay . 
That's uh  Um  
It  
Some text uh buttons . 
Yeah , but 
there's one there's one text button I  
There's one text button I prefer . 
That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text . 
Do you do you  
Did you think of that ? 
Ex Yeah . Yeah . 
The sta the state you  
Yeah . 
No . Just remember where it was . 
It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page . 
If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ? 
But maybe it's not the way  
Mm . That's maybe one thing we can discuss about . 
Mm <other> most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages . 
But uh not not every every television , so  
Yeah , I I thought about one thing . 
Uh the buttons ? Uh from which material are they now ? 
Okay . 
Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , 
are uh  
And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? 
Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ? 
Well yeah . That's too much place . 
Okay , just leave it . Just leave it . 
Yeah , and i 
The most time  
Yeah , with rubber buttons . Yeah , okay .  
Okay . Fine . 
Yeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model . 
I d d d I don't think if it's right . 
<laugh> That shall show it . 
Mm-hmm . 
Uh no , uh all criterias we just argue about . 
Uh  
Oh . 
Yeah . 
Evaluation crit 
Yeah , evaluation presentation . 
It's not in . 
Uh d it doesn't matter um  
It only had two pages or something . 
<other> Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , 
or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market . 
The Italians uh , how they think about it . 
And  
<other> The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . 
I made some criteria , 
and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . 
We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our 
um <other> model . 
And this  
These are all I I I found , or I wrote down . 
And um <laugh> we have to discuss about <laugh> , if we give it a one or a seven . 
Uh  
Yes . 
Yeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something . 
And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and <other> and that kind of stuff . 
The LEDs . 
Yes . 
And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of ? 
The basic colours are black or green or yellow ? 
Or you haven't thought about  
Ho how do we make uh  
Black and yellow . 
Can  
Black white , maybe ? 
Uh  
Because um  
Okay , so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful ? 
Beautiful is uh really subjective , uh because it has to do lots with the colours . 
Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful . 
Yeah . 
A two . Okay . 
The fancy look-and-feel . 
That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons . 
Okay . 
And we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy I think . 
So  
Slide panel ? 
Oh , you mean th this here ? 
It's pretty cool . If you slide it open , <sliding sound> it lights up . 
That's that's really fancy , but <other> I don't know if it's reachable . 
Then we do it . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
but  
Okay . 
Okay , fine . So I I think it's very fancy . 
So I'll give it a  
Yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so  
I think it's one . 
Okay , next . 
<other> Learnable ? Easy to use ? 
Yeah , we shall test it <laugh> 
But uh  
Yeah . 
Learnable ? 
It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control . 
Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel . 
I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or 
 Uh then the re 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
But  
Yeah . But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ? 
And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . 
So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide . You must slide it . 
And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls . 
'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um <other> easy to use . 
Because easy to use comes after learnable . 
I I think it a three or something . 
Oh . Okay . 
New features . Techno technological innovative ? 
<other> The speech function is new . 
The scrollwheel 
and the slide . Uh I think the slide is pretty new . 
Uh I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control . 
Okay . 
Okay , and the the the lightning ? 
Is that new ? 
The lighting's new . 
Scrollwheel . 
Speech ? 
Yeah , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too . 
So we have a pretty new uh  
It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something . 
Uh-oh . 
Home-station . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
 
Uh all <other> the the seven , uh all the seven . 
No , we are not extraordinary new or something . 
Tha tha that  
<other> No , 
we we we searched for uh um <other> a young group , audience , beneath f forty . 
Yes . 
Yeah , but did we reach , um <other> with our uh style , the targeted audience ? 
Th that's my question . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh   That's  that's  <other> That's this question . 
Yeah , this . 
So we targeted it ? 
But we didn't follow the latest trends . 
Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh <laugh> get on my computer . 
Uh yeah , th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh  
Oh yeah . 
But spongy will never be . <laugh> 
So we give ourself a three or something . 
 
Okay . 
That's uh  
What's the average ? 
A perfect score . <laugh> 
No , I don't know . 
<laugh> 
And and you need n uh a button to call it , to let it beep . 
Call  
That's  Yeah , but it  <other> 
<other> No , we need that . That's usable . That's really usable . 
It's <other> uh  
Yeah . I did save it . 
<laugh> That's fine . 
Come on , it's perfect . Uh twelve point three point three . 
<laugh> 
Special form , yeah . <other> 
Four . It's four Euros . 
Yeah . 
<other> So we are  
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Yes . 
<whistling> 
Or a different style . 
Yeah . 
We could make a lot of different uh remote controls . 
So it's creativity . 
Who was the leader ? <laugh> 
Yeah yeah . We were not finished . 
Uh . 
Yeah , because the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now . 
And then  <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . 
And uh  
Yeah . 
Digital pen or  
Yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , I think . 
Precise . 
 
Digital pen . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
New ideas . 
For for for  
<other> 
To gather , or to uh work together , uh or new ideas for

No , for the prototype . New ideas . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <other> 
Hmm .
