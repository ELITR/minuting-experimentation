A:  Oh . 
B:  It's not saved yet . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  So  
A:  Okay . 
B:  Our beautiful drawing . 
A:  So just f um  So this is our agenda . You're  F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me . 
D:  Oops . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Uh I didn't  Oh yeah . So these are the  
C:  Oh , okay . Yeah . 
A:  So these are the um last notes we I made . If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . I don't have to put it in the report . 


B:  Are we doing the the speech recognition ? Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well . 
A:  Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially . So if you want to , it's okay . 
B:  Okay yeah . Well then then we're gonna put it in . 
A:  Okay , just <other>   
B:  Yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , but it should be uh  
A:  Okay . So this is okay ?  
B:   No . Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then . 
A:  Okay , so that's  Uh I'll just have a look how much that is . But um  Okay , for the  Okay . No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So  
C:  <other> The  
B:  Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , I I think so . I don't know . 
B:  Okay . 
C:  Ah okay . 
A:  So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . So it's okay . 
B:  Good . 


A:  So you can show your prototype if you want to . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Together ? 
C:  Yeah , it's  Let's do it together . Okay . 
B:  I'll give comments . 
C:  Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements . 
D:  Means  
A:  Mm . So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ? 
D:  <other> 
B:  Speech recognition . 
A:  Yeah , speech recognition . Just  Only one button to say it's on or off . 
B:  Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something . Um so I've  
C:  Uh I dunno . Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it . 
B:  Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore . 
A:  So you can put it on the back as well if you want to . 
B:  Yeah , you can  put 'em all on the back . That's for sure . 
C:  Yeah , or or on the slide function , I don't know . Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  That's uh  
D:  Okay . 
B:  We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . But  You have a lot of room if you can slide it open . 
A:  Yeah , you can put it separate . 
B:  You  Yeah I know . I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So  But it's enough room . 
C:  Yeah . Um the position ? Yeah , you write uh  You wrote this , so . 
D:  Ah . 
C:  Yeah , these are just basic functions , so  All the non-basic are in  
A:  Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  Okay . Um  
D:  Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions . It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart . Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player . That function must be  
C:  Okay , maybe we use this button for the  
D:  Yeah , maybe  Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions . 
B:  Yeah , I um  To your video device . 
A:  Yeah , as well . Just make make a   Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <other> A second level ? Like a a new blank one or  Or just here ? Okay . 
B:  Yeah . <other> 
A:  Yeah . No no , just on  Down there . So uh  
B:  Is i Ah okay . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  And h how does the second level come out ? Uh it slides uh along ? 
A:  Just uh if you s 
B:  Um slides I think . It's 
A:  Yeah , y Maybe , yeah . 
D:  From from the uh beneath ? 
A:  For the bottom . 
B:  You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough . If that breaks then you're screwed . 
A:  No , you gotta slide it . Yeah , it's right . 
B:  So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open . Um  
C:  So what do we need ? 
B:  Uh i the the speech functions buttons . 
C:  Yeah , just  
D:  Menu ? 
B:  Menu button . With uh maybe uh arrows . So you can uh 
A:  <cough> 
B:  scroll in the , navigate the menu . Um  
C:  God damn it . 
D:  Scart ? 
B:   I think we can even put a  <other> We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels . So you have one left for the  Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . That's used pretty often . 
D:  Uh yeah . And so y you keep you keep one , you have one left . Yes . <other> 
C:  So this is the  
D:  Yeah . <other> It's a f <other> basic uh  
C:   
B:  If you have a Play Station , mm you use it every day . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Extern or something . 
B:   
A:  You want to save that file as well ? The drawing ? 
B:  That was it . 
C:  So here are multiple speech buttons , I don't know how many . 
B:  Uh  
A:  Doesn't really matter . Just just uh  
C:  I don't know the functions . Okay . What else ? 
B:  It doesn't really matter . That's  Yeah well we don't have any uh  Hmm ? What else ? Uh menu buttons with arrows . 
C:  What else ? Uh menu . 
D:  Yeah , to navigate . 
C:  Uh  With arrows . 
B:  S Just uh like  Um I think it's best if we do . Mm where do we have  Or there . 
C:  Like a normal um  
B:  Like on the normal uh  Like this . 
C:  Yeah , with in the middle um a menu button . Okay . 
B:  The menu button , yes . 
D:  <other> 
A:  <cough> 
B:  Well we don't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires . So you can't redesign it . 
D:  <other> Mm okay . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ? 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yep . 
D:  Uh and and you can hold it , you can hold it , and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons . 
A:   Yeah . 
B:  Just press it once , the colour should uh switch . Press again , the colour switch again maybe ? 
D:   okay . 
A:  Or we just make it three buttons , all the colours on it . Just red , yel uh red , green and  
D:  Okay , yeah . Th Yeah . If we have enough place , uh then we can do that . 
C:  Yeah , okay . 
A:  That's that's very easy , yeah . 
C:  We can put those here . 
D:  Colour buttons . And then we choose green , uh blue and red or  Okay . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yep . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Okay . That's uh  Um  
C:  So did we miss anything ? 
B:  Yeah , maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume . 
D:  It  Some text uh buttons . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , but 
B:  I just uh  The volume logo . 
A:  No , ma on on o on the on the  
D:  there's one there's one text button I  
C:  Oh wh Here ? 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah .  
C:  Okay . 
A:  Just make it  
D:  There's one text button I prefer . That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text . Do you do you  Did you think of that ? 
C:  Yeah , or th or the  
B:  Yeah , we have that on the the text button . 
C:  Yeah . Yep . Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . You just switch it off and then  
B:  Uh why not ? 
A:  Yeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well . 
D:  Ex Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  No  Whoa  
C:  Well w we thought of a text button . And if you press it again , you get the the the 
B:  I think um  Yeah , the three stages . Yes . 
D:  The sta the state you  
A:  Oh just three stages , you  Yeah , that's okay . 
C:  through view . Yeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off . So you can switch back from second to w first . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  No , it doesn't have to turn it off . 
D:  No . Just remember where it was . It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page . If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ? But maybe it's not the way  
B:  Just don't   Yeah . 
A:  Yes , that's to remember . 
C:  Okay , okay . 
A:  Yeah , but that's that's uh  
B:  I dunno if   
A:  That's a functionality for the television . <other> 
B:  Yeah , I think as well , but  Uh yeah . 
D:  Mm . That's maybe one thing we can discuss about . 
C:  Yeah mm nee uh  No , if i <other> uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on . 
B:  Yeah , in thi the the remote control in the 
A:  Okay . Yeah , but you have to search every time again . That's what what happening if you do it like that . But it's still the television that has to do that . 
C:  Th i 
B:  the chip . Yeah , that's true . 
C:  Yeah , I dunno . Okay . 
B:  So yeah . Um do we need to fix that or  
D:  Mm <other> most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages . 
A:  No , that's what the television does . 
C:  Yeah , those memory functions . 
D:  But uh not not every every television , so  
C:  Yeah . Was uh this logo for uh volume ? Okay . 
A:  Okay , it's cool . Yeah , that's fine . 
C:  So that's it ? 
A:  Is this prich pretty much it , yeah ? 
D:  Yeah , I I thought about one thing . Uh the buttons ? Uh from which material are they now ? 
C:  Mm . No no Yeah . Just hard plastic . So  
B:  Just like your telephone , hard plastic . 
D:  Okay . Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , are uh  And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ? 
A:  It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway . 
B:  I think just on the buttons . If you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space . 
C:  Uh I think just um  
D:  Well yeah . That's too much place . 
C:  Yeah , but  
D:  Okay , just leave it . Just leave it . 
B:  I don't think the space is worth it . 
D:  Yeah , and i 
C:  I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons . 
D:  The most time  Yeah , with rubber buttons . Yeah , okay .  Okay . Fine . 
A:  Yeah ? Okay , cool . 


A:  Mm mm mm mm mm . Yeah , I don't know what this means . But I think we just evela evaluated this one . 
D:  Yeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model . I d d d I don't think if it's right . <laugh> That shall show it . 
A:  Oh okay , you made some criteria . Okay , cool . Okay . You have some usability criteria or  Okay . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Uh no , uh all criterias we just argue about . Uh  Oh . 
C:  In the bottom . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Look-and-feel ? 
D:  Evaluation crit 
C:  No , evaluation is  
D:  Yeah , evaluation presentation . It's not in . Uh d it doesn't matter um  It only had two pages or something . <other> Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market . The Italians uh , how they think about it . And  <other> The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . I made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our 
A:  Okay . 
D:  um <other> model . And this  These are all I I I found , or I wrote down . And um <laugh> we have to discuss about <laugh> , if we give it a one or a seven . Uh  
A:  Okay . 
D:  New features . Techno technological innovative ? 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . <other> 
C:  The speech function and the colour . Colour . 
D:  <other> The speech function is new . The scrollwheel and the slide . Uh I think the slide is pretty new . 
B:  And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide . 
A:  Slide is not n is is not new . No . I already have a  
D:  Uh I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control . 
A:  Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . And they all have a slide in it . So that's not new . Yeah . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  But also slide that buttons come out , as well ? Okay . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Okay , and the the the lightning ? Is that new ? The lighting's new . Scrollwheel . Speech ? 
A:  That's cool . Yeah for a  Uh for a f 
C:  Mm it's pretty new , I think . 
B:  Yes . 
C:  Speech is new . 
B:  Different colours , so  
D:  Yeah , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  So we have a pretty new uh  
A:  There are no games on it , that's that's  It's not a one , it's a two again . But  
B:  That would  And we didn't uh  
D:  It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something . 
B:  But then we also have the the home station . We are forgetting about that now , but  
A:  If you have  Yeah . Oh yeah , that's right . Rechargeable . 
D:  Uh-oh . Home-station . 
B:  We don't recharge . 
C:  Yeah , we didn't draw that too , but  
B:  But that's more like uh now . 
A:  Yeah , just draw it afterwards .  
C:  Yeah , that's just a normal th s simple thing . 
B:  I don't know . 
A:  If you  Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ? In the the project uh map ? 
B:  Uh  Just save , save as ? 
A:  Yeah . Mm-hmm . Uh save as ? No , that's not in the project . 
B:  <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Well it's a already in the folder . L like number seven . 
A:  Oh yeah , okay . Smart board . Yeah , but this one . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  This one is not yet in the  Oh oh . 
C:  I think it is . 
A:   
D:   
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , it is . 
C:  No , I think it is . 
B:  Uh untitled ? Yeah , it doesn't matter . Save . 
A:   
C:  Okay . 
D:  Uh all <other> the the seven , uh all the seven . 
A:  But you still have to draw the resi the recharger . Okay . And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? No , I think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one . But not  
D:  No , we are not extraordinary new or something . Tha tha that  
A:  No , just so it's still a two . 
C:  Mm two , I think . 
B:  N 
A:  Targeted audience . Uh we are the targeted audience ? Do we like it ? 
D:  <other> No , we we we searched for uh um <other> a young group , audience , beneath f forty . Yes . 
A:  Yeah , but l younger than forty . So we we are exactly the targeted group . 
D:  Yeah , but did we reach , um <other> with our uh style , the targeted audience ? Th that's my question . 
A:  I think so , yeah . You get the fancy things for younger people . And you get the the aesthetic things for older people . So you want  
C:  Yeah . We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . So 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh   That's  that's  <other> That's this question . 
C:  think that's a two or a one . Yeah , but s it  That's basically not not handy . And <other> I don't thi I don't see  
D:  Yeah , this . So we targeted it ? 
C:  <other> Yeah . 
D:  But we didn't follow the latest trends . 
C:  Yeah . <other> No . Yeah , you could make a a front 
B:  Mm . I think we followed the latest trends . 
C:  a front that's that's like uh like a banana , <laugh> or something . 
D:  Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh <laugh> get on my computer . 
B:  Oh right . Well uh fruit and vegetables , yeah . You can different front uh  
A:  Yeah , you get different colours . 
D:  Uh yeah , th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh  
A:  So  
C:  Like a a f banana kind of front . 
D:  Oh yeah . But spongy will never be . <laugh> 
C:  No . 
D:  So we give ourself a three or something . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:   
A:  Oh . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  So that's eleven . 
D:  That's uh  What's the average ? 
A:  <other> It's  Yeah , it is one point eight three . 
C:  Eleven divided by six . 
D:  A perfect score . <laugh> No , I don't know . 
C:  We're not too hard on ourselves . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 


B:  This is a a power indicator . So you can see how far it's charged up . 
C:  Okay . 
D:  And and you need n uh a button to call it , to let it beep . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  To call . Um  
A:  Oh yeah , that's still  <other> 
D:  Call  
C:  Yeah , but uh we have to make a speaker then too . If you want to make it beep . 
A:  Yeah , maybe we have to skip that one . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  That's  Yeah , but it  <other> 
B:  No no , I want that in . 
C:  <laugh> But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo . 
D:  <other> No , we need that . That's usable . That's really usable . 
C:  If you do uh  
A:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah , th the speaker is very small as well , right ? 
C:  Yeah , okay . 
D:  It's <other> uh  


A:  So I just got a financial um  
B:  Yes uh . 
A:   You s <other> saved it or  
D:  Yeah . I did save it . 
A:  No . Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . If I forgot anything , just say it to me . It just is a battery . Yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . But okay . So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros . <laugh> 
C:  Mm <laugh> okay . 
D:  <laugh> That's fine . 
C:  But uh is uh uh  
A:  So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  So that's both . 
D:  Come on , it's perfect . Uh twelve point three point three . 
A:  Yeah , and single curved curved . 
C:  But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or  
A:  No , that's not on the list . But that shouldn't be  . 
C:  Can we make that for uh h twenty cents ? <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , we can uh  <laugh> 
A:  Probably . I just  The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was  I'm not sure . 
B:  Um <other> different fronts , but standard front won't be , yeah . 
A:  See it's  I think it's okay like this . 
D:  Special form , yeah . <other> 
A:  It's hard to say . But maybe we have to um  Yeah ,  okay . Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal . We get different ones , that's all . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  So you can put a recharger in it as well . <laugh> But this is expensive , the sample speaker . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  This ? 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , it's four . 
D:  Four . It's four Euros . 
B:  Oh , them . Is that uh included ? In the twelve Euro or  Okay , then we then we need to use it . 
D:  Yeah . <other> So we are  
A:  Yeah , that's included . 
C:  It's kind of weird that we <other> we get this information now , afterwards . Because  
A:  Yeah , no . <laugh> Okay , so this is uh pretty much it this  . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Damn , solar cells are uh expensive . 
A:  So  I just want you  Yeah , we just made it . 


A:  So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Okay . We can do some discussion about this . Was there room for creativity ? 
C:  Sure . 
D:  Yes . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  <laugh> Paul , was there room for crea creativity ? 
C:  <laugh> Beautiful . 
D:  <whistling> 
B:  Mm uh i Yeah , I think so . I think uh everyone uh  already . So  
C:  Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Or a different style . 
C:  then there <other> we probably have been creative . 
B:  I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . So  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . We could make a lot of different uh remote controls . So it's creativity . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Huh . 
A:  Okay , so the leadership  Was there a leadership and  
B:  Of course there was . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay . What do you have to say about that ? 
C:  No , I think  Yeah . 
D:  Who was the leader ? <laugh> 
A:  I dunno . 
C:  <laugh> Just normal discussion , I think . Not 
B:  Yeah .  
C:  one leader or something . 
B:  One leader to check the time , etcetera . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . And make notes . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , I know . 
B:  So more like a secretary . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> Okay , next one . Uh team work um  The the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard . We were not all  We were not um agree with every not agree with  . We're not finished . 
D:  Yeah yeah . We were not finished . 
C:  Yeah , w we had so much information , that we get through email and just  
D:  Uh . 
B:  Uh I think we <other> we got wrong information at the wrong time . I think that was the m biggest problem . Like uh the prices . If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , th that's weird . 
D:  Yeah , because the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now . And then  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , and if you had uh fifteen Euros , then we would  it . We had to  
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  Hmm hmm yeah . 
A:  Yeah , finance . 
C:  So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  But the teamwork was okay . 
D:  Yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . And uh  
B:  I think uh everyone listen to each other . Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 'Kay . Yeah , what I have to say about uh means . The smart board is okay . Digital pen is horrible . I dunno if you use it . But if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work . No . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  It was  Just doesn't work . Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with , if it worked really well . Just not work too slow . Yeah , more accurate . 
D:  Digital pen or  
C:   Yeah . Yeah , i if if it would be faster , it would be great . 
D:  Yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , I think . 
B:  Yeah , it's i It should be more accurate . 
D:  Precise . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  And uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from , just with a mouse , from where you're sitting . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Not just pointing out on it . 
A:  It's the same for the presenta for the presentations . You can do it from here . That's much easier than standing there . And so you've  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , and p just point with a mouse . 
B:  No use to draw on the board itself . It's just slows down . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:   
C:  Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style . But you might as well do it in normal computer style . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , like  . 
B:  Yeah , even harder to draw like this than black board style . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . And it's far too slow this way . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  You cou You could draw on it , but not as main function . 
C:  No . 
A:   I think  Yeah , okay . 
D:  Digital pen . 
A:  So we made it in time . <laugh> And we made a remote control . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> We did it . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  In the budget , yeah . 
B:  New ideas found . 
D:  New ideas . 
C:  What's that ? 
B:  Oh  
D:  For for for
