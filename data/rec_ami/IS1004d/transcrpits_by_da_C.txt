Okay so we can go to the slides . 
Yeah . 
Number three . 
Oh number two 
sorry . 
So final design . Final design . 
Okay so 
Michael you can go ahead . 
You can pull it out first , maybe . 
Uh  
And we we do have one more functionality . 
If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_ . 
The turbo button . 
Additional button . 
That's right , that's right . 
<laugh> 
So then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing . 
And you can tele 
yeah , 
once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume . 
Yeah . 
That's right . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So it always means , whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage . 
It's like antennas . 
And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries 
and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries . 
It is very light . 
Yeah . 
And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana . 
Otherwise it's you know a child comes and so  
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Oh we didn't think of that yet . Yeah . 
Oh yeah that's right . 
Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
It'll It'll be always at top somewhere at there . 
Yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries 
so that that is  . 
Eight to ten eight to ten hours . 
N most  
no most of the time it's not being used . 
So when when you are making it on  
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
No eight or eight or ten hours of working . 
If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer . 
Yeah . That's right . 
Yeah . 
And we are having the speakers regular chip for control . 
Pricing is  was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip . 
And uh that's it . 
That's right . 
You want to have more functional buttons ? 
You are not convinced . 
Not not many , we we want to keep it simple . 
So that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case , 
that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons . 
It's up to you , means . 
Now that  
Means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits . 
That's right . 
Yeah . So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape . 
So we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing , they they don't care about the buttons any more . 
And anyway  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Evalua yeah . 
Why this strange factor of seven ? 
Usually I have seen that scales are from one to ten . 
Okay . 
Okay . Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Okay fine , got the idea . 
Okay . 
Okay , 
okay , great . 
Okay . Yeah yeah . 
Go ahead . 
Mm-hmm . Sure . 
Okay . Yeah yeah . Yeah . 
So you can say fancy , 
handy . 
Handy . 
Yeah , it's fancy , according to me . 
<laugh> 
Seven . Seven by me . 
Okay . 
So you can add seven plus six plus seven plus  
Five . 
Again I'll give seven . 
Yep . 
Seven for me . 
I'll give five . 
 
That's right . 
That's right . 
The standards . What is available in the market off the shelf . 
<other> We  
Five . 
So four point two ? 
 four . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
There I'll give it seven . 
That's right . 
For a T_V_ the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature . 
And then the scroll buttons are again cool features . 
We don't have L_C_D_ for it but that we decided we don't want to have . 
Mm-hmm . 
Seven . 
Okay . 
Definitely seven . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Okay . 
I'll say five . 
I'll say five . 
<laugh> 
Why ? 
<laugh> No but it's really handy actually if you see . 
It's it's so handy . 
And then  
Anyb anybody who comes here <laugh>  anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this . 
It's a very positive thing if you see like that <laugh> . 
Youngsters . 
<laugh> 
You want to flaunt . 
You  with your girlfriend or something . 
Or might be it does some other kind of thing but  
Uh yeah , crazy . 
<laugh> 
I say five . 
And you have saved it ? 
You'll have to reload . 
They're not going to be as  
And they they might not be a as easy as this  
yeah . 
Yeah . 
S 
I go slightly up . 
Six . 
<laugh> 
Six , five , four . 
Okay . 
I'll still give it five . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> So it's somewhere three point five I think . 
No I said five . 
Mm-hmm . 
Oops . 
<laugh> Yeah it's it's funny . <laugh> 
Yeah , sure . 
Mm-hmm . 
Solar cells , yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah , we said no to that . 
I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing . 
Yeah . 
To bring the cost  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So we have the regular chip on the print , which is one . 
And that's it . 
And we have sample speaker . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
 the cost of that is very high . 
Uh-huh . 
Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
And we have sev 
Yeah . 
So we we'll put some extras , if there is something . 
Okay . 
To reduce the cost , it's okay . 
Oh it's got all the directions 
so don't worry . <laugh> 
It's got a  direction . <laugh> 
Okay . Okay . 
Yeah . 
That's right . 
We don't have any push buttons . 
No that is a scroll wheel itself , it'll be put in that . 
Ah okay , okay . 
Okay , okay . 
Yeah . 
No . There's no chip there . 
It just emits the signal . 
And the receiver accepts it and that's it . 
Just se sends the signal , that's it . 
Yep . 
No . 
Yeah . 
So first thing which we should take care of is , 
instead of rubber , let it be plastic . 
And uh that much money will be required for the base station , which is not there . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
That's right . 
So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which  the cord and everything which'll go  
That's right . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
S 
Detachable battery . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
They like that . 
Mm-hmm . 
Biased . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
The cost of the thing can be made more than might be . 
Because I think it's just the optimal , what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to . 
Interface . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
That's right . 
Yeah . 
Integrate . 
Mm-hmm . 
So  
What else ? 
Okay . 
Home ? 
<laugh> Happily satisfied . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Thank you .
