<cough> 
Okay . 
Good afternoon again . 
So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of  detail design of the product of the remote control . 
Um <cough> So here is the agenda for today . 
Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting 
then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two , 
sounds interesting . 
And we'll have um <other> presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts . 
Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing 
and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro . 
<other> Okay . 
So let's go . 
Uh if I go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . <tongue clicks> 
So we went through th uh 
w we took this following decisions . 
No L_C_D_ , no speech recognition technology , okay , 
we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control . 
We went through the use of wheels and but buttons . 
<other> And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . 
Okay . Um . Good . 
So guys let  this uh wonderful thing . 
<other> Oh yeah . 
Sorry . Um . 
Which is   
Yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
What's the use uh of the t turbo button already ? 
Ah yeah yeah 
an then you stop when you stop it stops . 
Uh-huh . 
Which one ? 
Okay . 
To navigate it through th through teletext . 
 with the wheel it's easy . 
Excellent . 
Calling . 
Excellent . 
And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ? 
Oh . 
Great . <other> 
So , what else ? 
Yeah , they're light . 
<laugh> 
 
Ah yeah . 
So for the power source , apparently you still  you you want to use both solar cells and batteries . 
Uh you mean  
okay . So  
Yeah , 
where are going to  
where are you are you going to place them ? 
You have enough surface ? 
You   
Okay . 
What will be the autonomy ? Roughly ? 
The autonomy . 
Autonomy . 
Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ? 
Yeah . 
A long  <laugh> 
Yeah , 
so it's  
It's used only when you  
Yeah . 
F weeks . 
Right . 
Next slide ? 
Okay . 
 Okay . 
Those really sounds very good . 
<other> Nothing else to add ? 
Yeah . 
Well in fact b both will be  could be useful , navigating through teletext . 
Yeah . 
Wow . 
<laugh> 
Very good uh yeah  
<laugh> you th 
yeah . 
<laugh> Bananas everywhere . 
Okay , so  <cough> 
<other> 
So we have to go through now evaluations . 
<other> So your slides are ready ? 
Uh you're four I think . 
So this is one , which one is this one ? 
<other> 
<cough> 
Num number  
So to have  in order to have enough granularity  
it's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah , six . 
S seven . 
Six . 
No , wait . 
What do you say seven ? 
Five ? 
Okay , six point five . 
Handy ? 
Seven . 
So seven , seven , 
six , 
six point five . 
Functional . 
<mouth sounds> <laugh> 
Four . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Uh for a remote control , does he have all the  
you could expect . 
Yeah . 
<cough> 
So it's universal but for T_V_s . 
<other> So s uh four ? 
Five ? 
Four . 
Four . 
<laugh> <singing sound> Okay cool ? Cool device . 
<long sh- sound> 
Yeah . Seven . 
Six . 
Plus six , 
I say  I said seven . 
So it's six . 
Yeah . 
Seven . 
Seven . 
And you ? 
Outl you are not lik outlier . 
Seven <laugh> 
<laugh> Okay okay okay okay . 
<laugh> 
Of course I'll buy the  banana .  
Well  
Twenty five Euros . 
<laugh> Cheap . 
Yeah , 
so the target price is for all Europe , or only for rich countries ? 
<other> It's more targeting U_K_ or  
So this is selling costs , not production costs . 
Yeah yeah sure . 
Um  
Five . 
<laugh> Aw , should be nice in your  
<laugh> It's kitsch . 
Well , don't forget well , don't for 
don't forget who we're targeting also 
who are f f who are wh 
yeah , youngst youngst 
No  well  yeah 
 I  
if you would be young . 
Not telling that you are young . 
Li li like a teenager for instance . 
Okay 
you're you're crazy teenager and you like fun things . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , you want to show the beautiful banana you have .  
Okay so you s you give  
oh yeah yeah I know I know . 
So you say two . 
F I d I say five . 
You say ? 
<laugh> So what's the new question ? 
Uh yeah , I think so . 
<laugh> 
Yeah that's two different question . 
Ugly . 
I stick to five . 
W we have six , five  
Three <laugh> 
So we are 
six , five , four  
Yeah . 
So  
So and last question , 
will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana . 
Um , zero . 
No uh we can't . <laugh> 
So one . 
Well if  . 
No uh let's say I'll put two . 
It's for the T_V_ . 
Two three five two three fi and two . 
So it's r 
Yeah , three point five . <cough> 
<laugh> No no you say five , he is the outlier . 
Okay just just do a sum . 
Well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob 
Yeah . 
So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling . We can had uh have a  out of these numbers , which which is that well we should go for it . 
<other> Problem with connectors ? <laugh> 
Okay 
. So let's move uh let's move on . 
<other> Okay ,  now now we have to mm to estimate <cough> uh the cost okay 
. So I prepare an Excel sh uh an Excel sheet . 
Um well we are going to calculate the production costs . 
We should we should be below twelve point five . 
So I already uh put some pu some numbers here , okay . 
We are going to go through <cough>  
so this is the number the mm number of components we need for this thing . 
So it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about . 
Uh and also things that I uh I d I forget to uh to put like solar cells . 
Oh yeah finally we say no . 
Okay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines . 
So hand dynamo . 
This something we didn't thought about . 
But  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay so we we stick to battery , one . 
No kinetic also . 
I don't I don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo . 
Ah you have to  ah okay I see so kinetic is really uh shaking the banana . 
<laugh> Crazy . 
Okay . 
So those banana is falling . 
Let's go ahead . 
So we we st only have one for battery . 
Uh then for electronics um so I didn't put anything for the  . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
No  so we hin 
Yeah so one . 
Ooh ye ye ye 
the cost is increasing . 
So we are  
The beep . 
That's what  
Okay 
so I'll remove it . 
S 
So don't we need a  
Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing . 
So  
Yeah maybe . 
We'll see later . 
Okay so in  for the case um 
<other> I put single curved . 
Because we have two things . 
No . 
Well . 
What a  
what i if I put one here . 
Yeah 
so let's put one here in the  then instead of single 
oka all right . 
So we stick to plastic , it cost nothing . 
No , 
it's too  
no . 
It's too expensive . 
We're already at eleven . 
Okay 
so I put rubber one . 
Okay so special colour , yellow . 
Uh for the interface we have  
We have three . 
No no . 
We have two scroll , and we have three push buttons . 
<other> 
And  
No it's  no chip . 
This is just radio frequency  . 
Th This is no chip . 
It's just  
Yeah . 
No . 
Just  only  . 
Okay w we didn't think a thought about uh integrated scroll wheel push buttons . 
Yeah , 
so  
Yeah . 
Okay . 
So no L_C_D_ , 
so for  we have no button supplements , 
right ? 
Uh <tongue sounds> 
well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement 
because  
oh no , 
these are these are for colours , co and special forms , special colours and special materials . 
So  
Okay so we are over budget . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So mayb in fact n we have to put two here 
because it cost nothing . 
<cough> 
Exactly exactly 
so we have margin for that stuff . 
Yeah maybe . 
Okay good . 
Wha 
Excellent . 
<other> Um we'll invest in R_ and D_ . 
Yeah . 
So well we're under the the the cost . 
So we can go to  through to project evaluation . 
<other> 
Sorry ? 
<laugh> Which is different . Which is different . 
None of us will buy it . 
This is a battery . <laugh> 
This is what we  which you can mm  
It did  yeah . 
Extra battery , yeah . 
Exac 
<other> 
Well in fact I I did not know <laugh> I didn't know really what to say here . 
<laugh> If uh if you have any ideas of what we can we can say . 
So 
I don't I don't I don't understand what what they mean by satisfaction um and for and for example . 
Should it be more like um like a status of of the  these meetings in fact . 
Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen , not that much . 
Oh yeah it's really creative . 
Yeah . 
Yeah maybe we should go through , yeah an uh evaluation . 
So maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation <cough> in the streets like asking to young peoples well , do you like to have a banana as a remote control . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yep . 
Any any new ideas we could uh we could investigate next time ? 
Dunno , oranges ? 
Hmm . 
Okay . 
<other> Very good . 
<other> So  
Well done . 
I think we we can go 
home . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Maybe maybe we can hassle the the 
production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate . 
 Okay so thanks very much . 
Bye .
