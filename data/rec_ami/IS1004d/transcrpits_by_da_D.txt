<cough> 
What this button for ? 
Okay . 
But if you want to go to page seven hundred ? 
How man 
I don't understand it . 
Can you repeat it ? <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Ah okay okay . Okay . Okay okay . 
Okay . 
I see . I see . Okay . Okay . 
 
<other> Is it really weight ? 
Is it light or  
Okay . 
Okay . 
Ok 
Okay . 
Yeah yeah yeah , I see . I under I understand . 
How long the  
how long the bit the batteries long . 
<laugh> 
I l yeah . 
I like I like it . 
Maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the <other> the multifunctional buttons . 
Looks a bit  
Looks a bit puzzled 
uh I dunno how to say <laugh> that . 
You  the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it's teletext or not  
And the volume button will will become  
And what about people who want to use digits ? 
Butto real buttons ? 
<other> 
Okay . 
Because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff ? 
It's all automatic . 
<laugh> Okay . 
<laugh> Okay yeah it's fine . 
W we are living in a wonderful world . <laugh> 
Automatically configure  . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
S 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
I <other> I const 
I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements . 
And each criteria is <cough> will be evaluated it's uh logical criteria 
so we must users must say i if it's true or is  or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven . 
Because i 
I'm sorry . Sorry . 
Ah yeah . 
It's from  
sorry , 
it's from one to seven . It's from from one to seven 
sorry . 
Because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale , 
and five 
is too short and nine is too long . 
<laugh> I'm a I I'm  
Sorry ? 
Yeah yeah . 
The variance is mi it's is minimal . 
I'm um answering your question . 
Okay . 
<laugh> And that's the criteria I I found more useful . 
I think I sh I <cough> I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ? 
And we all four could range 
could evaluate the  
 
Okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or  
Seven but  <laugh> 
I would say seven . 
It's quite fancy . 
Six . 
Six . 
I would say  <laugh> 
Everything ar 
Mm everything  
It's compared to the all 
remote controls . 
Actually I don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro 
Ah it's not an univer but it's for all kind of T_V_s ? 
Yeah . 
Four . 
Four . 
So four ? 
<laugh> 
It means cool features , like new features actually . 
I would say five . 
You said seven ? <laugh> 
Five . <laugh> 
Sorry , 
I have them  
<laugh> Of cour Of course the most difficult question for the end . <laugh> 
I find it quite cheap <laugh> actually . 
I dunno . If i i it depends , if you live in in Switzerland or you live in  
I don't know . 
Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or  
Yeah this is the the initial specifications . 
I would say six . 
It's quite cheap actually . 
 
Actually maybe  
Yeah  
I change the question . <laugh> 
So yeah upload the  
Yeah it's two different situations 
. If you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for a n for a new one . 
<laugh> 
So ? What now ? What range ? 
Six . 
<laugh> Six ? Six ? 
Six , so it's uh five point five , or less . 
<laugh> 
Actually yeah , 
I  we  
<laugh> 
Five ? 
 You are romantic , really . 
<laugh> I would say two . 
Who is the outlier ? 
Wh wh <laugh> you said five ? 
I don't know if <laugh> it's a  
No because there are more  
yeah , we shouldn't sum like that . 
Because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually . 
Otherwise we wouldn't  we will not sell . 
Uh no I didn't  anything . <cough> <laugh> 
Yeah , 
the uh  
Yeah . 
Do you want me to sum 
o I think it's not  
S 
<laugh> 
Actually what's the differen 
<laugh> Too expensive . 
Actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two , because there is another chip here . 
Yeah but 
you need  
Fo i it does nothing actually ? 
 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy . 
Would  yeah , would buy . 
Yeah because th th the evaluation project  
Ah would buy , yeah . 
Massively , yeah . 
Yeah . Okay . 
Uh you have been in Milan a couple of times , so . 
<laugh> And you said the lowest  . 
Yeah , for the batteries  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
So more general remote control instead of just focusing on uh on T_V_ . 
The complexity shouldn't be much higher . 
For  
you said if it good for D_V_D_ then I would  
 
<laugh> 
Bye .
