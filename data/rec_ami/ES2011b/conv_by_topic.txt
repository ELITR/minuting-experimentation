D:  Okay . 
A:  'Kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . Welcome everybody . Um hope your sessions went well . Um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings <laugh> <other> , and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . 
topic_description:	opening_None


A:  Right . Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this  sure . 
D:  And I can start if you want . Mm . Is there an order ? No . We haven't decided on an order . 
A:  Hm ? No , any any order's fine . Yeah . 
D:  First . Okay . Um , how do I put this  I'll just put the cable in . 
B:  Just uh  
A:  Oh yeah , sorry . 
D:   Is that it ? Can you see ? <laugh> Oh , here . Okay . So what happens it doesn't work ? 
A:  It sh it takes a few seconds I think . 
B:  You may need to  
C:  <laugh> Who's that ? <laugh> 
D:  <other> No . 
C:  <other> . 
D:  Is it in the right thing ? 
B:  But sometimes you have to do it  it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight . 
D:  Oh wait , um . Uh . You need to help me . <laugh> 
A:  Uh-huh , and then press function . 
D:  <other> Yeah . 
A:  and F_ eight . 
C:  Could you just plug it back into hers because she had  oh . 
D:  Oh , wait . That's  is that it ? 
B:  Adjusting . 
A:  Here we are . <laugh> 
B:  The cable might be a little loose or something . Oh , you got it . 
A:  Oh . Is it on ? Okay 
D:  Right here we are . We're here . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


D:  Okay , um . In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um 
A:  . 
D:  a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . 
D:  <other> And that's all I have to say about the matter , <other> um . 
A:  'Kay . 
D:  Shall I  what do I do ? Do I give this to someone else ? 
A:  Yeah . Just move right on . 
topic_description:	marketing expert presentation_None


D:  Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means . Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue . 
A:  Hm . 
D:  Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than  you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together . 
topic_description:	user requirements_None


C:  Right . So get this . Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ? 
A:  <other> Uh function F_ eight . 
D:  Function F_ eight . 
C:  'Kay . What's function ? 
A:  It's the little blue  w it's the one  th yeah . 
C:  Oh function , I see it . There we go . 
A:  Yeah should be  
C:  <other> 
A:  It should be  yeah . 
C:  Okay . Um . This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um <other> just what what functions we need and how to make that 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  the best function for the user . So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet <other> . 
C:  <other> That concludes my presentation . 
A:   
topic_description:	interface specialist presentation_None


C:  And okay so basically um <other> I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . Um <other> so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that  like close together that um <other> are used in the same way , uh <other> or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh  can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ . Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? Um <other> does it do  or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? And um  
topic_description:	look and usability_None


C:  <other> I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but  And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . <other> Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um <other> like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . 
topic_description:	existing products_None


C:  Okay . You need the little thingy . Ooh . 
B:  How do I um  
D:  S That's on view . Oh . 
B:  Right . Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . 
B:  So that concludes my presentation . 
A:  'Kay . 
C:  Do you know about like  I dunno , you seem like you know about  <laugh> 
B:  Mm ? Yeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here . 
C:  Okay . Cool . <laugh> 
A:  Okay . Well thank you everybody . 
topic_description:	industrial designer presentation_None


B:  Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


A:  Um <other> we have  we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so  <laugh> due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um , 
B:  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess . Um if we have something  I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . 
topic_description:	new requirements_None


A:  Okay . Um . So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . Um , yeah . <laugh> Do  Let's  I guess we should yeah make some 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  kind of brainstorming , see what we can  
C:  Like in terms of 
D:  How it looks or  
C:  how it looks , or like what it does ? 
A:  wha what  um <other> well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the the s the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So . 
C:  Okay . Yeah . Okay . 
topic_description:	discussion_None


C:  So  Is our target group then people  so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? So  
A:  <other> I think that seems to  yeah . Mm . 
B:  It's easy to implement . 
C:  Okay . So the  yeah , yeah , yeah . So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , what was it ? 
D:   the the buzzer you mean , yeah , for sure , yeah . 
B:  Locator . 
A:  Yeah , teenagers and young professionals . 
D:  Well that's for speech recognition . 
C:  Oh . 
B:  Well  
A:  Oh , uh . 
D:  And screen . That's only for speech recognition and screen . 
B:  I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one , or  it seems like a silly , I'm not sure how you would implement it . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah yeah yeah . I mean  
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Mm . 
D:  I just put the values <laugh> in . But um the screen is the same as what ,  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  And if if you consider our budget , it probably  if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . Yeah <laugh> . Right so um  yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  It's a cool idea but  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I'm happy with that . <laugh> Completely . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Hu yeah . Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a  like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself . 
B:  Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place  since the T_V_ already has power . Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Okay . Okay . Alright . 
D:  Yeah . Okay . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  <other> Okay . 
A:  So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can  right . 
B:  It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote <laugh> . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  So do you plug it in the T_  you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ? 
B:  Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button . 
D:  Okay . Okay . 
C:  So it's now like a two-part thing . Okay . Alright . 
B:  Yeah , so it would be a two part package . 
D:  Okay . 
C:  So we get to design that too . <laugh> Make it fashionable . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Um , okay . 
A:  So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . Huh . 
B:  Yeah I think so . 
D:  Yeah . Just there . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Mm . Are we um should that thing be on the <other> thing to put the  you s you talking about a home for it . Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ? 
A:  Yeah . We probably leave that . I mean I guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's  
D:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah . Then it can live anywhere . 
A:  Yeah <laugh> . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Okay . For the  so you have that button , that  so there's  is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ? 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Um on the T_V_ or on the phone ? Um it seemed like a  a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , I think that's what the phone has , I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it <laugh> and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . 
D:  Are we just having a radio ? On the phone . 
C:  T 
D:  You don't need a light . Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so  yeah . 
D:  You can hear it's under the couch yeah . Um , <other>  
C:  So i Yeah . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


D:  So need the other buttons . So we have this  mm . 
A:  So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them <laugh> , yeah you you did um , they're  I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . 
D:  Mm-hmm . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  That was that was me . I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . And uh 
A:  Oh really . 'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across  international ? 
A:  They're not  no . 
D:  They're not , no . 
B:  Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s . 
C:  S 
A:  Yeah , that's right , yeah . But D_V_D_ probably is . 
D:  <other> It not V_H_S_ here ? 
B:  Yeah , other than that region and coding thing . 
C:  Um  
D:  But V_C_R_s  
A:  And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah , for sure . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	other_function of prototype


C:  So . Okay , let's see if I can  I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take  like just reduce the number of buttons you know , like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Well for sure we need the um  I think we can just design the channels ? I mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much , s and it's usually that red and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red . 
A:  S 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Huh . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  You know , I've seen some remotes that  where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . So you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just  
D:  Oh okay , yeah . 
C:  It seems like that would be hard though . I mean , like because unless you know  yeah . Just 'cause I wouldn't  I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . <laugh> Yeah . B <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  But  It might be confusing . Yeah . Yeah . Besides you like to be able to go power . <laugh> I have the power <laugh> I guess . So we definitely want a power button and numbers . Right . 
B:  Yeah , I never think to hold something down . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Well even um iPod thing <laugh> <other> , like um , I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of 
C:  That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah . 
D:  scrolling  I don't know . Yeah . Because people li seem  now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no  
A:  Mm . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Know you don't have one two three four five  
C:  Yeah , yeah . I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool , it's it's funny like you f like I just  I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just sort of and  it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , you know . 
A:  Mm . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah yeah , it's just  and it's one thing which has everything . 
C:  Yeah , and it is  yeah . It is really  but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ? 
D:  Well can't it tell the  like can't you  if you  you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then  
B:  Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner . 
C:  Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button . 
A:  Oh that's gonna  Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of  okay . 
C:  Like a disc . Yeah . Yeah . It's like  it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad . 
A:  I've never used one . No . 
D:  It's like l this  like that , and then you do that . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah and then . 
D:  And then you can have um <other>  if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing <other> like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus . 
C:  Okay . So like it's like a little part of the circle that  Or it  oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can  
D:  Yeah , you can  
A:  Well i 
D:  Yeah , click o actually click on to have  
C:  zap . Okay . 
A:  We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . So volume could be like the top it and the bottom  So do you need to  okay . 
B:  Doesn't it rotate though , so it'll be moving around . 
C:  Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like  
D:  What do you mean the function ? 
C:  I mean like okay , 'cause so  I dunno , I guess  Okay  so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . That that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down . But then  so if you wanna switch to the  to u do you have to switch to a function where 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down . 
D:  Yeah but it knows for some reason . The iPod knows . 
C:  It just  It just kno <laugh> the iPod knows . <laugh> S 
B:  <laugh> If it works on an iPod then it works . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want . 
A:  Huh . 
B:  I don't have one . 
D:  Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up . 
C:  Okay . That's what I mean . Okay . Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down . 
B:  Oh . 
D:  And then  well if you do that it goes , but if you  like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that I've seen . 
A:  So it's like holding  You can  o And you you  is there an extra actual button ? Or are you actually  you're just using the mouse to go up and down . Like  
D:  Well what you  for the iPod you press an  w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down . But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , I'm pretty sure  
C:  It's like a b 
A:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Right . Mm-hmm . Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ? Like you could just have  
D:  Yeah . I don't know , you could click and then have it up and down , but I think  
A:  Oh , like  
C:  Like  
A:  Oh you could actually  
C:  I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod . But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , like , it has to be  is that part of  yeah , I dunno , I dunno . You don't think so ? Okay . 
D:  Yeah yeah yeah . 
B:  Yeah <laugh> . 
A:  Yeah . Is that what makes them expensi I think it's all of  they have so much memory though , that's  it's  
B:  <laugh> I don't think so . I don't think it's the wheel dealy . 
D:  I think it  
A:  Yeah . I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they  it can hold what like five thousand songs or something . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . I'm thinking we could  if if we're hav So ba I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know . 
B:  <other> . And they're re-programmable aren't they ? You can put on your songs and then put on a different set , that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just  
A:  S 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah yeah yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . Because , the other thing , I didn't tell you all my presentation <laugh> , is that people find it  find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote and that's another thing they complained about . Um , what other buttons were there ? Volume  oh we've ts just said that . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah . So okay . This is just for T_V_ , it's not for  or it is  does need to be compatible with  
D:  Channel selection . 
B:  I  
A:  Um  
B:  A D_V_D_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject , 
C:  Yeah . So how do you switch  
D:  Menu . 
A:  You know actually our our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things . So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next  But we'll hold off on that 'cause  
B:  and menu maybe . Oh yeah . 
C:  Okay . So like if we had that  Yeah . 
A:  But s yeah uh . 
D:  But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote . 
C:  That's true , yeah . So , I know I'm not c really clear on what  
A:  Yeah . 
B:  But it's cool to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch . 
D:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Mm . Mm . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  So you'd have to have like  I think  you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can  you're either on T_V_ , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like . So  
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons . 
D:  Yeah , it is only fun 
C:  Yeah , but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad . 
A:  But i 
B:  Oh . But I think the circle only does  channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna  but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah but it  it would be  So  but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you're  if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels , but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different  I mean do we need to think about that , that like  
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  Um , yeah , let's think about it 'cause we need to wrap up . Um <laugh> let's see . Um so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire , uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work , um yeah , so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting . See you soon . 
B:  Yes we can try that .
