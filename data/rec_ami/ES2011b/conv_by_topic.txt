D:  Okay . 
A:  'Kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . Welcome everybody . Um hope your sessions went well . Um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings <laugh> <other> , and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . 


A:  Right . Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this  sure . 
D:  And I can start if you want . Mm . Is there an order ? No . We haven't decided on an order . 
A:  Hm ? No , any any order's fine . Yeah . 
D:  First . Okay . Um , how do I put this  I'll just put the cable in . 
B:  Just uh  
A:  Oh yeah , sorry . 
D:   Is that it ? Can you see ? <laugh> Oh , here . Okay . So what happens it doesn't work ? 
A:  It sh it takes a few seconds I think . 
B:  You may need to  
C:  <laugh> Who's that ? <laugh> 
D:  <other> No . 
C:  <other> . 
D:  Is it in the right thing ? 
B:  But sometimes you have to do it  it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight . 
D:  Oh wait , um . Uh . You need to help me . <laugh> 
A:  Uh-huh , and then press function . 
D:  <other> Yeah . 
A:  and F_ eight . 
C:  Could you just plug it back into hers because she had  oh . 
D:  Oh , wait . That's  is that it ? 
B:  Adjusting . 
A:  Here we are . <laugh> 
B:  The cable might be a little loose or something . Oh , you got it . 
A:  Oh . Is it on ? Okay 
D:  Right here we are . We're here . 


D:  Okay , um . In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um 
A:  . 
D:  a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . 
D:  <other> And that's all I have to say about the matter , <other> um . 
A:  'Kay . 
D:  Shall I  what do I do ? Do I give this to someone else ? 
A:  Yeah . Just move right on . 


C:  Right . So get this . Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ? 
A:  <other> Uh function F_ eight . 
D:  Function F_ eight . 
C:  'Kay . What's function ? 
A:  It's the little blue  w it's the one  th yeah . 
C:  Oh function , I see it . There we go . 
A:  Yeah should be  
C:  <other> 
A:  It should be  yeah . 
C:  Okay . Um . This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um <other> just what what functions we need and how to make that 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  the best function for the user . So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet <other> . 
C:  <other> That concludes my presentation . 
A:   


C:  Okay . You need the little thingy . Ooh . 
B:  How do I um  
D:  S That's on view . Oh . 
B:  Right . Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . 
B:  So that concludes my presentation . 
A:  'Kay . 
C:  Do you know about like  I dunno , you seem like you know about  <laugh> 
B:  Mm ? Yeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here . 
C:  Okay . Cool . <laugh> 
A:  Okay . Well thank you everybody . 


A:  Um <other> we have  we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so  <laugh> due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um , 
B:  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess . Um if we have something  I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . 


A:  Okay . Um . So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . Um , yeah . <laugh> Do  Let's  I guess we should yeah make some 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  kind of brainstorming , see what we can  
C:  Like in terms of 
D:  How it looks or  
C:  how it looks , or like what it does ? 
A:  wha what  um <other> well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the the s the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So . 
C:  Okay . Yeah . Okay . 


A:  Um , yeah , let's think about it 'cause we need to wrap up . Um <laugh> let's see . Um so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire , uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work , um yeah , so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting . See you soon . 
B:  Yes we can try that . 
D:  <laugh> Okay . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh>
