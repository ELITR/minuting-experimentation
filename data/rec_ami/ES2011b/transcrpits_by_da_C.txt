<other> 
<laugh> Who's that ? <laugh> 
Could you just plug it back into hers 
because she had  
oh . 
Right . 
So get this . 
Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ? 
'Kay . 
What's function ? 
Oh function , I see it . 
There we go . 
<other> 
Okay . Um . 
This my presentation about the uh technical functions design 
and I basically just tried to focus on um <other> just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . 
So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet <other> . 
And okay so basically um <other> I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . 
Um <other> so I think things like uh 
you know keeping buttons together that  like close together that um <other> are used in the same way , 
uh <other> 
or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , 
keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , 
and also things like is it is it um is it uh  can you c y small enough large enough 
I'm not sure we c 
I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , 
um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ . 
Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? 
Um <other> does it do  
or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? 
And then , is it findable , 
and uh how do we wanna do that ? 
And um  
<other> I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , 
um I dunno if this will work but  
And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . 
<other> Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , 
uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um <other> like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . 
<other> That concludes my presentation . 
Okay . You need the little thingy . 
Ooh . 
Do you know about like  
I dunno , you seem like you know about  <laugh> 
Okay . Cool . <laugh> 
Like in terms of 
how it looks , or like what it does ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . Okay . 
So  
Is our target group then people  
so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? 
So  
Okay . 
So the  
yeah , yeah , yeah . 
So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , 
what was it ? 
Oh . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Hu yeah . 
Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a  like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Alright . 
<other> Okay . 
So it's now like a two-part thing . 
Okay . Alright . 
So we get to design that too . 
<laugh> Make it fashionable . 
Um , okay . 
Yeah . 
Then it can live anywhere . 
Yeah . 
T 
So i Yeah . 
That was that was me . 
I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . 
And uh 
Yeah . 
S 
Um  
Yeah . 
So . Okay , 
let's see if I can  
I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take  like just reduce the number of buttons you know , 
like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a 
you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
It seems like that would be hard though . 
I mean , like because unless you know  
yeah . 
Just 'cause I wouldn't  
I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
B <laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah . 
That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool , 
it's it's funny like you f like I just  
I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , 
and you just sort of and  
it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , 
like it's not that hard , you know . 
Yeah , and it is  yeah . 
It is really  
but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ? 
Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button . 
Yeah . Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Like a disc . 
Yeah . Yeah . It's like  it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad . 
Yeah . 
Yeah and then . 
Okay . 
So like it's like a little part of the circle that  
Or it  
oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can  
zap . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
So volume could be like the top it and the bottom  
So do you need to  
okay . 
Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like  
I mean like okay , 'cause so  
I dunno , I guess  Okay  
so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . 
That that means you're gonna go up the channels , 
and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down . 
But then  
so if you wanna switch to the  to u do you have to switch to a function where 
like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down . 
It just  
It just kno <laugh> the iPod knows . <laugh> S 
Yeah . 
So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want . 
Okay . That's what I mean . Okay . 
Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down . 
It's like a b 
Like  
I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod . 
But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , 
like , it has to be  
is that part of  
yeah , 
I dunno , I dunno . 
You don't think so ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
I'm thinking we could  
if if we're hav So ba 
I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , 
like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So okay . 
This is just for T_V_ , it's not for  or it is  does need to be compatible with  
Yeah . 
So how do you switch  
Okay . 
Yeah . 
So like if we had that  
That's true , yeah . 
So , I know I'm not c really clear on what  
Yeah , yeah . 
So you'd have to have like  
I think  you would have to have like a function switch button , 
you know somewhere so like you can  you're either on T_V_ , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like . So  
Yeah , 
but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad . 
Yeah but it  it would be  
So  but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , 
<laugh> 
so like you're  if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels , 
but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks 
or s you know , to different  
I mean do we need to think about that , 
that like
