'Kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . 
Welcome everybody . 
Um hope your sessions went well . 
Um so this is our functional design meeting , 
we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . 
Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings <laugh> <other> , 
and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder 
so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . 
Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , 
um they're not finished yet . 
Right . 
Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked 
on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this  
sure . 
Hm ? 
No , any any order's fine . Yeah . 
Oh yeah , 
sorry . 
It sh it takes a few seconds I think . 
Uh-huh , and then press function . 
and F_ eight . 
<laugh> 
Here we are . 
Oh . Is it on ? 
Okay . 
Hm . 
'Kay . 
Yeah . Just move right on . 
<other> Uh function F_ eight . 
It's the little blue  w it's the one  th 
yeah . 
Yeah should be  
It should be  yeah . 
<laugh> 
 
'Kay . 
Okay . 
Well thank you everybody . 
Um <other> we have  
we'll discuss that 
and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . 
Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so  <laugh> due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um , 
also our remote should be used only for television , um , 
no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . 
Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , 
so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , 
so let's be fashionable I guess . 
Um if we have something  
I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , 
so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . 
Okay . Um . 
So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . 
Um , yeah . <laugh> Do  Let's  
I guess we should yeah make some 
kind of brainstorming , 
see what we can  
wha what  um <other> 
well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group 
and I dunno the the s 
the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So . 
<other> I think that seems to  yeah . Mm . 
Yeah , teenagers and young professionals . 
Oh , uh . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
And if if you consider our budget , it probably  
if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . 
Yeah <laugh> . 
Right so um  yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
right . 
So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can  
Yeah , yeah . 
Huh . 
So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
We probably leave that . 
I mean I guess one takes care of the other , 
like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's  
Yeah <laugh> . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so 
 yeah . 
So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r 
I don't remember who showed them <laugh> , 
yeah you you did um , 
they're  
I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . 
Oh really . 
'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities . 
They're not  no . 
Yeah , that's right , yeah . 
But D_V_D_ probably is . 
And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days . 
S 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Huh . 
You know , I've seen some remotes that  where you just hold one , 
like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . 
So you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just  
But  
It might be confusing . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Besides you like to be able to go power . 
<laugh> I have the power <laugh> 
I guess . 
So we definitely want a power button and numbers . 
Right . 
Mm . <laugh> 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Oh that's gonna  
Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of  
I've never used one . No . 
okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Well i 
We could we could even have four buttons , 
like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well . 
<laugh> 
Huh . 
So it's like holding  
You can  o 
And you 
you  
is there an extra actual button ? 
Or are you actually  you're just using the mouse to go up and down . 
Like  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Right . 
Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ? 
Like you could just have  
Oh , like  
Oh you could actually  
Yeah . 
Is that what makes them expensi 
I think it's all of  
they have so much memory though , 
that's  it's  
Yeah . 
I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they  it can hold what like five thousand songs or something . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
S 
Mm . 
Um  
You know actually our our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things . 
So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next  
But we'll hold off on that 'cause  
But s yeah uh . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
But i 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Um , yeah , let's think about it 
'cause we need to wrap up . 
Um <laugh> let's see . 
Um so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire , 
uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work , 
um yeah , so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting . 
See you soon .
