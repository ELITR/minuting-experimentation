Just uh  
You may need to  
But sometimes you have to do it  
it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight . 
Adjusting . 
The cable might be a little loose or something . 
Oh , you got it . 
How do I um  
Right . 
Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , 
um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . 
Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , 
the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . 
And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . 
So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , 
um input which would probably be buttons , 
although um we just talked about voice recognition , 
processor to take the information , 
um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , 
and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . 
And also you need a sender for location signal , 
which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . 
And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . 
Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , 
um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb 
which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . 
And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , 
um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . 
That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , 
and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . 
Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , 
that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , 
um a button pad for input , 
um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , 
I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , 
that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . 
Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it 
and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . 
So that concludes my presentation . 
Mm ? 
Yeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
It's easy to implement . 
Locator . 
Well  
I was thinking about that 
but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , 
and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one , 
or  
it seems like a silly , 
I'm not sure how you would implement it . 
<laugh> 
It's a cool idea but  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place  since the T_V_ already has power . 
Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , 
and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , 
um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . 
Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . 
It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote <laugh> . 
Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ 
so if you need to find the remote , click the button . 
Yeah , so it would be a two part package . 
<laugh> 
Yeah I think so . 
<laugh> 
Um on the T_V_ or on the phone ? 
Um it seemed like a  a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , 
I think that's what the phone has , 
I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it <laugh> and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . 
<laugh> 
Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across  international ? 
Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s . 
Yeah , other than that region and coding thing . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , I never think to hold something down . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner . 
Doesn't it rotate though , 
so it'll be moving around . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> If it works on an iPod then it works . 
I don't have one . 
Oh . 
Yeah <laugh> . 
<laugh> I don't think so . 
I don't think it's the wheel dealy . 
Yeah . 
<other> . 
And they're re-programmable aren't they ? 
You can put on your songs and then put on a different set , 
that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
I  
A D_V_D_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject , 
and menu maybe . 
Oh yeah . 
But it's cool to have it all on one , 
because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch . 
Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons . 
Oh . 
But I think the circle only does  
channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna  
but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch . 
Yes we can try that .
