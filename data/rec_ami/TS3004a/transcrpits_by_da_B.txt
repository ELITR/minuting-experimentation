Two . 
Good morning . 
Mouse . 
Come on . 
There we are . 
<laugh> 
Let's just check one more time . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
One uh  most to the right . 
Yes that one . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
Yeah . 
Purple . 
<laugh> 
Looks very nice . 
<laugh> A pink elephant . 
<laugh> The water is important . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh>  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Like this ? 
Okay . Um 
let's make it um a dog . 
Ooh . 
 
Ah okay . 
A pig ? 
I can make  
a dog . 
<laugh>  Um  
'Kay , 
I make a cat of it . 
Oh , 
not too quick . 
No 
I have it . 
I just draw too quick I think . 
Okay , 
that's it . 
More . 
It's just to get used to it . 
Yeah , that's right , 
it  
but you actually got to write on the paper . 
You really got to write on that paper . 
Yeah , 
but it's just a picture . 
You really  
No . 
It's a donkey . 
Uh I think it was uh  
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Piece of cake . 
Uh easy . 
Universal . 
And only television ? 
Or more devices ? 
Ah okay . 
Not just a T_V_ . 
Okay . 
Well 
we can try to make it special . 
Well  
<other> 
Yeah . 
Nothing  
N 
 It shouldn't be too big , 
but I don't think we can make it too small , 
'cause it has to have a lot of functions , 
so . 
We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think . 
Yeah . 
Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem . 
Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer , 
maybe more trendy . 
Fold open , 
where you can see uh more options . I think  
Yeah , 
something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often . 
Yeah 
b I wanted  
No 
you can make an uh manual in it . 
But that's  
Yeah , I think it's much uh  too expensive . 
Yeah , too fragile . 
<laugh> Yeah  . 
Yeah . 
Maybe that's a good idea , 
but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think . 
Well 
uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ? 
Maybe have  uh  
Yeah , 
'cause well  
Yeah . 
Maybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately . 
Rechargeable . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well 
I think we have to look at that , 
'cause well you can do  the standard way , 
but then you won't  
Well 
you can um have uh <other> the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see . 
But the rest is uh you don't use that often , 
so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well . 
So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think , 
so you can do something unique with that . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah  . 
That's what I meant . 
Uh  
Okay , but yeah . 
<other> No , 
what you want to do with it . 
Yeah , 
I also wrote down some stuff 
that you want on a  
Technical fun fu 
What do you want to do with your remote control , 
what do you need on your remote control . 
I already wrote some down , some ideas . 
Yep . 
There's already a document in the folder about it . 
Okay . 
I will . 
It didn't say that . 
Your fault . 
<laugh> 
Bye bye .
