Hello . 
Ah . 
Plate ? <laugh> 
Uh I also forgot my mouse , 
but I don't need my mouse , I think . 
<laugh> 
Damn computers . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Can you hear me ? Hello ? 
Test . 
I dunno . 
Check . 
Okay . I think it works . 
Mm-hmm . 
We're gonna make a remote control . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Press F_ eleven . 
<other> 
Folder , 
yes . 
<laugh> 
Ah I can see it now . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> It look like a dinosaurs . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Let me try one . 
Okay . 
Mm . Okay 
and then uh what's the colour ? 
How do I do  
Ah . 
I'll take this one . 
Uh there has to be water , 
but  <laugh> 
Yeah yeah , 
but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water . 
So I first uh draw the water . 
Uh . Okay , 
and now 
I make the animal . 
It's a fish . 
Mm-hmm . 
So . <laugh> Um  
This is a worm . 
 
<laugh> Okay , 
who next ? Uh  
Okay . 
Well 
Paul ? <laugh> 
<other> 
I think it's a pig . 
Or a dog . 
A sheep ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
No . 
Yeah yeah , 
it's a real pen . 
Oh . 
Y you can you can't edit in the  edit it in Word . 
Oh , okay . 
<laugh> 
Half past ten . 
Brilliant . 
Yep . 
<laugh> <laugh> 
<laugh> <laugh> 
Yeah , 
my first question was does it have to be a <other> a universal remote control ? 
Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart . 
So 
I  
Because   
Yeah , 
I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros 
Yeah , I think . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Well 
I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , 
  we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , 
so uh that's no matter . 
<other> Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , 
because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , 
so uh 
it's not only for the uh technical persons . 
Um I think it must be a very good control , 
so you can uh uh uh act uh <other> use it from uh everywhere in your room , 
the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality . 
No . Yeah . 
I dunno um  
Yes 
Ah 
that's that's  
Ah right right . 
Oh 
that's good , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
but 
Yeah 
but it's not reachable I think , touch screen . 
And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control , 
because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken . 
Yeah 
and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it 
and touchscreen is not uh kids uh  
<laugh> 
Um  
Ma maybe a home station . 
Yeah . 
Ah yeah . 
 
<other> 
Yeah , 
but a home station is uh a really good idea , 
because uh lots of people are  uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is , 
and now you can put it always at the same place . 
Maybe it's  
Therefore it's a good idea , 
but maybe it's expensive . 
Yeah . 
You can  
yeah , 
you can buy it with it . 
Oh yeah . 
Uh I I set something on paper already ,  size , looks , uh usable , 
uh the buttons on usable places , 
uh the the on off button must be on top , 
uh it has to lay good in the hand , 
you you have to uh  
Yeah , 
I don't I don't know I don't know 
if we  
You can make it very special , to create our own um looks , 
but it's very hard to  
Nah . 
Yeah yeah , 
what Paul already said . 
Uh on on top are the the basic options on top , 
and if you fold it open  
 
Mm . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an  uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control . 
Okay . 
Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user , 
a as a a a only the looks and the  
Okay . Yeah , 
it's also about strength and uh for everything uh . 
Okay . 
Yep . 
Okay . 
Yeah , me too . 
Okay , 
well done . 
Oh Paul . <laugh> 
Ciao . 
<laugh> <other> Bye bye .
