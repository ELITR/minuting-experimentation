Hello . Hello . 
You have to put it exactly on the on the  
yeah . 
I took your mouse . 
Yeah 
just  
yeah , 
no , 
that's for me , 
I just have to make some notes . 
I got my uh mouse . 
 <laugh> yeah . 
 
Uh actually my laptop doesn't work , 
 switch it on again . 
Oh no . 
So 
you all read what we are going to do or not ? 
Okay . 
Yeah , that's right . 
I just made a a simple uh presentation . 
So you  put some things in it . 
Okay . 
How does this work ? 
I dunno .  
This one ? 
Ah 
cool . 
Okay . So 
that's my name ,  . 
Uh we're going to make uh a remote control , 
you already know that . 
Just have a look , 
are we going to  uh this agenda of our meeting . 
You know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting . 
So um 
the  thing we have to know is 
you already know what we're going to do , 
you also read what this the things  or , not yet , 
okay . 
So um , yeah , 
it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly 
 that's what we're going to design . 
Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control . 
Fir the first thing is th the functional design , 
that's very important . 
We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , 
it's for the f next meeting . 
The the second thing is the conceptual design , 
that's what it  
that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . 
And we have to look what uh the market is doing for  what kind of uh remote controls are in the market . 
And the third thing is uh the detailed design 
um and that's exa 
yeah , 
you know what it is , 
it's exactly how it looks and whatever . <laugh> 
Okay so  uh no , 
this is a  
these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one . 
And you already saw  you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map . 
Folder , okay . 
So no okay  
have a look at that one . 
Okay . So uh 
what we're going to do first is um 
so 
you can read . <laugh> 
You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard 
and um and say why it's your favourite animal . 
So 
and you have  
this is just to try it out 
and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen . 
So okay , so 
first have to show you , 
maybe you can come here to have a look how it works . 
Yes ? 
Okay . 
This a new page , 
it's okay . 
Use pen format . 
and a different colour can use here  
no 
I just take the pink . 
You take  
oh 
there's no pink , 
okay , oh 
just purple , okay . 
No 
blue . 
And uh 
line width <other> ten . 
Okay uh 
just take  
what I'm going to draw is an elephant . 
Just draw slowly , 
because otherwise it won't work . 
It's a very nice elephant , you can see . 
I dunno what it looks  
but it doesn't matter . <laugh> 
I just h 
Something like this ? 
Oh no  
Yeah , okay . 
Because I like  
uh okay . 
Just takes so long , 
okay . 
Whatever , 
just . 
You erased this one . 
It's a bit slow you can see , 
this is a bit annoying . 
Okay , so 
just for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want . 
Just don't 
um  yeah , 
just u use it like that , 
yeah . That's okay . 
 
It's in format . 
Yeah . 
Just  
No 
it has to be an animal , 
so if that's it's  
it should be a shna snake or something . 
Okay . Okay okay . Okay . 
<laugh> 
Okay , 
cool . 
Hmm yeah , that's nice . 
Uh do you have to write down why  
uh that doesn't matter , 
just  it's to get used to the whiteboard , 
but it's okay . 
Just make a new blank new blank page . 
Yeah , 
not too far to the to the t pen top . 
Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back , 
so that  
no , 
to the  
yeah . 
No , 
it's a dog . <laugh> 
Uh we d only have twenty five minutes , 
so  . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Use your fantasy . <laugh> 
Just hold it more more to the back 
then you don't have  
okay . 
No , 
that's okay , 
thank you . <laugh> 
I thought these pens would be just um  uh you write it down and you download it to Word , 
you already did it or no ? 
No , not yet , okay . 
But it's just  
Sorry ? 
Yeah , 
I know , 
but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word , 
so that's not 
just  
it's just a picture . 
So <laugh> 
it's not that cool as I th thought it would be . 
No . 
<laugh> 
I don't know , 
what time did we start this meeting , 
I'm not sure . 
Half past . 
Okay . 
Okay , 
perfect . 
Yeah , 
thank you . 
Now we just have to save everything , 
so . <laugh> 
<laugh> Oh 
this is definitely the best one . 
Okay , so uh 
what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros . 
Okay , 
that's  . 
And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , 
so we have to uh use a big market in Europe . 
The production cost are about half the price of selling price , 
sorry . 
So 
can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , 
I dunno . 
Uh so 
we're gonna have  a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the  and everything , 
so just have a look how it  we think about remote controls . 
Oh yeah , 
that's a good question . 
I think it's  
I'm not I'm not sure , 
it's not mm  I think  
I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros , 
so  
not sure , 
but  
Okay , 
so 
we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . 
Okay , perfect . 
Yeah , everything 
just  
so a lot of buttons <laugh> on the remote control . 
No , 
just everything . 
 . so yeah , 
what what what's a remote control , 
it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , 
it's not  nothing very special , 
but um  
yeah , that's right . 
So 
do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability 
or user <other> 
Hmm yeah . 
That's right . Should be a good point . 
Just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it . 
But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open . 
Okay , 
yeah , that's cool . 
Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something , 
if you just  
Yeah . 
Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? 
There are buttons on it . 
Okay . 
But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it . 
 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So . 
And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile . 
No . 
You can put games on your remote control . Whatever . <laugh> 
Oh 
maybe that's a good idea , 
just to put it on your television and just s recharge , 
you never have to use any batteries . 
Yeah , 
how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ? 
I dunno . 
<cough> 
Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably  it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , 
because maybe it's too expensive . 
Yeah , that's right , yeah . 
The option , just the option , that's cool . 
Yeah . 
Has it be  has  
does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control 
or  
Yeah 
Yeah . 
Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine . 
But maybe it's 
maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh 
 what's it's called ? 
 Maybe it's hard t 
No , that's right . 
So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control  . 
Just think about it . 
We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , 
so . 
There's some more things . 
We have uh another thirty minutes , 
so then we're going to meet again . 
So you know what you have to  what you have to do ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I think this  if you  you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things . 
Also from a user , but all these things together . 
Yeah , everything . 
Yeah , 
no maybe not not uh  , 
that's not a f that's something for for for  yeah . 
That's not for you . 
Just if  
what's in the market , 
what's normal , 
uh what kind of uh buttons do you have . 
Yeah , it's alright . 
Yeah , 
just  
is that okay ? 
Okay . 
So 
see you in thirty minutes . 
For the next time you have to uh put it exactly on the square , so  your laptop . 
<laugh> 
No , 
sorry .
