Nice , 
eh ? <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Uh . 
Excuse me . 
Yeah , it probably would be universal . 
Hmm , maybe , 
I don't know . 
And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player 
and  
okay .

<laugh> 
Okay . 
And how big should it be ?

n 
Yeah , 
or you c 
O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control . 
<other> Uh maybe be uh it's it's  
Yeah , 
or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small . 
Uh like a a to have

Uh should you put it in a recharger 
or a  just  
Mm yeah .

Yeah , 
if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive , 
but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
but I have a mouse that's uh uh also uh  
Yeah , 
and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , 
or you can change your batteries , 
so . 
Yeah . 
N 
uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , 
when you have it closed , you <other> can still uh do the th the functions . 
Yeah .
