topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  Okay . So that's my name ,  . Uh we're going to make uh a remote control , you already know that . Just have a look , are we going to  uh this agenda of our meeting . You know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting . 
topic_description:	opening_None


A:  So um the  thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do , you also read what this the things  or , not yet , okay . So um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly  that's what we're going to design . Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control . Fir the first thing is th the functional design , that's very important . We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the f next meeting . 
B:  Yes . 
A:  The the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it  that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . And we have to look what uh the market is doing for  what kind of uh remote controls are in the market . And the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah , you know what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever . <laugh> Okay so  uh no , this is a  these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one . And you already saw  you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map . Folder , okay . 
D:  Folder , yes . 
A:  So no okay  have a look at that one . Okay . 
topic_description:	project specs and roles of participants_None

D:  <laugh> 
A:  So okay , so first have to show you , maybe you can come here to have a look how it works . Yes ? Okay . This a new page , it's okay . Use pen format . 
D:  Ah I can see it now . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  and a different colour can use here  no I just take the pink . You take  oh there's no pink , okay , oh just purple , okay . No blue . And uh line width <other> ten . Okay uh just take  what I'm going to draw is an elephant .

A:  I thought these pens would be just um  uh you write it down and you download it to Word , you already did it or no ? No , not yet , okay . But it's just  
D:  No . 
B:  Yeah , that's right , it  but you actually got to write on the paper . You really got to write on that paper . 
A:  Sorry ? Yeah , I know , but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word , so that's not just  it's just a picture . So <laugh> it's not that cool as I th thought it would be . 
D:  Yeah yeah , it's a real pen . 
B:  Yeah , but it's just a picture .

topic_description:	drawing exercise_None


A:  Okay , so uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros . 
C:  Excuse me . 
A:  Okay , that's  . And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to uh use a big market in Europe . 
B:  Piece of cake . 
A:  The production cost are about half the price of selling price , sorry . 
B:  Uh easy . 
A:  So can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno . 
topic_description:	project specs and roles of participants_None


A:  Uh so we're gonna have  a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the  and everything , so just have a look how it  we think about remote controls . 
topic_description:	discussion_None


D:  Yeah , my first question was does it have to be a <other> a universal remote control ? 
A:  Oh yeah , that's a good question . 
D:  Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart . 
A:  I think it's  I'm not I'm not sure , it's not mm  I think  
D:  So I  
C:  Yeah , it probably would be universal . 
B:  Universal . And only television ? Or more devices ? 
D:  Because   
A:  I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros , so  not sure , but  
C:  Hmm , maybe , I don't know . 
D:  Yeah , I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros 
A:  Okay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . Okay , perfect . 
D:  Yeah , I think . 
B:  Ah okay . 
C:  And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player and  okay . 
A:  Yeah , everything just  so a lot of buttons <laugh> on the remote control . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah , probably . 
B:  Not just a T_V_ . 
A:  No , just everything . 
B:  Okay . 
A:   . so yeah , what what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it's not  nothing very special , but um  yeah , that's right . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  Well we can try to make it special . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user <other> 
B:  Well  
D:  Well I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television ,   we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that's no matter . <other> Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons . Um I think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh <other> use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality . 
A:  Hmm yeah . 
B:  <other> 
A:  That's right . Should be a good point . 
B:  Yeah . Nothing  
C:  Okay . And how big should it be ? 
B:  N 
D:  No . Yeah . I dunno um  
B:   It shouldn't be too big , but I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think . 
A:  Just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it . 
B:  Yeah . Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem . Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer , 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yes 
B:  maybe more trendy . 
A:  But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open . Okay , yeah , that's cool . Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something , if you just  okay . 
B:  Fold open , where you can see uh more options . I think  
D:  Ah that's that's  
C:  Yeah n 
B:  Yeah , something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often . 
D:  Ah right right . 
C:  Yeah , or you c 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh that's good , yeah . 
C:  O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control . 
B:  Yeah b I wanted  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? There are buttons on it . 
C:  <other> Uh maybe be uh it's it's  
B:  No you can make an uh manual in it . 
C:  Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Yeah , but 
A:  But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it . 
B:  But that's  Yeah , I think it's much uh  too expensive . 
C:  Uh like a a to have  Yeah , maybe it would . 
D:  Yeah but it's not reachable I think , touch screen . And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control , because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken . 
A:   Yeah . Yeah . So . And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile . 
B:  Yeah , too fragile . 
D:  Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh  
A:  No . You can put games on your remote control . Whatever . <laugh> 
C:  Kid-proof . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah  . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


C:  <laugh> And uh how about the batteries ? Uh should you put it in a recharger or a  just  
D:  Um  
A:  Oh maybe that's a good idea , just to put it on your television and just s recharge , you never have to use any batteries . 
D:  Ma maybe a home station . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm yeah . 
B:  Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think . 
A:  Yeah , how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ? 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , I dunno . 
B:  Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ? 
A:  I dunno . 
C:  Yeah , if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive , but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing . 
A:  <cough> 
D:  Ah yeah .  
B:  Maybe have  uh  
D:  <other> 
A:  Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably  it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive . 
B:  Yeah , 'cause well  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , but a home station is uh a really good idea , because uh lots of people are  uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is , and now you can put it always at the same place . Maybe it's  
A:  Yeah , that's right , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive . 
B:  Maybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately . 
D:  Yeah . You can  yeah , you can buy it with it . 
C:  Yeah , but I have a mouse that's uh uh also uh  
B:  Rechargeable . 
C:  Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , or you can change your batteries , so . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh yeah . 
A:  The option , just the option , that's cool . 
C:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


D:  Uh I I set something on paper already ,  size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top , uh it has to lay good in the hand , you you have to uh  
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Has it be  has  does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control or  
D:  Yeah , I don't I don't know I don't know if we  
B:  Well I think we have to look at that , 'cause well you can do  the standard way , but then you won't  
D:  You can make it very special , to create our own um looks , but it's very hard to  
A:  Yeah 
C:  N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works . 
D:  Nah . 
B:  Well you can um have uh <other> the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see . But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well . So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think , so you can do something unique with that . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you <other> can still uh do the th the functions . Yeah . But n <other> yeah , but uh i <other> basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so , so . 
D:  Yeah yeah , what Paul already said . Uh on on top are the the basic options on top , and if you fold it open  
A:  Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  But maybe it's 
D:   
B:  Yeah  . That's what I meant . 
A:  maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh  what's it's called ? 
D:  Mm . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an  uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control . 
A:   Maybe it's hard t 
B:  Uh  
A:  No , that's right . So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control  . 
B:  Okay , but yeah . 
A:  Just think about it . 
C:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , so . There's some more things . We have uh another thirty minutes , so then we're going to meet again . So you know what you have to  what you have to do ? 
C:  Okay . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the  
B:  <other> No , what you want to do with it . 
A:  Yeah , I think this  if you  you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things . Also from a user , but all these things together . Yeah , everything . 
D:  Okay . Yeah , it's also about strength and uh for everything uh . 
B:  Yeah , I also wrote down some stuff that you want on a  
A:  Yeah , no maybe not not uh  , that's not a f that's something for for for  yeah . That's not for you . 
B:  Technical fun fu 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Just if  what's in the market , what's normal , uh what kind of uh buttons do you have . 
B:  What do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control . I already wrote some down , some ideas . 
A:  Yeah , it's alright . 
D:  Yep . 
A:  Yeah , just  is that okay ? 
D:  Okay . 
B:  Yep . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  There's already a document in the folder about it . 
D:  Yeah , me too . 
A:  So see you in thirty minutes . 
D:  Okay , well done . 
B:  Okay . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  For the next time you have to uh put it exactly on the square , so  your laptop . 
B:  I will . 
D:  Oh Paul . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  It didn't say that . 
A:  No , sorry .
