Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch . 
Um <other> . 
Alright we're moving on to conceptual design . 
<laugh> 
Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . 
Um , <other> under marketing we targeted our audience , 
and  Um , yeah . 
That was <laugh> generally <laugh>  how helpful that was . 
Um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , 
um , we discussed an iPod-like button system 
which , uh , we haven't concluded but we're  
Right , um  
So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what  where you've come from our last time . 
Does everyone have presentations ? 
Okay . 
Would anybody like to go first ? 
Okay . 
And why not wood ? 
And why not wood ? <laugh>  <laugh> 
'S good . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I think it's the next  it's the blue one , yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time . 
You need a screen for it ? 
We're , um , we're actually not having D_V_D_ , 
that was one of th I I was  
sorry , 
I I meant to update you on that . Um . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
You've  
Yeah , I know what you're saying , 
you have to  
But but imagine someone with s 
But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . 
Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to  
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Right . 
Yeah 
I mean with that many options , you'd  <other> uh  I'd think that the screen would be better , 
because you could have that menu option , sort of  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh . <laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
So the T_V_ is the screen , that  
yeah 
So it would have all these different options of changing 
to  
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Um , right . 
What if  
I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes , 
um , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing , 
or whatever we're thinking . 
I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? 
Or  
Yeah . 
So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . 
I mean  
okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah . 
Yeah . 
But , were there buttons on there as well ? 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
What if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? 
Like you  
so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? 
So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it . 
Do  
do you know what I'm talking about though ? 
Like , uh , yeah just something  
Yeah , that you can flip over , yeah , yeah . 
Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing 
is is  if w I  
if we can do this , that'd probably be  
Yeah , yeah . 
So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this  how they actually programme these things , and if that's  
yeah . 
I mean it  would y would  that would be  
<laugh> 
Huh . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
you don't know they mean , yeah , 
it's like  
yeah . 
Mm . 
And it is technologically innovative in a way , 
so that fits with the  
B 
Yeah . 
Oh god . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Ah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I mean definitely the area round it . 
<laugh> <weird noises> 
Yeah . 
An orange . <laugh> <other> <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
So what if  what 
 this is  
I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . 
If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , 
so like what you're feeling is comfortable , 
and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is . 
And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there . 
Is that kind of  
I  'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours . 
Um  
<laugh> 
I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just  the feedback we've just got about the  
A ball ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
This is just  
Okay . 
Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . Squashy . 
That 
 see I was thinking this s 
sorry  
I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing . 
And like this  you could have like you could have like cherries and <laugh> things around there . 
Um but  
I was thinking if it was like this  
'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy  
It's almost like your thumb is farther up , 
so if if you could squish it lower then  
Yeah , I know what you meant , yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Hmm . 
Well that's not very neat , but <laugh>  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
It was , yeah , silver and yellow . 
It l it looks like  
<laugh> I don't  
Yeah . <laugh> 
I mean that's another question , 
where are we gonna  
we we should have the logo somewhere on it . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
th and that would  that  
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me . 
<laugh> But if someone  
components concept . Question mark . 
Energy . Question mark . 
Was that you ? 
Okay . 
Oh right right . Yeah . 
Um , so what d but what do we know about 
energy ? 
I mean we're gonna use batteries right ? 
And  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I think batteries sound good . 
What does everyone else think ? <laugh> 
What about Kryptonite ? <laugh> 
Yeah . 
What does chip on print mean ? 
Uh-huh . 
Okay . 
Right . 
So , chip on print is just  means like that they're mass-produced . 
Okay . 
And case ? 
Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about , 
yeah . Casing . Yeah . 
 thinking of like syntactic case and thi 
um <laugh> let's see . 
Is there anything else we need to 
talk about ? 
Oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough . 
Um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . 
And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation . 
So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach . 
Mm . 
See you soon . 
Does it matter that I end early ? 
How how early is it ? 
I didn't get a pop-up thing that said
