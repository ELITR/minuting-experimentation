A:  Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . 
A:  Um , <other> under marketing we targeted our audience , 
A:  Um , then we considered some design options with how it should look ,

abst_sum - abstract: The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting.

B:  So I've been looking at the components design . 
B:  Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . 
B:  Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , 
B:  And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , 
B:  Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . 
B:  And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . 
B:  Um , I'd recommend against titanium 
B:  Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case . 
B:  <laugh> Uh , well we can use wood . 
B:  <laugh> I don't know why we'd want to .

abst_sum - abstract: The Industrial Designer gave her presentation on components and discussed which would have to be custom-made and which were standard.

B:  Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . 
B:  Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip .

abst_sum - abstract: She also discussed the various materials and chips available.

D:  Um , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material 
D:  and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . 
D:  Um . Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . 
D:  And th last thing is the easy to use um factor . 
D:  Um , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the <laugh> is the current trend 
D:  So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . 
D:  And also go for a spongy feel , 
D:  I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . 
D:  Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables , 
D:  should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ?

abst_sum - abstract: She discussed the current fruits and vegetables trend and the trend toward softer, spongier materials.

C:  we're gonna try to talk about , um <other> what kind of uh  how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design . 
C:  And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . 
C:  <other> Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . 
C:  I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ? 
C:  it seems like you would need a screen . 
D:  But the screen can come up on the telly , the  she said . 
C:  Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen  I think  
C:  So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? 
C:  I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen 
C:  So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if  
C:  I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on . 
C:  I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , 
B:  You have to get a  an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , 
B:  which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal . 
C:  that , like , then you hit that and then you can  it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ 
C:  Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess ,

C:  And then there's also the concern about you know um <other> how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , 
A:  So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this  how they actually programme these things , and if that's  
B:  Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ? 
B:  I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_ , not inside the remote .

abst_sum - abstract: The group discussed how the menu function would be programmed.

A:  I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes , 
A:  I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? 
A:  So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . 
C:  Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing . 
B:  W when we had the wheely remote control , we  it was on the top I think , if you held it like that . 
A:  What if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? 
D:  um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing . 
A:  and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is . 
A:  And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there . 
D:  Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , 
C:  oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , 
C:  so so maybe one you know  you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing <laugh>

B:  I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case . 
B:  Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo , 
D:  Oh , a dynamo is  ah , <clicks fingers> it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . 
B:  Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself . 
B:  So I sort of picked battery . 
D:  No . But dynamo  the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it <other> creates energy on its own . 
D:  So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . 
D:  But we need to find cost . 
B:  Like the chip is probably the most expensive part .
