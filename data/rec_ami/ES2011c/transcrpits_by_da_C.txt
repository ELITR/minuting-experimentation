<other> 
<Hiccough> 'Scuse me . <laugh> <cough> 
Yes . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
So . 
Oh , uh , there we go . 
<other> Uh . 
Okay . Um . 
Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh . 
<laugh> I actually wasn't aware of the <laugh> new trends in electronics 
and and uh  <laugh> <other> 
So so okay , let me get this right . 
Okay , uh  
Okay , alright anyway . 
Um <other> here we go . 
Conceptual User Interface . 
Trying  
we're gonna try to talk about , um <other> what kind of uh  how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design . 
And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . 
<other> Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . 
Um , kind of  
I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ? 
'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this  it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um <other> the wheel 
you  
it seems like you would need a screen . 
But like if you think about it  
yeah but if  
so is it just  okay . 
So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ? 
Are we  
Okay . 
<laugh> Alright . Okay . 
Okay . Okay . 
So anyway if  
well we just  
we need to  
Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen  I think  
I was thinking  okay . 
So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? 
And you're just gonna  
I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a  
right . 
Yeah 
like you're g 
yeah 
like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can  
okay we're not choosing that , I guess . 
But like choose channel control , 
like if you wa 
Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine . 
So that   
 people seems to be  well  
You know . 
But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . 
So um <other> 
I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen 
because  
So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if  
or or  
then again if you just  
I guess  I c 
I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on . 
You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or  
I oh yeah ? 
'Cause you'll have to like  
but you can quickly s you can  <other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be  you  
I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , 
and um  
So you're either  you're  you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different 
uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume 
or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . 
Like if you just wanted to go to like  from five to six you could tap or someth 
And then there's also the concern about you know um <other> how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , 
or if you want to um <other> you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes 
like turn on the timer or like something something like that , 
like  
I would think so too , like  
So I mean  
and it seems it w 
it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , 
because  
but then again it would  
it does make kind of  
if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of  
m yeah . 
Yeah , that's the only thing though . 
Yeah . 
So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , um  
<other> You can get to  you know , you can  
Like maybe it'll be that central button 
that , like , then you hit that and then you can  it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ 
and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the  
yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up . 
Hmm ? 
Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess , 
but um  
'cause that just  
it does seem like , it  that would be , like , incredibly expensive , 
but  I dunno , 
and then  so , 
it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything . 
So  
Yeah . 
It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow 
I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_ . 
Yeah . Yeah definitely . 
Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing . 
I mean it it needs to be easy to  
somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate 
and use your  
I mean how do how do  
I'm not really  
Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it . So  
<other> Yeah . Or your thumb or something . So  
Yeah . 
Yeah , so  
Mm yeah . 
Yeah , 
so  
but I mean I think it could be pretty small . 
Like , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that 
you can  
But can't you just get  
K 
Yeah , 
But , I mean , do you need that ? 
If if you can get to , you know  if  
so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen . 
That keeps it 
really  
Yeah . 
Uh you wouldn't  
I don't  
I just don't think you would even need it . 
So  
Mean  
I mean you can do it , 
you  it's  
it doesn't seem that hard . 
I mean I've never bought a remote . 
It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television , 
which is a little  
My  
I've never bought just a remote , like , so I don't I don't really know . 
But um  
So , um  
but I mean it's  
I've never had a hard time with like my remotes , 
like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . 
And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well so  
So , do we need  
I dunno . 
Well I guess we have to you know think about  
But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up . 
That's what it does anyway . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So , but  
oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ? 
On the telly , okay , yeah . 
So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea 
because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those  like okay now I hit this  you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date . 
Yeah . I guess . 
And it is trendy , the iPods are <other> really hot right now , so  
Um , yeah , by web research , yeah , 
so  
Oh . 
Yeah . 
Oh , okay , that would be cool . 
Mm . <other> 
Yeah , 
c that's e that would be kind of  oh , 
you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing . 
But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda  
so you're like  <laugh> 
Or what if we integrated the <laugh> the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables 
we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like 
a vegetable . <laugh> 
<other> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or  
Yeah . 
So I think  
yeah , colours . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables . 
I do I dunno . 
Um  
That's in the shape of a fruit , like a  
Yeah . 
Oh I like that shape . 
Yeah . 
<other> Yeah <other> . 
It's like it has to be s 
yeah <other> . 
Yeah . 
What if , yeah , what if the squishy , 
oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , 
and you can  
so so maybe one you know  you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing <laugh> 
and you could get  you could have your choice , you know ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Oh . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I mean I think uh  
and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely  
So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part . 
Yeah . 
So where are the fruit and vegetables now ? 
Fruits and veg . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
We could promote the banana one . 
<laugh> Like  mm . 
Mm . 
Oh yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , I think , um 
it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit . 
The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits . 
But uh it  
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> The dynamo would be interesting <laugh> . 
Oh . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Cool .
