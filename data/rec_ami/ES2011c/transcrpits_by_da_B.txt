Hmm . 
Yes . 
Sure . 
So I've been looking at the components design . 
Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet 
and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . 
Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . 
Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , 
probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . 
And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , 
because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . 
But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . 
Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . 
The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . 
Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . 
And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . 
So we have some material options . 
Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . 
Um , I'd recommend against titanium 
because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . 
Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case . 
And , 
hmm ? 
<laugh> Uh , well we can use wood . 
<laugh> I don't know why we'd want to . 
Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . 
We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . 
I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . 
So that's what I've got on design . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , 
like you know that band or whatever . 
With T_V_ channels it's , you know , one two three . So  
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the T_V_ . 
<laugh> 
They have to r wheel really fast . 
But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels , 
at least on theirs . 
It's more expensive according to the design people . 
You have to get a  an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , 
which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
W when we had the wheely remote control , we  it was on the top I think , if you held it like that . 
Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do . 
So we just used the top part . 
Yeah . 
Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of  
Yeah . 
Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ? 
I don't know . 
I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_ , not inside the remote . 
I'm not sure . 
<laugh> 
Well they usually are . 
Well  
I guess that's right . It always comes with the T_V_ . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
it  
most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 
'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . 
'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Or on the T_V_ too . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Oh , I was gonna say . 
You said uh people want spongy . 
<laugh> Um , one of your  
one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's  in like those stress ball things . 
So , that would be spongy . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah I think it could work . 
<laugh> Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana . 
<laugh> 
You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh . Mm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I was thinking sort of a single ball shape . 
So you're holding a squishy ball 
and then it has a  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah I guess so . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah you could squish it . 
I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case . 
Especially if you're switching out the squishy part . 
Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off . 
Well I dunno . 
You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . 
Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
That was me . 
Yes . 
Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo , 
which is something I don't know what it is . 
Something to do with torches . 
Oh okay . 
Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself . 
So I sort of picked battery . 
We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . 
Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways . 
It <laugh> it seems a little weird for a living room anyways . 
Didn't have enough data to actually  
All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . 
It didn't give me any actual cost . 
Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . 
So I don't think it's that much of a problem . 
Like the chip is probably the most expensive part . 
Um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip , 
calculators too I think . 
Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap . 
But it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip . 
Yeah . 
Case is what we were discussing yeah .
