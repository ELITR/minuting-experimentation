A:  Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch . Um <other> . Alright we're moving on to conceptual design . 
C:  <other> <Hiccough> 'Scuse me . <laugh> <cough> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Bless you . 
A:  Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . Um , <other> under marketing we targeted our audience , and  Um , yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  That was <laugh> generally <laugh>  how helpful that was . Um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an iPod-like button system which , uh , we haven't concluded but we're  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Right , um  
topic_description:	opening_None


A:  So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what  where you've come from our last time . Does everyone have presentations ? 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yes . 
A:  Okay . Would anybody like to go first ? 
B:  Yes . Sure . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  So that's what I've got on design . 
A:  'S good . 
topic_description:	industrial designer presentation_None


B:  So I've been looking at the components design . Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case . 
A:  And why not wood ? And why not wood ? <laugh>  <laugh> 
B:  And , hmm ? <laugh> Uh , well we can use wood . <laugh> I don't know why we'd want to . Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive .

D:  Um , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material 
A:  Hmm . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  which is quite shocking . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Ha . Mm . 
A:  Mm . 
D:  Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables , but that's just a personal opinion . I think I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room . <other> Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ? 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Um , and finally again with the spongy . It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find  come up with a solution that's better than mine . Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter . Thank you for your attention . 
C:  Mm-hmm . So . 
topic_description:	marketing expert presentation_None


D:  Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . Um . Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . And th last thing is the easy to use um factor . Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use . Um , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the <laugh> is the current trend and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . Um . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  For fashion , we go for fashion . The fashion in electronics . So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . As to the material should be limited to  I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . 
topic_description:	trendwatching_None


A:  I think it's the next  it's the blue one , yeah . 
C:  Oh , uh , there we go . <other> Uh . Okay . Um . Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh . <laugh> I actually wasn't aware of the <laugh> new trends in electronics and and uh  <laugh> <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Neither was I . Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um <other> fabrics . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  So so okay , let me get this right . Okay , uh  Okay , alright anyway . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you  like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand , and I never get it . Never ever . So  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , you don't know they mean , yeah , it's like  yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . So , but  oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ? On the telly , okay , yeah . So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those  like okay now I hit this  you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date . 
D:  Well on the telly . 
B:  Or on the T_V_ too . <laugh> 
A:  Mm . And it is technologically innovative in a way , so that fits with the  
D:  Mm . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . I guess . And it is trendy , the iPods are <other> really hot right now , so  
A:  B Yeah . 
D:  Did you did you get that pc picture on  did they provide you with that picture on the web ? 
C:  Um , yeah , by web research , yeah , so  
D:  That's quite interesting . 
topic_description:	interface specialist presentation_None


C:  Um <other> here we go . Conceptual User Interface . Trying  we're gonna try to talk about , um <other> what kind of uh  how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design . And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . <other> Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . Um , kind of  I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ? 
A:  <laugh> Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time . 
C:  'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this  it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um <other> the wheel 
A:  You need a screen for it ? 
C:  you  it seems like you would need a screen . 
B:  You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . With T_V_ channels it's , you know , one two three . So  
C:  But like if you think about it  yeah but if  so is it just  okay . So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ? Are we  
A:  We're , um , we're actually not having D_V_D_ , that was one of th I I was  sorry , I I meant to update you on that . Um . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Okay . <laugh> Alright . Okay . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  But the screen can come up on the telly , the  she said . That correct ? 
C:  Okay . Okay . So anyway if  well we just  we need to  Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen  I think  I was thinking  okay . So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? And you're just gonna  I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a  right . Yeah like you're g yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can  okay we're not choosing that , I guess . But like choose channel control , like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine . So that    people seems to be  well  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Graphical interface ? Uh on the  you can have it on the telly though . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . You've  Yeah , I know what you're saying , you have to  
C:  You know . But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . So um <other> I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because  So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if  or or  then again if you just  I guess  I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on . You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or  
D:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  But but imagine someone with s 
B:  My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the T_V_ . 
C:  I oh yeah ? 
A:  But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  'Cause you'll have to like  but you can quickly s you can  <other> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  They have to r wheel really fast . But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels , at least on theirs . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
C:  Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be  you  I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um  So you're either  you're  you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . Like if you just wanted to go to like  from five to six you could tap or someth 
A:  Right . 
C:  And then there's also the concern about you know um <other> how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um <other> you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that , like  
A:  Yeah I mean with that many options , you'd  <other> uh  I'd think that the screen would be better , because you could have that menu option , sort of  
C:  I would think so too , like  So I mean  and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because  but then again it would  it does make kind of  if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of  m yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  It's more expensive according to the design people . You have to get a  an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal . 
A:  Uh . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , that's the only thing though . Yeah . So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , um  
A:  Mm . 
C:  <other> You can get to  you know , you can  Like maybe it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can  it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the  yeah , yeah . 
D:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Mm . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . So the T_V_ is the screen , that  yeah So it would have all these different options of changing 
C:  Yeah . But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up . 
A:  to  
D:  Look it even has settings . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  Hmm ? Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess , but um  'cause that just  it does seem like , it  that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but  I dunno , and then  so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything . 
D:  On the  <laugh> you can just take theirs and just  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  So  
A:  Um , right . What if  I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes , um , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing , or whatever we're thinking . I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? Or  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_ . 
A:  Yeah . So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . I mean  okay . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah definitely . Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing . I mean it it needs to be easy to  somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your  
D:  Yeah but should be comfortable . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  I mean how do how do  I'm not really  Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it . So  
A:  Yeah , I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah . 
C:  <other> Yeah . Or your thumb or something . So  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah I use it like that . 
B:  W when we had the wheely remote control , we  it was on the top I think , if you held it like that . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , so  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  But , were there buttons on there as well ? 
B:  Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do . So we just used the top part . 
A:  Mm . Yeah . 
C:  Mm yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , so  but I mean I think it could be pretty small . Like , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that 
D:  Uh . 
C:  you can  
A:  What if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? Like you  so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it . 
C:  But can't you just get  
A:  Do  do you know what I'm talking about though ? Like , uh , yeah just something  
B:  Yeah . Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of  
C:  K 
D:  Well you can have it on the settings , no ? 
A:  Yeah , that you can flip over , yeah , yeah . 
C:  Yeah , But , I mean , do you need that ? If if you can get to , you know  if  so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen . That keeps it 
A:  Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing is is  if w I  if we can do this , that'd probably be  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  really  Yeah . Uh you wouldn't  I don't  I just don't think you would even need it . So  
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this  how they actually programme these things , and if that's  yeah . 
C:  Mean  
B:  Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ? 
C:  I mean you can do it , you  it's  it doesn't seem that hard . 
B:  I don't know . I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_ , not inside the remote . 
A:  I mean it  would y would  that would be  
D:  They already do it . 
C:  I mean I've never bought a remote . It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television , which is a little  
B:  I'm not sure . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Well they usually are . Well  
C:  My  I've never bought just a remote , like , so I don't I don't really know . But um  
D:  No . 
A:  Huh . 
B:  I guess that's right . It always comes with the T_V_ . <laugh> 
C:  So , um  but I mean it's  I've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , it  most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . Well so  So , do we need  I dunno . Well I guess we have to you know think about  But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up . That's what it does anyway . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . Okay .

D:  What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading ? <laugh> 
A:  Oh god . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Oh , I was gonna say . You said uh people want spongy . <laugh> Um , one of your  one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's  in like those stress ball things . So , that would be spongy . 
C:  Oh . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Oh , okay , that would be cool . Mm . <other> 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Ah . Yeah . 
D:  Just nice feel , but I hate spongy . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , c that's e that would be kind of  oh , you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing . But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda  so you're like  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . I mean definitely the area round it . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> <weird noises> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah I think it could work . 
C:  Or what if we integrated the <laugh> the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana . 
D:  Well it could be like mobiles that just  you just put a cover . 
C:  a vegetable . <laugh> 
A:  An orange . <laugh> <other> <laugh> 
C:  <other> Yeah . 
D:  If it's a small thing , you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana , which frankly I'm not particularly fond of , um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing . You know you had  there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah .

C:  Yeah .

B:  You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits . 
D:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> 
D:  And it could  the colour can fit your sitting room , so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have  well I don't know . Um . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  So what if  what  this is  I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is . And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there . Is that kind of  I  'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours . Um  
C:  So I think  yeah , colours . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables . I do I dunno . Um  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just  the feedback we've just got about the  
D:  Maybe a ball . 
A:  A ball ? 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Know , a squashy ball . <laugh> A relaxing squashy ball . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> <laugh> That you can p well I  see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit and I'm thinking how do you change the hard  would you put a um 
C:  That's in the shape of a fruit , like a  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  sticker sort of ? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a  
A:  This is just  Okay . Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . Squashy . 
D:  Oh , okay , yeah . Yeah I was thinking of getting a cover for  <other> 
A:  That  see I was thinking this s sorry  I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing . And like this  you could have like you could have like cherries and <laugh> things around there . Um but  
D:  Which is cheaper . Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually . 
B:  Oh . Mm . 
C:  Yeah . Oh I like that shape . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> I was thinking sort of a single ball shape . So you're holding a squishy ball and then it has a  
C:  <other> Yeah <other> . 
A:  I was thinking if it was like this  'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy  
C:  It's like it has to be s yeah <other> . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  It's almost like your thumb is farther up , so if if you could squish it lower then  
B:  Yeah I guess so . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . So it wouldn't be very big in either  like how big ? This big , and then you just do that , I suppose . 
C:  What if , yeah , what if the squishy , oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can  so so maybe one you know  you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing <laugh> and you could get  you could have your choice , you know ? 
A:  Yeah , I know what you meant , yeah . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Well just a li I can't des like condom thingy , like a a cover . But  well the question is , which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that , and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that , and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is , and  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Okay . 
C:  Yeah . Oh . 
D:  No . Um . That's nicer . I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  Um . 
A:  Well that's not very neat , but <laugh>  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . I mean I think uh  and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely  So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part . 
D:  If it's a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your  to the way you hold it . If it's got sand in it maybe , or something , you  it it just moulds to your hand . 
B:  Yeah you could squish it . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . So where are the fruit and vegetables now ? 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  We we don't know . <laugh> 
C:  Fruits and veg . 
B:  I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  And the rest is the company  the company colour's silver ? 
A:  It was , yeah , silver and yellow . It l it looks like  <laugh> I don't  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  We could promote the banana one . <laugh> Like  mm . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> I mean that's another question , where are we gonna  we we should have the logo somewhere on it . 
C:  Mm . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Should also fit the batteries , which we haven't  
C:  Oh yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case . 
A:  Yeah , th and that would  that  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  Especially if you're switching out the squishy part . Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah , I think , um it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit . The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits . But uh it  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Well I dunno . You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  No but it does it automatically . <laugh> Does it automatically ? I don't know . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah .

A:  I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me . <laugh> But if someone  components concept . Question mark . Energy . Question mark . Was that you ? Okay . Oh right right . Yeah . Um , so what d but what do we know about 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Okay . 
B:  That was me . Yes . 
A:  energy ? I mean we're gonna use batteries right ? And  
B:  Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo , which is something I don't know what it is . Something to do with torches . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh , a dynamo is  ah , <clicks fingers> it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy . 
B:  Oh okay . Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself . So I sort of picked battery . We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  It's quite sweet . 
A:  I think batteries sound good . What does everyone else think ? <laugh> 
B:  It <laugh> it seems a little weird for a living room anyways . 
C:  <laugh> The dynamo would be interesting <laugh> . 
D:  No . But dynamo  the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it <other> creates energy on its own . 
C:  Oh . 
A:  What about Kryptonite ? <laugh> 
D:  Which is quite cool . So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . But we need to find cost . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Don't know the cost . 
B:  Didn't have enough data to actually  
D:  Does anyone have costs on the on the web ? 
B:  All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . It didn't give me any actual cost . 
D:  Okay . Right . 
C:  Hmm . 
D:  Mm . 
B:  Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . So I don't think it's that much of a problem . Like the chip is probably the most expensive part . 
A:  What does chip on print mean ? 
B:  Um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip , calculators too I think . Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap . But it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh-huh . Okay . Right . So , chip on print is just  means like that they're mass-produced . Okay . And case ? Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about , yeah . Casing . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Case is what we were discussing yeah . 
A:   thinking of like syntactic case and thi um <laugh>

A:  Oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation . So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach . 
D:  Oh , thank you . <laugh> 
A:  Mm . 
C:  Cool . 
A:  See you soon . Does it matter that I end early ? 
D:  I  it's strange because  
A:  How how early is it ? I didn't get a pop-up thing that said
