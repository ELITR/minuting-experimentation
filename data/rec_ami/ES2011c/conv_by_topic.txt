A:  Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch . Um <other> . Alright we're moving on to conceptual design . 
C:  <other> <Hiccough> 'Scuse me . <laugh> <cough> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Bless you . 
A:  Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . Um , <other> under marketing we targeted our audience , and  Um , yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  That was <laugh> generally <laugh>  how helpful that was . Um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an iPod-like button system which , uh , we haven't concluded but we're  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Right , um  


A:  So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what  where you've come from our last time . Does everyone have presentations ? 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yes . 
A:  Okay . Would anybody like to go first ? 
B:  Yes . Sure . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  So that's what I've got on design . 
A:  'S good . 


D:  Um , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material 
A:  Hmm . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  which is quite shocking . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Ha . Mm . 
A:  Mm . 
D:  Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables , but that's just a personal opinion . I think I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room . <other> Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ? 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Um , and finally again with the spongy . It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find  come up with a solution that's better than mine . Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter . Thank you for your attention . 
C:  Mm-hmm . So . 


A:  I think it's the next  it's the blue one , yeah . 
C:  Oh , uh , there we go . <other> Uh . Okay . Um . Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh . <laugh> I actually wasn't aware of the <laugh> new trends in electronics and and uh  <laugh> <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Neither was I . Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um <other> fabrics . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  So so okay , let me get this right . Okay , uh  Okay , alright anyway . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you  like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand , and I never get it . Never ever . So  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , you don't know they mean , yeah , it's like  yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . So , but  oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ? On the telly , okay , yeah . So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those  like okay now I hit this  you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date . 
D:  Well on the telly . 
B:  Or on the T_V_ too . <laugh> 
A:  Mm . And it is technologically innovative in a way , so that fits with the  
D:  Mm . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . I guess . And it is trendy , the iPods are <other> really hot right now , so  
A:  B Yeah . 
D:  Did you did you get that pc picture on  did they provide you with that picture on the web ? 
C:  Um , yeah , by web research , yeah , so  
D:  That's quite interesting . 


A:  let's see . 
B:  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  Is there anything else we need to 
C:  Hmm . 
A:  talk about ? 


A:  Oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation . So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach . 
D:  Oh , thank you . <laugh> 
A:  Mm . 
C:  Cool . 
A:  See you soon . Does it matter that I end early ? 
D:  I  it's strange because  
A:  How how early is it ? I didn't get a pop-up thing that said
