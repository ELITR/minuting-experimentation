Bless you . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Um , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material 
which is quite shocking . 
Ha . Mm . 
Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , 
and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . 
Um . Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . 
And th last thing is the easy to use um factor . 
Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , 
but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use . 
Um , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the <laugh> is the current trend 
and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . Um . 
For fashion , we go for fashion . 
The fashion in electronics . 
So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . 
And also go for a spongy feel , 
so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . 
As to the material should be limited to  
I don't know how spongy it can be , 
should discuss this together , 
I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . 
Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables , 
but that's just a personal opinion . 
I think 
I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room . 
<other> Uh those are just suggestions 
and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , 
so that still has to do with the material discuss 
should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ? 
Um , and finally again with the spongy . 
It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that 
or find  come up with a solution that's better than mine . 
Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , 
and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter . 
Thank you for your attention . 
<laugh> 
Neither was I . 
Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um <other> fabrics . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
But the screen can come up on the telly , the  she said . 
That correct ? 
Graphical interface ? 
Uh on the  
you can have it on the telly though . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Look it even has settings . 
On the  
<laugh> you can just take theirs and just  <laugh> 
Yeah but should be comfortable . 
Yeah 
I use it like that . 
Yeah . 
Uh . 
Well you can have it on the settings , 
no ? 
They already do it . 
<laugh> 
No . 
But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , 
because the problem with buttons is you  like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand , 
and I never get it . 
Never ever . 
So  
Well on the telly . 
Mm . 
Did you did you get that pc picture on  
did they provide you with that picture on the web ? 
That's quite interesting . 
What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading ? <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Just nice feel , but I hate spongy . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well it could be like mobiles that just  you just put a cover . 
If it's a small thing , you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana , 
which frankly I'm not particularly fond of , 
um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing . 
You know you had  there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
And it could  the colour can fit your sitting room , 
so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have  
well I don't know . Um . 
Yeah . 
Maybe a ball . 
Know , a squashy ball . 
<laugh> A relaxing squashy ball . 
<other> <laugh> That you can p 
well I  
see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 
'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit 
and I'm thinking how do you change the hard  
would you put a um 
sticker sort of ? 
Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , 
like a  
Oh , okay , yeah . 
Yeah 
I was thinking of getting a cover for  <other> 
Which is cheaper . 
Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually . 
Yeah . 
So it wouldn't be very big in either  
like how big ? 
This big , and then you just do that , I suppose . 
<laugh> 
Well just a li I can't des like condom thingy , like a a cover . 
But  well the question is , which one's easiest to change 
and we can just contact our relevant department for that , 
and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that , 
and for now we can do two prototypes maybe 
and then hi try and ask users what the best is , 
and  
No . 
Um . 
That's nicer . 
I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater . 
Um . 
<laugh> 
If it's a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your  to the way you hold it . 
If it's got sand in it maybe , or something , you  it it just moulds to your hand . 
We we don't know . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
And the rest is the company  
the company colour's silver ? 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Should also fit the batteries , 
which we haven't  
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
No but it does it automatically . 
<laugh> Does it automatically ? 
I don't know . 
Okay . 
Oh , a dynamo is  ah , <clicks fingers> it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . 
It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy . 
It's quite sweet . 
No . But dynamo  the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it <other> creates energy on its own . 
Which is quite cool . 
So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . 
But we need to find cost . 
Don't know the cost . 
Does anyone have costs on the on the web ? 
Okay . Right . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Oh , thank you . <laugh> 
I  it's strange because
