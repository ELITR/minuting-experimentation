Um we are  
So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . 
So  switching over I've just left uh my first two screens  . 
Um <cough> 
mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time . 
<cough> Um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that 
are particularly bothering you ? 
N 
No ? Okay , cool . 
Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj . 
 
<other> 
<laugh> 
 
<laugh> 
Alright , okay . 
Fashion . 
<other> Mm 'kay . 
Fruit and veg , well there you go . 
Just what I think of when I think of a remote control . <other> <laugh> 
Mm-mm-mm-mm . 
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . 
Function F_ eight . 
Hmm . 
 
<other> Excuse me . 
Uh , yeah  . 
Mm 'kay . 
<laugh>  either . <laugh> 
Uh okay . 
Right , okay . Yeah . 
<other> 
Excellent . 
Uh no just escape 
should uh  
<laugh> 
'Kay . 
Looks pretty complicated . 
Right , okay . 
Mm-hmm , like the middle button . 
Okay . 
Ah it's kinda like scrolling  
uh right , well , 
if I s if I'm thinking of the right one , I've got the same thing in front of my monitor , 
you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um <other> menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . 
Right , okay . 
Yeah , presumably . 
Yeah , looks like uh looks like something out of a jet . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um <other> , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . 
So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
I mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ? <laugh> 
Strange . <laugh> 
No they do , they do . 
They listen to it . Yeah . 
Right , okay . 
'Kay 
but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ? 
Brilliant . 
That's handy . <laugh> <cough> 
Okay . 
Okay . 
It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
I can't see tha 
Although , th I mean to be to be sure they have got  I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now , 
so that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything 
so maybe the small  
But I mean like I I  the black and white , I guess , it just doesn't look funky enough . 
Um but , I mean , like even mobile phones or whatever have  now have colour L_C_D_ screens , 
w I ju I mean 
I wouldn't know about the costs of them . 
Twelve fifty . 
<other> Possibly . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Right . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Well I mean we could make a  
Yeah . <cough> 
Well , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s <laugh> 
And if it doesn't work you know , we've just made a lemon . <other> <cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
I like I like the colourful buttons as well . 
Yeah . 
I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five , 
so most people 
will have come in contact with that kind of use . 
Yeah . 
And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker , so  
'Kay . 
<other>  
<other> 
<other> 
Yeah , looks like it . 
<other> Uh <other> 
Yeah , I was just thinking the self same thing . <laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> Magic man . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? 
Right . 
Okay . 
So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? 
They gotta be  
<laugh> Almost a key-ring .  
<other> Okay . 
'Kay . 
Well . 
Well , I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , 
doesn't it . 
Um  
Yeah . 
And that would k also give it kinda durability 
and 
and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . 
Um <other> 
so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic  initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? 
Oh right , okay . 
I don't know what that stuff is . <other> 
Yeah . 
Or at least incorporating , yeah . <laugh> 
I mean I forgot i we're sort of uh  
I don't know what other standard silver kind of  
Other parts or uh  
Mm-hmm . 
Um . 
Um I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . 
Yeah 
or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . 
I mean if we are gonna make it a novel  
I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , 
a bit comfier , you know . 
Yeah it's uh , yeah , that that'd be  that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it . 
<laugh> 
Well , yeah , 
I mean like  
Yeah , yeah . 
Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . Yeah . <laugh> 
They only cost pennies . 
<laugh> 
Huh ? 
<laugh> Um . 
<other> I mean that that th <laugh> 
does 
it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . <other> 
<other> S 
And sponginess . 
Huh . 
Uh . 
 
<other> 
Yeah , why the hell not . 
<other> Let's <laugh> 
that'll make us fifty million Euros . 
Um . Well , 
I guess it's kind of dra uh 
you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , 
yeah ? 
Yeah , we can relate it by advertising or  
<other> Yeah . 
There's a good man . There's a good idea . 
<laugh> 
Um I l I su 
I mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , uh play , stop . 
They've got , I mean , they've got standard sort of intuitive um 
things that are always used . 
<laugh> That's cool . 
<laugh> I like it . 
Um . <cough> 
Uh speech recognition , I think , 
so we need a microphone presumably . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
I mean ho h h wel 
are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? 
<laugh> 
Glad , we're not doing this for real . 
Yeah . 
And uh I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is  the microphone  
I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's  
Yeah . 
So it can be sort of held and w  <other> 
 We really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition . 
Oops . <laugh> 
Um . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Upsidaisy . <cough> 
<other> 
<other> I s I still like it . 
Um but that's me . <laugh> 
Yes , or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far . 
I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes . 
Um don't wanna sort of overkill . 
'Cause I mean like uh if we  
I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? 
Do we want to go for buttons at all , 
do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? <laugh> 
Yeah , 
you know , and then you just tal 
I mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly . 
<laugh> Um . <other> 
Yeah . 
Make them make them think of fruit , yeah . 
I mean uh <other> some uh I 
l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple . 
Then it's just apple so sort of  
Uh , yellow apples though  Hmm . <laugh> 
Yeah . Okay , yeah , that's good . 
Groovy . 
<other> 
Yeah ,  . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
So <other> I mean like you could actually  
Yeah , gives you the options . 
So a selection of casings . 
It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um  
 
Like like mobiles , yeah . 
 
You can standardise those , 
I mean . 
I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , 
'cause when  
if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . It doesn't really  
You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , 
unless you have sort of  you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . 
And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the  
Maybe . <laugh> 
<laugh> So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay , 
so we stick with what we've got there . 
Mm 'kay . 
Mm-hmm . <laugh> 
Well , it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow . <laugh> 
So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different 
colour , but have  
kinda going round , yeah . 
Um I mean e even if  
I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , 
so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . 
So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . 
W sort of  
Uh It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda <other> powers it . 
Uh yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah , I like that , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
You shake it and scream at it . 
Yeah . 
It does leave them with an obligation to  
Especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated . 
Then if it's just sitting on the  
Okay , okay . 
Right um what are the other options ? 
Yeah . 
I'm I'm with uh Raj on that , 
I think , you know , 
I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window . 
Oh that's true . 
I mean I w I w uh 
that idea that I thought <other> 
um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother 
is having a , 
yeah , 
having a rechargeable stand , 
so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as  uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . 
Yeah that kind of thing . 
Yeah . 
Rechargeable . 
 . What's chip on print ? 
What's  
Sorry , never mind . <cough> 
Yeah , 
and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping . 
That's good . 
Uh woah . 
Okay , we're we're kind of uh we're kind of um <cough> 
Excuse m 
I've just deleted that whole thing . 
Um we're kind of running out of time , 
so if you could  
Uh . 
<other> Was that you ? 
Um that was  your bit's covered , 
I just dele I just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to say next . 
Um , yeah . 
Oh , yeah . 
And I just touch the pad . 
<laugh> It's actually shut down . 
Okay , um now what we have  
uh our next meeting's in half an hour 
and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . 
<laugh> Yeah . It's you guys . Yeah . 
So um , you know I mean , luckily we chose a nice simple shape . 
<laugh> Um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches . 
Uh yeah , 
I hope I can recover this , 'cause I've accidentally deleted it . 
<laugh> Which doesn't really help me much . 
Yeah , can you save that  uh send that last one again , please , Raj , 
as I still can't find it on the  
<other> 
Okay . 
No . 
Okay , thank you . 
Um yeah , Project , Project Documents . 
Uh right , 
that's that's the that  
it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents . 
Project Documents is on the um <other> desktop . 
Really ?  
Oh right , 
I think um  
Hold on . 
<cough> Yeah , I don't know if y 
it it just ca it just came up on my um 
on my agenda . 
S <laugh> Um 
presumably there's clay somewhere . 
Um . 
<other> 
Four . 
Whoops . 
Light , light , please . Light . 
<laugh> Right , there you go . 
Yeah , quite . 
And we're using this our basic chip set , 
so it's all good . <laugh> 
Um I think we're almost done , yeah . 
Oh oops . 
Sorry man . 
Uh okay , still didn't manage to get down all the last bits 
so we had rechargeable and  Uh . Apples . 
<cough> Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . 
'Kay , so we came up with that , that's okay . 
What's supplements ? 
Supplements . 
Uh <other> uh . <other> 
See . <laugh> 
I shoulda  something like that . 
If I kn see I I knew that . 
I shoulda sort of engineered it so we k ended up making a diffi difficult shape . 
<laugh> Just for cruelty . <cough> 
<laugh> I wonder if they mean like literally make it , sort of buttons and everything . 
Um . 
Uh no , I think that's us our discussion over 
unless anybody's got questions <other> or confusions , 
'cause I'm confused . 
Huh ? 
Um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute , 
it's a  
<other> 
There we go . Warning , finish meeting now . 
I rounded it up far too fast . 
<laugh> Um <other> .
