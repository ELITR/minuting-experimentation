No . 
<laugh> 
We should make a big sponge lemon , 
and then it'd be it would be yellow . 
It's  
Yeah . 
Mm . <laugh> 
 
 
No , it's got it's got it . 
 
<laugh> 
Wow . 
<laugh> 
Uh it looks threatening . 
<other> It looks like 
yeah  . 
<laugh> 
Wow . 
<laugh> 
Then d blind don't watch T_V_ . <laugh> 
They do ? <laugh> 
<other> 
The L_C_D_ 
and the other stuff 
uh , I think . 
Ben bana 
 
<other> 
<other> 
Hmm . 
But uh price price not withstanding um , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ? 
But but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , 
right ? 
You're looking at the T_V_ 
and and it's uh  
It just seems kind of like a a needless th 
So which vegetable ? <laugh> 
Okay . <laugh> 
The the lemon . 
Well what are the options ? 
Oh . 
Okay . 
Um so 
I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , 
and I'll I'll give you the uh , <other> I guess , technical considerations for those . 
And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , 
just 'cause we haven't used it <other> . 
Right . So , 
the way I'm gonna do this <other> is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , 
uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it , 
and then we'll throw in our new innovations um <other> 
and keep it all within budget . 
So uh yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control . 
Um this is what they sent me . 
'Kay . Here's uh the competition , I suppose . 
Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , 
um <other> 
and there's a a chip , a processor , 
the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , 
and ch 
Right , 
it's very  
they're very cheap remote . 
This remote costs nothing , you know . 
Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , 
which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , 
and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light , 
which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , 
and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television . 
Oh here it is . 
<other> Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , 
because it it defines the uh  
R Um no , I mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make . 
Right . 
So this is what we need to have for certain . 
Um . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , 
which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , 
um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up , 
processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , 
amplifier and transmitter are all standard . 
Um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team 
uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , 
um latex , double-curved , curved . 
So lots of choices , 
what do we think ? 
Uh or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right . 
Organic sponge . <laugh> 
Uh yeah , it's very elasticy for sure . 
Um . 
Yeah 
so  
Okay so , here are a a plastic , 
uh latex  
Oh right . 
So something with give to it . 
<other> Okay . 
And 
and the colour is yellow , right ? 
Yellow <laugh> , okay . Um . 
Mm' kay . 
So yellow for the body , 
and then what colour for the buttons ? 
So multi-coloured buttons . 
 
<laugh> Okay . 
Okay . 
Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go  Um how exactly ? 
Maybe double  
What about a banana ? 
Yeah ? 
Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , 
'cause it's yellow fruit , 
right ? 
 
Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess . 
We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end . 
<laugh> 
So a spongy banana re <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay , okay . 
See  
So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable 
like so it would have a stem perhaps 
and a 
maybe a  it'd be s axially symmetric . 
So it'd look like this kinda . 
Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? 
Yeah , 
and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? 
Okay . 
Okay um , I guess , since you're the marketing guy . 
We'll uh  
Okay , we could do that . Um . 
 
Okay , so 
so buttons . 
Okay , just like that . 
Okay . 
With the scroll-wheel or no ? 
Okay 
uh I could put the microphone here . <laugh> 
Okay there's the microphone . 
Where should I put the microphone ? 
Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or  
'Kay there's the mic . 
<other> 
Um n well we can  
Whoops . <laugh> 
Um . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Um . 
Oops , sorry . 
Okay . 
<cough> 
Right . 
Hmm . 
 
 <other> They can work from a  
You don't have to hold it . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<other> I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , 
you know they have uh fruits all round them . 
<laugh> Now just make sure they don't eat the remote . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
 
Okay . But yeah  
But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . 
It can sit at a distance and pick it up still . 
Yeah yeah . 
<other>  
Okay , um so  
Yeah , 
s I guess we decided on material , 
right ? 
So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , 
and the colours we got down , 
and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or  
<laugh> Yeah . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Great . 
<other> Um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , 
but we don't have to be limited by that . 
We can use a hand-dynamo . 
Um I don't know what that means , 
we crank it ? <laugh> 
Right , it's like those watches that you c 
So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power . 
Okay . So if it if it's not working , I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . <laugh> 
Right . 
Okay . 
Uh there's solar power . Um . 
Yeah . 
Okay , so probably just  
Mm . 
'Kay . 
Okay . 
So uh a rechargeable battery  . 
Okay . 
Um the user interface , the buttons , I guess we talked about this already . 
Um . 
Hmm ? 
Uh th the uh 
the electronics um , basically the more features we add um  
Oops , this one . 
So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , 
which adds to the cost as you can expect . 
Um . 
But uh I think we can keep it all under budget . 
So uh yes , 
so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through . 
So just in time . <laugh> 
Right , right . 
Yeah , 
and keeping the L_C_D_ screen out . <other> 
Huh ? 
Oh yeah that was that was it . 
 
So control F_ eight , right ? 
Try uh flipping the screen down  . 
'Kay . 
Oh , 
I get to do it , too . 
Oh neat . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Okay . Save everything to the shared documents , is that right ? 
Oh  . 
Uh these lapel mics are trouble . 
Are we done with our meeting ? 
Yeah .
