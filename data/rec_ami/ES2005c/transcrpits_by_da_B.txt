Yeah . 
<cough> Hi , me Raj , again . 
Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching , 
uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . 
So we have to look on this . 
First of all methodology . 
The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way  <cough> 
We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , 
because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . 
So what are our findings ? 
In our <other> 
uh in our findings we have seen that  
when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , 
rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . 
So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . 
So we should take into uh 
we should consider this factor as the most important factor , 
because this factor is twice as important , 
the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor . 
So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take  in designing our rem uh remote controls . 
No the first one is the 
uh the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , 
the fancy design 
uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . 
The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . 
We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are . 
So it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . 
So that indicates our technological advancement . 
And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , 
like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , 
there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control , 
it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way . 
And it should be uh  
and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . 
So that they could know how to use these remote controls . 
When we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh  our recent fashion update shows that  
Ah yeah ? <laugh> 
Y yeah uh yeah , 
we have to , 
because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes ,  and everything with fruits and vegetables , 
because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic , 
becoming more and more organic , 
becoming  <other> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
So  <other> 
Yeah . 
So something like that we we should do . 
And people uh 
the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . 
<other> Yeah . Yeah . 
So so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it . 
So that should also be taken into consideration . 
So these are my views . 
So  
No it ca <other> y a   
The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co 
Yeah . 
'Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also , 
because our company is very well  for taking all these concerns into consideration , 
so we don't want to have any harm to the society , 
so  
So that's all . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
 
S uh we didn't find out any such point . 
Uh yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so  
Yeah .  
Oh no , <other>  . 
Yeah , uh yeah , uh yeah . 
 Yeah . <other> 
Hmm . 
<other> Yeah . 
Hmm . 
But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , 
but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . 
Uh yeah . 
Yeah . 
So even if we increase our cost little bit , within uh some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market . 
And the  
Uh i it will be easy because there will be , on L_C_D_ s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa 
Ah 
yeah . Mm-hmm . 
<other> Yeah , I appreciate this idea , 
because then this  <laugh> this will help us in our advertisement also 
and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . 
That what our data shows that , 
so this w this w 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , 
like people uh now  
Spongy . 
Yeah , then only we can relate it with something . 
Yeah . Exactly . 
<other> Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . 
Yeah , sure . I will be happy to do that . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Or we can  
we can do one thing , 
we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , 
different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . 
So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , 
it will look l 
<other> Uh yeah . 
In that w 
S s sorry ? 
Uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , 
okay ? 
If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . 
If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put  we will put apple shape casing on that . 
It will give apple shape look . 
So in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , 
without  uh yeah . 
Yeah , 
button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . 
Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , 
so half of that will be look the  
Yeah , not not the upper side . 
So from lower you can , 
it means while you are holding of  from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . 
So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . 
And  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah ,  . 
 
But  <other> 
But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? 
Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat 
Yeah , to 
mo Yeah . 
Yeah , 
because most of the people  
Yeah . <other> 
Uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea , 
because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , 
and the days when there is no sola sunlight  <other> 
Yeah . Yeah . 
What we w 
yeah . 
I think we should  a rechargeable <other> battery will be a good idea . 
They can they can recharge it . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that's  Yeah , exactly . 
Yeah .
