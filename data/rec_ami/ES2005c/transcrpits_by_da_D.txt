Mm-hmm . 
Okay . Cool . 
Mm um . No , I don't think so . 
The last one is the most important one , is it ? 
Oh , sorry . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> Sorry . 
I was just reading fruit and vegetables . 
Hard to know how we are going to incorporate that . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Th that's very good . 
Glow-in-the-dark . 
Okay . 
Well , that's good . 
That's what we kind of predicted anyway . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay , the spongy , not real spongy , 
you can <other>  
Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? 
Okay . 
Quite disposable . 
Okay . 
Oh okay . 
Uh-huh . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Cool . 
<other> 
Mm . 
A remote control ? Yeah . 
And were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ? 
Or was it just  
Okay . <laugh> 
Cool . 
F_ , what is it ? Um . 
 yeah . 
Okay . 
No signal . 
Is that  ? 
Okay , 
and then F_ five , right ? 
Okay . Um 
okay , so the interface concept um . 
Yeah . The interface specification , 
what people  
um how they interact with it basically , I think . 
Um so the method , we looked at existing designs , 
what are the  
what's good about them , what's bad about them , 
um I looked at their flaws , 
so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . 
Um and what <other> the survey told us and what we think would be good , 
so a bit of imagination . 
<other> Uh the findings , I've got some pictures to show you as well . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<other> Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , 
where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . 
Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing . 
So I think for our remote control  
There is some inconsistency already in  ec existing in  between remote controls , 
but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons 
like the the top right for on and off or something , 
I think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use . 
And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you . 
Do I press Escape F_ five ? Or just  
Escape , okay . 
Um , oh I still haven't got my glasses on . 
Yeah , okay . 
So these are the  some of the pictures of existing ones . 
I'll just walk you through them . 
This one is a voice recognition . 
And that's the kind of idea we're going for . 
There's um an L_C_D_ thing , 
which we thought could  
I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . 
This one is  got a kind of scroll like a mouse , 
which  
Yeah . 
Um and  But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that , 
like would the computer come  
Uh-huh , that's like the L_C_D_ one , 
is it ? 
But the one below that has got like <other> a little scroll function on the side . 
But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen . 
I think that's what that is . 
So these are just a few ideas . 
Again that's just quite boring shape , grey , 
looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one . 
Yeah , it does look kind of dangerous . 
Um this one I thought was really cool . 
It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about . 
You can put it in there , 
it's for your kids , 
and it's quite an organic shape 
and the little circle around there is pretty cool . 
And that's really easy to use , bright , 
so I like this one lot for our design . 
I think something like that would be good . 
Of course yellow . <laugh> 
Right , yeah . 
Yeah , that's true . Yeah . 
Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something . 
And this one , the over-sized one , 
I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky . 
I don't think that will sell very well . 
<other> I guess so . 
I don't know . 
I think that's a bit  
<laugh> Yeah exactly . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
And um this one <other> is just pointing out . 
I like <other> some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , 
but  pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape . 
So that could  
that's a bit confusing . 
Um but the buttons on this I think are  
it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons . 
They don't have to be all the same . 
So that's quite cool . Um . 
Yeah , exactly . 
Um F_ five . 
Yes . 
So there are some of the findings . 
So we need to combine those ones um 
and I've just got <other> an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . 
Um yeah it is , just in time , very handy . 
Um so <other> 
I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . 
It's  
you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , 
so that's  
And it's much  
Yeah . 
So that's quite cool . 
Uh personal preferences just some imagination , 
the raised symbols I thought were good , 
the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , 
do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the <other>  
Yeah . 
And the speech recognition , 
'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , 
are we ? 
Uh-huh . 
Uh-huh . But our budget , we've  
Yeah . 
Uh-huh . 
Okay . 
I'm not sure if the  if <other> for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost ,  . 
The L_C_D_ . 
Yeah . 
No . 
Yeah . S 
Uh-huh . 
Yeah , that's the thing , 
because  
Yeah . 
That's true , yeah . 
And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ . 
It's a it's great , it's a good idea , 
but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think . 
Child-friendly , I thought this was good , 
as you pointed out the um 
<other> the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , 
but it's a good shape 
and the organic is kind of  
we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think . 
Yeah , I know , carrot <laugh> . 
Yeah . 
But we don't want it to be  
Yeah . 
Um the child-friendly , yeah . 
Easy to use , it seems quite easy to use . 
I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . 
I think that's a good idea to go for . 
Yeah . 
And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , 
because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . Um . 
Yeah . 
S yeah . 
So they'd be able to use that um , 
as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen . 
Um so there you go . 
Yeah . 
So that's um the user interface 
design . 
So okay , I'll take this out now then . 
There you go . 
Mm . 
 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . I'm not sure about the sponge . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think , 
you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and  
Yeah . 
And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around . 
Yeah , 
y <other> yellow incorporated , yeah . 
I think  
Mm . 
Yeah , the buttons 
w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours 
or i if we're having buttons actually , 
I don 
Yeah . 
You do have ones like um play <other> could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah . 
<other> Makes it easy to use . 
Yeah , that's true , 
because that blue one did look quite hardish . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Like uh <other> an hour glass kind of figure , 
is that what you're thinking of , 
or just like a  
It's not  
Yeah . 
<laugh> We could make novelty remote controls . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
But then how would you point it ? 
How would you point it ? 
What  
<other> 
Yeah . 
 y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea . 
Rubber banana . 
<laugh> Okay . 
<other> Yeah . 
I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . 
And what else did you say about fashions ? 
What was trendy ? 
And spongy , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Maybe , yeah . 
Like what's what's that <other> , 
I don't even know the name of it , 
some kind of , you know where it's like  looks like a little snowman kind of thing . 
I don't know the name of that . 
Yeah , that's what I was thinking . 
Yeah , maybe that's what they are . 
'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit 
and  
Yeah . 
I don't know . 
What do you guy  What do you think ? 
No . 
Yeah . 
Uh-huh . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
And buttons would , did we say ? Uh different shapes of buttons ? 
Mm . 
 <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? <other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , I'm not sure . 
Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration , I think . 
Um yeah , I can  
no I'm not sure . 
I couldn 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
That's cool . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
So let's not use the whiteboard any more . <laugh> 
And uh so what else was there ? 
Um the  
What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? 
Are we just gonna leave that ? 
You still like it . 
'Cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system . 
'Cause um it could  
Yeah . 
Especially with yellow <other> . 
<other> Mm . I dunno . 
<laugh> Then you put it in the fruit bowl ? 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , do we need buttons ? 
Mm . 
I quite like the shape . I quite like the design of that , 
uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite  got a quite steady base . 
Um 
and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . 
 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , 
'cause you said about disposable , 
didn't you ? 
You said about disposable earli people want disposable things 
so we could do that , like have a choice . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
We still need the buttons in the same places thought , 
don't we ? 
 
Oh , that's the other side . Oh , okay . 
Oh , half a fruit . Oh , okay , okay . 
Okay , okay . 
Okay . 
Mm mm . 
<other> Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well , um because  
Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , 
because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit 
and uh because <other> what  
Yeah , 
w I think wh wha would  
we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . 
They wanted something that looks fancy 
and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a  too much of a gimmick , 
but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , 
because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . 
I mean we could make it nice pale yellow . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . 
Because  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh-huh . 
Oh , a d a dynamo ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah , like with those watches that you kind of twist . 
Yeah that's quite cool . 
Yeah , it is , yeah . 
Yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then  Yeah . 
That's true . 
 
But w <other> like just normal light ? 
<other> 
And we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Like like a hand  
like one of those portable phones kind of thing . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Just in time . 
Yeah , mine seems to have turned off . 
I can't do anything . 
No . 
It's on , but there's nothing on the screen . 
<laugh> 
Cool . <laugh> 
Yeah . Mm . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
I think , I've saved mine already . 
Cool . 
Fun . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . Star fruit . <laugh> 
No . 
Oh yeah , we can do buttons . 
No I'm good . 
Okay . 
Mm .
