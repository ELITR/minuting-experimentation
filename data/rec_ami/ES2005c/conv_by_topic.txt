C:  Um we are  So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . So  switching over I've just left uh my first two screens  . Um <cough> I have 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time . <cough> Um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that 
D:  Okay . Cool . 
C:  are particularly bothering you ? 
D:  Mm um . No , I don't think so . 
C:  N 
A:  No . 
C:  No ? Okay , cool . 


C:  Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj . 
B:  Yeah . <cough> Hi , me Raj , again . Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching , uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . So we have to look on this . First of all methodology . The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way  <cough> We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . 


D:  F_ , what is it ? Um . 
C:  Function F_ eight . 
D:   yeah . 
C:  Hmm . 
D:  Okay . 
A:   
B:  Yeah .  
C:   
D:  No signal . 
B:  Oh no , <other>  . 
D:  Is that  ? 
A:  No , it's got it's got it . 
B:  Yeah , uh yeah , uh yeah .  Yeah . <other> 
C:  <other> Excuse me . 
A:   
D:  Okay , and then F_ five , right ? 
C:  Uh , yeah  . 
D:  Okay . Um okay , so the interface concept um . Yeah . The interface specification , what people  um how they interact with it basically , I think . Um so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the  what's good about them , what's bad about them , um I looked at their flaws , so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . Um and what <other> the survey told us and what we think would be good , so a bit of imagination . <other> Uh the findings , I've got some pictures to show you as well . <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  Mm 'kay . <laugh>  either . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  'Kay . 
D:  design . 
C:  <other>  
D:  So okay , I'll take this out now then . 
A:  Okay . 


A:  Um so 
D:  There you go . 
C:  <other> <other> 
A:  I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , 
C:  Yeah , looks like it . 
A:  and I'll I'll give you the uh , <other> I guess , technical considerations for those . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  <other> Uh <other> 
D:   
A:  And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it <other> . 
C:  Yeah , I was just thinking the self same thing . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Right . 


D:  And uh so what else was there ? Um the  What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? Are we just gonna leave that ? 
C:  <other> 
A:  <cough> 
C:  <other> I s I still like it . Um but that's me . <laugh> 
D:  You still like it . 'Cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system . 
A:  Right . 
C:  Yes , or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far . I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes . Um don't wanna sort of overkill . 
D:  'Cause um it could  Yeah . Especially with yellow <other> . <other> Mm . I dunno . 
A:  Hmm . 
C:  'Cause I mean like uh if we  I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? Do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Then you put it in the fruit bowl ? 
A:    <other> They can work from a  You don't have to hold it . 
C:  Yeah , you know , and then you just tal I mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly . <laugh> Um . <other> 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , you know they have uh fruits all round them . <laugh> Now just make sure they don't eat the remote . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Make them make them think of fruit , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  I mean uh <other> some uh I l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple . 
D:  Yeah , do we need buttons ? Mm . 
C:  Then it's just apple so sort of  Uh , yellow apples though  Hmm . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  I quite like the shape . I quite like the design of that , uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite  got a quite steady base . 
A:   
C:  Yeah . Okay , yeah , that's good . Groovy . 
A:  Okay . But yeah  
D:  Um and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . 
C:  <other> Yeah ,  . <laugh> 
D:   
A:  But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . It can sit at a distance and pick it up still . 
C:  Yeah . So <other> I mean like you could actually  
D:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah , gives you the options . 
B:  Or we can  we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , it will look l <other> Uh yeah . In that w 
D:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
C:  So a selection of casings . 
D:  Yeah , 'cause you said about disposable , didn't you ? 
C:  It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um  
B:  S s sorry ? 
D:  You said about disposable earli people want disposable things so we could do that , like have a choice . 
C:   
B:  Uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , okay ? If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put  we will put apple shape casing on that . It will give apple shape look . So in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , without  uh yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Like like mobiles , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Okay . 
C:   
D:  Okay . We still need the buttons in the same places thought , don't we ? 
B:  Yeah , button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , so half of that will be look the  Yeah , not not the upper side . So from lower you can , it means while you are holding of  from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . And  
C:  You can standardise those , I mean . 
D:   Oh , that's the other side . Oh , okay . Oh , half a fruit . Oh , okay , okay . Okay , okay . Okay . 
A:  Yeah yeah . 
C:  I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , 'cause when  if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . It doesn't really  
D:  Mm mm . 
C:  You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , unless you have sort of  you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . 
D:  <other> Yeah . 
C:  And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the  
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Maybe . <laugh> 
A:  <other>  Okay , um so  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . 
A:  Yeah , s I guess we decided on material , right ? So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , and the colours we got down , and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , um because  Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because <other> what  Yeah , w I think wh wha would  we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a  too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . I mean we could make it nice pale yellow . 
C:  Okay , so we stick with what we've got there . Mm 'kay . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . <laugh> Well , it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow . <laugh> So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Okay . Yeah . Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . 
C:  colour , but have  kinda going round , yeah . 
A:  Mm . 
D:  Because  
C:  Um I mean e even if  I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Uh-huh . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  W sort of  


A:  Great . <other> Um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we don't have to be limited by that . We can use a hand-dynamo . Um I don't know what that means , we crank it ? <laugh> 
C:  Uh It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda <other> powers it . Uh yeah . 
A:  Right , it's like those watches that you c So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power . 
D:  Oh , a d a dynamo ? 
B:  Yeah ,  . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah , I like that , yeah . 
B:   
D:  Yeah , like with those watches that you kind of twist . Yeah that's quite cool . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . So if it if it's not working , I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . <laugh> 
C:  Okay . 
B:  But  <other> 
C:  You shake it and scream at it . Yeah . 
B:  But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat Yeah , to mo Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , it is , yeah . 
C:  It does leave them with an obligation to  Especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated . Then if it's just sitting on the  
B:  Yeah , because most of the people  Yeah . <other> 
A:  Right . 
D:  Yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then  Yeah . 
C:  Okay , okay . Right um what are the other options ? 
D:  That's true . 
A:  Okay . Uh there's solar power . Um . 
B:  Uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea , because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , and the days when there is no sola sunlight  <other> Yeah . Yeah . What we w yeah . I think we should  a rechargeable <other> battery will be a good idea . They can they can recharge it . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  I'm I'm with uh Raj on that , I think , you know , I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window . 
A:  Okay , so probably just  
D:   But w <other> like just normal light ? 
C:  Oh that's true . 
D:  <other> 
C:  I mean I w I w uh that idea that I thought <other> um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother is having a , 
A:  Mm . 
D:  And we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ? 
C:  yeah , having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as  uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  'Kay . 
D:  Like like a hand  like one of those portable phones kind of thing . 
C:  Yeah that kind of thing . 
B:  Yeah , that's  Yeah , exactly . 
A:  Okay . So uh a rechargeable battery  . Okay . Um the user interface , the buttons , I guess we talked about this already . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Rechargeable . 
D:  Mm . 
C:   . What's chip on print ? What's  
A:  Um . Hmm ? 
C:  Sorry , never mind . <cough> 
A:  Uh th the uh the electronics um , basically the more features we add um  Oops , this one . So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , which adds to the cost as you can expect . Um . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
A:  But uh I think we can keep it all under budget . So uh yes , so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through . So just in time . <laugh> 
D:  Mm-hmm . Just in time . 
C:  Yeah , and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping . 
A:  Right , right . 
C:  That's good . 


C:  Uh woah . Okay , we're we're kind of uh we're kind of um <cough> Excuse m I've just deleted that whole thing . Um we're kind of running out of time , so if you could  
A:  Yeah , and keeping the L_C_D_ screen out . <other> 
C:  Uh . <other> Was that you ? Um that was  your bit's covered , I just dele I just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to say next . 
A:  Huh ? Oh yeah that was that was it . 
B:  Uh excuse me , Bri 
A:   
C:  Um , yeah . Oh , yeah . 
A:  So control F_ eight , right ? 
D:  Yeah , mine seems to have turned off . I can't do anything . 
C:  And I just touch the pad . 
B:  You just touch the pad , yeah . 
D:  No . 
C:  <laugh> It's actually shut down . 
B:  No ? 
D:  It's on , but there's nothing on the screen . 
C:  Okay , um now what we have  uh our next meeting's in half an hour and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . 
A:  Try uh flipping the screen down  . 'Kay . Oh , I get to do it , too . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . It's you guys . Yeah . So um , you know I mean , luckily we chose a nice simple shape . <laugh> Um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches . 
D:  Cool . <laugh> 
A:  Oh neat . 
D:  Yeah . Mm . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  Okay . 
B:   That's great . 
A:  Okay . Save everything to the shared documents , is that right ? 
C:  Uh yeah , I hope I can recover this , 'cause I've accidentally deleted it . <laugh> Which doesn't really help me much . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  I think , I've saved mine already . 
C:  Yeah , can you save that  uh send that last one again , please , Raj , as I still can't find it on the  
B:  Yeah . Uh it was under a different name . I will show you , in shared documents . 
C:  <other> Okay . 
B:  Uh working components  . Oh , you didn't get that . I will send new . Uh I'll put it in shared documents , again . 
C:  No . Okay , thank you . Um yeah , Project , Project Documents . 
B:  Project documents , sorry , I put it in the shared documents . 
C:  Uh right , that's that's the that  it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents . Project Documents is on the um <other> desktop . 
B:  Uh yeah . Right , that's great . But I cou can't open that , because it w asks uh for some username or password . 
A:  Oh  . 
C:  Really ?  
B:   I'll show you . 
A:  Uh these lapel mics are trouble . 
B:  Ts 
C:  Oh right , I think um  Hold on . <cough> Yeah , I don't know if y it it just ca it just came up on my um 
B:  Sorry . Uh . 
C:  on my agenda . S <laugh> Um presumably there's clay somewhere . Um . <other> Four . 
B:  Yeah , that's great . 
C:  Whoops . Light , light , please . Light . <laugh> Right , there you go . 
B:  Yeah , th thank you . 
C:  Yeah , quite . And we're using this our basic chip set , so it's all good . <laugh> 
B:  Oh sorry . 
A:  Are we done with our meeting ? 
B:  Uh excuse me , Brian . You have to keep your pen separate , because I used your pen . 
C:  Um I think we're almost done , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh oops . Sorry man . 
B:  S <laugh> 
C:  Uh okay , still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and  Uh . Apples . <cough> Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . 'Kay , so we came up with that , that's okay . What's supplements ? Supplements . Uh <other> uh . <other> See . <laugh> 
D:  Cool . Fun . 
C:  I shoulda  something like that . If I kn see I I knew that . I shoulda sort of engineered it so we k ended up making a diffi difficult shape . <laugh> Just for cruelty . <cough> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . Star fruit . <laugh> 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  <laugh> I wonder if they mean like literally make it , sort of buttons and everything . 
B:  So sh should 
D:  No . Oh yeah , we can do buttons . 
B:  Should we leave now , Brian ? Or we are going to discuss something ? 
C:  Um . Uh no , I think that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions <other> or confusions , 'cause I'm confused . 
B:  <other> 
D:  No I'm good .
