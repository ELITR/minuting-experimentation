C:  Um we are  So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . So  switching over I've just left uh my first two screens  . Um <cough> I have 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time . <cough> Um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that 
D:  Okay . Cool . 
C:  are particularly bothering you ? 
D:  Mm um . No , I don't think so . 
C:  N 
A:  No . 
C:  No ? Okay , cool .

C:  Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj . 
B:  Yeah . <cough> Hi , me Raj , again . Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching , uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . So we have to look on this . First of all methodology . The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way  <cough> We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . 
topic_description:	marketing expert presentation_None


B:  So what are our findings ? In our <other> uh in our findings we have seen that  when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . So we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor . So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take  in designing our rem uh remote controls . 
D:  The last one is the most important one , is it ? Oh , sorry . 
B:  No the first one is the uh the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , the fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are . So it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . So that indicates our technological advancement . 
C:   
D:  Okay . Okay . 
C:  <other> 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way . And it should be uh  and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . So that they could know how to use these remote controls . 
D:  Mm-hmm .

B:  When we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh  our recent fashion update shows that  
D:  <laugh> Sorry . I was just reading fruit and vegetables . Hard to know how we are going to incorporate that . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Ah yeah ? <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Y yeah uh yeah , we have to , because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes ,  and everything with fruits and vegetables , because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , becoming  <other> Yeah . <laugh> So  <other> Yeah . So something like that we we should do . 
C:   
D:  <laugh> Okay . Yeah . 
A:  We should make a big sponge lemon , and then it'd be it would be yellow . It's  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . Th that's very good . Glow-in-the-dark . Okay . 
B:  And people uh the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . <other> Yeah . Yeah . So so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it . So that should also be taken into consideration . So these are my views . So  
D:  Well , that's good . That's what we kind of predicted anyway . 
A:  Mm . <laugh> 
D:  Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay , the spongy , not real spongy , you can <other>  Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? 
B:  No it ca <other> y a   The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co Yeah . 'Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also , because our company is very well  for taking all these concerns into consideration , so we don't want to have any harm to the society , so  
D:  Okay . Quite disposable . Okay . Oh okay . 
C:  Alright , okay . 
D:  Uh-huh . Okay . 
C:  Fashion . 
D:  <laugh> Cool . 
C:  <other> Mm 'kay . Fruit and veg , well there you go . Just what I think of when I think of a remote control . <other> <laugh> 
B:  So that's all . <laugh> 
D:  <other> Mm . A remote control ? Yeah . 
A:   
B:  <laugh>  
D:  And were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ? 
B:  S uh we didn't find out any such point . Uh yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so  
D:  Or was it just  Okay . <laugh> 
C:  Mm-mm-mm-mm . 
D:  Cool . 
C:  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm .

D:  F_ , what is it ? Um . 
C:  Function F_ eight . 
D:   yeah . 
C:  Hmm . 
D:  Okay . 
A:   
B:  Yeah .  
C:   
D:  No signal . 
B:  Oh no , <other>  . 
D:  Is that  ? 
A:  No , it's got it's got it . 
B:  Yeah , uh yeah , uh yeah .  Yeah . <other> 
C:  <other> Excuse me . 
A:   
D:  Okay , and then F_ five , right ? 
C:  Uh , yeah  . 
D:  Okay . Um okay , so the interface concept um . Yeah . The interface specification , what people  um how they interact with it basically , I think . Um so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the  what's good about them , what's bad about them , um I looked at their flaws , so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . Um and what <other> the survey told us and what we think would be good , so a bit of imagination . <other> Uh the findings , I've got some pictures to show you as well . <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  Mm 'kay . <laugh>  either . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  'Kay . 
D:  design . 
C:  <other>  
D:  So okay , I'll take this out now then . 
A:  Okay . 
topic_description:	interface specialist presentation_None


D:  <other> Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing . So I think for our remote control  There is some inconsistency already in  ec existing in  between remote controls , but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something , I think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use . 
C:  Uh okay . Right , okay . Yeah . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


D:  And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you . Do I press Escape F_ five ? Or just  
C:  <other> Excellent . Uh no just escape 
D:  Escape , okay . 
C:  should uh  
D:  Um , oh I still haven't got my glasses on . Yeah , okay . So these are the  some of the pictures of existing ones . I'll just walk you through them . This one is a voice recognition . And that's the kind of idea we're going for . There's um an L_C_D_ thing , which we thought could  I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . This one is  got a kind of scroll like a mouse , which  Yeah . Um and  But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that , like would the computer come  
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Wow . 
C:  'Kay . Looks pretty complicated . Right , okay . Mm-hmm , like the middle button . Okay . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Ah it's kinda like scrolling  uh right , well , if I s if I'm thinking of the right one , I've got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um <other> menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . Right , okay . 
D:  Uh-huh , that's like the L_C_D_ one , is it ? But the one below that has got like <other> a little scroll function on the side . But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen . 
C:  Yeah , presumably . 
B:  <other> Yeah . 
D:  I think that's what that is . So these are just a few ideas . Again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one . 
C:  Yeah , looks like uh looks like something out of a jet . <laugh> 
A:  Uh it looks threatening . 
D:  Yeah , it does look kind of dangerous . 
A:  <other> It looks like yeah  . 
D:  Um this one I thought was really cool . It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about . You can put it in there , it's for your kids , and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool . And that's really easy to use , bright , so I like this one lot for our design . I think something like that would be good . Of course yellow . <laugh> 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Wow . 
C:  Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um <other> , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever . 
D:  Right , yeah . Yeah , that's true . Yeah . Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something . And this one , the over-sized one , I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky . I don't think that will sell very well . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . I mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ? <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> I guess so . I don't know . I think that's a bit  
C:  Strange . <laugh> 
A:  Then d blind don't watch T_V_ . <laugh> They do ? <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah exactly . <laugh> Yeah . And um this one <other> is just pointing out . I like <other> some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , but  pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape . So that could  that's a bit confusing . Um but the buttons on this I think are  it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons . They don't have to be all the same . So that's quite cool . Um . 
C:  No they do , they do . They listen to it . Yeah . Right , okay . 'Kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ? 
D:  Yeah , exactly . Um F_ five . Yes . 
A:  <other> 
D:  So there are some of the findings . So we need to combine those ones 
topic_description:	existing products_None


D:  um and I've just got <other> an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . Um yeah it is , just in time , very handy . Um so <other> I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . It's  you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , so that's  And it's much  Yeah . 
C:  Brilliant . That's handy . <laugh> <cough> Okay . 
D:  So that's quite cool . Uh personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the <other>  
A:  The L_C_D_ and the other stuff uh , I think . 
D:  Yeah . And the speech recognition , 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , are we ? 
B:  But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . Uh yeah . Yeah . So even if we increase our cost little bit , within uh some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market . 
D:  Uh-huh . 
C:  Okay . 
D:  Uh-huh . But our budget , we've  Yeah . 
C:  It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . 
D:  Uh-huh . Okay . I'm not sure if the  if <other> for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost ,  . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Ben bana 
C:  Yeah . I can't see tha Although , th I mean to be to be sure they have got  I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now , so that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything so maybe the small  
A:   
D:  The L_C_D_ . 
A:  <other> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  But I mean like I I  the black and white , I guess , it just doesn't look funky enough . Um but , I mean , like even mobile phones or whatever have  now have colour L_C_D_ screens , w I ju I mean I wouldn't know about the costs of them . 
A:  <other> 
D:  No . Yeah . S 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  Uh-huh . 
A:  But uh price price not withstanding um , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ? 
C:  Twelve fifty . 
B:  And the  Uh i it will be easy because there will be , on L_C_D_ s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa 
C:  <other> Possibly . 
D:  Yeah , that's the thing , because  
A:  But but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , right ? You're looking at the T_V_ and and it's uh  It just seems kind of like a a needless th 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  That's true , yeah . 
C:  Right . 
D:  And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ . It's a it's great , it's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


D:  Child-friendly , I thought this was good , as you pointed out the um <other> the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of  we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . Well I mean we could make a  Yeah . <cough> Well , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s <laugh> And if it doesn't work you know , we've just made a lemon . <other> <cough> 
A:  So which vegetable ? <laugh> Okay . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , I know , carrot <laugh> . 
A:  The the lemon . Well what are the options ? 
D:  Yeah . But we don't want it to be  Yeah . Um the child-friendly , yeah . Easy to use , it seems quite easy to use . I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . I think that's a good idea to go for . 
C:  Mm-hmm . I like I like the colourful buttons as well . 
D:  Yeah . And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . Um . 
C:  Yeah . I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five , so most people 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  will have come in contact with that kind of use . 
D:  S yeah . So they'd be able to use that um , as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen . Um so there you go . 
C:  Yeah . And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker , so  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh . 
D:  So that's um the user interface 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  Um so 
D:  There you go . 
C:  <other> <other> 
A:  I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , 
C:  Yeah , looks like it . 
A:  and I'll I'll give you the uh , <other> I guess , technical considerations for those . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  <other> Uh <other> 
D:   
A:  And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it <other> . 
C:  Yeah , I was just thinking the self same thing . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Right . 
topic_description:	industrial designer presentation_None


A:  So , the way I'm gonna do this <other> is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it , and then we'll throw in our new innovations um <other> and keep it all within budget . 
C:  <other> <laugh> Magic man . 
A:  So uh yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control . Um this is what they sent me . 'Kay . Here's uh the competition , I suppose . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , um <other> and there's a a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , and ch 
C:  Mm-hmm . So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? 
A:  Right , it's very  they're very cheap remote . This remote costs nothing , you know . Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light , which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television . Oh here it is . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Right . 
A:  <other> Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it it defines the uh  
C:  Okay . So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? 
A:  R Um no , I mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make . 
C:  They gotta be  <laugh> Almost a key-ring .  
A:  Right . So this is what we need to have for certain . 
C:  <other> Okay . 
A:  Um . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up , processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard . Um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , um latex , double-curved , curved . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  So lots of choices , what do we think ? 
C:  'Kay . 
A:  Uh or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right . Organic sponge . <laugh> 
C:  Well . 
D:  Mm . I'm not sure about the sponge . 
C:  Well , I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , doesn't it . Um  
A:  Uh yeah , it's very elasticy for sure . 
C:  Yeah . And that would k also give it kinda durability and 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Um . 
C:  and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . Um <other> so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic  initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? 
A:  Yeah so  Okay so , here are a a plastic , uh latex  
D:  I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think , you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and  
C:  Oh right , okay . 
A:  Oh right . 
C:  I don't know what that stuff is . <other> 
A:  So something with give to it . <other> Okay . And 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


A:  and the colour is yellow , right ? 
D:  Yeah , y <other> yellow incorporated , yeah . 
C:  Or at least incorporating , yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Yellow <laugh> , okay . Um . 
C:  I mean I forgot i we're sort of uh  I don't know what other standard silver kind of  
D:  I think  Mm . 
C:  Other parts or uh  
D:  Yeah , the buttons w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours or i if we're having buttons actually , I don 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Mm' kay . So yellow for the body , and then what colour for the buttons ? 
C:  Um . Um I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  So multi-coloured buttons . 
D:  You do have ones like um play <other> could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah . 
A:   
C:  Yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . 
D:  <other> Makes it easy to use . Yeah , that's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish . 
A:  <laugh> Okay . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . I mean if we are gonna make it a novel  I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
C:  a bit comfier , you know . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go  Um how exactly ? Maybe double  
D:  Like uh <other> an hour glass kind of figure , is that what you're thinking of , or just like a  
C:  Yeah it's uh , yeah , that that'd be  that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it . 
D:  It's not  Yeah . 
A:  What about a banana ? 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> We could make novelty remote controls . 
A:  Yeah ? Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , 'cause it's yellow fruit , right ? 
C:  Well , yeah , I mean like  
D:  <other> 
C:  Yeah , yeah . Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . But then how would you point it ? 
B:  Ah yeah . Mm-hmm . 
A:   
D:  How would you point it ? What  
A:  Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess . We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end . 
B:  <other> Yeah , I appreciate this idea , because then this  <laugh> this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . That what our data shows that , so this w this w 
C:  They only cost pennies . 
D:  <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah .  y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea . 
C:  Huh ? 
B:  <other> 
C:  <laugh> Um . 
A:  So a spongy banana re <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <other> I mean that that th <laugh> 
D:  Rubber banana . <laugh> Okay . 
C:  does it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . <other> 
D:  <other> Yeah . I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . And what else did you say about fashions ? What was trendy ? 
A:  Okay , okay . 
B:  Uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , like people uh now  
C:  <other> S 
A:  See  
C:  And sponginess . 
D:  And spongy , yeah . 
A:  So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like so it would have a stem perhaps and a 
B:  Spongy . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . Maybe , yeah . 
A:  maybe a  it'd be s axially symmetric . 
C:  Huh . 
D:  Like what's what's that <other> , I don't even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it's like  looks like a little snowman kind of thing . I don't know the name of that . 
A:  So it'd look like this kinda . 
D:  Yeah , that's what I was thinking . 
A:  Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? 
C:  Uh . 
D:  Yeah , maybe that's what they are . 
C:   
D:  'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit and  
A:  Yeah , and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <other> Yeah , why the hell not . <other> Let's <laugh> that'll make us fifty million Euros . 
D:  I don't know . What do you guy  What do you think ? 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Um . Well , I guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , yeah ? 
D:  No . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , then only we can relate it with something . Yeah . Exactly . 
C:  Yeah , we can relate it by advertising or  
A:  Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? 
C:  <other> Yeah . 
B:  <other> Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . 
D:  Uh-huh . 
C:  There's a good man . There's a good idea . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Okay um , I guess , since you're the marketing guy . 
B:  Yeah , sure . I will be happy to do that . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  We'll uh  Okay , we could do that . Um . 
D:  Okay . And buttons would , did we say ? Uh different shapes of buttons ? 
A:   
C:  Um I l I su I mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , uh play , stop . They've got , I mean , they've got standard sort of intuitive um 
D:  Mm . 
A:  Okay , so so buttons . 
C:  things that are always used . 
D:   <laugh> 
A:  Okay , just like that . 
C:  <laugh> That's cool . <laugh> I like it . Um . <cough> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . With the scroll-wheel or no ? 
D:  Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? <other> 
C:  Uh speech recognition , I think , so we need a microphone presumably . 
A:  Okay uh I could put the microphone here . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Okay there's the microphone . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Where should I put the microphone ? 
C:  I mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? 
D:  Yeah , I'm not sure . Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration , I think . Um yeah , I can  no I'm not sure . 
C:  <laugh> Glad , we're not doing this for real . 
A:  Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ? 
D:  I couldn Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  And uh I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is  the microphone  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or  
C:  I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  'Kay there's the mic . 
C:  So it can be sort of held and w  <other>  We really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition . 
D:  That's cool . 
A:  <other> Um n well we can  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Whoops . <laugh> 
C:  Oops . <laugh> Um . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Um . 
D:  So let's not use the whiteboard any more . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> Um . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Upsidaisy . <cough> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Oops , sorry . Okay .

D:  And uh so what else was there ? Um the  What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? Are we just gonna leave that ? 
C:  <other> 
A:  <cough> 
C:  <other> I s I still like it . Um but that's me . <laugh> 
D:  You still like it . 'Cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system . 
A:  Right . 
C:  Yes , or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far . I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes . Um don't wanna sort of overkill . 
D:  'Cause um it could  Yeah . Especially with yellow <other> . <other> Mm . I dunno . 
A:  Hmm . 
C:  'Cause I mean like uh if we  I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? Do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Then you put it in the fruit bowl ? 
A:    <other> They can work from a  You don't have to hold it . 
C:  Yeah , you know , and then you just tal I mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly . <laugh> Um . <other> 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , you know they have uh fruits all round them . <laugh> Now just make sure they don't eat the remote . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Make them make them think of fruit , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  I mean uh <other> some uh I l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple . 
D:  Yeah , do we need buttons ? Mm . 
C:  Then it's just apple so sort of  Uh , yellow apples though  Hmm . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  I quite like the shape . I quite like the design of that , uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite  got a quite steady base . 
A:   
C:  Yeah . Okay , yeah , that's good . Groovy . 
A:  Okay . But yeah  
D:  Um and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . 
C:  <other> Yeah ,  . <laugh> 
D:   
A:  But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . It can sit at a distance and pick it up still . 
C:  Yeah . So <other> I mean like you could actually  
D:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah , gives you the options . 
B:  Or we can  we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , it will look l <other> Uh yeah . In that w 
D:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
C:  So a selection of casings . 
D:  Yeah , 'cause you said about disposable , didn't you ? 
C:  It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um  
B:  S s sorry ? 
D:  You said about disposable earli people want disposable things so we could do that , like have a choice . 
C:   
B:  Uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , okay ? If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put  we will put apple shape casing on that . It will give apple shape look . So in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , without  uh yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Like like mobiles , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Okay . 
C:   
D:  Okay . We still need the buttons in the same places thought , don't we ? 
B:  Yeah , button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , so half of that will be look the  Yeah , not not the upper side . So from lower you can , it means while you are holding of  from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . And  
C:  You can standardise those , I mean . 
D:   Oh , that's the other side . Oh , okay . Oh , half a fruit . Oh , okay , okay . Okay , okay . Okay . 
A:  Yeah yeah . 
C:  I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , 'cause when  if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . It doesn't really  
D:  Mm mm . 
C:  You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , unless you have sort of  you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . 
D:  <other> Yeah . 
C:  And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the  
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Maybe . <laugh> 
A:  <other>  Okay , um so  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . 
A:  Yeah , s I guess we decided on material , right ? So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , and the colours we got down , and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , um because  Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because <other> what  Yeah , w I think wh wha would  we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a  too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . I mean we could make it nice pale yellow . 
C:  Okay , so we stick with what we've got there . Mm 'kay . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . <laugh> Well , it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow . <laugh> So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Okay . Yeah . Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . 
C:  colour , but have  kinda going round , yeah . 
A:  Mm . 
D:  Because  
C:  Um I mean e even if  I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Uh-huh . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  W sort of

A:  Great . <other> Um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we don't have to be limited by that . We can use a hand-dynamo . Um I don't know what that means , we crank it ? <laugh> 
C:  Uh It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda <other> powers it . Uh yeah . 
A:  Right , it's like those watches that you c So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power . 
D:  Oh , a d a dynamo ? 
B:  Yeah ,  . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah , I like that , yeah . 
B:   
D:  Yeah , like with those watches that you kind of twist . Yeah that's quite cool . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . So if it if it's not working , I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . <laugh> 
C:  Okay . 
B:  But  <other> 
C:  You shake it and scream at it . Yeah . 
B:  But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat Yeah , to mo Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , it is , yeah . 
C:  It does leave them with an obligation to  Especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated . Then if it's just sitting on the  
B:  Yeah , because most of the people  Yeah . <other> 
A:  Right . 
D:  Yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then  Yeah . 
C:  Okay , okay . Right um what are the other options ? 
D:  That's true . 
A:  Okay . Uh there's solar power . Um . 
B:  Uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea , because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , and the days when there is no sola sunlight  <other> Yeah . Yeah . What we w yeah . I think we should  a rechargeable <other> battery will be a good idea . They can they can recharge it . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  I'm I'm with uh Raj on that , I think , you know , I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window . 
A:  Okay , so probably just  
D:   But w <other> like just normal light ? 
C:  Oh that's true . 
D:  <other> 
C:  I mean I w I w uh that idea that I thought <other> um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother is having a , 
A:  Mm . 
D:  And we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ? 
C:  yeah , having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as  uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  'Kay . 
D:  Like like a hand  like one of those portable phones kind of thing . 
C:  Yeah that kind of thing . 
B:  Yeah , that's  Yeah , exactly . 
A:  Okay . So uh a rechargeable battery  . Okay . Um the user interface , the buttons , I guess we talked about this already . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Rechargeable . 
D:  Mm . 
C:   . What's chip on print ? What's  
A:  Um . Hmm ? 
C:  Sorry , never mind . <cough> 
A:  Uh th the uh the electronics um , basically the more features we add um  Oops , this one . So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , which adds to the cost as you can expect . Um . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
A:  But uh I think we can keep it all under budget . So uh yes , so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through . So just in time . <laugh> 
D:  Mm-hmm . Just in time . 
C:  Yeah , and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping . 
A:  Right , right . 
C:  That's good .
