A:  <cough> So um nice to see you again . Uh . So , uh . Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes . Uh so we will see our three presentations . Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . 


D:  Okay , can I have the laptop over here , or ? Okay . Have to get up . <laugh> 
A:  Yep . Oh , I don't think so . I think you have to come here . I dunno . I think it should stay . 
D:  Excuse me . <laugh> Okay . 
B:  Yeah , that's it . 
A:   Should stay in the square here . <laugh> 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Oh , maybe . 


D:  Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control . Um so first of all we  what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects . Um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to , you know , um play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls . <other> <cough> 
A:  Oh , you can put it here . Oh that's okay , it's jus 
D:  That's my dic that's my presentation . Thank you . 
A:  Hmm . Thank you . 
B:  <other> 


C:  Okay . 
A:  So , um maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device . So uh Pet Peter , can you talk say something about that ? 
B:  Well , okay , yeah . Yeah , but the user user interface is responsible . 
A:  No . 
C:  B you think uh I I'm User Interface Manager . <laugh> Okay . Okay . If I could go there with this cable . 
A:  Ah . <laugh> Sorry , I'm  Sorry . Sorry . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Okay , so  . 
A:   


B:  You're scaring me with L_C_D_ man . And speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive . 
D:  <laugh> Yeah , it's true , but , you know , they're features that users want , so it's  And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think , so I think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:   
B:  Yeah . At least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally . <laugh> 
C:  <other> Sh okay .  
D:  It is true . 


C:  Where's delete button ? Okay . Oh I'm sorry . <other>  
B:  <laugh> 
C:   
A:   
C:  Okay . 
D:  That's the wrong one , I think . 
A:  Yeah , it's still Bob Morris . <laugh> Yeah you should have put yes . 
C:  Oh . Presentation three ? 
B:  Because you cancelled it . Yeah . 
C:  Oh . <laugh> 
A:  Click on yes .  yeah . 
B:  Yep . 


C:  Okay , so here is my presentation about technical function design . I will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together . Okay , uh , first what is a remote control ? Simply it's a device , as you know , for uh , for sending some commands by some waves to uh another device to to tell different commands uh with this device . And the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device . 
C:  And uh personal preferences , uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with  uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way . And uh uh again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see . Okay . That was my presentation . 
D:  Okay . 


A:  Okay . So , maybe you can talk about the function , and  
D:  Okay . 
B:  Yes . I have only a couple of things because I had  I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company . I was used to use Linux before , so . But I tried to tried to break through this  too , I guess . Mm . Ah . 
A:  Open . 
C:  <other> 
B:  Okay . <other> How to make it big ? 
A:  Slide show . 
C:  Five .  
B:  Slide show . Okay , thanks . <laugh> 
A:  It should work , so you can  . 


B:  Okay . Oh so I will speak about working design . That's the first slide . Uh what uh I have to do ? A look at what the other company  Okay so uh presently I am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and stuff like that because uh I didn't work uh with these uh circuits so far so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication  for the I_R_ circuits and so on , so I'm currently looking what is available on the web . And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , I would be glad if you can tell me about them . So , you know . 
A:  Mm . Yeah . 
B:  But if we use the L_C_D_ uh even the radio frequency communication with the T_V_ set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay . If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards . It depends of you if if the M_E_ or U_I_D_ , I'm sorry about the names , I don't really know , uh want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it it depends on you not  Because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that , so . We will discuss it afterwards . 
A:  Okay . Mm . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  Oh , this is nothing . This is just my notes on what to use . And uh my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit , but from the point of view uh of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s . That's my opinion . Uh I mean if infra-red uh circuit not not the radio frequency . 
A:  Why ? Because it's simpler ? 
B:  Because because the the range where you can use it is fair . It's okay I think . And the price is fairly cheap for this . Well , depends . 
A:  Yeah . Mm . Okay . It's a a price matter . Yeah . 
B:  Jus just the price . Otherwise I don't care what I put there because it's the chip which I buy or which we buy . 
B:  Uh okay , that's it for me . 'Kay . 
A:  Okay , thank you Peter . 


A:  So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . Um 
D:  Mm . 
A:  first um , they say that's uh about something about t teletext . Uh apparently it becomes from  according to them it becomes out of date . Out-dated . And uh  Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext . Um . So I think we can avoid the teletext . Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , because it make it  it makes it's too complex and uh because we have not much time for this project we should stay on T_V_ on the  only specific T_V_ remote control . 
B:  I agree . <laugh> 
A:  The third <laugh> the third one is uh about the the the image of the company . So um uh we should we should keep uh  The the product should be recognisable . Uh , uh It's  That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is uh , we put fashion of  in electronics . So , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company . 


A:  So , um  So now we we should take the decision what we are going to  what function we will have on this uh on this remote control . So , mm , are we going to use L_C_D_ , speech recognition ? Uh . 
D:  Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need . And then we can move on to the more advanced features . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm . Yes . 
A:  Maybe , maybe . 
B:  Okay , so the available things are L_C_D_ , the buttons and everything . Uh radio frequency depends . And , well the recognition it depends on you guys . You should probably speak . 
A:  <other> Anything else ? 
D:  So we've got channel and volume . Um . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  So we are still s speaking about the common devices or we are inviting the new one ? 
C:   
D:  I think so . I think basically the core functions we want , and then more advanced ones . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So , any other suggestions or functions ? 
D:  What about things like the clock and um timers ? 
B:  Do we still have the time ? I I just wonder . 
A:  Yeah , we have still one or two minutes to talk , yeah . 
B:  Okay . Oh . Well what w what was the question ? 
C:  Clock or  
A:  <other> So maybe we think  we can think more about that , and discuss that maybe last time  next time . 


A:  And uh yeah , now the meeting room is busy . Somebody booked the meeting room just for  at one P_M_ , and so we should leave . Uh . So , um . So now we are going for for a small lunch . It's uh funded by the company . And uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works . And uh I will do the minutes . And uh you are going to work on your individual works . And uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on . Thank you everybody . 
D:  Okay , cool . Okay 
C:  Thanks . 
D:  Thank you .
