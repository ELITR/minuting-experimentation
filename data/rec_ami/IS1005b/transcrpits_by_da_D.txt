Okay , 
can I have the laptop over here , or ? 
Okay 
. Have to get up . <laugh> 
Excuse me . 
<laugh> Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control . 
Um so first of all we  what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects . 
Um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to , you know , um play with remote controls , 
and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls . 
<other> <cough> 
So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market . 
Um they , you know , 
seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly . 
Completely ugly . 
Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , 
that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_ . 
Um , that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it . 
Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls . 
Um so we collect 
we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . 
And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most  by far the most used buttons on the remote control . 
Um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , um , while the user's watching T_V_ . 
Um the closest button that was used , 
well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , 
um which was used fourteen times per hour , 
followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , um , 
all the other , all the other um buttons , such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour . 
Um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them , 
you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . 
And basically they came  they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , 
um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance . 
Um and the audio and picture settings had a very  
that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh weren't very important to them um , 
and they used them very infrequently a as well . 
<cough> So we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls . 
And fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . 
Um <other> they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , 
especially when there's many buttons and it's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface . 
Um and then thirdly , they  some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury . 
<other> We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the  on the remote control . 
In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , 
and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control . 
Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . 
They want these features , 
they want these high technology features . 
Um for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . 
Whereas um <cough> the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control . 
So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market . 
Um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , um I think we're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic , 
and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control . 
That's my dic that's my presentation . 
Thank you . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah , it's true , 
but , you know , they're features that users want , 
so it's  
And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think , 
so I think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote . 
It is true . 
That's the wrong one , I think . 
Okay . 
I have a question . 
Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Are we um are we planning to take an off the shelf an O_E_M_ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ? 
Okay s 
So we just buy a circuit board and <other> 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
What how much more expensive ? 
Are we talking three times more expensive ? 
Or ten times more expensive ? 
Or  
Okay . 
Yeah 
yeah . 
That's still a lot . 
I think it's it's probably not worth spending the extra money , 
because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red . 
So it's not worth spending the extra money . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are  prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves . 
So I think we're better off spending money in the usability phase . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need . 
And then we can move on to the more advanced features . 
Okay , well , I mean the obvious one is changing channels . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , okay . 
 
Yeah , 
I  
 Ah yeah . <laugh> 
To have some feedback . Yeah . 
We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel . 
So we c you could quickly just <whizzing sound> <laugh> through many channels . 
<laugh> For the channels , perhaps . 
So we've got channel and volume . Um . 
I think so . 
I think basically the core functions we want , and then more advanced ones . 
Yeah . 
I don't 
Oh , I don't but I don't think we're we're the ones . 
I mean this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all T_V_s , I think . 
Okay . 
But then you don't want to make the L_C_D_ display too complicated at the same time . 
<laugh> 
I mean there's always  we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , 
under a cover or at the back of  under a slide or some 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Okay . 
So we have five minutes left . Um . 
So I think s the settings we th we are agreeing  are agreed that they're required . 
It's just how to a 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Uh , okay , what else ? 
I mean a power button's obviously 
uh required . 
Uh , well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off . 
But if you're watching T_V_ for two hours , you don't want your T_V_ to turn off after five five minute <laugh> 
<laugh> 
I mean based on our usability studies again , um <other> pe um people said that the power button was v a very relevant button . 
Um , you know , it was nine out of ten 
re relevance . 
 
Okay . B Okay . 
I think we need to concentrate on the , you know , the major usage of the th of the control , 
which is you sit down , you turn on your T_V_ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the T_V_ off . 
Um and all the other f functionality is 
not used very often . 
Yeah . 
I think a button . 
I think it should be a bu 
Its own button on the front . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
S 
What about things like the clock and um timers ? 
Uh um , you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display  
Probably not . 
It's a questi yeah , it's a trade-off . 
'Kay . 
Okay simple . 
Very , yeah okay , very occasionally . 
But I do use the I do use the display of the time quite often , but  
Yeah . 
Yeah that's okay , that's true . 
Okay , so no time button  . Okay . 
Okay , 
cool . Okay 
Thank you .
