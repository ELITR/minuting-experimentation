<cough> 
So um nice to see you again . 
Uh . So , uh . 
Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes . 
Uh so we will see our three presentations . 
Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . 
Yep . 
Oh , I don't think so . 
I think you have to come here . 
I dunno . 
I think it should stay . 
 
Should stay in the square here . <laugh> 
Oh , maybe . 
Oh , you can put it here . 
Oh that's okay , it's jus 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
Thank you . 
So , um 
maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device . 
So uh Pet Peter , can you talk say something about that ? 
No . 
Ah . 
<laugh> Sorry , I'm  Sorry . Sorry . 
 
 
Yeah , 
it's still Bob Morris . 
<laugh> Yeah you should have put yes . 
Click on yes . 
 yeah . 
So can we use any any frequency ? 
We have the right to use any frequency ? 
Okay . 
And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same  have our remote control , for example ? 
And so do they have the same frequency , or ? 
Okay . A kind of identification  , 
okay . 
So  
Yeah . 
So  
Okay . 
Hmm . 
Okay . 
So , maybe you can talk about the function , and  
Open . 
Slide show . 
It should work , 
so you can  . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ? 
Or it would be maybe feasible ? 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Why ? 
Because it's simpler ? 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Okay . It's a a price matter . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well I  , oh  
On the other side , we want to have something new . 
You know , 
where 
we want to to have something new 
and So we I think we should still thinking about it . 
But maybe  . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay , thank you Peter . 
So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . Um 
first um , they say that's uh about something about t teletext . 
Uh apparently it becomes from  according to them it becomes out of date . Out-dated . 
And uh  
Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext . 
Um . 
So I think we can avoid the teletext . 
Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , 
because it make it  it makes it's too complex 
and uh because we have not much time for this project we should stay on T_V_ on the  only specific T_V_ remote control . 
The third <laugh> 
the third one is uh about the the the image of the company . 
So um uh we should we should keep uh  The the product should be recognisable . 
Uh , uh 
It's  That mean we should use the colour of our company 
and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is uh , we put fashion of  in electronics . 
So , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company . 
So , um  
So now we we should take the decision what we are going to  what function we will have on this uh on this remote control . 
So , mm , are we going to use L_C_D_ , speech recognition ? 
Uh . 
Yeah . 
Maybe , maybe . 
Yeah 
but first maybe what is  what are the usual function of a standard remote control ? 
I mean 
what do  
Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
I think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button . 
So , yeah . 
So , turning channel , of course . Volume setting . 
Yeah . 
I think it would be a b  
Yeah . 
On the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's  
Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like 
uh  
Yeah . Maybe something like that . 
<laugh> Uh . 
Maybe  
Oh I don't know . 
Oh . 
Maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and  
And inside this this thing you can move , maybe switch . 
If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus . 
I It just an idea . 
I don't know what you think about that but . 
Yeah , probably , yeah , yeah . 
Okay . 
<other> Anything else ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
What about the settings of the T_V_ ? 
Because it's button we don't use very often , but it's  we need it anyway . 
So  
Yeah , 
yeah . 
I don't know if it's possible to to watch something on T_V_  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So , what are we doing with the settings ? 
Because settings  
if we want to do settings we need buttons for that 
and we want less buttons , so . 
Maybe with the L_C_D_ we can do something with less buttons , but  
Mm . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Oh yeah . 
Oh , the  . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> We should hide them somewhere . 
In the menus of the L_C_D_ or in the back of the remote control , or something like that . 
It's it's a kind of setting , I think . 
It should fit in those settings functions . 
Because it's not a very current useful function . 
No , I think it's after after five minutes or something  a timer  
I I think , no ? 
<laugh> 
Oh okay , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So s yeah . 
Yeah . 
On the back , or  
For what ? 
Ah oh yeah , yeah . 
Yeah a button , yeah I guess so . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
So , any other suggestions or functions ? 
Yeah , we have still one or two minutes to talk , yeah . 
Usually it's already on T_V_ or something like that . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , 
and is it very useful ? 
I mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ? 
This is the question . 
Is it useful ? 
W In my opinion we should have only useful thing 
and Because apparently they want  The simpler it's is better . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
No time on  . 
I think  
Yeah . 
<other> So maybe we think  we can think more about that , 
and discuss that maybe last time  next time . 
And uh yeah , now the meeting room is busy . 
Somebody booked the meeting room just for  at one P_M_ , 
and so we should leave . 
Uh . 
So , um . So now we are going for for a small lunch . 
It's uh funded by the company . 
And uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works . 
And uh I will do the minutes . 
And uh you are going to work on your individual works . 
And uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on . 
Thank you everybody .
