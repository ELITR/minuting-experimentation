Yeah , that's it . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Well , okay , yeah . 
Yeah , but the user user interface is responsible . 
Okay , so  . 
You're scaring me with L_C_D_ man . 
And speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
At least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Because you cancelled it . 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
You still want me the presentation . 
Yeah , it should be okay  . 
Yeah f <other> uh I know about this , since it's my  it's exactly my field , so . 
It's uh kind of handshaking , uh , 
when starting to  uh when you start to communicate with the your T_V_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote . 
So so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the T_V_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . 
Well it can be a problem sometimes , but most of the time it works okay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah but we we don't have to think uh about this 
because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made uh circuits which we probably bu buy . 
It's worth to buy . 
And they have these problems solved so . 
So we don't have to think about these . 
Yes . 
I have only a couple of things because I had  I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company . 
I was used to use Linux before , so . 
But I tried to tried to break through this  too , I guess . 
Mm . Ah . 
Okay . 
<other> How to make it big ? 
Slide show . Okay , 
thanks . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Oh so I will speak about working design . 
That's the first slide . 
Uh what uh I have to do ? 
A look at what the other company  
Okay so uh presently I am looking what is possible to use , 
what circuits to use and stuff like that 
because uh I didn't work uh with these uh circuits so far 
so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication  for the I_R_ circuits and so on , 
so I'm currently looking what is available on the web . 
And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , 
so , I would be glad if you can tell me about them . 
So , you know . 
Uh , okay findings , that's  the point that I'm working on currently 
but uh so far I I was uh looking what what are the blue circuit , I mean radio wave  radio frequency circuits are available now , 
but the prices I read are high . 
So , I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves 
because you can you can uh you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , 
but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on 
and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_ 
but we will discuss it later maybe . 
Uh . Components to use , 
I'm not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit . 
It depends uh on whether we will use the L_C_D_ and mainly the speech recognition , 
because the speech rec 
Yeah ? 
No no no no no . 
This we this we buy I think , because it's rather cheap nowadays 
and it's not worth to construct ourselves . 
Exactly . 
But I'm not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition . 
This I prefer that we should make ourselves . 
But it depends whether we take a decision to use it . 
Same thing . 
It's fairly expensive to use these circuits . 
So , speech recognition  
well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ , 
so I agree on using any kind of L_C_D_ , 
less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit . 
But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the  what does it offer , you know . 
Yeah , I'm  
Oh . 
I was not thinking too much about the price . 
But if we use the L_C_D_ uh even the radio frequency communication with the T_V_ set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay . 
If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle 
but we'll see afterwards . 
It depends of you if if the M_E_ or U_I_D_ , 
I'm sorry about the names , 
I don't really know , 
uh want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , 
it it depends on you not  
Because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that , so . 
We will discuss it afterwards . 
Oh , this is nothing . 
This is just my notes on what to use . 
And uh my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit , 
but from the point of view uh of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s . 
That's my opinion . 
Uh I mean if infra-red uh circuit not not the radio frequency . 
Because because the the range where you can use it is fair . 
It's okay I think . 
And the price is fairly cheap for this . 
Well , depends . 
Jus just the price . 
Otherwise I don't care what I put there because it's the chip which I buy or which we buy . 
So I I I think it's o y o <other> . 
Well , three to three to five . 
N not ten times , 
but it depends what what we  
 
Yeah . 
Th they are used to use it when they can see the T_V_ 
so , I don't know . 
 You the user interface , and management man , uh <laugh>  
Uh okay , that's it for me . 
'Kay . 
I agree . <laugh> 
Okay , so the available things are L_C_D_ , the buttons and everything . 
Uh radio frequency depends . 
And , well the recognition it depends on you guys . 
You should probably speak . 
Okay . 
Uh just one note to the chan channel changing . 
Do we  
will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ? 
I mean those nine plus one or two ? 
Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . 
Okay 
so so we keep all these all these buttons . 
Like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus or something . 
Or using the names and the keyboard <laugh> 
I dunno . 
You mean like hierarchical structure . 
Okay , so s 
Oh sorry . 
So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you  
Okay , 
so I'll make a note on L_C_D_ . 
Yeah . Like roller for the  
Yeah . Okay . 
So we are still s speaking about the common devices 
or we are inviting the new one ? 
On the screen , you mean ? 
Not on the control , but on the screen . 
Well , this would avoid L_C_D_ , then . 
Oh . 
W I I think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the T_V_ to to to print these things . 
Well it wi it will be still more expensive , but for the L_C_D_ and this stuff is no problem in the price . 
<laugh> Two T_V_s . 
Like ma 
We we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode . 
<laugh> Or I dunno . 
Or like children and grandfather's mode , 
and the , well the the user 
not the user , 
the man mana T_V_ manager mode <laugh> . 
Ah , I dunno . 
Uh . 
Yeah . 
Hide them , okay . 
Um . 
 Yes . 
<laugh> This I was thinking . Do we need a power button at all ? 
Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? 
Because generally  
Yes . 
Well I I uh 
<other> 
<laugh> 
You don't need to  every five minutes to keep it alive . 
Uh probably . 
Okay , so we should keep this button . 
Okay , 
so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff , 
we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are  you just turn on the T_V_ and if you close it , it will 
turn off the T_V_ . 
If if you like this , <other> 
Because , well   it's maybe question for you t 
<other> 
Yeah . 
I mean like the  
Yeah but since we have the L_C_D_ , we didn't need too much button too many buttons . 
Um , okay , just um the decision of the power button . 
Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be  
Uh power button . 
If it if it's a button or  
Okay . 
Okay , one nice big button . 
Old fashioned button , to satisfy the grandmothers . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Do we still have the time ? 
I I just wonder . 
Okay . 
Oh . Well what w what was the question ? 
Yeah but since we want to control all the televisions , and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote , 
no ? 
Because if if the T_V_ turns on itself , it well you know , if the time The timer should be there . 
Ah , yeah . 
Did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the T_V_ , 
well  And based on your  
<other> 
Yeah 
but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote . 
 
Yes yes . 
Yeah but we we should be careful about the battery life , then . If we use the speech recognition . 
<other> Yeah .
