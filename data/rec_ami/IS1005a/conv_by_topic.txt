The  We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro . 
B:  Per unit , I guess . Y oh okay .

topic_description:	project budget_None


A:  Um , so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ? So , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea . Anything . 
B:  Okay . 
topic_description:	discussion_None


D:  Well , from experience , um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very  they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons , and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . Um and and normally you only every use , you know , on a T_V_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . Um . 
A:  Mm . 
B:  Oh . 
D:  So it's frustrated me in the past , th that . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


B:  Okay , I have also some points uh . Maybe two points . Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light <other> , so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light . And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . So something like this . 
A:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


B:  And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh  there are two buttons for volume control . But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Ah , okay . Okay . 
B:  You know , some slider or  Not just two discrete buttons for volume , but something which  
A:  Okay . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Okay , n <other> 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Is that because the  of the discrete volume levels , or is that 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , but I can reach  In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume . 
A:   Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could   the the volume can go up very quickly and it can  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Ah , n . If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream  . 
A:  Yeah , also if y when you take the the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and 
B:  <other> Yeah , f It depends what what you feel about that . 
A:  you have a heart attack <other> . Okay . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , but if  you have some more notes on that . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  Yeah so you can  Do you have something ? 
C:  Uh I  Yeah , just a simple experience . I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune  . 
A:  Yeah , that's true . Yeah without obstacles and  . 
B:  Okay . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None
