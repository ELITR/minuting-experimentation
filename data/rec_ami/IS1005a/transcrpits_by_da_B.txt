Now what . 
Okay , 
so my name is Petre  . 
You can call me Petre  , or Peter if you like . 
I don't care  . 
Uh , in the project I'm supposed to be the technic . 
Bob , 
okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
So probably I would try to try to draw the animal . 
Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal ? 
I I th I think I should . 
Okay , so . 
Um <other> . 
Okay , American , um . Um . 
I would use the bird . 
So I tried to sketch it out . 
I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it , but ah . 
Can you recognise it <laugh> as a bird ? 
Okay <other> it's your turn to  
 
Oh it's okay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
I should get used to the tool , so . 
<laugh> Oh just wait  a little bit . 
C could we put it here , to make it as straight as possible ? 
<laugh> Ah probably not . 
Okay , it  it works like this . 
Are you left-handed ? 
Oh , pity <other> . 
Ah , it's maybe better if you leave it . 
 
You won't draw them , or ? 
<other> 
Just try . 
I would like to see how it looks like . 
<laugh> 
No , I think it's clear . 
It's okay . 
It's in it's indeed beautiful . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Bob . Have to remember it . 
Bob . 
Per unit , I guess . 
Y oh okay . 
Okay . 
Oh . 
Okay , I have also some points uh . 
Maybe two points . 
Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light <other> , 
so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light . 
And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . 
So something like this . 
And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh  there are two buttons for volume control . 
But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like . 
You know , some slider or  
Not just two discrete buttons for volume , 
but something which  
Yeah , but I can reach  In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume . 
Ah , n . 
If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream  . 
<other> Yeah , f It depends what what you feel about that . 
Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , 
but if  you have some more notes on that . 
Okay . 
Um . 
Okay , 
just a second .
