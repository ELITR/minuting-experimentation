Hi Kate . <laugh> 
Okay , carry on . 
<laugh> Alright um 
this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . 
Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting , 
I have  
the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . 
Um and we should each have a presentation to make . 
Um we have certain decisions to make 
and we have forty minutes total . 
It's twenty five after two at the moment , 
so forty minutes is five after three , 
<other> um which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . 
Okay . 
<other> Um there are the decisions we have to turn to , 
but we'll come back to them in a minute 
after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . 
Right um 
as we remember , I opened the meeting , 
the four of us were present , 
the meeting  the first meeting's minutes were reviewed 
and approved . 
Um Sarah , you presented a marketing research report 
um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition . 
And then Steph did a second presentation 
um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . 
I think all of us agreed with those things . 
Kate presented a working design of  going after  going over the basics on the whiteboard 
um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . 
Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries 
and having a docking place as a selling point . 
Um and the new requirements that it for  be for T_V_ only 
um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . Um <other> the corporate image . 
So 
we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . 
Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ , 
but it still should meet those parameters . 
Um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held . 
<other> Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . 
Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . 
Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . 
And I was to type up these minutes 
and work on the final report . 
Is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ? 
Okay . 
Right . So 
we're ready to close that 
and go back to our  That one . 
Right . 
We're up to the point of the  
Go back . 
Um <other> the three presentations . 
So we're going to pull the plug on me 
and turn to Sarah . 
Is that okay ? 
Is that alright with everybody else ? 
Especially since Kate asked to be last . <laugh> 
Sarah , I'm sorry if I misspelled your name , 
I didn't know whether it was S_A_R_A_ or <laugh> S_A_R_H_ . 
You respond to whatever you get , huh ? <laugh> 
Okay . 
Um , did you do your  Hit  
Ah , 
there it is . 
Ta-da . 
Mm 'kay . 
'Kay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Uh-huh mm . 
In most families , don't  isn't the remote  is a remote . 
Mm . 
Mm . Well 
actually some households do have three and four T_V_s 
and they would have a remote for each one , 
so . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
<other> 
Are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product ? 
Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management 
and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product . 
Wo would that be agreeable ? 
Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next ? 
Okay , 
we'll move the  
Mm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Alright . 
Remember , 
we only have forty minutes 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Thank you , Kate . 
Yes . 
There we go . 
<other> Do it again . 
Keep doing it until you get it in both  
you get it there , 
you get it yours without that one , 
and then you get it with both . 
Yeah . 
This time it should come up both . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Huh . 
It's a selection wheel . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Or call it a or call it a banana 
and have it in yellow . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm 'kay . 
I wanna thank you all for all your presentations . 
We have about ten minutes left , 
in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . 
Um and I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together . 
Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things . 
So <other> 
let's  
Mm . Right . 
They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , 
which  the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar . 
Um this is where Kate's expertise comes in , 
and our decision making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point . 
The  
You were saying that the kinetic would be useful , 
that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it 
um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . Um 
or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it . 
That's the day you wanna use the T_V_ . 
Um so what's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ? 
Okay . 
Mm 'kay . 
What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ? 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible . 
It costs . <laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish , thanks . 
Um <laugh> the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision . 
Oh . 
Okay . 
What about the ca 
yeah . 
Oh , 
the way we  
uh-huh . 
Oh , okay . 
Um what about the case ? 
I think they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber , 
and I think we've discussed not having titanium . 
One , it's too expensive , 
um and second , it won't do this double um curves . 
Um we've sort of eliminated wood . 
We said plastic or rubber . 
What's the pleasure ? 
What about you ? 
Cover . 
Plastic inside . 
Hmm . 
Okay . 
Um the next part they want is the user interface concept . 
I'm sorry to push you , 
but we only have a couple minutes to <laugh> finish with . 
Okay , 
and it says interface . What type and what supplements ? 
Okay , um 
<other> that's that . 
Um this is gonna sound weird , 
but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . 
Whew . 
And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , 
you can look and see this as well as I can . 
Marketing they want product evaluation . 
Oh . 
Oh my , I'm sorry . 
Oh , okay . 
Sorry about that . 
missed that one . 
This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work . 
Ah , ta-da . 
Ah . 
Yes , 
because I can't even see mine . 
Next meeting starts in thirty minutes , 
these are <laugh> the individual actions . 
Yeah , right . 
Um the look and feel design is for Kate , 
uh Steph gets the user interface design , 
you get product <other> evaluation . 
Um the two of you <laugh> get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype . 
Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way . 
<other> Anything else we need to do ? 
Go to it . <laugh> 
And that's the end of this meeting . 
That's for her benefit . <laugh>
