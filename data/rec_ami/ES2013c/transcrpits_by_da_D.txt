<laugh> <other> I respond to either . 
No worries . 
Okay , 
first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up , 
which was uh current cost of the competition devices , 
similar to the ones that Stephanie uh showed us 
and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros , depending on uh branding . 
Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end . 
But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for , we're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market . 
But I'm going to move on to more interesting um <other> more vibrant things . 
<other> So , 
I investigated the remote control market in greater detail , 
and my uh  the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch . 
And <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<other> I know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research , 
so you know , 
I'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here . 
What's hot , 
fruit and veg . Spongy . 
And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . <other> 
This is really interesting change from past years , 
because it is much more organic , 
um some would say approachable . 
<other> And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . 
So . <other> 
I also did a little research 
on um <other> what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . 
Fancy . 
Functional is out . 
And f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , I'm I'm thinking polished , elegant , <other> you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . 
This is twice as important as the next finding , 
which is technologically innovative . 
This is interesting , 
'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , 
but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically <other> superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances . 
Ease of use . Again , pretty low , 
I mean it's the top three , 
but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . 
So 
I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of <laugh> fruit <laugh> fruit themed sleeves . 
<other> Y yeah , you know  
Exactly . <other> Exactly . 
I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress .  you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy . 
They could be  ini 
initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear . 
Um it could actually  the sleeve could <other> take up a lot of the <laugh> development 
and the remote control , we'd just need to get reductionist on it . <other> 
They could be interchangeable , 
they're spongy , 
that goes back to ergonomic , 
and the youngsters love 'em , 
fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own . 
So what we're talking about is changing . this concept . 
Everyone has a T_V_ remote , 
but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit . 
<laugh> That's what's hot on the catwalks . <other> 
So , 
this is my  
This is what I'm thinking . 
Y yeah , 
but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it  
we all need a remote , 
but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the  someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
W and <other> plus I think  
<other> Uh yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . So 
this is an idea 
and I I  
you know , 
this is exactly what the research has uh has shown . 
So I really open this up to uh any other feedback . This <other> spongy fruit and veg . 
Thanks . 
<other> Alright . 
<other> I I just have my ear to the market , guys .   
Is spongiest , yeah . 
That would add  
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
They are 
and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority , 
which is fancy . 
I think many of us would associate those with fancy . 
Something else we could do is uh call it something that's fruit and veg oriented . 
We could call it uh  <other> The name . 
<other> Well 
it would be uh a a very simple product 
that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . So  
<other> That , you know , that might be  
And then we could keep it titanium . 
Yeah . 
Or s or smelly . Scratchy 
Uh well 
I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone . 
It's hot on the streets , guys . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> <laugh> <other> 
<other> 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
That sounds good . 
Any idea  <other> you 
you mentioned that there would be a cost difference . 
Um do you have any idea if if this could  if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ? 
Hmm . 
Because , you know what , I'm being quite serious when I say that that um the things I mentioned are hot . 
But I think the important thing might be to choose one . 
You know , if if what you're telling me is is um some of these things aren't just f aren't feasible , maybe we could something about naming , 
we could call it , you know , Blackberry . 
That's uh  
<other> Alright , 
well 
let's see then . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But  yeah , 
I'm trying to streamline mine a little bit . 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Thank you , Kate . 
Mm . 
Oh 
I think um Florence resolved it by 
F_ eight again . 
Maybe . 
<other> 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
It's a duplication . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
 
<other> To uh m make it . 
Oh 
nice . 
Um  Hmm . 
Mm . 
Wow . 
<other> Do you think with um  
<other> It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic , 
perhaps the  something reminiscent of the child's remote . 
Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? And have it abstract . 
You know , 
we could call <other> like a fruit name , 
but it would be a little more abstract . 
Mm-hmm . 
I'm just just throwing out ideas . 
Yeah . 
I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Nice . Good point . 
I've used kinetic in terms of watches 
and it's very very uh handy , 
you don't even notice um that it's there . 
It's  
Mm-hmm . 
It could tie in with the fanciful design 
as 
uh , you know , <laugh> 
throw the banana , you know , just gotta keep it moving . 
Be 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
But I could market that as a um as a <other> a  I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know . 
Mm-hmm . You know , 
kind of the  
That's exactly what I was thinking . I'm sold . 
Mm . 
Kind of like an internal egg . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
And with sports on television . 
You know . <other> 
I su 
Then I'll just say I support either  from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that . 
No we can't , actually . 
That's why I was looking over your shoulder 
Mm . 
Sounds good . 
<laugh> That's really all I got , guys .
