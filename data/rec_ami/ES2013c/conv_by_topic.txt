A:  Hi Kate . <laugh> Okay , carry on . <laugh> 


A:  Alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting , I have  the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . Um and we should each have a presentation to make . Um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . It's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , <other> um which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . Okay . 
B:  Just just carry on . <laugh> 
A:  <other> Um there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . Right um as we remember , I opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting  the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved . Um Sarah , you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition . And then Steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . I think all of us agreed with those things . Kate presented a working design of  going after  going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . Um and the new requirements that it for  be for T_V_ only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . Um <other> the corporate image . So we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ , but it still should meet those parameters . Um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held . <other> Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . And I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report . Is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ? 
C:  Yeah . Yes . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Okay . Right . So we're ready to close that and go back to our  That one . Right . We're up to the point of the  Go back . Um <other> the three presentations . So we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to Sarah . Is that okay ? 
C:  Yep . 
B:  Mm-hmm . <laugh> 
A:  Is that alright with everybody else ? Especially since Kate asked to be last . <laugh> 


A:  Sarah , I'm sorry if I misspelled your name , I didn't know whether it was S_A_R_A_ or <laugh> S_A_R_H_ . 
D:  <laugh> <other> I respond to either . No worries . 
A:  You respond to whatever you get , huh ? <laugh> Okay . Um , did you do your  Hit  
C:  Yeah ,  
A:  Ah , there it is . 


A:  Ta-da . 
D:  Okay , first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up , which was uh current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that Stephanie uh showed us and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros , depending on uh branding . Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end . But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for , we're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market . But I'm going to move on to more interesting um <other> more vibrant things . 
C:  Right . 
A:  Mm 'kay . 


B:  W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit , because I think it would give you um  maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do . 
C:  <other> Yeah , maybe . Or  
A:  Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next ? 
C:  I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next . 
A:  Okay , we'll move the  
C:  Um  
B:  <cough> 




B:  <other> Right , well I I I think some of this um  you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you , but I'm afraid this is the real world . <other> So um 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , but I'm not sure that it's quite what you want um . Now this isn't a very good overhead , but this is just to show you , this is the innards of a remote control um . 
B:  This is this is the a a <other> a remote that's been opened up and that's the the back of the interface . 
A:  Mm . Mm . 
B:  And this is a push-button one , so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here . Um <other> and we  that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate . We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver . 
D:  <other> 
B:  So um I wan I wanna go through not not just addressing the um <other> uh the the points that you made , Sarah , but um <other> doing my presentation in the order I wrote it . 
B:  So , thank you . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  That sounds good . 


C:  Shall we wait 'til I've 'til I've showed you what  well , <laugh> my extensive presentation <laugh> on what sort of interfaces are available . 
B:  <cough> 
D:  Yeah . Mm . 
B:  Yep . 
D:  Thank you , Kate . 
A:  Thank you , Kate . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though . So <laugh> so mine's a bit pointless . Right . <other> 
B:  <cough> 
C:  F_N_ and F_ eight , did you say ? 
A:  Yes . 
B:  <cough> 
A:  There we go . 
C:  I don't have it on mine though . 
B:  <cough> 
D:  Oh I think um Florence resolved it by 
B:  I If you do F_ uh F_N_ F_ eight again , it's  it'll  
A:  <other> Do it again . 
D:  F_ eight again . 
A:  Keep doing it until you get it in both  you get it there , you get it yours without that one , and then you get it with both . 
B:  I think it  yeah , you you will do an  
C:  Should I do it again ? 
D:  Maybe . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <other> 
A:  This time it should come up both . 


C:  <cough> Right then . I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says , just 
A:  Okay . 
C:  that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , uh 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , 
A:  Mm . 
C:  um what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece . 
C:  Uh <other> then  
D:  <other> To uh m make it . 
C:  If  I don't think I can get it up on the screen . Ah here we go . Right . 
D:  Oh nice . 
D:  Do you think with um  
A:  <other> 
D:  <other> It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the  something reminiscent of the child's remote . Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? And have it abstract . You know , we could call <other> like a fruit name , but it would be a little more abstract . 
C:  Possibly . Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . Mm . We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather  if you feel  if you like the spongy  
C:  That also is possible . 
D:  Mm-hmm . I'm just just throwing out ideas . 
C:  Just  
A:  Or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow . 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so  
A:  Okay . 
B:  <other> Yeah . 


A:  I wanna thank you all for all your presentations . We have about ten minutes left , in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . Um and I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together . Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things . So <other> let's  Mm . Right . 


D:  You know . <other> I su 
A:  Um the next part they want is the user interface concept . I'm sorry to push you , but we only have a couple minutes to <laugh> finish with . 
B:  I should I should r  
D:  Then I'll just say I support either  from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that . 


A:  Okay , um <other> that's that . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  No we can't , actually 
C:  No , it's still it's still 
A:  Um this is gonna sound weird , but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Whew . And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as I can . Marketing they want product evaluation . 


A:  Oh . Oh my , I'm sorry . 
C:  plugged in on mine actually . 
D:  . That's why I was looking over your shoulder 
A:  Oh , okay . Sorry about that . missed that one . This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work . Ah , ta-da . 
C:  Now it's gone again . 
B:  <cough> 
A:  Ah . 


B:  You know , I think the the company's s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately . <other> 
A:  Yes , because I can't even see mine . 


A:  Next meeting starts in thirty minutes , these are <laugh> the individual actions . Yeah , right . Um the look and feel design is for Kate , uh Steph gets the user interface design , you get product <other> evaluation . Um the two of you <laugh> get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype . Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way . <other> Anything else we need to do ? 
C:  Oh yes . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  Great . 
D:  Sounds good . 
C:  <other> I don't think so . 
A:  Go to it . <laugh> 
C:  Play-Doh . 
A:  And that's the end of this meeting . That's for her benefit . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> That's really all I got , guys . 
B:  <laugh>
