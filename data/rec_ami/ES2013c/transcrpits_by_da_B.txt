Just just carry on . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . <laugh> 
<laugh> Sorry . <laugh> 
I'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on <laugh>  . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
<laugh> <other> I think that's a good idea . 
Don't you ? <laugh> 
Yeah , 
I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this . 
Spongy is gonna be difficult , I'm afraid . 
Yeah , I mean basically 
we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . 
I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , 
yeah . 
I was thinking titanium myself . 
Yeah . <other> 
W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit , 
because I think it would give you um  maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do . 
<cough> 
<other> Right , well 
I I I think some of this um  
you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you , 
but I'm afraid this is the real world . <other> 
So um 
I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , 
and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , 
who have told me what's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , 
but I'm not sure that it's quite what you want 
um . Now 
this isn't a very good overhead , 
but this is just to show you , 
this is the innards of a remote control um . 
I really need a pen or something 
but uh  
does my mouse work ? 
No . 
Um  oh 
yeah , 
can you see my little mouse pointer ? 
Right . 
This is this is the a a <other> a remote that's been opened up 
and that's the the back of the interface . 
And this is a push-button one , 
so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons 
that go through onto the the board at the back 
and they push these buttons here . 
Um <other> and we  
that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate . 
We got to have something that pushes the little buttons 
that um talk to the chip 
that encodes the message 
that sends the the message to the receiver . 
So um 
I wan I wanna go through not not just addressing the um <other> uh the the points that you made , Sarah , 
but um <other> doing my presentation in the order I wrote it . 
<laugh> So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source . 
Um we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment . 
We can have a hand  <laugh> 
sorry  
a wind-up , yeah , 
<laugh> which I think is quite an interesting concept for a  <laugh> sorry  for a remote control , 
but i it maybe is  doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg . 
<other> <laugh> Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , 
where um <other> you you actually get the energy by moving the device , 
which is quite a ni a nice and neat one . 
You have to  
it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work , 
but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then , 
it'll work . 
Or we we had talked about solar power , 
but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark . 
Now 
I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case . 
It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , <laugh> or titanium . 
Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber , 
but um <other> I'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium , 
and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , 
but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that . 
Okay , 
what does the interface look like ? 
Um well 
push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with . <other> 
Um we can have scroll buttons 
and the the scroll button can incorporate a push , 
so you can have it like on a mouse 
where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that 
and push to select something . 
<other> Um you can have multiple scroll buttons , 
um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , 
but um it's it  the technology is there . 
And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote , 
but this will increase the cost . <cough> <other> 
Um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , 
and the price goes up as we choose each of this . 
If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . 
All the other fancy interface designs go out the window , I'm afraid . 
Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . 
If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , 
but it  that's what you need if you want the L_C_D_ display . 
And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . 
Now 
I don't know what that is , 
but I think they think it's quite important 
and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . 
Um ou our real expertise is in push buttons , I have to say , 
but maybe you think that's old technology . <other> 
And  well 
I I think we've got two options . 
We can either go for a really cheap model , 
keep all of the costs down , 
um which <other> means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . 
Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , 
I think it , um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple , 
but um that <laugh> may or may not be a good thing . 
<laugh> Sorry . 
<laugh> Um <other> but it could have an L_C_D_ screen 
and it could have multiple scroll buttons , 
and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker . <other> 
So , 
thank you . 
<other> Yeah , 
I'm afraid I don't have that information available . 
Um manufacturing didn't actually give  attach any prices to any of this , I'm afraid . 
<other> Yeah mm-hmm . 
<other> Banana ? 
We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one , 
which would allow um say a banana , 
but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , 
we can't do anything fancier . 
<cough> 
Yep . 
<cough> 
<cough> 
<cough> 
I If you do F_ uh F_N_ F_ eight again , it's  it'll  
I think it  yeah , you you will do an  
<other> 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea . 
It's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , 
we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately . 
<cough> 
<other> And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea , 
'cause um <other> otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting  building the L_C_D_ in , but for the electronics as well . 
There is that . 
Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ? 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Right . 
Yeah . 
I think I think that's a g nice clean design , 
it's playing to our strengths 
which are in push button technology . 
Yeah . 
But we can implement it with simple push buttons , 
which is much cheaper . 
In fact  
Oh 
that's really nice . <laugh> 
Hmm . 
Mm . We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather  if you feel  if you like the spongy  
Hmm . 
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<cough> 
Mm . 
Oh 
unfortunately I don't have costing information . 
I i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , 
but I'm sorry 
I don't figures on the difference in cost . 
And and how much you do have to keep it moving , 
'cause I'm conscious that watching T_V_ can be quite a sed sedentary activity . 
<other> Yeah . <laugh> 
True , yeah , 
m more more environmentally friendly . 
<other> Oh right , okay , 
I'd  
that that's something I maybe should have covered . 
Um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique 
um and I would certainly recommend it , I think , 
because I'm not sure I have an alternative . 
I i it it's just the way that the the the uh th the way it's ac it's actually built 
and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper . 
<cough> 
Well 
if if Sarah's keen on a spongy feel , 
the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls , 
so it's  
yeah . 
Yeah . 
I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible , 
but I agree , it's uh  sounds like a nice idea if it is . 
<laugh> 
I should I should r  
Which I think technically is just push button 
and uh I'd certainly support that that 
that brings the cost down quite a lot 
and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on . 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
You know , 
I think the the company's s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately . <other> 
<laugh>
