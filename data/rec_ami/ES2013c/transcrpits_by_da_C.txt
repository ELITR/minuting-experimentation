Yeah . 
Yes . 
Yep . 
Yeah ,  
Right . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yes . 
<laugh> <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<cough> <laugh> 
<laugh> So when your dad's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we're gonna watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we're gonna watch this . 
 
Yep . 
<other> And as for as for um well budgeting as well , if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components . 
<laugh> Is this  to the market  ? 
I was thinking titanium , 
I was thinking it's just  
I have been influenced by pictures of iPods , 
and they're also minimalist and shiny . 
Yeah , 
but it's kind of pointless , 
isn't it ? 
Yeah . 
Let's delegate . <laugh> 
<other> Yeah , maybe . 
Or  
I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next . 
Um  
<laugh> You can even have them in different flavours as well . <other> 
So that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour , 
yeah . Scratch and sniff . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> A wind-up . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company , 
so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it . 
But um 
I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company . 
It's just what I'd understood we'd be doing . 
That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise . 
Shall we wait 'til I've 'til I've showed you what  well , <laugh> my extensive presentation <laugh> on what sort of interfaces are available . 
You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though . 
So <laugh> so mine's a bit pointless . 
Right . <other> 
F_N_ and F_ eight , did you say ? 
I don't have it on mine though . 
Should I do it again ? 
<cough> Right then . 
I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says , 
just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , 
which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . 
Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , 
um what functions we actually need , 
and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece . 
<other> Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel , 
which  
Well , 
I couldn't find a  
the picture of the iPod w only linked to a web browser , 
so I couldn't copy and paste it , 
but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . 
It has uh scroll wheels without without a display , 
but they they scroll like a computer mouse . 
So I was thinking that uh <other> um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um 
and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . 
Like I guess an existing Sky or cable one does . 
Like , you know , 
you press enter 
and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , 
and you can do  
you can scroll along 
and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour , 
and you scroll up 
and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen . 
Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , 
um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , 
but still quite simple and quite cost effective . 
So 
what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , 
I was thinking , yellow and black , 
just because that's the company's colours , 
with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , <other> just small along the bottom 
instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive . 
And when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you , 
it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching . 
And so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down . 
And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . 
I mean titanium would be great , 
but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . 
If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too futuristic . 
Yeah . 
Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else . 
Uh <other> then  
And it's a little bit pointless as well I think . 
Like 
when when when you've got when you've got the screen there , it doesn't have to be anything fancy , 
just a little menu showing  
yeah , 
a menu , you go into one menu 
and then it can have your different options , whether you wanna change the settings or the you know , your information about programme that's on at the moment . 
I don't think that's to taxing to uh s engineer . <laugh> Um . 
But as for actually arranging them  let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one . 
And I quite like it , 
'cause it's just smooth and hand-held 
and it's got these easily reachable buttons 
that quite nicely uh spaced out , 
so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . Up , down , left , right . 
I I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , 
but you know , a  <other> 
I can't quite d uh describe it . 
 you see on the one on the right , down at the bottom , is the mouse . 
Yeah , 
see where the mouse is , 
like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . And enter in the middle , 
so you pick your menu and then  your different options 
and when when you click on each one , it  you can go into a new menu for that . 
I'm getting a bit uh specific here . 
Really we'd have to use something to show you , 
but  
If  
I don't think I can get it up on the screen . 
Ah here we go . 
Right . 
Well , 
the iPod spinning wheel is uh really complicated . 
It does scroll , 
but it is hugely complicated . 
What else have we got ? 
Them , they're terrible . 
But they all have this this feature of this uh  It's not quite a scroll wheel , but it's a kind of selection in this circle , 
which I think is a really good idea . 
Yeah , 
like up , down , left and right . 
Which is good . 
And then and then  
Yeah , so I mean 
either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , <other> uh and then also <other> when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down . 
So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle . 
And that's it . 
<laugh> Look at look at this one . 
<laugh> Almost impossible to misplace or l or lose . 
Might take up your whole living room . 
Possibly . 
Yeah . 
That also is possible . 
Just  
Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention 
is have you have you seen these on a remote ? 
This is actually the volume up and down , 
but <other> they both say V_ on them , 
which , when you first look at it , <other> you expect that to be the down , 
because it looks like a downward pointing arrow , 
but it's actually the V_ to indicate that it's the volume , 
so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these . 
But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down . 
If we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions . 
But then , that's complicated . 
It sounds great . 
I've never come across it before , 
but it sounds fantastic . 
Sounds like it could be g a really good economical  
it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient . 
Yeah . 
'Cause it's really a quite attractive thought , 
isn't it ? 
It's like  
yeah , 
a good selling point . 
But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs . 
<laugh> Do your exercises while you're watching the T_V_ . <laugh> 
Yeah , that's what I was thinking as well . 
<laugh> 
Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy Yeah , s thick spongy cover , 
so it feels like the whole thing's spongy , 
but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it . <laugh> 
Because I mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac 
Yeah . 
Well 
you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile , 
you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them , 
and  
Just copy the one on the left . <laugh> 
No 
um a scroll  
Well , 
like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen . 
Yeah , 
I'd  like push buttons with  
So 
push buttons  
No , 
it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually . 
Now it's gone again . 
Oh yes . 
Great . 
<other> I don't think so . 
Play-Doh .
