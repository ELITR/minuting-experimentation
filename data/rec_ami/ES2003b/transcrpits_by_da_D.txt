<other> How did  where did  
where did you get all your in information  ? 
Oh . 
Ah , okay . 
Yeah . 
Uh , I was still working on stuff , 
I hadn't got it finished . 
Um , <other> alright . 
Click to save in  
where do I have to save it ? 
<other> Um , what I've done with it , 
I'm sorry . 
Shit . 
Um <other>  
I'm just  closing it now . 
 where I've saved it . 
 that's it there , 
yeah . 
Oh right . <other> 
Uh , right 
I'm responsible for working design , 
uh , this is basically the inside going on of the the uh remote control . 
So we have the energy source , 
we have the user interface , 
this this is what I've seen . 
Uh the sender will push the button , 
the chip will respond , 
uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the T_V_ . 
So uh uh , 
if you go to next slide , 
you'll see you'll see uh what do we need on the user interface . 
Do we need uh many buttons , 
or do we need l many light bulbs 
that could be easier to uh to realise which appliances are on or not . 
Um , <other> , or would that take too much power , 
would we need more um components in there to supply the power ? 
Um , the joystick is another thing , 
if we were gonna add that , um , there'd be more components to deal with that . 
Um <other> , so uh 
we need to  
I dunno exactly what  
That's the design of the the the layout of the uh electronic design , 
um obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface . 
So , 
that'll be decided , I guess . 
<other> Uh , and the next slide . 
Oh , yeah  Um , 
if you go to the next slide then . 
I just used the <laugh> 
it was a mess , 
uh I was just putting adding it together at the end there . Uh  
Uh so 
you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip , 
and the user interface obviously contains everything . 
You have the switch turn it on , 
infrared bulb , uh will contact the T_V_ 
and will have whatever device or D_V_D_ player , the bulb will turn on to say it's on . 
Uh , so 
do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs , 
would it be easier ? 
Um , I dunno what we should decide on that . 
No , 
it's finished , yeah . 
Cost . Mm . 
L_C_D_ on the remote just telling you what's on , or <other> uh , interactive L_C_D_ or  
Do you think that people will get mixed up , 
like , 
they'll be looking at this screen and that screen 
and then , you know , trying to get everything working , 
would it be a bit confusing ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah <laugh> 
<cough> 
We're just saying volume . 
Should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ? 
Yep . 
I 
Yeah , think so . 
Light bulb as well , 
no ? 
And a light bulb ? 
No . 
To flash . 
No . 
Nah , 
you'd see it anyway , if you hear it . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
So 
I should just look at um the speaker ,  the speaker and an L_E_D_ . 
And  
Yeah , 
and a transmitter . 
P 
Fashion . 
The slogan is  
yeah , 
the slogan's we put the fashion in electronics , 
isn't it ? 
'S also look cool .
