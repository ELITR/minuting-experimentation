Just put it on the deskt  desktop . 
Project documents , 
yeah . 
What's your username ? 
What's your username and password ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Sorry . 
Okay . 
There we go . 
'Kay . 
Sure . 
Um , sh would you like to <other> 
I'll just do it from here . 
Um , try second one maybe . 
Try it , 
yeah maybe . 
Yeah . Okay . 
Oh , I thought I put in my last name , 
I guess not , 
but  . 
Okay . <other> 
Oh yeah , that'd be fine , that'd be great . 
Okay . 
Functional requirement by me Ebenezer . <other> 
Okay , so um 
we did some research , 
we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . 
We asked some uh open ended questions , 
just , what are your opinions on the remote control , 
got a lot of re responses , 
and we asked some very specific questions , 
and we got a lot of good feedback . 
Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people , 
so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there's only maybe ten people <other> fifteen people in each group . 
Okay . 
<other> So 
we got  
some the bad stuff we got , 
remotes are often lost . 
I often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , 
and even if it's not lost permanently , it takes me a few minutes to find it . 
<other> Most buttons are not used any more , 
like you said , teletext is outdated now . 
I remember trying to load a D_V_D_ player recently , 
and there were so many buttons , 
it took me I don't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button , 
'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons , 
you know 
there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses . 
And if they do , not very often . 
Takes too long to master the remote control . 
I've seen some remote controls that are big , 
they have a lot of buttons , 
you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , 
they're just not great to use . 
We just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls , 
people do not like remote controls . 
Some of the good stuff we got . 
Between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . 
Now don't get excited yet , 
I've got more to say on that . 
Most people'd be willing to pay for that 
um most people want remote controls to be pretty , 
they want it to be fancy , 
th they they want it to be different , 
everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button , 
not everybody wants that . <cough> <other> 
Finally , my opinion . 
The voice recognition thing is cool . 
And uh voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . 
It's a bit sketchy at some times , uh , you're not gonna get good always accurate results , 
but for a very fixed number of words , 
you know 
you have , 
how many different words can you have for a remote control , 
up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven , 
you know , 
how many , 
you can't have that many words . 
For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . 
I'm pretty sure people would buy it . 
But after a while people may wanna return it , 
because <laugh> if you have to to say som 
I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , 
and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . 
Using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , 
and that's for flickering through channels . 
So if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that 
and they may return it . 
<other> However , <other> oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , 
there's no need to spend money on research and development , 
but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , 
which is an unusual feature in my opinion . 
But if we do have the voice recognition thing , there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . 
See , you could  
there're two options . 
Either you have voice recognition by itself , 
which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , 
or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you , it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . 
So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . 
But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , 
because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , 
it it could be as fancy as you want it to be , 
you know , 
it could be like a lollipop or something like that , something weird like that . 
As long as the voice recognition stuff works , that's that's fine . 
So 
we have the three birds , 
we have the design , 
that <other> 
we have the the fancy bit , 
right , 
the voice recognition's fancy , 
it's cool , 
it's different , 
it's radical , 
so , 
and then we have an extra bit 
I don't remember <laugh> 
so 
I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote , 
but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , 
I think is a big question . 
Um , will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote , 
'cause I think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user , 
but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait , 
are you willing to have a bad remote control . 
<other> And uh what if you have visitors come round , 
they stay the night , 
they wanna use the T_V_ , they can't use the remote 
because they speak differently to you . 
Um , how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that . 
Uh , will people return the remote control , 
<other> I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , 
you know , so , 
do our audience have the money , 
but would they return it after a while 
because it's not as fast as pressing a button , 
it's not a practical . 
So . 
These are things I think we should consider . 
I think it's cool , 
I'm sorry ? 
Sure . 
I'm about to end , yeah . 
I think it's cool 
but there are definitely some considerations . 
So , 
yeah . 
There was uh a website , uh , 
right here . 
Mm . 
Well like 
if you go to one , uh whichever one you were working  
yeah , 
and you just click file save as . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
'Kay . 
Mm . 
I uh  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Sure 
but the idea of a remote with a menu or  and a joystick I think like I h if I was in the habit of buying remote controls then I would want one , 
but I think we don't have a specific audience , 
you know , 
like what is our target audience , 
what niche are  niche are we trying to market and corner . 
You know , 
you know what I'm saying , 
like , 
for whom is this intended ? 
Everybody ? 
Most people , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Sure . I think that's fair <other> yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
<other> Yeah . 
Hmm . Okay , specifically television . 
So the joystick is just for differentness . 
Okay . 
Mm . <other> 
Mm-hmm . 
It's just , the way I figure it , twelve point five Euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million or something like that , 
not to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys , 
you know , like 
if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it , then we have to sell a lot of remote controls . 
We just  
Is this gonna be enough to to sell ? 
Yeah . 
I had one of those , 
and my brother , and my dad , could have beat me up 
because it it went off all the time accidentally . 
The clapping one . <other> 
To a television . <other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that's a good idea . 
<other> I think so , yeah . 
But we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most . 
Um , power is used like once per hour , 
channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour , 
that's by far the biggest one , 
and then teletext , is still here , 
that's like fourteen , 
and volume selection . 
No , 
yeah , 
okay okay . 
Yeah , um <other>  
Mm-hmm . 
Um , I think because it's so small 
it might be an 
uh I mean if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that  
Yeah . 
Speaker <other> 
yeah . 
W 
those little key-rings have both , 
so  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Well 
I can give you the frequency , what people what options people use most often , 
I guess that's gonna be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface , 
right . 
You want the stuff  . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Sure . Sure . 
Mm . 
Sure . 'Kay . Yeah .
