No 
on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link . 
A 
well 
actually just there . 
Yeah . That's it . 
If you dump it in there . 
Your username . 
Okay . 
Excellent . 
Right . 
Hopefully that's us ready to uh to go . 
So . 
Functional design meeting . 
We'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff . Um 
we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . 
Not a lot thankfully to say . 
We introduced ourselves , 
discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well . 
Um it's come to my attention the following . 
Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . 
Remote control should only be used for the T_V_ . Um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues . 
Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , 
um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . 
Um . Now . 
Just to say quickly uh I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required . 
Um or at l its functionality would have been of limited use . 
So 
to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . 
Um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so . 
Um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going . 
Um I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first , 
to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go . 
So um 
I'll just load up your presentation from here if you want . 
Yep . 
Sorry . 
Uh . Is yours the  
Oh 
sorry . 
Okay , right . 
Uh if you  
that's all right . 
If you  
do you want me to just cycle through it for you or ? 
Yeah ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yep . 
Okay , yep . 
Mm-hmm . If you could uh 
sor 
if you could speed it up a bit , yeah . 
If you could uh speed it up a bit please , yeah . 
Sorry . 
Cool . 
Okay . Excellent . 
Right . Um . 
Hear from the <other> User Interface Designer now I think might be an idea . 
Um , you've got your presentation now , 
is it on the  
is it ? 
Okay . 
<other> Technical functions ? 
No . Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . Yeah . 
Right . Um , 
if we could hear from our Industrial engineer , or Designer . 
If you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder , or project documents . 
If you save it in there we can open it up from here . 
Are you finding it okay 
or ? 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Oh . 
Yeah . 
Ah , 
don't worry about it at all mate . <laugh> 
Okay . Well . 
Oh sorry , 
I'm I'm interrupting you . 
Are you  is it  
yeah ? 
Okay . Right . Um , <other> right 
we can probably skip that for now . 
So , 
we've had some stuff put forward , um 
along with the new user requirements , 
um we've had a lot of kind of input I'd say so far . Um 
I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about <other> um voice activated control . 
However I've got a couple of worries about that . <other> 
The power required , um and the ability to the cost , it seems like for uh an embedded system , this could cause us issues . 
Um for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via uh via voice , 
I_B_M_ do um drag and dictate , 
but these require a lot of memory 
and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements . 
Um voice activation could be an interesting idea 
but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible . 
Um that's just my view right now , 
however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far , 
it's almost like having a small 
T_ not T_V_ to say , 
but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take , 
but it might be quite low ? 
Well 
literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a <other> a mobile phone , 
something where you can read an an um fair amount of information , 
traverse maybe quite a few menus , 
if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example , 
they usually incorporate they have the keypad , 
and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around . 
That could be one possibility . 
Um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels  
We  
<other> I would agree with you . 
Mm-hmm . <other> 
That would be my feeling as well , 
I think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface . 
Um now I mean 
I don't  
sorry , 
go for it . 
<other> I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile . 
And that might be just another way of saying try to target most people . 
Um , if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be s you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose . 
But that does cover a very large section of the people out there . 
Um , I mean 
I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality . 
Which maybe doesn't get used as often , 
maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it . 
Um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , 
it depends , 
I mean 
maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , 
that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined . 
So like 
we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control . 
So that literally anybody can come along , pick up the remote and still know what do do . 
And they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the the T_V_ 
and who would normally use the unit . 
I dunno . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well 
this is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid , 
this isn't one that I've just arbitrarily decided on . 
So um 
this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed , for now . 
So 
I can understand your point , 
and I would agree with you , 
but this is our design spec for now . 
'Fraid to say . 
Um  
I would say so , yes , 
because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes , 
and that is a separate unit . 
Um I think that it  
I would say that the design spec we've been  with is for the television only for now . 
And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that . 
Okay . 
Maybe we'll hear differently , 
but for now  
It would be ease of manipulation of certain functions , yes . Um  
There is that possibility , yes . 
B 
However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that , 
but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert , 
that might be sales , 
who are not in this meeting . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well , 
something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote , 
which as you said you've done , 
in fact we've probably all done . 
Um , I don't know if it's a gimmick or not , 
but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings 
where if you whistle , it will beep and you  tell you where it is . 
Um . Well 
the other option of course is that um the 
well  
I was going to say clapping , um  
Um digital telephones , uh for example , one unit has  
of course you have to have that base unit , 
somewhere where there's a button , 
but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_ . 
Something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit . 
And that could be something could um separate us a bit . 
And that way , because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T_V_ , 
again say what , it would be a small transmitter , um watch battery type scenario I would say , 
or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um I don't  power  
that might be something that we could look into . 
Yep . 
Yeah , 
it's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there , 
so I mean 
that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well . 
So . 
To go on from here . 
Um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote . 
Before we leave this meeting , it would be best to say this is what we're going  
this is the design we're gonna try and get , 
this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique . 
Do we go for maybe a remote contro 
uh sorry , 
we're gonna go for a remote control obviously , 
do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , 
and then , what , another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_ . 
We could use say the left and right for changing channels 
and the up and down for volume , 
and  
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Vol Volume selection okay , yep , 
the teletext we're gambling with , 
and we're gonna say it's dead , the way of the dodo  
So we  
well , 
sorry , 
we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , L_C_D_ , 
and then what 
maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system , 
and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ? 
So we're having very very few buttons involved , 
but navigation around a menu for most things . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
So um 
we're actually that sounds like a rough idea . 
Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ? 
<other> Do you mind looking  ? 
The ability to locate it again . 
So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_ , 
just so that it says find me , 
and <other> what , a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit , 
can maybe hide it in the base . 
Sorry ? 
Some speaker , 
sorry , 
yeah . 
Um  
<other> E us 
we might be better with the sound possibly  
we could maybe incorporate 
th e the true fact , considering the cost of an L_E_D_ , we could just incorporate it anyway . 
The L_E_D_s can be surprisingly bright now . 
Um . <laugh> So 
by the sounds of it , with what we're suggesting so far , your design um the user interface is still quite open , 
you could go for quite an interesting design . 
Because we're only going to have a very few key 
and you've got 
you know a small L_C_D_ , joystick , 
e 
I think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes , 
something that can make it stand out slightly . 
Um if you could look into what we've suggested so far , the feasibility of um small transmitter , um and such , maybe if an L_C_D_ screen requires too much power , or such . 
Ebenezer , um , Marketing Expert  
If , 
yeah 
if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken , 
where of a joystick to control the very basic functions , 
and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile . 
I don't know how easy that will be within the time frame , 
but could be something we could maybe look into . 
Okay . 
Um any last comments that anybody would like to put forward ? 
Anything that they think has been missed out . 
Bit of a wide open question there of course . 
Feel free to email me if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible . 
Right . 
Speaker and L_E_D_ for locating , um , 
transmitter  
 getting the external power source , 
yep , that's quite true . 
Um , and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well I'd say . 
The electronics could be s either placed externally or internally , 
makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control , 
so that's good . 
'Kay . 
Oh , 
one thing that we've almost not talked about at all , 
my apologies for that , 
um , user interface , we also need to maybe get the slogan in here , 
um it's , 
I'm pointing at my laptop , 
what in God  
Real reaction , and such . 
So um  
Oh , sorry . 
My apologies . 
No 
it could well be , 
I've probably missed that . 
Um , I think that's l almost the last minute thing 
we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top . 
So I'm not too concerned a that we haven't gone into depth about that . 
But it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes ? 
In fact we might like to put a slogan on , 
and um possibly the two R_s to signify the company . Rather than real reaction . 
Sounds good . 
And I'd say that that's us for now . 
Okay .
