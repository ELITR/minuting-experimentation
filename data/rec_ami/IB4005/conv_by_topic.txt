A:  Uh I guess I start with my presentation . We had two groups of people working on this . So we'll show you two slightly different presentations . Feel free to ask any questions or comments , obviously . Um the first one was done by myself , Bruno , Marianne and Nikos . 
A:  Um so I guess that's pretty much it for our proposal . Um I don't know if you want Andre to go through his first or if you have any questions for me . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
A:  Unfortunately , we haven't been given as much space as we would have liked , but that's always the case . <laugh> 
B:  Mm-hmm . <other> That's always the case . Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Mm . 
A:  <other> So  
C:  Yeah . Um well , uh I can think of some reactions from the people wi so maybe I can  Well , r 
B:  Alright . 
A:  Well , do you want to do your presentation and  
B:  Okay . 
A:  Okay . So  
C:  Yeah , well , tell me about some of the constraints and  Well , first of all I must say that there are also quite a lot of common points , so um it's probably not going to be very difficult to  Yeah , please . Thanks . Perfect . 
topic_description:	room designation presentation


A:  Um , just to go back , most people are grouped in projects . And we have two fifty per cent people who are half time in Geneva , half time at the E_P_F_L_ in Lausanne . And they m them we've put in three person offices , so that in the three person offices it's not constantly three people . So there's a little bit of give there . And the reading room , or the lounge as some people call it , that we have is in a central position . So basically we've got Andre and Nancy at the top . Um they don't actu they will be starting a new project together , if um if I'm not mistaken . Like I said , Susan and Maggie in the individual offices . Nikos and Yalina , who work on the same project , at the bottom . The reading room is in the middle . Um , Marianne and Bruno are at the bottom . Um , as well , Marianne works closely with Pierrette and the other Marianne . We have two Mariannes in our department . And David is a half time . So as I said , the half times are in the three person offices . And on the other side we have Maria , Martin and myself , who all work on the same project . And Martin is fifty per cent . Um Gisella , we've given her two person office for two reasons , one is because there's a spare place there , so if we want to put a stagieur or someone who just comes in for short period of time , we figured it was okay if they were in the admin office which is a little bit noisy , because they're only there for a short period of time . Um , and again the proximity to the other offices . 
topic_description:	arrangement of people in space


A:  And the rationale that we have , I'll show you the layout in a second , was that full professors would get private offices . Administration is close to the professors offices , so it's easier for the secretary to speak to everyone . The fax is in the administration office , since it's mostly used by Gisella , who's the secretary . For noise reduction purposes we've moved everyone who has office hours together , and we've also put the network printer and the photocopier in the hall . Um , so I'll just show you how that works . Basically , you can see Gisella sort of there in the middle with the fax machine , and Maggie and Susan , who are the two full professors in our department have the private offices . And the photocopier and the printer are sort of in the hall on the side there across from mailboxes . 
B:  Okay . Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	physical layout of space


B:  So you sa so Pierrette is a professor , but she's only she's only fifty per cent time . Is that why she's in a three person office ? 
D:  Yes . Yeah , Martin . 
A:  She's  It's  Do you wanna explain how it it works or  
C:  Uh , actually Martin is fifty per cent time . Yeah . 
D:  Mar 
B:  Uh-huh . 
A:  Martin is fifty per cent . 
topic_description:	personal/work schedules


A:  Pierrette , there's two sort of statutes of professor . I guess you could say where there's  
C:  No ? Oh , because you would say that she's an assistant professor or something like that . Oh , okay . Yeah . But um  yeah , maybe that's   
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Ah . 
B:  I see . 
A:  There's a professeur d'ecole and the  
C:  Yeah , there are full professors and assistant professors , if you want . And , yeah , it's true that she's an assistant professor , but uh <other> well , we see , maybe we can move a little bit around just to give her uh , well , also at least , maybe not a uh an office alone , but at least with just one person , not two . We'll see . 
D:  Yeah , ho 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Mm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  But the idea is Maggie and Susan are sort of the senior 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  um professors on staff so they got the the individual offices . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	professional rank/status


B:  <cough> And what what's happening  what what do you foresee happening in the next couple of years , like beyond this m b beyond this current group of people , do we do we know of any changes coming ? Is the department growing ? Or is it is it going to be  
A:  Um the department will obviously be growing , but there are some people who only work part time , there's some people who are doing P_H_D_s or master students , who won't necessarily be there for a larger extent of time . So for example , Yalina and the Finnish Marianne are master students for right now , so whether they decide to stay and do a P_H_D_ , we're not sure yet . Um , Nikos is working um as a researcher . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
A:  So for him it's the same thing . There's  I think the only constant people are Susan , Maggie , Andre , um Gisella , Pierrette , um and all the rest are either P_H_D_ students or master students . And again Martin and David are half time with the E_P_F_L_ , so that's project dependent as well . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	personal/work schedules


B:  And have you have you talked to th any of these people to ask them if they have any special requirements ? 
A:  Um , Susan wanted a private office , she has a preference for private offices . Other than that , no one really had any tight constraints from what I've heard . 
B:  Oh . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Of people they needed to be near or people they would  needed to avoid or anything like that . <laugh> Okay . Okay . Alright . But you've given people chance to say that if they really needed to ? Okay , good . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> No one's explicitly said that they needed to avoid anyone else . Um  Yeah yeah yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	arrangement of people in space


D:  But you  no specific uh views for mountains or old town or  I mean people prefer any windows . 
A:  No , they were fine with it , so  
D:  Oh . Oh . 
A:  And they're both nice views . <laugh> 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah , I guess those thin lines , or I mean they're windows or  Okay . 
A:  Yeah , they're windows , yeah . Or sorry , the thick lines are windows actually . We have fairly big windows in the room , yeah . So there's lots of light coming in . 
D:  Oh oh k okay oh 'kay  . <laugh> 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  And one of the reasons for putting the reading room where it was is that you have a lot of light coming in , so if people just go somewhere to sort of relax and 
D:  Hmm . 
A:  have a quiet place to sips sit , they have a lot of light and  
B:  It says mountains . Is that because that's the view . Yeah ? So it's the best view . You gave the reading room the best view ? Mm-hmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
A:  Yeah yeah . 
D:  Yeah yeah . Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , well I mean it depends if you like looking out over the old town and the cathedral . That sort of goes both ways , but , yeah , we've got two mountain views , sort of on that side , that side , and then the last part looks on the old town . Because we're on the sixth floor , you can actually see everything , 'cause I don't think buildings are much higher than  was it , six or eight floors ? 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> Yeah yeah . 
B:  Okay . Oh , two mountain views . Oh , and that's old town . 
D:  Yeah . And then one of old town . 
B:  Okay . Okay . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah , no , mountains are just in the far so , that's not  
B:  No , okay . What's that purple thing there ? 
A:  Yeah . The purple thing is the mailboxes . And those are fixed , we can't do anything about those . 
B:  Oh , okay . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Oh . 
topic_description:	physical layout of space


D:  So you can't do any partitions ? I mean , you plan to do any partitions in three p person rooms or like this kind of blocks ? 
A:  Um , r We don't have anything like that . If we can get stuff like that , it might be a good idea . Some people might like them . At the moment we have people thre sharing like three people in a room , without any partitions and 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , just three desks , yeah . 
A:  it's a little bit noisy , but people sort of get used to it and admittedly it's mostly assistants that are stuck in rooms like that , so it's junior people , but  
D:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	cubicles/splitting rooms


C:  So um , yeah , actually we um  Well , basically the the group who produced this uh proposal is made by Susan , Martin , David and uh and myself . And we also  
C:  Yeah , so uh I think , yeah , these are the three main points . So one is the place of the lounge . Uh , the other one is the uh the place of the admin office with Gisella . And the third one is the number of visitor  visiting people and uh , well , how many of them we want to accommodate and where where we put it . These , I think , are the three main differences . Otherwise , we pretty much agree on uh on placing people . 
topic_description:	room designation presentation


C:  well , Susan volunteered to ask Maggie and Pierrette about how they they felt about sharing offices , and  . So , as you can see , well um Susan gets obviously the same office , which is quite a good thing . Um , then things started move a bit . It looks like I'm also in the same position . 
topic_description:	arrangement of people in space


C:  But the most obvious constraints that uh we we found here was that it was probably very difficult to have a lounge uh just a lounge in one room , because it would block us two full working places . And although it's true that the group , I agree , decided to to had  to have a lounge , we propose to put the lounge uh in the room at the the upper side on on the right . Uh , so let two people share this with uh sort of a , yeah , a place where we have a sofa maybe and uh and some books . So it's obviously a calm place . People are not there to talk very loud , but they can sit and relax , and uh still look at at the mountains . Um , also  So that's one of the main differences , I think , maybe one of the points that we have to talk about . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	types/purposes of rooms


C:  It's true that this blocks one of the one person rooms , but uh on the other hand , uh Maggie has no objection uh sharing an office with her assistant . And this appeared to be true also of Pierrette . We don't know about Pierrette sharing an office with two persons , but at least no problem in Pierrette sharing her office with uh Marianne , the the Swedish one , who is sort of her assistant . Um so this is why we , yeah , we put Maggie with with Bruno . 
topic_description:	arrangement of people in space


C:  Uh the other one is the admin office . So it's  Gisella fifty per cent because she's only half time , and uh the fax machine . Um Gisella actually has a lot of phone calls to make and uh it's true that her activity is quite noisy when she's there . Um , it's also true that she has quite a lot of files for most of the the projects actually that we manage , so it appeared , at least to well to our group , that even if she's here only half time , she should have an office by her own because it would be quite disturbing for other people to to work in the the same office . Uh Gisella has has no objection against sharing the office . We thought it was more for the the calm of the the people . 
topic_description:	admin


C:  And then the third main difference uh would be the the number of visitor places or free places . Uh you notice a new name in the room uh at the centre upper upper side . So that's Paola . It's true that it's someone coming next year , Susan reminded me this uh  of this point , and I could not really ignore it . Uh , so um that she's an Italic , she will arrive in about two month . And the two uh , vis one and vis two , are the visitor places . You had one , I think , called free space or spare spare place . 
D:   
A:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
C:  Um we didn't really reach a very good agreement on the distribution of these two rooms . So the the two at the centre , uh where is written Paola , Yalina , the two visitors and then Maria plus David . So I think there is quite a lot of space here to uh switch a little bit among the people , just to make some kind of smooth occupancy rate , so not to have one empty room when we have no visitors , um and uh then a very full room when everybody is is here . So I think we're we are quite willing to split and put say maybe one visitor with Maria and David uh fifty per cent in the other room with the second visitor , so that it smooth is . 
A:  Mm-hmm . But realistically we don't actually have that many visitors coming in . I've been here for almost two years , and we've had a couple of stagieurs , but that's it . 
C:  Well , yeah , exactly so the visitors are uh basically stagieur and it happens that sometimes we have two of them even if it's only for three or four month . Martin seemed to insist that when we have a visiting professor , for instance , we cannot really put him with Gisella , because , well they wouldn't feel very nice , they they made a joke about that . 
A:  No , for a professor , yeah , but  
D:  Mm . 
C:  So we should manage some kind of decent space . It's true that these one or two  last one or two years we didn't have uh a visiting professor . But um  
topic_description:	visitors


topic_description:	arrangement of people in space


A:  Oh , in a way , if that's your argumentation , then put a visiting person with a senior 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  researcher , at least , if not a professor , rather than two students . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Um sorry ? I I didn't understand . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> If you're gonna argue that the visitors are supposed to be important and they should have their own space , then put them with another researcher , rather than two students . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah , that's that's true , I think , yeah , they are are quite open to to this . Martin also reminded us that he is quite noisy . He has a lot of uh phone calls to make , even if it's here if he's here only fifty per cent of the time . Um , so yeah , I I I don't mind this , but uh that's something  But it's true , yeah , we could also try to put a visitor and the professor . 
D:  <other> 
B:  Hmm . 
topic_description:	visitors


C:  Um , Martin made another point . It was the fact that sometimes professor have to  professors have to discuss sensitive matters about projects and financing , and they sometimes might feel uncomfortable discussing this with their  well , in the presence of their P_H_D_ students . Like saying , oh I I have to reduce her t from eighty per cent to fifty per cent . That's probably something  So I I mean , all these are constraints . I don't know how how you would like us to proceed from from here , or if you already have questions or reactions on this one . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh-uh . Mm . 
topic_description:	sharing with assistants


D:  But how often the lounge is used , um  People uses on regular basis  daily basis or  
A:  Fairly regularly there's at least one or two people in there . I mean it's a  Yeah . It's a fairly new thing in the department , but it's being used pretty regularly or something that a lot of people wanted , just sort of quiet space out of your office that doesn't have the office furniture , the office chairs , it sort of has comfortable sofas and armchairs and things like that , where you can just go and relax , and  or if you wanna read something for a longer period of time in a more comfortable environment . And because we do a lot of reading and things like that , it does get used fairly often . 
D:  Oh . Yeah . 
B:  In the lounge , yeah . 
D:  Okay . Hmm .  
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
B:  So it's not a place for discussion . And it's it's it's a quiet place . Yeah . 
A:  We sort of have an open policy where if there's no one in there and you want to have a discussion , then that's fine , but you can't displace people who are in there reading , just because you want to have a mini-meeting or whatever . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  Mm I see . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah , well , it was actually this pressure from from my group that led to this , to squeeze a little bit uh the place of the lounge . Now , how for instance would the university feel about a room that would be only used as a lounge ? Would they feel it's too empty and that we have too much space ? Or w is there no problem ? The  <other> Do do you see a problem with having a l a room just for a lounge or no ? 
B:  So I d mm , you know  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . <other> 
D:  Hmm . 
B:  Mm . Well , maybe if it if it helps us pack more people into the offices , because they have a private lounge . maybe it's a good thing . Saves us money . <laugh> But uh  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . Hmm . Yeah . 
C:  So we could have a separate room as a lounge as long as uh we pack the other offices . 
D:  <other> 
B:  Uh yeah , I guess that's  Let's see , what is that ? 
C:  Mm . Personally I I have no problem with this . So um that's that's fine . 
A:  Mm . 
D:  Mm . 
B:   
A:  I mean , suppose if the need really arises and it comes to a point where we do have a lot of people , then you can get rid of the lounge , figure out what to do with the furniture , either distribute it between various offices or put it into storage somewhere . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Mm yeah . But you're saying it does get used . So you've it's it's not a completely experimental concept . Your your department has a lounge and it gets used a lot . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  No no no . No , this is something that <other>  it started off sort of as a discussion at the coffee table , where people were complaining that sort of in the middle of the afternoon they just wanted somewhere to go off and 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Oh . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  no have some quiet time and  That's where it came from . 
D:  So you have some  Oh . 
D:  Yeah , you mean you can display some new journals or a new proceedings and  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  So it's just  Yeah yeah , and people can come w in with their stuff or leave a newspaper or a magazine lying around for other people . We've got a bulletin board where you can paste up articles that you think are b interesting for other people , but  
C:  Yeah , yeah , exactly . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  <other> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Okay , so I think maybe we can agree on on the lounge in a separate room if we can manage to to find space elsewhere . 
topic_description:	types/purposes of rooms


B:  And <other> so i there's no  are you planning some kind of partition between the lounge and the offices or ar How are you gonna keep those things  I think should ask the question to you , how are you gonna keep them separate ? 'Cause it seems like 
D:  Yes . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Yeah um  
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Well  Mm-hmm . Yeah , we  Yeah , that's true , that's one of the problems . Um , well we were told that it was not really possible to build walls , but we noticed that this room actually has two doors . So uh we thought that maybe we could put some kind of , well , separation . I Yeah , maybe just , yeah , furniture or just uh some kind of screen . 
B:  fairly separate functions . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  <other> Book-cases or something or  Yeah . 
D:  Mm yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
C:   
B:  But it won't be uh an acoustic separation ? 
C:  No , it's not sound-proof . <laugh> 
B:  So if if the  Those are students there ? So if they're noisy , that could disrupt the quiet of the lounge . Um , 
A:  Yeah , they're  Yeah . Which is sort of why in our proposal we had it completely as a separate room . So if you really want peace and quiet , you shut the door and when the doors are shut , like unless someone's making noise right outside the door , it really is fairly quiet . 
B:  but  
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  As a separate room . Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
topic_description:	cubicles/splitting rooms


B:  But you've also put the lounge in a a very k kind of a high-traffic area where the mailboxes are , the printer and the restrooms . So that's um  
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  That may also  tha that may be good for meeting people and bumping into people , but it's maybe against the idea if it's a very  supposed to be an isolated quiet spot . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	physical layout of space


D:  So you have some books also like ? Mm hmm  
A:  There are bookshelves in there , but it's not really a library , 'cause everyone  At the moment , everyone has a bookshelf in their office and we just go in and borrow books from everyone else . It's more really about having a comfortable place to sit um where it's not an office environment , it doesn't look anything like an office . 
D:  Oh , okay . Hmm . Oh . Yeah . 
topic_description:	furniture/equipment


C:  What about Gisella , how do you feel about putting her in a separate office ? 
A:  I d 
topic_description:	arrangement of people in space


C:  Which is the case now I think . Well she has an extra  Yeah . With a visitor space , yeah . Mm-hmm . 
A:  Well she shares an office , so  Which is why we were thinking that it wouldn't be a problem to s keep her with a spare person , because that's the w the situation it is right now , and if you're a stagieur and you're coming , and you don't necessarily expect to have a full-blown office , if you are only there for about two months . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah , it depends on what kind of visitor you are exactly . So we could say some kind of low key visitor . This is uh very nice . Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	visitors


D:  You mean these fifty per cents , <other> I mean , they're all separate or  
C:  Actually , Gisella fifty per cent means that she's there half time , uh generally in the mornings . 
D:  <other> Yeah . Okay . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Gisella has a fixed schedule for when she's there , but David and Martin are sort of  they f it fluctuates . Like they can't say that they'll be there Monday , Tuesday and half of Wednesday , and not the rest of the time , which is part of the problem . I mean , <other> they can't s specify when exactly they'll be there . So our rationale for putting them in a three person room is is that it doesn't matter when they're there and whether they're there for certain hours or not . It's just either there's two or three people in those rooms , and sometimes there's less , sometimes there's more , because we also don't work fixed hours . It's not like we work , you know , nine to five or whatever . Everyone sort of keeps their own hours . 
D:  Yeah , okay . Yeah . I mean , they don't  Okay . Yeah yeah . Yeah okay . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	personal/work schedules


B:  So , can you just summarize briefly the differences between your two proposals , the key differences ? Uh sh shared 
C:  Um , I think it's what I tried to to do before , it's the shared lounge , uh th 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , the shared lounge , the the assistants with their professors . 
C:  Um  
B:  In two cases . Yeah ? 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  And then <other> secretary has separate room . 
C:  Do you have assistants with professors ? 
A:  We have Pierrette and Marianne in the same  
C:  Yeah . No , I think this is quite accepted and it's a bit the case . No , I think it's uh the lounge uh the admin room  
B:  Oh okay . So that's okay . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , okay 'cause  
B:  So  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , okay . 
B:  T_V_ at  The lounge , the admin room separate . Not shared . 
C:  An 
D:   
C:  Yeah , and the number of slots for visitors and for this new student who arrives , because having just one spare place , this was probably the strongest disagreement in my group . People said uh we should have at least two or three spare places , just for , you know , growing or sometimes you have three interns that arrive . So even if they are not perfect places . Um  
A:  Yeah . For visitors . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Mm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . <other> Okay , so you basically achieve that by giving less space to the reading room , I think . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah . Right . 
C:  Yeah , that's yeah , that's how we did in in our proposal , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh . 
C:  So that  I I think I mean if we need to reach a solution now , I I wouldn't mind working from your plan , and doing some changes . Or if you prefer working from mine and doing other changes . 
A:  Sure . Either way . 
C:   So um  
C:  Okay , so let's keep the reading room . 
B:  Well , 
C:  Um  
B:  it's good in case I ever have to defend it . You know , it's good to have some numbers , if you can come up with some numbers uh  
C:  <other> 
A:  Mm sure , yeah , we can do that . 
B:  Some  And maybe uh relative to some other comparable departments . That's  It's it's good to have that . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Mm 'kay . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  But if you both agree with this plan and you think your group will be happy , then uh fine with me . I don't know about you , what do you think ? Yeah ? <cough> 
A:  Sure . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah , it's fine . <laugh> 
A:  Okay . So I'll save that . Yeah . 
C:  Perfect , just save it <laugh> please . Maybe it's another name . Just say okay , it's fine . Okay . 
A:  Okay . 
topic_description:	discussion


B:  So I guess what  One of the questions is how important is the reading room to your group really ? Is it is it something that's a very valued thing that has to be protected , um , or is it okay to l make it be kind of this spare space that gets used up a little bit when you need  when you have some extra visitors or things like that . I think that's  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  I think , because it's a fairly new thing , it's a little hard to say at this point . I think that most people like it , now that it's there , they sort of see the value of it and they wouldn't want to see it wiped out entirely , definitely . 
B:  <other> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Mm yeah . Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  But I suppose once it  if it gets eaten away a little bit , at one  some point it becomes unuseful , and then  Yeah . So it  
A:  <other> 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  And that's the danger is  
C:  Yeah , mm-hmm . 
B:  <other> Mm yeah . 
C:  But then we need to squeeze in in one of the three person rooms some extra visitor space and uh  I I think so . If if we want to keep the reading room . Uh I think it's possible by playing a little bit with the furniture . 
D:  N d 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Hmm . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Um , so yeah .

A:  Okay well , since this one's up , keep this one in . Easily , go ahead . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm-hmm 
C:  Okay , yeah . Depends how how easy you can write in it . <laugh> 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues


C:  I think another point here , and I don't know how you you feel about it , is , well , the fact that Martin is  said he would be quite noisy fifty per cent of the time . So many phone calls . So I wouldn't put him in that big office , even if he's fifty per cent , but he's still a professor here and we got him from E_P_F_L_ . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	personal/work schedules


C:  Uh also I think Pierrette Pierrette and Martin p should deserve at least I think offices with one person , not with two . 
A:  . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Double rooms . Mm 'kay . 
C:  Uh  
D:  Maybe can you combine both , or like in two person room , Pierrette too ? 
A:  Pierrette and Martin ? 
D:  Yeah , Martin is fifty per cent . 
C:  Yeah . We we never asked them , it could be , but um on the other side they have , I think , no real project in common , so I wonder  
D:  Maybe   Okay . 
C:  Whe I I think I would prefer , and probably my group would prefer , to see them with the respective assistants , and I think Pierrette plus Marianne is a very good combination . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Why not switching them from , yeah , that office ? Yeah , switch the whole group . Yeah , Marianne Swedish , and then Pierrette . 
A:  Here ? Out  
B:  So what does that mean , Swedish um  
A:  There's two Mariannes , one is Swedish , one is Finnish . So we just call them the Swedish and the Finnish . 
C:  Because there are two Mariannes . 
D:  Yeah  . One is finishing . <laugh> 
B:  Oh , I see . <laugh> Okay . <laugh> Okay . 
C:  And both family names start with S_ T_ A_ . 
A:  Oops . 
D:  Oh . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Oh . Okay . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  No . No , not true . The  just S_ . Yes . 
A:  <other> No , both start with S_ but  
B:  Just S_ , uh so just to know who they are , okay . 
A:  Uh , it was Bruno , right ? Yeah . Mm 'kay . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Now let's do something with Martin too . Um  
D:  But then you can create on more spared place in that big three piece room , no   
A:  In here ? 
D:  Yeah , somewhere .  fifty per cent . 
C:  Yeah , maybe we can write it down , say vis vis one . David is fifty per cent and visitor one should  Yeah , or spare or  It's fine . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Gisella   
A:  Well for m Martin  If you didn't mind working with Martin , we can switch Nancy and Martin here . 
C:  Yeah , mm-hmm . I think that's closer to what I said . 
A:  Oops . 
C:  Well , because actually we have this project in common . You know , call I_M_ two . 
A:  Yeah . Ah . Wrong keyboard . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  I've heard of that . <laugh> 
A:  <other> <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Um yeah , I think it's  And so d could we um  
C:  Yeah , we could , yeah , even put  
A:  Well you can move Maggie and Bruno 
C:  We couldn't put Maggie and Bruno together . That's obviously the case . 
A:  into this room . Move Gisella , move the other spare place to the big room , but then there's not a lot of people in there . 
C:  Mm-hmm . No , let's leave it like this for the moment . 
C:  Or we could get that office for you and Nancy and put Nikos and uh Yalina with Maria and a visitor ? What about that ? Wouldn't you like to have a calmer spot ? <laugh> 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Sure . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Um , so you want to do  
B:  Mm . 
A:  That's gonna back-fire on me . 
topic_description:	arrangement of people in space


A:  So we can say that this is sort of for  But then again you get the more formal visitor in with a bunch of students in a crowded room . 
C:  Mm-hmm . <other> Well , I think , yeah , always Gisella , but I think there is no way to uh  
A:  Well , you can say that this one is for let's say stagieurs or interns . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Yeah , sort of second uh  
D:  Yeah yeah yeah . 
A:  Um  
C:  Um , yeah . 
D:  But then you can move administration to the single room . The k Because she's only fifty per cent working and 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  and she will  
C:  So you would put Gisella in a one person room ? Yeah ? Yeah . 
A:  <other> 
D:  Oh yeah . Yeah , and give that room to f some professor with a student or from  for visitor with the visiting place or  
C:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	visitors


C:  How do you feel , because your office  well , three persons and you are all full time in there , so you with Nancy and Maria ? 
A:  We're not terribly noisy , I think it'll be fine . 
C:  Uh-huh . Yeah and you have Parmenides in common with Nancy . 
A:  Yeah . And I am too in common with Maria . And we work on slightly different schedules too , 'cause Maria and I tend to work earlier and Nancy tends to work later . So that shouldn't be a problem . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  And do you think we could put a visitor with Nikos and Yalina ? Because it's it's also  it's not very clear , you know , Yalina's  that we said in our meeting . Yalina's master thesis should be defended in a couple of months or something like that . So we don't really know what happens afterwards . So we could at least think it's sort of an open place . 
topic_description:	personal/work schedules


B:  So when you when you put four people in that office , does that mean you're planning on four desks ? You need space for four desks ? Yeah . 
A:  <other> Yeah . And that's the problem is that you either get smaller desks , 'cause the ones that we have now won't fit . 
B:  Do you know if it's possible . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , but a visitor actually uh doesn't have that much paper , so for instance maybe they don't need uh , well uh the place to put their files , you know , a smaller drawer . They just need a a desk and probably just one drawer under underneath . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm right . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . And so you can fit that , you think . 
A:  No . <other> 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  But you can't put three desks in the two person rooms . 
C:  Yeah , probably not . I think it wouldn't be uh  
topic_description:	furniture/equipment


C:  Yalina and maybe we could think of a visitor too here ? So that  
A:  I think it's gonna be too much . 
C:  Think so ? Because remember there is also this Paola arriving um on the new project . So , you know , Susan insisted that uh 
A:  Well , Maria is full-time . 
C:  we should be  And it it's al also it's not very clear <other> because Nikos and Yalina are  Well , Nikos is um research student , Yalina will finish her master thesis , so it's  Yeah , okay . Yeah , Paola or  Mm-hmm . 
A:  So just like that ? 
C:  Or maybe Paola will be able to choose . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah , I think that's quite okay . I don't know about any preference of Maggie being alone or with Bruno , or no ? 
A:  Okay . 
B:  No ? 
A:  I don't think she cares . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Um , David mentioned also that there should be some kind of gender balance . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  Uh I don't know if there is a strong constraint , but I think we are doing pretty well . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  You mean  <cough> Maybe you should break the wall between the men's room and the women's room . <laugh> Sorry . <laugh> 
C:  Well , so  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> I'm not sure that was what was meant , but  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> <other> No . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Actu Bruno did mention that he didn't want to be in a room with a lot of people , 'cause he did that before and he didn't really like it . So maybe  
D:  Oh mm . 
C:  Ha . 
A:  I don't know , I can switch with him , and we can put him and Nancy together . I don't mind , it doesn't really bother me . 
C:  Okay , that's fine if he mentioned this to you , that's quite nice . And okay , yeah , I'm with Martin . Not very balanced . 
A:  Okay . Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Well , the gender balancing , we have more women than men in our department anyways so  
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , that's why  Okay , if you don't mind me sharing the office with Martin , that's fine . Okay , yeah , that looks good . So <other> Agnes with Marianne and David . Yeah , so you have I_M_ two in common . That's nice and he is fifty per cent , so that means the office is not very crowded . Okay , the other one is a bit crowded , but that's okay . Gisel 
A:  No . Okay ? 
B:  Is your person to square meter ratio within the n university norms ? 
D:  Hmm . 
C:  Um I I think for the moment . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Good question . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Overall . 
C:  So this is true for Susan and Maggie , but not true here for Pierrette and and and Martin . So we can already argue that uh we're squeezing in even the the professors . It's true that the reading room  But you know we fought so much to have it , so let's uh let's try to have it there . And I think putting four people in a three person room is already a sign that uh we are already quite uh quite full , so um I think , yeah , it's normally the nominal capacity of this , I think , it's uh eighteen people . Um , eighteen or or seventeen . And we're only fifteen if you don't count Paola and some visitor's place . And I think it's quite important to have space for visitors , because if you have no visitors or if you cannot take a new , well , intern , during the summer , you're very much handicapped . So I think we're , yeah , on  Well , the reaction of my group was that this was almost full already , so I  well , we tried to  
B:  Mm right . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . So basically , we're moving into a new space , but it's 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  I thin 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  only marginally better than the old one . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Yeah , so I think , yeah , what we could say about the reading room is that we we squeeze quite a lot of people in in the other offices , so I think it's okay . 
B:  Mm bu Mm-hmm . Alright . 
topic_description:	arrangement of people in space


A:  Do you see any constraints from any administrative sides ? 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Mm . 
C:   
D:  But even like you can put mm Paola in administrate office like  
B:  Mm . 
D:  You're already three people . Mm , it looks like small room compared to the other three p

B:  <laugh> We don't we don't , I mean , we don't want people coming in seeing this lavish reading room and and and everyone having their own office if that's not what we are having in the other places . We have to make sure that um if for example there's a spare reading room , like we were saying before . Overall your department has  doesn't have excessive space per person . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . <laugh> K 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Well , what was said in in my group , actually Susan who knows professors from other um other faculties , well , she noticed that most of them have rooms alone . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	types/purposes of rooms


C:  So , my group also asked to circulate the final proposal just to make sure there is no major problem . 
A:  <other> The final copy . I'll circulate it to everyone , along with the numbers that you guys wanted to see in terms of the space . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
B:  <other> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Okay . 
C:  And the numbers . 
A:  Okay ?
