Okay . 
Well 
this is what me and Richard came up with . 
The default spot for the on-off button . 
The mute button just below that . 
Then there's the volume and channel selectors . 
Simple plus-minus button . 
Uh we thought of a help button . 
If you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen . 
Then there's the zero to  one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo . 
So it's rather simple prototype . 
And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it . 
Sure 
uh just pop in at any time . 
I think if you look at most controls , they've got more buttons than this . 
And well 
the on-off button , it's it's a necessity . 
You can't drop that one . 
The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those . 
The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice . 
So we could cancel that one . 
I think the help button really is necessary 
because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does . 
Well , <other> 
you can't leave out the number buttons I guess . 
And  <other> 
Yeah . 
So it's rather basic already . 
Yeah , 
they're  
It's rather hard to draw on the white-board . 
But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff . 
Just for recognition . 
So 
and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a a different colour than the case . 
So they jump out . 
And uh that's about it . 
Yep . 
Yes . 
<laugh> 
Yep . 
Yep . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yes . 
Uh that's that's a big cost . 
If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip . 
Which isn't the  the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic . 
So 
it's not even taken into the price . 
<other> We we could save money on it . 
But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ? 
My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message . 
So  
Yeah . 
The margin will get too small . Yeah . 
Ten . 
<laugh> 
No remote . <laugh> 
<other> That's  
We're getting closer . 
Yeah . 
You could just not scroll for a half a second . 
So you won't need a button . 
<laugh> 
If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes . 
Yep . 
Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button . 
Yeah . 
I think so . Yeah . 
<laugh> What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? Eight hundred eighty eight . <laugh> 
Yeah . Okay . 
No . 
<other> 
We could make two buttons out of that . 
And just um  If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel . 
So that would save two buttons . If you do the same for the channel . 
More obvious . 
So 
if we  
Yeah . 
So  
If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . 
And make it smaller overall . 
So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button 
you get a a much smaller remote . 
And it sh 
Yeah ? 
Yeah . 
Richard's argument was very good . Yeah . 
Yep . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<yawns> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Six . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Four or five . Yes . 
<yawns> 
<other> 
No . 
Mm , we haven't thought of that one . 
<other> 
<other> 
I think that's a three . 
<other> I still  I think it's too m too fancy . Too too flashy . 
Twendag sieven an twendag . 
Yeah . 
Yes . 
Yeah . That's true . 
Yeah , there w there was enough room , but the finance uh  
Yes . 
Yes , was okay . 
The tasks are very structured , 
so you can just do step by step 
and it's very easy . 
Well , 
the smart-board , the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass , 
but  The digital the digital pen is very nice . 
Yes . Yeah . 
A flip-over or a more precise uh digit 
Yes . 
No . Didn't work . 
Yes . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
<other> Considering we are not going to make a docking station . 
Perhaps . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<yawns> 
Okay . 
Okay .
