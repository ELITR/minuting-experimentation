A:  So  Hello . <laugh> 
D:  Good afternoon . Sorry I'm a little late . Got stuck in the traffic . 
A:  No problem . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay . <laugh> That's possible on uh this time of day . Starts at three o'clock . Uh  <laugh> Uh , let me see . Our fourth and last meeting . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  There he is . Yes . Okay this our last meeting . In this meeting we will discuss our final design . And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . And then we're going to close the project today as well . So after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  And this uh design , detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . Um , in order to do that we have this agenda . We'll have the prototype presentation first . Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria . <other> Then we will look at the finance . Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . Because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote . 
C:  <yawns> 
A:  But we will see that later . Then we will do the project uh evaluation , and the closing after that . We've got forty minutes . So we will be finished at half past three .

A:  But first um we will do the  this is prototype presentation . So , if some yeah if somebody wants step forward . 
C:  Okay . Well this is what me and Richard came up with . The default spot for the on-off button . The mute button just below that . Then there's the volume and channel selectors . Simple plus-minus button . Uh we thought of a help button . If you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen . Then there's the zero to  one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo . So it's rather simple prototype . And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it . 
A:  Okay . 
A:  Okay . So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ? 
C:  Yeah , they're  It's rather hard to draw on the white-board . But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff . Just for recognition . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah , it  
A:  Just n normal plain buttons . 
B:  Yeah yeah . Just to recognise it , so uh  
A:  Yeah . 'Kay . 
B:  Uh yeah and now we don't need uh LEDs or um  
A:  No . 
B:  Y uh s some uh remote controls uh do it also , but um uh because we use the little display we don't uh have to use it . Uh so  
A:  No . Yeah . Okay . 
C:  So and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a a different colour than the case . So they jump out . 
B:  Nay . 
A:  Yep . 
topic_description:	presentation of prototype(s)_None


D:  Um , <cough> is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ? 
B:  So  
C:  Sure uh just pop in at any time . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Um , when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page . 
B:  Uh , that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh  So um  You put it uh  you um came in uh page uh one hundred . Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons . And you  But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  S so uh the shifting uh button . Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext , and shifting uh down . So  
D:  Okay . Okay . Um  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . Uh but um I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple . Uh just a few buttons and large buttons . But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons . 
B:  Oh yeah ? 
A:  So I'm wondering if we if we neely  really need all of those buttons . 
B:  <other> 
C:  I think if you look at 
B:  <other> 
C:  most controls , they've got more buttons than this . And well the on-off button , it's it's a necessity . You can't drop that one . The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those . 
A:  That's right . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice . So we could cancel that one . I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does . 
B:  Yeah yeah . 
A:  Mm . 
B:  Uh , or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh  Yeah . But m Yeah . We disc discuss that already . But uh we think uh old people uh don't know that uh option . So uh they just put in uh put <other> press uh the button and uh  
A:  Long time . Yeah . If you put  Yeah . Okay . 
C:  Well , <other> you can't leave out the number buttons I guess . 
B:  And uh  
A:  Yeah . Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary . Okay . 
C:  And  <other> Yeah . So it's rather basic already . 
B:  Oh . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . Think so . That's what I pointed out earlier . If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yep . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  Okay . That's nice . Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . And I can tell you 
C:  And uh that's about it . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  If we see  I don't know if I've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see uh something wrong . 
C:  Which isn't the  the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic . 
A:  No . That's extra . <laugh> That's extra . That's right . 
C:  So it's not even taken into the price . 
D:  Maybe we should to a different supplier . 
A:  <laugh> That's an option . Poland . Something . <laugh> Polish supplier . Don't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th uh these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as well . 
D:  <laugh> <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  <other> We we could save money on it . But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ? 
B:   . 
D:  Yeah , that's what I'm wondering . <cough> 
C:  My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message . So  
A:  Yeah . That's a point . 
B:  <other> 
D:  Um  
B:  Are we gonna buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it ? So um  Yeah . We m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty or  Can't uh go um  
A:  Yep . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  No . 
D:  Well , since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . Especially since we have those nice features . 
B:  Nay . 
A:  Yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros . We don't have any more budget to develop it . Yeah . So  
C:  The margin will get too small . Yeah . 
B:  Is it impossible to  
A:  I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . If you just make it real simple . Because it saves it saves a lot of money . And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen , which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles . 
D:  True . True . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  And it's good for the innovative design as well . 
topic_description:	costing_None


A:  I counted two batteries . But maybe we can also use one . I don't know if it's possible . 
D:  Since it rechargeable . 
A:  It's rechargeable . That's right . 
B:  Yeah we can u just uh   
A:  Okay . That's two Euros off . <laugh> We need the advanced chip . So there's not much to uh 
B:  'Kay . <laugh> 
C:  Yep . 
A:  <other> to save there . <other> Here we have the single curves . Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro . Um , 
B:  Mm . 
A:  I don't know , but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . I think we have to keep that . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yes . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Then we have the case material supplements . It's plastic . It's the cheapest one we need . So that's uh not much to save either . But then the biggest costs are the buttons . So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low . Because you have to  we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . Um , 
B:  Okay . Yeah . 
A:  so if we  Let's fir first count the buttons we have now . Because I  <other> Sixteen . Nah , that will be even more then . Eighteen Euros . 
B:  Uh  Sixteen , I believe so . 
A:  So , 
B:  Uh seventeen . 
A:  seventeen . 
D:  Um  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh with the help button . 
A:  Okay , including the help ? Yeah . Uh seventeen . I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button 
C:  Yep . 
D:  Damn . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number 
B:   . 
C:  Yep . 
A:  long . That saves us uh one Euro already . 'Cause then we have got fifteen I think ? 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Wouldn't  Yeah . No . That wouldn't be an option . 
A:  Fifteen buttons . And this is  
D:  Uh , d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ? 
A:  No those are one , I think . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , think actually there're two buttons , aren't they ? 
B:  Where did uh  <other> Uh , it's just one button . But , um  Yeah . There were uh two uh for one big button . But they are uh more expensive than the small ones . Uh , yeah . So  
A:  Yeah but th it's not stated in this files . So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing 
B:  It's just a  . 
D:  Well I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button . 
A:  That's possibility as well . 
D:  That would cut the cost . 
A:  So  And it's good for the design as well . So you can make  Uh let's see . If you make this  <laugh> Looks a bit like uh a cross . <laugh> Plus . Min . 
B:  But I don't don't know if if it's cheaper . So uh , we've still got four buttons , but just um  So  
A:  Uh s yeah channel . Yeah w Yeah th I think they count uh the materials . 
B:  You got uh not not a butt button itself , but uh on the um  
A:  Yeah on the chip there . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . On the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons . So  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  That's right . That's right . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  But I think because we have the advanced chip <laugh> we can just count this as one button . But  No but I think  
B:  Yeah , but  
D:  <laugh> But , I think this really is four buttons anyhow . 
C:  Yes . 
A:  <other> Yeah . Maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros . Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use . I think they uh try t 
D:  Yes . 
C:  Uh that's that's a big cost . If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip . 
A:  That's right , but what's the big advantage of our remote then ? <laugh> 
D:  Only the docking station , I guess . 
A:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


B:  But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty . I don't think so . 
A:  It is . If you leave out the L_C_ display . And if you use less buttons . 
D:  It would be a be a pretty rigid one . 
B:  S Yeah . <other> 
A:  Say  Or you can take the single chip . 
D:  <cough> 
C:  Ten . 
B:  But , you can't use uh  
A:  There it is . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  But we want to make a  uh so uh uh fancy and a good uh  Yeah . 
A:  But then w Good looking . 
B:  Uh , wi with n Oh , with uh 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  attractive uh o options . So uh , you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty . So  
A:  I think it's uh difficult as well , but  
D:  Or b Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control . 
C:  No remote . <laugh> 
A:  Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . 
B:  Scroll-wheel's one . 
C:  <other> That's  
A:  Then w Because then we save ten buttons . Then we have five and one . And and see . If we have this one and we've got the advanced  
B:  No , it  Yeah . 
A:  W uh , we're getting close . <laugh> 
C:  We're getting closer . 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  But how does scroll-wheel work here ? 
A:  Then you will  Or maybe you can um scroll . If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display . Until you've got the right number , then you push it . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . 
A:  Alright . It's gotta scroll and push . Okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well . 
D:  Integrated scroll-wheel push-button . But  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  You could just not scroll for a half a second . 
A:  Yeah . That's right . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel . 
C:  So you won't need a button . 
D:  I think that would be like the end of our usability . 
A:  <laugh> But it would definitely crop cost , a lot . And we need the battery . 
B:  D yeah . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah , but  <cough> 
A:  <other> And the regular chip is not possible ? It has to be advanced ? 
C:  If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes . 
A:  It has to be advanced . Yeah . Okay . And we can save a Euro by a flat design . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  That's an option we can  Then we're almost there . 
C:  Yep . 
B:  Ja ja . 
C:  Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button . 
A:  Yeah . So if we  
B:  Yeah , or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah but I think that's  That is a big advantage , if we're  
B:  So  Yeah  Yeah it's a big advantage . But um , it's  
A:  But  Can we use  can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ? 
C:  I think so . Yeah . 
B:  Uh , yeah . 
D:  Well , think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight , and teletext disappears . But the subtitles stay there . 
A:  If you push it three times ? 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah .   But if you push the teletext button twice  
D:  I think that's the case on most  
C:  <laugh> What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? Eight hundred eighty eight . <laugh> 
B:  It's uh  One m uh one b uh , a few buttons . 
A:  Ah that's not really that  
D:  Well , that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click . 
C:  Yeah . Okay . 
D:  But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is . 
C:  No . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Holding a 
A:  No . 
D:  remote with <other> which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . 
C:  <other> 
D:  With only five buttons on it . And a scroll-wheel . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


A:  If you would erase these . Mm eraser ? And we put uh  Looks a bit odd maybe . <laugh> 
D:  That's a pretty big scroll wheel . 
A:  That is  <other> Something like that . Then , yeah . We've got the scroll-wheel . One , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  And these are two buttons then . 
C:  We could make two buttons out of that . And just um  If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  So that would save two buttons . If you do the same for the channel . 
A:  Yeah . That's really a good good idea , I think . And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed . 
C:  More obvious . 
A:  So we make one for the volume , one for the channel . Plus scroll . That's right . So we've got one , two , three . Yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want . 
C:  So if we  Yeah . So  
B:  Yeah . 
A:  That's m that's better . 
D:  So this is five buttons . 
C:  If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . And make it smaller overall . So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button 
A:  Y yeah . Mm yeah . Uh yeah , and then you can  
C:  you get a a much smaller remote . 
B:  Uh yeah . 
A:  That's right . 
C:  And it 
A:  So we can 
C:  sh 
A:  decrease this one to four buttons . 
C:  Yeah ? 
D:  Right now we have five . 
B:  But uh , you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one . Just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . It uh it's a bit uh  
A:  Yeah . That's no problem . Yeah . Yeah . It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made , I think . Single curved is really easy to just fill in . And cases come right out of the machine . And single curved you have to have a different uh different machine , than a flat one . 
D:  Mm . 
B:   . 
A:  I think this is a really easy one . Um , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? Freek , what do you think ? 
D:  Well , I still think we should go for the single curve design . But then again ,  
C:  Yeah . 
B:   . 
C:  Richard's argument was very good . Yeah . 
D:  all these changes are not really okay with me . But since 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Yep . <laugh> We have to cut costs . <laugh> Yeah . Yeah I'm ag 
D:  we just have to . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  I'd rather just go to the board and 
A:  Ask for more money . 
D:  get us to spend <laugh> eighteen dollars a a remote . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . I am agreeing with the usability . Yeah . 
D:  Or do some market research and see what the options are . 
A:  Yeah . But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one . Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more . So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . It will be necessary to have good help function , as well . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yep . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  So this is scroll . I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . <laugh> Before we went on to the to the whole design . 
D:  Yes . Definitely . <laugh> 
B:  The th 
A:  But  I'm glad we could make a bit . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  It's pretty different , if you saw the last one than <laugh> this one . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <cough> It's pretty different . 
topic_description:	presentation of prototype(s)_None


D:  But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote . This will really require a lot of marketing 
B:  No . 
A:  Yeah . It will . 
D:  to get this to sell . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <other> But um  
D:  'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff . This is not familiar for them . 
A:  No , but I think  
D:  So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them . 
A:  I think the most  
B:  But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios . Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels . So maybe it's uh  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  That's right . We can let l We can stick it out , a bit . Like a old old buttons . <laugh> Maybe that's recognisable for them as well . Yeah . That's a good one . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  So , I'm afraid we have to move on . And it's uh it's b uh less frightening , I think . If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and uh  But we will see . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  That's true . Might uh  might be confusing too . 
A:  Yeah . That's definitely right . 
D:  They'd be like , what ? Only five buttons ? 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  But very special , so uh  
A:  I would buy it . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . But you're not sixty . <laugh> 
A:  That's right . I would buy it if I was six . <laugh> No I don't know . What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ? No ? Uh , yes they are . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  No . <laugh> 
A:  No . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  But we can go on with the project evaluation . 
C:  <yawns> 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Let's see . I can sit down I think . We still have fifteen minutes left , so we're nice on schedule . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Um , the project process . 
D:  So um , I like set up all these criteria . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  And evaluation of the 
A:  Evaluation criteria . That's right . That was the the point I forgot . 
D:  thingy . <laugh> 
A:  I should  
C:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  There we are . Evaluation criteria . <laugh> Go ahead . We've got five minutes I think for those criteria . No we've got fifteen minutes but  
D:  Thank you . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Five more minutes ? Okay . 
A:  Uh yes . What ? 
D:  'Kay so I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . 
A:  Uh yeah . 
D:  Translated it into criteria , which would be these . Um , is the remote fancy ? The shape , look and feel . Innovative ? What new functions are there ? Uh , easy to use ? Uh , learnability is a very important factor here . Uh , is it functional ? Are there not too many functions uh among the functions ? And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? And the cost . The target group . Is the remote really for the group we're making it for ? And recognability . If our company is  If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? And  So we're supposed to evaluate it right now . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Let's see . Oh I have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here . 
A:  Yeah , that's because my pen failed to upload his data . <laugh> I tried to but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah ? <laugh> 
D:  Interesting . So  <cough> 
B:  Mm . 'Kay . 
D:  Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ? 
A:  I think it's fancy . 
C:  Six . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Uh six . Yeah . 
D:  We all go for six ? Good . 
A:  Six . 
D:  Um , is the design innovative ? 
A:  Very . <laugh> Subtitles , buttons . Yeah . Seven . Yeah . So we've got twenty cents for our docking station , huh ? <laugh> 
B:  Mm . Sh 
D:  I think so , with our L_C_D_ screen , docking station , scroll-buttons . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <other> 
D:  Seven ? 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Should be do-able . Is the design easy to use ? 
A:  Yeah . That's right . 
B:  Mm . Not really . 
A:  That's a bit dodgy . 
D:  Well  Would be for us . But  
B:  For old people I I  
A:  I would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five . 
C:  Four or five . Yes . 
B:  W Yeah . Four . 
D:  I'd go for four , too . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Is it functional ? 
D:  Is the design functional ? Um , do we have all functions that we want to include ? 
C:  <yawns> 
A:  Yes . 
C:  <other> 
B:  N Yeah . 
D:  I think we do . Do we have too many functions ? I don't think so . It's pretty slim . 
C:  No . 
A:  No . 
B:  No . 
A:  Think it's uh seven . 
D:  Seven . Oh , and do we um take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and  
B:  Mm m 
D:  R_S_I_ influences ? Think we do . 
C:  Mm , we haven't thought of that one . 
A:  It was . I had them worked out . Mm . They are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost . 
D:  Are the production costs within the preset limits ? Well they are now . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <other> 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  <other> 
D:  Does the design fit the group of focus ? 
C:  I think that's a three . 
B:  Mm , th yeah . 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . I think it doesn't . 
A:  No I think with our new radio button , I think it's uh 
B:  Yeah . Uh
