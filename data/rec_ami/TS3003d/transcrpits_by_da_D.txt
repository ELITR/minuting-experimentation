Good afternoon . 
Sorry I'm a little late . 
Got stuck in the traffic . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Um , <cough> is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ? 
Um , when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Okay . Um  Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Think so . 
That's what I pointed out earlier . 
If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here . 
<cough> 
Since it rechargeable . 
Um  
Damn . 
<laugh> 
Wouldn't  
Yeah . 
No . That wouldn't be an option . 
Uh , d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , 
right ? 
Well , 
think actually there're two buttons , 
aren't they ? 
Well 
I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button . 
That would cut the cost . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> But , I think this really is four buttons anyhow . 
Yes . 
Only the docking station , I guess . 
Maybe we should to a different supplier . 
<laugh> <laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah , that's what I'm wondering . <cough> 
Um  
Well , 
since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , 
maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . 
Especially since we have those nice features . 
It would be a be a pretty rigid one . 
<cough> 
Or b 
Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control . 
But how does scroll-wheel work here ? 
That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . Integrated scroll-wheel push-button . 
But  Yeah . 
I think that would be like the end of our usability . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
but  <cough> 
Well , 
think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are 
right now you just push the teletext button , 
go to page eight eight eight , 
and teletext disappears . 
But the subtitles stay there . 
I think that's the case on most  
Well , 
that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click . 
But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , 
who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is . 
Holding a remote with <other> which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . 
With only five buttons on it . And a scroll-wheel . 
True . True . 
That's a pretty big scroll wheel . 
<cough> 
So this is five buttons . 
Right now we have five . 
Mm . 
Well , 
I still think we should go for the single curve design . 
But then again ,  all these changes are not really okay with me . 
But since we just have to . 
I'd rather just go to the board 
and get us to spend <laugh> eighteen dollars a a remote . 
Or do some market research and see what the options are . 
Yeah . 
Yes . Definitely . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<cough> It's pretty different . 
But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote . 
This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell . 
'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff . 
This is not familiar for them . 
So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them . 
Yeah . 
That's true . 
Might uh  might be confusing too . 
They'd be like , what ? Only five buttons ? 
<laugh> Yeah . 
But you're not sixty . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
So um , 
I like set up all these criteria . And evaluation of the thingy . <laugh> 
Thank you . <laugh> 
Five more minutes ? 
Okay . 
'Kay so 
I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . 
Translated it into criteria , 
which would be these . 
Um , is the remote fancy ? The shape , look and feel . 
Innovative ? What new functions are there ? 
Uh , easy to use ? 
Uh , learnability is a very important factor here . 
Uh , is it functional ? 
Are there not too many functions uh among the functions ? 
And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? 
And the cost . 
The target group . Is the remote really for the group we're making it for ? 
And recognability . If our company is  If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? 
And  
So we're supposed to evaluate it right now . 
Let's see . 
Oh 
I have to say this was a little hard , 
because the minutes of our last meeting were not here . 
Okay . 
Interesting . 
So  <cough> 
Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ? 
We all go for six ? 
Good . 
Um , is the design innovative ? 
I think so , 
with our L_C_D_ screen , docking station , scroll-buttons . 
Seven ? 
<laugh> Should be do-able . 
Is the design easy to use ? 
Well  
Would be for us . 
But  
I'd go for four , too . 
Is the design functional ? 
Um , do we have all functions that we want to include ? 
I think we do . 
Do we have too many functions ? 
I don't think so . 
It's pretty slim . 
Seven . 
Oh , 
and do we um take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and  R_S_I_ influences ? 
Think we do . 
Are the production costs within the preset limits ? 
Well 
they are now . 
Does the design fit the group of focus ? 
<laugh> Yeah . 
I think it doesn't . 
I don't know . 
I think  
I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control . 
I'm not sure . 
I think I'd go for two . 
'Kay . 
Is the company company recognisable ? 
Well , 
we have the logo there . 
So  
Yeah . 
So that will be this . 
I was also supposed to calculate the score , 
but thought we would have another private thingy after this . 
Is this  
Like 
after this , are we done ? Or  
We're gonna go to our other room again . 
Well , anyhow . 
These are seven factors times seven is forty something . Two ? 
No . 
Nine ? 
Uh , minus one . Minus three , minus four . <prosodic repetition vocalisation> Minus four . 
So that would be minus eight . 
Forty one out of forty nine . 
Okay . 
Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here . 
Hmm . 'Kay . So 
that will be the evaluation . 
<cough> 
Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . In the design phase . 
Yeah . Definitely . 
No . 
Not too much . <laugh> No . <laugh> 
Yeah , true . 
But  
And I would've liked to go for the younger users also . 
And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I tried to open the file on my laptop , 
but <laugh> not possible . 
Yeah . 
 no . 
Should've done that then . 
Pen is here . 
<cough> 
Mm . Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
They are . 
Yeah . 
Fifty grand . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
still I think  
I mean 
if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . 
So maybe we should just re-focus . 
Or specifically for younger people . 
That's true . 
Yeah , 
I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . Even if it were their covers . 
But  <cough> 
<laugh> Party party . 
'Kay . 
Oh 
you did . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , it probably will . 
Oh yeah , 
you're supposed to make a final  
Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ? 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
That'd be nice .
