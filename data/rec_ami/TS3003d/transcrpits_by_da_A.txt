So  
Hello . <laugh> 
No problem . 
Okay . <laugh> 
That's possible on uh this time of day . 
Starts at three o'clock . Uh  <laugh> 
Uh , let me see . 
Our fourth and last meeting . 
There he is . 
Yes . 
Okay 
this our last meeting . 
In this meeting we will discuss our final design . 
And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . 
And then we're going to close the project today as well . 
So 
after this you will be uh free to go 
and uh spend all your money . <laugh> 
And this uh design , detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , 
and we will do the product evaluation . 
Um , in order to do that we have this agenda . 
We'll have the prototype presentation first . 
Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria . 
<other> Then we will look at the finance . 
Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . 
Because everything costs money , 
and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . 
So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote . 
But we will see that later . 
Then we will do the project uh evaluation , 
and the closing after that . 
We've got forty minutes . 
So we will be finished at half past three . 
But first um we will do the  this is prototype presentation . 
So , 
if some yeah if somebody wants step forward . 
Okay . 
Okay . Uh but um 
I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple . Uh just a few buttons and large buttons . 
But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons . 
So I'm wondering if we if we neely  really need all of those buttons . 
That's right . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Long time . 
Yeah . 
If you put  
Yeah . Okay . 
Yeah . 
Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary . 
Okay . 
Yep . 
Okay . So 
we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ? 
Just n normal plain buttons . 
Yeah . 'Kay . 
No . 
No . 
Yeah . Okay . 
Yep . 
Okay . 
That's nice . 
Then because we only have thirty minutes left , 
I will move on to the finance part , 
which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . 
And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros . 
If we see  
I don't know if I've filled in correctly , 
so just correct me if you see uh something wrong . 
I counted two batteries . 
But maybe we can also use one . 
I don't know if it's possible . 
It's rechargeable . That's right . 
Okay . 
That's two Euros off . <laugh> 
We need the advanced chip . 
So there's not much to uh <other> to save there . 
<other> Here we have the single curves . 
Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro . Um , 
I don't know , 
but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . 
I think we have to keep that . 
Then we have the case material supplements . 
It's plastic . 
It's the cheapest one we need . 
So that's uh not much to save either . 
But then the biggest costs are the buttons . 
So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low . 
Because you have to  we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . Um , 
so if we  
Let's fir first count the buttons we have now . 
Because I  <other> 
Sixteen . 
Nah , 
that will be even more then . 
Eighteen Euros . 
So , 
seventeen . 
Okay , including the help ? 
Yeah . Uh seventeen . 
I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number long . 
That saves us uh one Euro already . 
'Cause then we have got fifteen I think ? 
Fifteen buttons . 
And this is  
No those are one , I think . 
Yeah 
but th it's not stated in this files . 
So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing 
That's possibility as well . 
So  
And it's good for the design as well . 
So you can make  
Uh let's see . 
If you make this  
<laugh> Looks a bit like uh a cross . <laugh> 
Plus . Min . 
Uh s yeah 
channel . 
Yeah 
w 
Yeah 
th I think they count uh the materials . 
Yeah 
on the chip there . 
Yeah . 
That's right . That's right . 
But I think because we have the advanced chip 
<laugh> we can just count this as one button . 
But  
No 
but I think  
<other> Yeah . Maybe it is , 
but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros . 
Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use . 
I think they uh try t 
That's right , 
but what's the big advantage of our remote then ? <laugh> 
Yeah . 
No . 
That's extra . <laugh> That's extra . 
That's right . 
<laugh> That's an option . 
Poland . Something . <laugh> Polish supplier . 
Don't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th uh these buttons in three , 
then we save a lot of money as well . 
Yeah . That's a point . 
Yep . 
No . 
Yeah 
but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros . 
We don't have any more budget to develop it . 
Yeah . So  
It is . If you leave out the L_C_ display . And if you use less buttons . Say  Or you can take the single chip . 
There it is . <laugh> 
But then w 
Good looking . 
Yeah . 
I think it's uh difficult as well , 
but  
Or we can leave out the ten buttons 
and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . 
Then w 
Because then we save ten buttons . 
Then we have five and one . 
And and see . 
If we have this one and we've got the advanced  
W uh , we're getting close . <laugh> 
Then you will  Or maybe you can um scroll . 
If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display . 
Until you've got the right number , then you push it . 
Alright . 
It's gotta scroll and push . 
Okay 
but then you you can push uh some other button as well . 
Yeah . That's right . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel . 
<laugh> But it would definitely crop cost , a lot . 
And we need the battery . 
<other> And the regular chip is not possible ? 
It has to be advanced ? 
It has to be advanced . Yeah . Okay . 
And we can save a Euro by a flat design . 
That's an option we can  
Then we're almost there . 
Yeah . 
So 
if we  
Yeah 
but I think that's  That is a big advantage , 
if we're  
But  
Can we use  
can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ? 
If you push it three times ? 
Yeah . 
Ah that's not really that  
No . 
I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . 
If you just make it real simple . 
Because it saves it saves a lot of money . 
And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen , 
which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles . 
And it's good for the innovative design as well . If you would erase these . 
Mm eraser ? 
And we put uh  
Looks a bit odd maybe . <laugh> 
That is  <other> 
Something like that . 
Then , yeah . We've got the scroll-wheel . 
One , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . 
And these are two buttons then . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . That's really a good good idea , I think . 
And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed . 
So we make one for the volume , one for the channel . Plus scroll . 
That's right . 
So we've got one , two , three . 
Yeah , 
we can leave the teletext in if we want . 
That's m that's better . 
Y yeah . 
Mm yeah . 
Uh yeah , 
and then you can  
That's right . 
So we can decrease this one to four buttons . 
Yeah . That's no problem . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made , I think . 
Single curved is really easy to just fill in . 
And cases come right out of the machine . 
And single curved you have to have a different uh different machine , than a flat one . 
I think this is a really easy one . Um , 
what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? 
Freek , what do you think ? 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
<laugh> 
We have to cut costs . <laugh> 
Yeah . Yeah 
I'm ag 
Ask for more money . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . I am agreeing with the usability . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one . Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more . 
So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , 
it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . 
It will be necessary to have good help function , as well . 
So 
this is scroll . 
I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . <laugh> Before we went on to the to the whole design . 
But  I'm glad we could make a bit . 
It's pretty different , if you saw the last one than <laugh> this one . 
Yeah . It will . Yeah . 
No , 
but I think  
I think the most  
That's right . 
We can let l 
We can stick it out , a bit . Like a old old buttons . <laugh> 
Maybe that's recognisable for them as well . 
Yeah . That's a good one . 
So , 
I'm afraid we have to move on . 
And it's uh it's b uh less frightening , I think . 
If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and uh  
But we will see . 
Yeah . That's definitely right . 
Yeah . 
I would buy it . <laugh> 
That's right . 
I would buy it if I was six . <laugh> 
No I don't know . 
What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ? 
No ? 
Uh , yes they are . 
No . 
But we can go on with the project evaluation . 
Let's see . 
I can sit down I think . 
We still have fifteen minutes left , 
so we're nice on schedule . 
Um , the project process . 
<laugh> 
Evaluation criteria . That's right . 
That was the the point I forgot . 
I should  
There we are . Evaluation criteria . <laugh> 
Go ahead . 
We've got five minutes I think for those criteria . 
No we've got fifteen minutes 
but  
Uh yes . What ? 
Uh yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
that's because my pen failed to upload his data . 
<laugh> I tried to 
but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software . 
I think it's fancy . 
Yeah . Six . 
Very . <laugh> 
Subtitles , buttons . 
Yeah . 
Seven . 
Yeah . 
So we've got twenty cents for our docking station , 
huh ? <laugh> 
Yeah . That's right . 
That's a bit dodgy . 
I would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five . 
Yeah . 
Is it functional ? 
Yes . 
No . 
Think it's uh seven . 
It was . 
I had them worked out . 
Mm . They are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost . 
Yeah . 
No 
I think with our new radio button , I think it's uh I think it's better . 
I think it  
Yeah . 
I would give it a four . 
Then we have to do the three . 
It's the  
Yes it is . 
Yeah . 
And they wanna put fashion in their products . Uh in the slogan of the company . 
And we have the removable front cases . 
So , I think it's very recognisable . 
Yep . 
We've got a calculate it . 
Mm ? 
N 
We've gonna  We're going to evaluate it . 
 Forty nine . 
Forty one . 
That's  Around eighty percent . 
What is it ? 
That's eighty four percent . 
I think that's a pretty nice score . 
<laugh> Okay . 
Thank you . 
So , 
that brings us to the project evaluation . 
Yep . 
Thank you . 
Project process . 
Did we move through the right phases , you think ? <other> Along the process ? 
That's right . 
So lack of information about prices . 
Okay . 
Uh  Okay . 
Satisfaction . 
Was there room for creativity ? 
<laugh> No ? <laugh> 
It's because of the finance sheet . Yeah . 
The room was  Yeah . 
Restrictions . Internet access . 
'Kay . 
Leadership . 
Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions ? Yeah ? 
Teamwork ? Did it work out ? Working together ? Also , you  two of you with the uh last phase ? 
Nice . 
 tasks . 
Okay . 
Were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do ? 
Or were they too much ? 
Smart-board . 
If it wants to download its uh data . <laugh> 
Failed download . Smart-board was irritating . <laugh> 
So you rather wanted to have a flip-over ? Or something else ? 
Faster as well , I think . 
Yeah . 
Flip-over . 
Yeah . 
Uh you need a smart board uh application I think . 
But I think you can  
Yeah . Should be possible . Yeah you can export it as image . 
Must  
Yeah 
must be  
So 
the sharing of the information was uh was okay ? 
Uh , network . 
Yeah , pen is here on the table . 
Yeah .  It's possible . 
Okay . 
That's nice . 
Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings ? 
Or  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So  Yeah . So 
everybody puts his own score . 
And then <other> it mediates the score , 
and you can get one  
Yeah . 
That's better . 
So that's uh  
How do we call ? Evaluation criteria . 
Okay . Mm , 
any more ideas ? 
Or questions about the project ? Or about the product ? 
Because I think then that we get to our last sheet . 
Are the costs within the budget ? 
Yeah . 
Do we  
Docking station . 
That's a good point . 
But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ? 
Uh and I think you can compensate that as well . 
So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem , 
because it's very cheap to make as well . 
Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? 
Or what was it ? <laugh> 
Fifteen fifteen million . 
I think we will . <laugh> If we gonna export this product . 
It's innovative . 
Especially in America . People are pretty decadent . Sometimes . 
You can do more . 
Yeah . 
Just put it on the market for everybody . 
You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers . 
That's one thing you can change it with . 
So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market . Just as a test . See how it works . 
That's I think a good advantage . 
Yeah . 
Uh , uh then I think we can have our little celebration , right now . 
That's it . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire . I think . 
I don't know . 
I didn't get a message 
from the from ending of the  
Oh 
I think I have one now . 
Five more minutes ? 
Oh that's nice . 
Then we still have some questions . 
If somebody has some questions they can ask them now . 
Or we can put these in the project folder as well . 
Maybe that's  
<laugh> <other> 
<laugh> 
Export as picture , I think . 
<laugh> 
Hmm . This is another network , I guess . 
Does somebody see the project folder ? <laugh> 
I don't . 
Hmm . My Documents . 
Yeah , 
I'll just put it in My Documents 
and uh  
That's okay . 
Okay . 
<other> I think I'm going to make our final presentation now . 
<laugh> And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . Summary of the project . 
Yeah . Questionnaire . 
I think you all get a questionnaire in in your room . 
And then I'll meet you in I think about ten minutes , or something . 
Hopefully my pen will download its software . Oh . Or data .
