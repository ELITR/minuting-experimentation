<cough> 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Wow . <laugh> 
Wow . <laugh> 
<other> Complex . 
Huh ? 
A cat . 
No . Darn . <laugh> 
Uh . 
A what ? 
A r a rabbit , oh oh yeah , 
where is the carrot ? <laugh> 
Okay <laugh> mm-hmm . 
I am not very good at uh <laugh> this kind of stuff . 
My favourite animal is  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Guess . 
<laugh> A human , yay . 
It's a very complex animal <laugh> 
and um  yeah . 
Characteristics of this this animal is <laugh> dangerous . <laugh> 
Ah , a kind of uh snake ? 
Cobra ? 
Exactly <whistling sound> . <laugh> 
Uh-huh . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
What about you uh <laugh> 
Christa ? <laugh> 
A fish . <laugh> 
A smiling fish . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
So , w whiteboard is working ? <laugh> 
Good . <laugh> 
Next . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah , well . <laugh> 
Not me . <laugh> 
So . Twenty five Euro for a remote control . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 'tis big number . 
Mm-hmm . 
Uh yes , we have plenty at home . 
<laugh> In fact , my daughter likes l <laugh>  <laugh> remote controls . 
To eat ? Yeah , mainly , and to break . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
<other> Ye ye yeah . 
So she likes uh buttons <laugh> which make click , 
so <laugh> it has to click . 
It has to be uh wha <laugh> baby proof <laugh> 
yeah 
<laugh> but mainly it has to be very robust 
because even if she's not very tall she's uh <laugh> high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh  
So it has to be very robust . 
Unbreakable , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
And uh 
<other> it has to be nice looking , 
colourful , maybe  
colourful , because uh nobody has colourful remote control 
, they're always black , yeah , 
but this one could be I dunno , purple or b 
Yeah , yeah . 
One colour . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Oh like the phones , 
yeah , it could change colours , yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Good . 
<other> Should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control 
so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , 
then it's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator 
<laugh> whatever <other> 
I dunno if it's  
Or if we should have a targeted re remote control . 
<cough> So colour , robustness , easy to use , size , 
yeah , size matters , yeah . <laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
But uh what would be different from this , from the others ? 
I dunno if <laugh>  
Yeah , at least the colour would be different . 
I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're  they never find a good button in the right place . 
For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the  
So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , 
I dunno  . 
<laugh> Too expensive for twelve Euro ? 
Ah . 
Mm-hmm . 
I thought it could be only a screen <laugh> which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user . 
So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right , 
so I would have my own design of the remote control 
because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control , 
if you  if you like . 
I don't know if it makes sense , but  
Yeah , for instance , mm . 
Mm . 
Maybe , if if it's possible , yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Three buttons you mean ? 
Ah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm , yeah , sure . <laugh> 
<other> <laugh>  
Yeah , 
more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time . 
Yeah 
but for instance when you change channels you can have  you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . 
And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . <laugh> 
Uh no . 
<laugh> Because I'm only using three or four channels but  <laugh> 
And then back to the one I was before , 
so there's  whichever it was . 
Yeah . 
Uh uh we had that in in other countries . 
<laugh> Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo <laugh> previous of the previous . <laugh> 
Then you can watch what your  ah you could also record your  record your <laugh> sequence of actions , 
<laugh> that becomes more complex , 
but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or  <laugh> remote controls . 
<laugh> Yeah <laugh> 
maybe it's a  
Okay . 
So what does M_E_ means ? 
M_E_ the user requirements ? 
Or that's uh that's for us ? 
Uh that's me . 
<laugh> Oh , of course <laugh> yeah , 
the user requirement specifications , 
uh-huh , yeah . 
Okay . <other> I'll think of that . 
So ? 
Meeting's over ? 
Great . 
Thank you .
