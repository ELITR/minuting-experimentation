D:  <cough> 
A:  <other> So I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan , some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting . 
topic_description:	opening_None


A:  So um we want to to do a new remote control . It has to be original , trendy and user friendly . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design .  and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day .

topic_description:	discussion_None


A:  So any of you have experience in remote controls ? <laugh> 
D:  Uh yes , we have plenty at home . <laugh> In fact , my daughter likes l <laugh>  <laugh> remote controls . To eat ? Yeah , mainly , and to break . <laugh> 
C:  Mm yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  <other> That  
B:  Mm . To eat ? <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> So that could be a great um <other> application . Remote controls children proof . Mm mm-hmm . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . <other> Ye ye yeah . 
B:  Children proof . Hmm . 
D:  So she likes uh buttons <laugh> which make click , so <laugh> it has to click . 
A:  <other> Okay . 
C:  Yeah , pret 
A:  <laugh> So they have to be waterproof maybe ? <laugh> 'Cause they eat  she ate it . <laugh> 
D:  It has to be uh wha <laugh> baby proof <laugh> yeah <laugh> but mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's uh <laugh> high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh  
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <other> Ah . 
D:  So it has to be very robust . 
B:  Okay , unbreakable . 
D:  Unbreakable , yeah . 
B:  Uh-huh . 
C:  Yeah , we have some child lock or something , yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  And uh <other> it has to be nice looking , 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  colourful , maybe  
A:  Colourful , yeah mm . 
B:  Colourful ? That's not practical . 
D:  colourful , because uh nobody has colourful remote control , they're always black , yeah , but this one could be I dunno , purple or b 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  No , that's a good idea . 
C:  Yeah , it's always black or  yeah . 
A:  Mm mm-mm . 
B:  No . But how gonna  okay , just uh but it's uh monochrome it's n it's not like  
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  No , because you think , why not . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  One colour . 
B:  Otherwise you will never find it . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  Yeah even we can change colours , no ? Like the uh like the phones and these things we c yeah . At least for children like one colour and  . <laugh> 
D:  Oh like the phones , yeah , it could change colours , yeah . 
B:  Cool . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Ch 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> Good . 
A:  Good idea . 
C:  And it should be really  small and  . 
A:  Small also ? Don't you think  
C:  Huh not so big like  yeah . 
A:  No uh , not too much buttons or  mm . 
C:  Yeah , not too much buttons and  
D:  <other> Should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , then it's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator <laugh> whatever <other> I dunno if it's  
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Uh . Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> <other> Yeah , that's  <cough> 
D:  Or if we should have a targeted re remote control . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  <cough> So colour , robustness , easy to use , size , yeah , size matters , yeah . <laugh> 
A:  So , I think there's  
C:  Yeah . Colour , <laugh> size , sh 
A:  So you you think it's better if small than bigger . 
C:  Yeah , maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess . <laugh> 
D:  Mm . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , but without any extremes like n not of this size , not too large . Okay . 
A:  No , not too small , yeah . 
C:  Yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like  . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Hmm . 
B:  Yeah , like a palm sized . 
C:  Yeah . <cough> 
D:  Mm . 
B:  Just to hold it . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  But uh what would be different from this , from the others ? I dunno if <laugh>  
C:  Uh maybe we can change the colours that  at least the frame . Mm . S so then it depends  you are to  
D:  Yeah , at least the colour would be different . 
A:  Mm . 
C:  Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame  . 
D:  I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're  they never find a good button in the right place . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the  
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , I dunno  . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  Mm . So , some kind of idea uh with um um <other> cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what  no . 
B:  No , no screens , it's too complex . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  <laugh> Too expensive for twelve Euro ? 
C:  Mm . <laugh> Too expensive , yeah . 
B:  And n maybe not too expensive , well it's not my problem , but well okay . But no screens on remote controls . 
A:  And too expensive . 
D:  Ah . 
A:  Mm . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


D:  I thought it could be only a screen <laugh> which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user . So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right , so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control , if you  if you like . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Ye yeah . Hmm . I mean it it's like  it's like two types no ? <other> people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this , say if you're right handed you use like this or  so tha your switch on and off should be on  yeah . 
D:  I don't know if it makes sense , but  
A:  Mm-mm . 
D:  Yeah , for instance , mm . 
B:  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Mm mm mm . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  So adaptable <other>  yeah something  yeah . 
B:  Adaptable . Alright , good , so how many actions do we need to implement in it ? 
D:  Maybe , if if it's possible , yeah . 
C:  Mm <other> huh . Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working . 
B:  On off ? 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations . 
B:  I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a 
C:  Two . 
D:  Three buttons you mean ? 
B:  <other> like three mental states , yeah you know what I mean , we can just make it uh 
A:  Three option . 
D:  Ah . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Um . 
B:  controlled by a brain , huh ? <laugh> 
A:  Mm-hmm . <laugh> Maybe if it's more , if there is a software inside that ask you three  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm-hmm , yeah , sure . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  <other> <laugh>  
A:  Hmm . <laugh> If it  if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah . 
B:  Sh sure , sure . 
D:  Yeah , more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time . 
C:  Mm yeah . Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else . 
D:  Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have  you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . 
C:  Mm . Yeah . 
A:  Mm . <other> 
D:  And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . <laugh> 
B:  Mm-hmm . You do this ? 
A:  <other> 
C:  Yeah <other> . 
D:  Uh no . <laugh> Because I'm only using three or four channels but  <laugh> 
C:  <other> 
B:  I usually just change channels . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put  yeah , you can only have one bit . 
A:  Yeah . I change channel like this , m uh I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah . 
C:  Dash . 
D:  And then back to the one I was before , so there's  whichever it was . 
A:  Also we can be here  yeah , that would be cool . 
B:  Uh-huh . Go back button is good . I once had it . 
C:  Yeah you can  yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Uh uh we had that in in other countries . <laugh> Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo <laugh> previous of the previous . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah yeah , the previous button is  . 
A:  Mm <laugh> yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Uh , okay . <laugh> 
B:  History . <laugh> 
C:  Oh <laugh> uh <laugh> . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Then you can watch what your  ah you could also record your  record your <laugh> sequence of actions , <laugh> that becomes more complex , but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or  <laugh> remote controls . <laugh> Yeah <laugh> maybe it's a  
C:  Uh . 
A:  <cough> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah yeah , what the  which channels the viewer  <laugh> 
A:  Mm-mm . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  <other> Okay . So I think we have full of idea . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm <other> work on these ideas and try to make a uh <other> the ones , <other> make um  to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . <other> And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do . Um . <other> So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes .
