<laugh> 
Or browse . 
Mm . 
Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now . 
<other> I  yeah . 
L_E_D_ . 
Mm-hmm , hmm . 
Also <cough> so you have uh uh browsing the channels , actually 
so you can go up and down the channels , 
uh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back . 
Oh  
no no no , 
this is a single  this 
this is a model with just the T_V_ one . 
No no 
just 
sorry , 
this is a standard T_V_ one , 
we are not talking about that . 
So 
and then we have usually there twelve keys 
but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . 
The extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel . 
And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . Actually . 
It's a very basic minimal thing 
which you can  
which is which is also available in the market , 
actually that's what it   that it  <other> i 
and would cost us to build it about eight Euros . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So 
this one model 
and uh  
yeah . Sure . 
<laugh> Th <other> this is a magic one 
but I know we don't want to talk about that , 
you know like <laugh> 
uh i i i it is a very futuristic , 
it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future , it can come . 
<laugh> So that uh <other>  then what we look t 
yeah . 
This is a model , 
yeah . 
Yep . 
Uh so well 
then the this is the <other> a more a little uh smooth 
and it gives a lot of functionality , uh in this way , 
so all we have 
uh th you see there are only six keys , 
but don't worry 
they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here . 
And so they have more space actually 
and uh it's easy to uh use this 
and uh you have 
um so 
this is a standard uh  uh infrared eye , 
and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have , 
and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo 
yeah s pause or stop , 
and uh then uh you can uh 
you have a L_C_D_ display , here 
and uh y this is a functional thing 
which can change 
like 
it's a toggle switch 
which could change the function 
say , y you press it  
Yeah . I really can change it , 
so  
Instead of having many switches , y <other> 
The L_C_D_ can display what is that on that , 
and uh well 
you can have a integrated microphone over here , 
or in the button th here , 
so which can 
uh basically 
you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display . 
And here is a small L_E_D_ 
which is like blinking one , 
which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery , 
and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier 
okay . And uh well 
then we have a cover 
basically , basically 
you don't need much of the time this , 
<other> when you need you can use it , 
and this gives additional functionality 
that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover 
you know . 
Design enter <laugh> . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . It's basically to do that . 
<other> 
Actually when you are watching the T_V_ , <other> when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , 
you know , 
uh you want to uh  
and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually , giving a cover to that actually . Gives a protection 
because when it falls down or something it it is it is is is it gives a protec 
it's more robust that way . Uh yeah . 
And you have very good chances  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
It  
Sixteen Euros . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Three Euros . 
Part of that  . 
<other> Yeah . 
Well uh 
if you  we can have  
if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys 
if you want to 
you know <other>  
Yeah 
it it should not be cluttering up everything . 
Ah 
that's for the  
it's kind of a L_E_D_ for indicating your battery 
and as well as it's like a blinking one 
you know 
you can keep it aside . 
Yeah . 
And now it  easy to use . 
No . 
<laugh>  
Mm yeah . 
Well 
I will give it maybe  we have anyways  
the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say <laugh> 
you know . 
It  
though the look is fine 
but uh still I will give four in that case 
you know . 
Four yeah 
that  
Yeah . 
I will gi 
yeah . 
No . 
C can you get the batteries ? 
No no 
the battery has fallen down , 
that's i 
Yeah . 
No no it's not that , 
it's how to close a battery . 
Okay ? 
Now it should be  . 
Is there another battery there ? 
Oh yeah . 
<other> 
<other> 
No 
actually this is this is not going to protrude actually , 
it it's n i it is jus 
It's a led actually 
which which 'll be covering in a curve  
It's  will be embedded there 
so it won't be really you know protruding or something . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> Yeah . 
No you  it it not protruding actually , 
it will go in better into that  
Uh it's fine I think . 
My  just that um the feel is that um you  
right now you you don't see the feel 
because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one . 
This is how embedded one will  
Yeah . It's a bas basically the same thing actually . 
You will be  Except that in this c 
Yeah <other> 
And <other> you might have a slight thing for to forward and  
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
 looking like  
No but except for the design of the surf <laugh> . 
You should be rea <laugh> 
<other> Uh no 
I think it's more of the feel . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Say about that . 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Yeah , 
it gives it  
Yep . 
No , 
we ha 
Yeah , eight Euros yeah . 
Sixteen Euros . 
It's a two , I would say two  . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay yeah . 
<laugh> Uh  
He is used to it act 
They are used to it actually . 
Here there may  
Uh , though it has more functionality 
I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . It shouldn't be diffi 
Uh yeah , 
actually in fact I think it will be  
Yeah <other>  
Yeah 
but <laugh> y 
Well 
we have reduced the keys actually you see . 
Three is fine with me . 
Yeah 
it's a  
actually the user has to put some effort to do  use that actually , 
it's not so easy , like this one the normal . 
Is quite easy yeah . 
Initially there there is a lot of effort , yeah . 
Mm . 
Oh 
no , 
this would I 
I would I would give this model to the old people actually . 
Yeah . 
And  
Oh 
yeah ,  . 
I  
Well 
I think  
Yeah . Uh yeah 
but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually . 
So  
And people can still decide to use the cheaper one 
instead of a  
Okay . 
Okay . 
So in that case well it's fine then . 
We can  
yeah . 
And the demographics of  
Yeah 
I think it's uh  it has more market actually . 
Y yeah , you know  
two . 
Yeah two yeah . 
Because tomorrow this will be more appealing 
because you can add <other> lot of sophistication on that . 
Because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include 
for the people to  
We have to practically test it . 
The field test will tell you how good . <laugh> 
The trends . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah I know . 
Yeah . We we we we we yeah , it's the way they are going to be , actually . 
But why do you want to cover that actually ? 
In that uh w in the mod 
Uh uh y are you sure ? 
Yeah I think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , yeah . 
Yep . 
Yeah , it's one . 
Yeah , 
it says a  
One point six , 
one point  
One point eight yeah . 
Four point  Uh four point two . 
Wow . 
Yeah . Yep . 
Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , 
it migh It  
it'll need uh more than a conventional one , 
it won't be uh just  
maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually . 
What do you say , Mael ? 
Yeah . 
Curved . Double curved 
yeah right . 
It's uh  
Are you talking about this or that ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
A special colour ? <other> 
Uh  
Ah good . 
Yeah , 
we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ? 
No , for that one also . 
Yeah 
that's a scroll . 
Yeah , 
one scroll wheel you might need . 
Uh  
Bad estimate , 
right ? 
<other> 
That is the sample sensor and sample speaker . 
We just need that actually . We need one . 
S 
Oh 
I  <other> i it  
I think it's going to be  y y 
yeah it's th with the regular chip , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh  
Yeah . 
That'll be  
then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Uh  
Or we could even replace them by buttons actually . 
A actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it , 
for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , 
or  and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is  that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least . 
Okay so we can get rid of it 
and then add a couple of buttons . 
I think but  
Yeah 
but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that . 
Yeah . 
W I I I just  
Yeah . 
That will create another problem . For the people to use it . 
It's not going to be easy . Doing that . 
No , 
it's okay , you uh cut the L_C_D_ screen 
and introduce two more buttons . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
That's it . 
Cool .
