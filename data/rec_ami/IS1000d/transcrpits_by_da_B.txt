<cough> Okay . 
So . 
Matthew is uh late again . 
<other> Probably an important man . 
Um . So well 
it is important for him to be here uh . 
He he he  
You did work together didn't you ? 
Yes . 
Yes . Yes . 
Mm . Um yes 
but w we  
<other> <other> 
Yes , maybe we should phone him . 
Um well  Um , 
when he is not here 
we will just we just have to continue . 
Um so 
just for record I I will take uh notes again . 
And um well <cough> 
first thing uh I was uh uh I got an email from uh from my superior again 
that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . 
when you stay in it's good , 
when you don't stay in you have to redesign . 
There is no <other> uh no negotiation uh <laugh> possible in this matter . 
So we have to consider that . 
<other> Good . 
Um so 
maybe Anna , you can have your presentation . 
Okay 
Matthew . Nice uh you are here . 
Great . Great . 
Oh 
ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Eye . 
Uh-huh . 
Yes . 
Ah , okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
Mm . 
Exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah no 
you can carry on , 
I just look how it feels all . 
Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone . 
Just I'm  
I really want to talk to it . 
But  . 
<laugh> So 
but but continue with your uh 
mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
From D_V_D_ player to television or something . 
Yes . 
Mm . 
Yes 
and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ 
yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm <other> . 
Mm . Yeah 
but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed , will it also uh cover up the L_C_D_ screen ? 
But but the L_C_D_ screen I mean is a very uh well an eye-attracting feature 
which shouldn't be shouldn't be  
<laugh> That th that's true . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yes . Yes , 
more robust . 
Yes okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
 Okay . 
But w 
<other> Mm 'kay . Hmm .  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm  . 
Well well  Mm . 
Be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible , maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um  
Yes . Evalua evaluation 
and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well 
just do it quickly 
if if we al already  . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Um , n no 
why not why not discuss uh discuss it now ,   
Mm , well 
my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it . 
And then  I mean w w w you must just see it <other>  
we can still spend this four and a half Euro 
and to r 
because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros 
so we just have to offer as much as as  well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five Euro . 
Mm . 
Um well 
w w we can still discuss that . 
So um , 
and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas 
I mean adding things or uh removing uh of options 
because they are too expensive , 
but 
um I've received uh a framework which we can do this . 
I mean did you have this this Excel sheet ? 
No okay , 
this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components , 
so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh . 
So 
maybe we can start with this , 
uh , calling this one . <laugh> 
Th th this is the first design . 
Yes . 
Uh there is another pen . 
Okay . 
'Kay . 
Okay . So . 
Look and feel . 
Well 
you already feel that uh pretty much I think <laugh> . 
In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , 
so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel . 
But that's just half , 
we should also consider look , 
and then i it looks quite conventional . 
Don't you agree ? 
So 
maybe two . 
Hmm . Hmm . 
Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five 
I  
It's my opinion , 
but I don't know what what 
Four , four . 
Now we th th 
then we settle on four . 
'Kay . 
Can you maybe fix the other  
Mm , try it , just try it . 
Oh it will not 
ri 
mm , 
mm . 
Yes , 
it it has a  mm . 
Good . Good . 
Okay . So 
then then  
Ah . 
Mm . 
I  I  I  
When we want to include  I I 
I'm doubting about this this component . 
It it it it breaks 
in your  
Mm , yes I see , mm okay . 
Well 
r r 
Mm . 
I think the look is better 
but the feel is is is worse . 
So so <laugh> I would also say this is four . 
But w w do you  what do you think ? 
Mm . Mm . Yes . 
Yes , 
it basically is the same shape . 
Mm-hmm . Mm . 
Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
Yes , okay  . 
Two ? 
Mm . Two's good 
yes . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
The only innova innovation is the shape . 
S so that  
Mm . 
Yes . 
A and the L_C_D_ screen is  
That's that's that's well it's quite innovative . 
Mm . 
Yeah . Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm . 
We just diske discuss it as you designed it 
and then we will will try to get it in the budget . 
Eight . 
Yes . 
Two . 
Why it is one . 
<laugh> 
A man  w w 
Yes . 
This this is it w with the speech recognition ? 
Well . 
Gi given that <laugh> that it works , 
<laugh> then it's I think one . 
 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Three , I would . Three . 
No . 
Yeah . 
Yes 
but then when when he is used to it , i i it is quite easy . 
So so I think th three is good . Yeah . 
Good . 
What's the next ? 
So  
Twe twenty to forty , yes that's  
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Well 
exce except for the surfing shape . I mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group I think , 
but  
Mm w w w we  after this we can can consider uh for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic 
Mm . 
But as it is now , I w would say mm , six , something . 
Do you agree ? 
Mm , yeah , indeed . 
Ju just think , twenty five Euros , 
I mean it's not going to be cheaper . 
Mm . Mm . Okay . 
Yeah 
tha tha tha tha tha that's  
I think it's better , 
because of the L_C_D_ screen 
which is really an appeal on the on the on the 
on the  and on the  
Mm . So , 
the L_C_D_ screen uh attracts , 
yes . 
Because it  
Mm , ma maybe that's something to consider , yes <other> , 
so . 
Wh what  what  
No 
s say t two . 
Two ? 
Okay , 
the final point , trends . 
Mm . Mm . <other> 
I think  
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
And the then we can al 
yes . 
We can  we can consider 
uh uh is it possible do you think , to to make a cover for s such a phone ? 
I mean  
Well 
just with the with the flexible plastic uh  
I th I th I think   
O o or just two things which can be put on each other . 
<other> Yes , exactly like it . 
Uh , so 
Maybe we can <other> 
but we have to decide it , 
we can put the the <other> the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers 
and s now try to invest in the in in the features . 
Mm . 
Mm mm mm mm mm . 
Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
Mm . Mm . 
Yes . 
So so so that that would make the trends equal , 
so we we we really have  don't have , 
I mean  
Yes , indeed . 
Yes . 
Say , say one and two . One and two . 
So 
le le let's see . 
So 
d 
this one has spongy but buttons ? 
Mm , I see , yes okay . Good . 
Just add it . 
You know . 
Three , six , seven . 
Mm-hmm . 
We  we must try to get them closer . 
Both in i i 
or we just have to choose . And adapt . 
Because , when we choose for this one we have to <other> we have to make it more attractive 
and w when we  to d for this one we have to make it more cheap . 
<laugh> Yes , well  <other> 
But I'm <other> 
now  
did y did you work with the same prices that I have here ? 
Mm . 
Mm , 
tha 
Well yes , well uh 
re reconsider it . 
So <other> 
let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet , 
uh what kind of energy source uh 
I I  
we didn't speak about that . 
It's a  it's a normal battery , or  
Yes . Just so one battery . 'Kay . 
Electronics . 
 given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip . 
Yeah , yes , 
or sample sensor , yes . 
Yes , this one . Okay . 
Case ? 
Um , 
<other> I see  <other> I 
Double curve . 
 
Mm . 
Oh 
yes , we are talking about , 
but they have the same shape , 
but , actually bu 
So 
th th this would be double curves ? 
'Kay . 
Uh , plastic would be the material . 
Uh special colour , now we leave it to the covers . 
Push . 
Mm , yes , 
but  
Yeah 
th 
now this is per per unit , this number of components . 
So , 
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , 
t 
Yes . Twelve I believe . 
So this comes to eighteen . 
So  
So 
I think  but th do you agree th that thi 
Yes I 
Yes 
I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh sure . 
Yes I kno undes I understand what you mean , yes . 
Uh-huh . 
Both . 
Yes . <other> <laugh> Uh  
W <other> d <other> 
we have  we haven't talk about a  , 
but that's no a  is very exp inexpensive I believe 
but it is not in the list . 
W ho h 
is this a scroll wheel 
or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower ? <laugh> 
Mm . Mm-hmm . 
So  um  
We're  
We  We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip , 
but then we can't have the the speech recognition , 
yes ? Yes ? 
So so 
w when we w a 
this would this would be cutting the speech recognition . 
Transti 
Say  say it's regular , regular chip , 
and we still on fifteen , 
so  
Yes but that  maybe  
Well 
we can just say 
one . 
Ca l we are just  
when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty . 
So is it possible ? 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
No no , 
he he he I I 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
<other> A 
Mm  
Mm . I 
I  think we have to come to a decision now , 
just I I think we we what we just do i is vote about the uh the L_C_D_ uh display 
so  
Yes . 
Yes . Yes . <laugh> 
One man one vote . 
<laugh> S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it ? 
Mm . Mm-hmm mm-hmm . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm , I know , 
but  
Yes . 
So uh uh 
having an L_C_D_ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons . 
Is that acceptable ? 
Ca can I have  can the functions be implement in an  
You've  you you agree . 
So hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve . 
So that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons <other> . 
Mm . 
Mm . So um 
I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen . That that's that's my opinion . 
Just  
Uh where , L_C_  
Okay 
w we now we can just uh  
Yes . Yes . I th I th I think w we just go for this one 
and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price , 
okay . 
My m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected . 
Okay . 
Okay , 
good . 
Then we  the same . 
Thank you . 
That was it . <laugh>
