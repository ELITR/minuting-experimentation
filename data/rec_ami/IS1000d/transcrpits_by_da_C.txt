I guess I have to change the pen 
otherwise . Will be completely different . 
Yeah . 
And do you think <other> it's  . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
So what can you   ? 
Yeah we will  yeah , 
so I will be able to to summarize uh our meeting , 
but still I think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer . I think we can put on the  here . 
Uh basically w yeah 
we we designed the two uh items . 
Um , can we have a phone , 
can someone  
it's really w well designed <laugh> . 
Yeah . 
'Kay . 
Yep . 
Great . 
Yep . 
So 
I will start by the the basic one 
that uh fits into uh eight Euros actually , right , seven eight Euros , 
and uh well 
first for both they have um a special shape , 
maybe the designer can uh explain better than me , 
but uh it's like a surf board . 
And you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf T_V_ , maybe the web , 
and uh it's kind of interesting shape 
because um unconsciously people want to s to surf <laugh> when they see this stuff . 
And also it's not too far from um a mobile . 
So people are used to that kind of shape , 
right . 
Don't take care too much about the colour 
because w 
yeah 
we don't take  
yeah . 
So 
here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led 
yeah L_A_ L_A_ L_E_D_ , 
the on-off button , in red . 
Here would be the volume . On the on the left , 
okay , so  
easy to turn on t and off . 
And um so 
this is a very cheap version 
so there are  
maybe you can carry on uh Matthew . 
How can you change from V_C_R_ to uh T_V_ , by the way ? 
Okay yeah . Yeah yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Seven , eight , ei eight Euros . 
Yeah . 
 <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah actually , yeah . 
<laugh> 
 
Play , pause . 
Exactly yeah . To audio and to video on demand . 
Yes . 
This is the orange button , the <other> microphone . 
An 
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Crazy dis designer , 
okay . <laugh> 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
Yeah . 
Oh actually  well . 
It's low weight . You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight . 
So the the cost is actually a bit more , 
it's uh <laugh> it's it's sixteen Francs . 
Sixteen Euros 
sorry . 
Then it's out of budget . 
But the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer . 
And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be uh something like three Francs per item  
so 
three Euros 
sorry . 
And um  
No no no , 
part of that , yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Well 
I think th th 
yeah 
we should <other> stick with uh a number of keys 
because if we add too much then 
it's too  
Locati . Location . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Functionality . 
Easy to use . 
 target . 
No . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Four maybe . 
Uh . 
Yeah . 
If you press like this not like this 
 then you  
 
But  
Okay . 
Try a  
Perfect . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yep . 
Wow . 
'Kay 
maybe  
It's not a button 
it's a led , 
it's a  
Ac actually yeah it should be embedded . 
Yeah . Oh 
you can push push it again , you can push it . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
And the L_C_D_ makes it better . Yeah . 
So I will say two . 
I would say two , three . 
Yep . 
Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , 
right ? 
<other> Yeah . The surf uh design <laugh> . 
Yeah . 
Yeah  . 
Yeah . You're right  . 
Yeah . 
And the  And the second one is really uh state of the art , uh in terms of innovation . 
And um with many more functionalities , 
and can open and close the the bottom part . 
Yeah . 
And all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this . 
Uh could put it at one or two I would say . Personally . 
Uh  Yeah 
automatic speech recognition . 
Yeah . 
So <other>  
Eight . 
Well 
actually we have yeah to check again yeah . 
Sixteen . 
W W un to be one what would do we nee actually , 
yeah , 
I don't see  
okay , 
one would would be without buttons , <laugh> . 
Bu 
Yeah . 
So maybe we can put one . 
It's using speech recognition , yeah . 
Yeah , one , yeah . 
So 
the first one is really standard , 
so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it , 
right ? 
Yeah . 
Um , the other one is quite easy , tho though . 
One me um we hope  
maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons . 
And there is a  
like 
I would say three . Or maybe four  . 
Yeah , yeah 
because it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so ,   
This one would be uh for grandmothers <laugh> . 
No . 
Yeah , grandmothers , 
yeah . 
Yeah that's true . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
because it's so important  it's i it was written that it really so important , the um the the look and uh taking care of its  it targets , the right range of people , 
right ? 
Yeah . 
But w 
Yeah . 
But for us it's <other> 
yeah 
<other> we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros . 
 Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And if you want to target  
yeah 
if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , I think for this audience we need absolutely the L_C_D_ screen . 
Yeah . 
Or even  Even one and two . Or two . 
Yeah . Two yeah . 
Yeah . 
Spongy , uh , that means that it goes in in the water . <laugh> 
Uh okay . 
But this one includes this feature , right ? Spongy buttons . 
So  Uh 
the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . This is possible . 
Yeah 
exactly like Nokia phones <other> . 
Yeah . 
'Cause sometimes 
look at this computer , th this laptop , it's all black , 
and uh it's quite conventional , 
and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here . 
So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
so a a point better for the for the number two <other> . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Yeah , the blue one uh spongy . 
Nine . 
 
Very good . 
Yeah , it's right , yeah that's right . 
So 
I I give yeah I just give a call with the manufacturer 
uh and uh I explained them 
and they told me this could be possible for sixteen Fr Euros . 
Uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip , uh Matthew , 
so maybe we have to recap with this one . 
For this one it's a normal battery  . 
Uh sample speaker , yeah . 
Sample , yeah , this one . 
So  
So 
which one are we talking to ? 
Well  
Yeah . 
Is it zero Franc ? <laugh> 
L_C_D_ is  . 
It's okay . Just say L_C_D_  . 
No 
but for this one it's twelve Euro . 
There are twelve ? 
Wait a minute , 
it's not it's not double curved , 
it's single curved , 
right ? 
Because it's  there is no like <whistles> . 
Well 
it's  
you know 
this curve like this so , it's w there is only is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are  
yeah concave . 
So I think we can put um  
<other> the single curved in the sixteen . 
That makes uh seventeen . 
And what are just  
The bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you sure ? 
Yeah . <laugh> 
So 
I had a bad uh bad estimation . 
No no no . 
Yes , a kind of scroll wheel . 
Okay , 
so based on that , 
yeah , 
um where is the es okay sample speaker  
But still , yeah it  
No we cannot , yeah . 
So  
But the um  
Yeah 
but if you have the  near the L_C_D_ you can um <other> choose  select between um you know like uni universal between audio , T_V_ and V_C_R_ , 
and this needs a needs a advanced chip . 
Right , Matthew ? 
Or regular chip ? 
I think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip . 
Yeah . Okay . Okay . 
So . 
And what about the number of buttons buttons uh  <other> my Matthew ? 
 
When you look at this w , this u uh item ,  
But <other>  
You cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really <laugh> really low , 
no ? 
And uh we don't want to to change that 
right ? 
We we really want a L_C_D_ 
other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market . 
It's evident . 
Yeah . 
And I dunno  
So wha what what each of us think about the  because it's measure point the L_C_D_ , um  
Do you think it's important ? 
Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact , you have a big display 
and maybe you don't need one more in your hands ? 
I dunno , 
I'm just asking . 
Yeah , it's true yeah . 
But uh , do we want that ? 
On the market point of view , yeah . What do you think uh , L_C_D_ is a major feature , or ? 
You assume , you want a democratic voyt vote , 
right ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
<laugh> We need to be . <laugh> 
Yeah .  . 
Yes . 
Because one 
yeah 
th 
show me that 
uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons 
and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here . Here one , at the middle , and at the bottom . 
Okay ,  . 
Okay . 
The speech recognition is out . Because of the budget , yeah . 
Yes . 
Yeah . 
Actually yeah , 
we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount , yeah . 
<laugh> Thanks .
