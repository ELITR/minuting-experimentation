 
Um sure . 
You or me ? 
Okay . 
Well , since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . 
<cough> The base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , 
and it's gonna be plastic . 
Um then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red . 
Um because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour . 
Um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top . 
Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue , almost see-through . 
It's just sort of a very pale blue and a light-up yellow . 
The whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it  just that one button will light up . 
Um and then at the bottom we have our logo . 
Um bright yellow sort of design with the R_R_ <laugh> which will actually look like our logo . 
And then on the side you have the buttons . 
<other> They're one button , but they kind of push up and down . 
I don't think they're scrolling . 
<other> Right , yeah . 
And then  
yeah , the buttons . 
Thumb-shaped . 
Yeah . 
And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top , 
just which we didn't do . <laugh> 
<cough> 
Single . 
Right . 
<laugh> 
Oh thank you . <laugh> 
Feel good meaning what ? 
Physically , 
okay . 
 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
 
Yeah . 
True or false , easy to use . 
<cough> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , two . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm I don't think it's that fashionable . 
I'd give it like three or four . 
<laugh> 
But then I'm not fashionable , so 
don't use my opinion . 
<laugh> 
Does it feel good ? 
Yeah , 
it's gonna be thicker . 
Depth . 
<cough> I'll give it a one . 
<laugh> 
Oh right , 
the  
<laugh> 
Right . 
Yeah I go four . 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
Squishy and fruity . 
It's just trendy , basically . 
<laugh> Okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh>  <cough> 
It's plastic . 
And special colour . 
No , we don't have the scroll . 
Buttons . 
<other> 
Oh like the  twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and 
push-buttons . 
But we don't have any scrolls . 
Two interfaces , 
is that what w should we s say ? 
Okay , fine . Yeah . 
<cough> 
And then s 
yeah . 
We're over ? 
Okay . 
Oh , I see . 
<laugh> 
We didn't have a whiteboard . 
Yeah . 
And no internet . 
<cough> 
I think we did well . 
Yep . <laugh> 
<laugh> Gouges . 
<cough> 
Irritating . 
And no internet . 
Misses . I do . 
There's so much available . 
Like it's information 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well , that's why I don't like uh Macs or Apples , 
just 'cause I look at it , and I know it's probably a very good computer , 
but I look at it , and I'm taken back to elementary school , 'cause they look the same . 
They look like they did when I was in elementary school , 
and that's so old-fashioned to me . 
Exactly , 
so I associate them with like really low-tech , really cheap , bad  
Yeah . 
<other> 
<cough> 
But the  my  
but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only . 
I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs . 
You're kidding . 
No , no . 
<laugh> No , marketing has to actually create the desire for it . <laugh> 
Ri <laugh> They'll be sexy with it . <laugh> 
Oh right . 
Let you loose . 
Yeah , no . 
<cough> 
<laugh> Good .
