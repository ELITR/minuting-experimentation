Mm 'kay , 
you ready ? 
Y you read that stuff , since you wrote it . 
I'll be the Vanna . 
No . 
They're just buttons . 
On off switch will be here 
and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of , 
by concave sort of thing , 
except for , you know ,  can't see underneath . 
So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that , 
because they're very 
nice to stock  you know , stick your finger in . 
Um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute , 
and then these are the numbers , 
so our channel and our volume will be on either side . 
I'd say a single . 
Yeah , 
it's only actually the size of my hand . 
Whoohoo . 
 
Yeah , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it . 
Yes . 
I'd say two as well . 
At the moment , no . 
Okay . 
I'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way . 
Neither are all o all the customers we have , either . 
Uh the shape of it actually does uh . 
I'd say a two . 
<laugh> 
We could do it with the chip , yes . 
It wasn't  
we have no reflection of it on the prototype , 
but that's because it's only two dimensions , really . 
It  
Yeah . 
Three and an half . 
It's capable of being squishy and fruity . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> How did you get that in there ? 
The <laugh> slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie . 
<laugh> That was good . 
Yep . 
Mm 'kay . 
Yeah , 
it's  . 
Yep . 
<other> 
Well , that's the push-button too , right there . 
Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button . 
We're really having just push-button interface . 
But it  that just covers the type of button we're having . 
Because we're not doing a scroll on the side , it's still push-button . 
Push-button . 
But we just have push 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Let's call it th 
Okay . 
Grand . 
So we can go to production . 
Go back . 
Previous . 
We think we got stifled for cri <other> creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote , initially . 
 right . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Well , no , there was there was scratching and fighting , but  no <laugh> . 
<laugh> 
Irritating . <laugh> 
The means , the whiteboard didn't work . <laugh> 
<laugh> A and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet . <laugh> 
<other> I really appreciated those , yeah . 
The use of the laptops for receiving everything . 
It was wireless too , so . 
And let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear . 
<laugh> 
The Toronto district school would only use his Macs with their kids . 
Well , i iPods are now quite trendy , 
and they come in different colours . 
Yeah . 
Not me . 
<laugh> I didn't have a phone 'til university . 
That's okay . 
We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met . 
This will help them find the one . 
That's right . 
<other> 
<laugh> And so the serpent says , use our remote . <laugh> 
Whoohoo . Margaritas for everyone . <laugh> 
Yay . 
Thanks to the Project Leader . 
Now we know w
