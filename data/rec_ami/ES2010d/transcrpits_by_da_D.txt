I wanna find our if our remote works . 
Oh . <laugh> 
Whoohoo . 
That's nice . 
Good . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , I think it's a beautiful  
Yeah . 
Good job , you guys . 
Those are really good . 
Okay , 
it's a PowerPoint presentation . 
I don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about . 
It's under evaluation . 
Alright . 
Um so these are the criteria we're gonna ask , 
is it easy to use , is it fashionable uh 
 yeah , I guess we should write these down so we can reference them . 
Like does it feel good , like  
yeah , physically . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
That's just for current trend . 
It doesn't really count , you guys . 
Yeah . 
But it's  
so we do have removable covers , right ? 
Yeah , well then that's covered . 
And so we n k 
everybody have that ? 
Yeah , she's got it . 
It's good . 
Yeah . 
Okay so , we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale , 
and so we need to discuss how we feel . It falls within this range , 
so for easy to use , 
do we feel it's very easy to use ? 
You guys  
Okay . 
Oh wait , that's false . 
Okay . 
Two . That's what I say . 
Okay , fashionable ? 
No . 
I mean like no , I think it's very fashionable . 
I thi I would give it a one . 
Well , that's that's just like  that's a clay , it's a prototype . 
What do you think ? 
Okay . 
Yeah , it's a two . 
That's okay . Yeah . 
<other> Um 
does it feel good ? 
I feel like  
I think it feels good . 
I'll give it a two . 
What do you say ? 
Okay . 
Oh no , it's fine , 
you're  I mean you're Project Manager . 
Um yeah , I mean and it  
does it have voice  I mean the phrase recognition on it ? 
And there's no way you can represent it on here . Y 
<other> Yeah , so . 
Then yes , 
then I would  
well it isn't  
what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ? 
And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_ , 
so I'd probably give it a three . 
Even though it is  for just a T_V_ remote it's uh very advanced . 
But it is just a T_V_ remote . 
<other> Well yeah , so I'd give it a two . 
Oh , it's very capable of being squishy and fruity . 
Yeah . 
Okay , next . 
<laugh> So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner , 
and uh hopefully we'll sell millions . 
Good job , team . <laugh> 
<other> 
<other> What ? 
It <laugh> it does . <laugh> 
Thanks . 
Two . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , let's let's do a lithium . 
We're gon that's gon 
Nologically advanced , 
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh  . 
Yeah . 
We  
plastic . 
And special colour . 
But it's  
Yeah , 
but i so i 
But will we w actually we'll need two , 
won't we ? 
One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side . 
Okay . 
Like because there's like one interface right here and then  because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button . 
There's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides . 
So is that gonna be an extra one on each side ? 
Or three , 
because of one on each side and one on top . 
I mean it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine . 
Well less than twenty nine even . 
They're a special colour . 
Um they're uh they're a special form , 'cause they're indented . 
And , they're a special material . 
We're under . 
<other> I think we just discuss it . 
Oh that's true . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> No , yeah , that's a good point . 
'Cause I'd forgotten that that wasn't our decision , yeah . 
Oh , overall I mean I thought we did a good job like  
We got to choose  basically we had control over  
minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it . 
And we're a fashion forward technology company . 
<other> 
Minus that one fight . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I mean minus you guys being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ? 
Irritating , yeah . 
Wow that's a  it's definitely a strong one . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , and no internet . 
And the digital the digital pens 
were  
they were pretty cool . 
Yeah they were fun , even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them , 
but they are awesome . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
And these things whoa . 
Yeah . 
And Big Brother . 
<other> Yeah . <laugh> 
Um we are really gonna sell this . 
<laugh> Ta-da . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 'cause they're pretty 
and just like  
Uh yeah . 
Yeah , no , iPods <other>  
They want all those words for presentation , even the plugs . 
Oh yeah , everybody . 
<other> Mine is amber . 
Oh . 
Look at it . <other> 
That is a piece of work . 
<laugh> Wow . 
Marketing Director says yeah . 
Fashionable people will buy it . 
Oh , I will create desire . <laugh>
