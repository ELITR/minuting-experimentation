Afro beat orchestra ,

I assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control , 
we can't kind of build it into other uh products . 
For instance like a mobile phone or something like that . 
Or or you know can we produ 
can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ? 
Yep . Okay . 
Mm-hmm .

Now 
are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ? 
S 
does anybody have any initial ideas ? 
But  I'm thinking  I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design 
so touch screen design rather than button 
so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things . 
<laugh> 
Too confusing . 
Mm-hmm . Possibly . 
I'm pretty sure there is . 
I mean 
I I have a friend who has a P_D_A_ 
that he just points at his telev any television he wants 
and it'll figure out the <laugh> the specifications of it 
and will control it 
um so 
I th 
I assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world . 
Oh . 
I like the idea of the uh multi plate . 
<laugh> In in 
I like . 
We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well . 
<laugh> For those cold winter days . <laugh> 
Well 
if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it . 
If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either  
well 
there used to be those whistling devices 
but that's a little bit annoying . 
Th 
Yeah . 
That's cool . 
I think we could design into that . <laugh> 
Curves . 
We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ? 
<laugh> Slight difference I guess . 
No . 
Thank you .
