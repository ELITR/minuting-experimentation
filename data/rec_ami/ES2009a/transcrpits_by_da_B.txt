<laugh> 
<other> Guess I should probably try to sit up straight . 
Oh , 
I think mine's fallen off . 
<laugh> 
Wow . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh yeah , that's fine . 
Right . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I'm Nathan , 
I'm from California , 
and I'm here doing a Masters degree in social anthropology . 
<other> U_C_L_A_ . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Wow . 
<laugh> 
No . 
Sounds nice . 
Oh , wow . 
<laugh> 
There's more vomit there . 
Alright . Yep . 
Um  
Let's see . 
Yeah , 
that's the music I grew up listening to . 
And so there  
Something I miss about my hometown . 
Burritos 
that cost less than eight Pounds . <laugh> 
I grew up in San Diego , 
but 
yeah um 
La Jolla , P_B_  . 
But really uh I last lived in San Francisco , 
I haven't lived in Cali 
well 
I haven't lived in southern California since I was eighteen . 
It's different . 
'Cause in San Diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill 
and in northern California they steam them . 
Yeah , it really does . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Where you from in San Diego ? 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
my grandparents lived on um thirty second . 
Close t 
uh do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is , 
and 
Cafe Forte  
Cool . 
Yeah . 
Wow . 
Okay . 
Mm . Sounds interesting . 
Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that . 
Yeah . 
Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
S smaller's better . 
Simple . 
Oh right . 
That'd be different . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
It's gonna be too complicated , too crowded with buttons and things . 
Needs  it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes . 
Right . 
I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , 
because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
 something , 
uh we'll have to come up with a name , 
patent it . 
<laugh> 
Leopard print . <laugh> 
I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , 
maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote . 
Mm . 
True . 
Yeah . 
<other> I think so . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
'S true . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Alright .
