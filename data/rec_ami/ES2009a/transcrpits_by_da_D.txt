Are you sure I got it all  
head's kinda small . 
Okay .  
We're okay ? 
We're good ? 
I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee . 
Mm . 
Uh okay . 
Very official . 
<laugh> You're just gonna believe me , 
we'll go from there . 
Fair enough . 
Prove it 
yeah , okay . 
<laugh> 
Works for me . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
There you go . 
<laugh> 
I'm Sarah , 
I went to Michigan , 
and I'm here doing cultural studies 
and I'm the Marketing Manager or something . 
Marketing , 
yeah Expert . Expert . 
Fine . 
That's me . 
So . 
So 
do we have to wait for you to write it down 
or are you gonna tell us ? 
I'm waiting to know . 
Uh  
Fair enough . 
Oh , Smallville . 
I went to high school with Tom Willing actually . 
The guy . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Very much so . 
Hell of a soccer player 
but a total bastard nonetheless . 
Yeah . He is a big guy . Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Good call . 
Interesting . 
<laugh> 
I guess I'll go next then . 
Okay . 
Don't wanna lose all my mikes , plugged in here . 
Okay . 
This is basically just pen practice 
huh ? 
Okay . 
Oh you're much taller than me 
so I'm gonna write down here . 
Um . 
Right now I'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of , Chris Bathgate , 
local Michigan folk singer , 
really lame 
and uh 
uh what else did I bring with me ? 
Probably classical , 
to totally geek it out , 
yeah I think . 
And my family guy D_V_D_s 
but we don't need to write that one down . 
No . 
Are you getting it online , 
or is it on sky ? 
Yeah , that'd be nice . 
'Fraid not . 
Mm . 
Exciting . 
That'd be  . 
Oh . 
I didn't even read those . 
Oops . 
I shouldn't admit that . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
It's the five by five , I can't read that much . 
<other> <laugh> Yeah 
oh it's so horrible . 
Oh my God . 
Seriously ? 
It really is <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Slide it in there . 
Yeah . 
Yeah fair enough . 
I've already got more than I can keep track of . 
And I'm gonna go home next week 
and everyone's gonna be like oh my God you're turning into one of those people , 
no . 
I know . I know . 
Oh it should be interesting . 
Wait until I tell them I'm not coming back . 
They're gonna love that one . 
Probably . 
Or at least get a work visa for a while 
and then decide . 
'Cause  
nice . 
Of course . 
Oh , 
now I can think of so many other ones . 
That's how it works . 
Mm . <other> 
Oh  
<other> Any thing that are like free . 
Nice . <cough> 
It must make all the difference . <laugh> 
Ah . 
Right . 
Mm . 
There you go . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Makes sense . 
Uh . 
What they're looking for . 
And negotiate that . Uh . 
I don't think there's any rules about it yet . So  
Yeah . 
Mm . 
W 
yeah . 
<laugh> 
I like the little cover thingies . 
Hmm . 
Good idea . Start your minutes . Um  
Well 
it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal 
right , 
we decided that already 
and it may be functioning for other things , 
as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door 
or like to have everything on one thing , 
but then , I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons , 
you can't tell what they do . 
Yeah . 
Specific . 
Okay . 
Interesting . 
True . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Right . 
We want it to be munt multifunctional 
but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart , 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
An interesting option . 
Yeah . 
Definitely . 
Right . 
That  
Yeah . 
Awesome . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Keeping it nice and slick , would be important . 
And  
I don't know , 
like , 
there's such a problem with losing them , 
that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose , 
so we're gonna have to be careful with what like  
Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff 
but that would be really cool . 
Yeah . 
Fi b 
like 
what are they called , those face plate things ? 
Isn't there a name for them ? 
Are they ? 
I dunno . 
Yeah . 
Something really cool . 
<laugh> Leopard print or something . <laugh> 
Hmm . 
True . 
Right . 
True . 
Right . 
Right . 
Right . 
Probably . 
<laugh> Good . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so . 
Mm . 
Right . 
<laugh> Right . 
Mm . 
Definitely . 
Yeah . 
Or if you our users in mind , 
like 
these  grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , 
no it's  
they're used to the buttons 
so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to , 
and who we're gonna be able to get it out of . <other> 
But  
Euros . 
Mm . 
Mm-mm . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
With half an hour ? 
'Kay . 
Perfect . 
Cool .
