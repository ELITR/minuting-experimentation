Like that ? 
Okay , cool . 
Okay ? 
<other> Right , so 
I'm just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick . 
Yeah , PowerPoint . 
Yeah , well , 
you know , <other> <other> <other> <other> . 
Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . 
Right . Um . So 
just to kick off the meeting 
basically um so 
we're working now for a real reaction , 
this is uh so it <other> 
right . 
Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . Um <other> 
We're gonna just do a quick opening 
and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another 
um then we're gonna start  talk a little bit about tool training . 
Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . 
<other> Um <other> we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this 
and then just a bit of discussion close up . 
Um I  guess you know game or something um <other> in real life 
um so yeah basically 
I want to  I'm just gonna  you got  
of course you can discuss that , 
I'm thinking about um <other> uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell . 
<other> Um so um 
if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , 
um <laugh> y is 
Exactly . 
Um I mean 
obvi if if you guys  if if at the same time if you  like logically if something doesn't  like if I'm 
like 
we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book 
you know um 
you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it . 
I mean we'll discuss it 
but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like 
<other> yeah yeah exactly 
so , 
'cause we're  what 
we're sort of role playing 
is y g 
yeah 
you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well <other> um . 
And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background 
you know 
have fun , 
you know 
maybe you went to 
um <other> uh you know 
maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ 
but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that , 
why not , 
you know 
you can  this is 
you know 
I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . 
So are you guys okay with that 
does that seem logical ? 
Sweet . 
Cool . 
So 
I guess that that <laugh> we're totally  
we're making a remote control 
which is thrilling 
um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model 
I dunno if you guys had time to check the  
in real life I dunno if you guys uh <other> checked the um <other> uh the corporate website . 
Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , 
that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff 
that nobody really thinks about 
and try to make it nice 
you know 
like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . 
So um basically 
we are reinventing the wheel 
but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . 
<other> Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics . 
And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um <other> um the other designer 
that I can't remember , 
the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ 
right 
um <laugh> the Industrial Designer 
hey right on alright , 
getting into it um 
to guide me and guide us on this project 
'cause you're gonna be  you're g you guys are the bottom 
you know 
you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time . 
And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , 
you know like um <other> 
I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did 
but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee 
but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass 
so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . 
Um and so we'll work up from there 
and um then we'll meet on 
and talk about it 
and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me <other> tell us what's possible 
and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go 
take the the the take the basics 
and make it nicer 
and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible 
um to try t of sync it all up . 
So that's the detailed design . 
So it's a three stage kind of thing . 
Um right so 
for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it , 
I haven't tried it yet either 
um I'm just gonna start 
and um mm carry like five remotes around 
um and just write down  I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs 
you know 
if you  if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , 
if you wanna write all five go for it 
but name one of them that you could um . 
Oh , 
we skipped introductions . 
Nice . 
I'm a excellent Project Manager . Um . 
I'm Marty , 
um I went to uni at uh U_C_ Santa Barbara 
and I'm here working on a P_H_D_ in psychology . 
Um yeah . So  
Expert <laugh> 
Don't play yourself down . 
Expert <laugh> 
Where did you go to uni Nathan ? 
Oh 
brilliant . Cool . 
My little brother goes there . 
Right so 
desert island discs . 
Yeah . 
Well 
I'll t i 
no no yeah 
I'm just gonna write a couple of 'em down . 
See I'm a big music fan 
I don't know if you guys are , 
I'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent 
but 
there's some other options , if you're a T_V_ slut 
like I am 
like Smallville terrible television show 
but I happen to love it , 
it's rubbish 
but I love it . 
T the the main c the main character ? 
Wow . 
Is he a wanker ? 
He looks really tall , 
like he's gotta be like six six . 
Yeah . Um okay so <other> 
I really like Jeff Buckley . 
You guys heard of Jeff Buckley ? 
Um that's cool 
'cause like not very many people have . 
Um <other> and um oh well 
I might as well throw a British person in there 
um you can't go wrong with Radiohead . 
It's a r 
<other> Okay so 
it really works just like a pen 
only makes noises I think . 
It's kinda weird . 
Anyway 
yeah . Yeah , 
you're like press and it's <sound imitating vibration> . 
Kinda cool . 
You'll see . 
Alright so um 
whoever wants to get up next , you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want . 
Right on . 
W 
Mm . 
Nice . 
Okay yeah yeah . 
Well 
yeah . 
Oh , 
family guy . 
Isn't h has h

<other> I think I'm gonna start downloading it 
yeah . 
Mm-mm . 
Afro beat orchestra ? 
Very cool . Mm . 
Wow . 
That's what a PowerPoint presentation is for . It's they're designed specifically to ignore . I  it's  th brilliant . 
Ah yes yes yes okay I see that . 
Vomit . 
Yes . <laugh> 
Street pizza . 
It's so brilliant . 
<laugh> I've seen more urine in this city than ever before , 
I mean  
It's so minging . 
Uh . 
I'm going local . Going local . 
I have to be here for three years 
so I might as well get the terminology right . 
Oh , 
have you been home yet ? 
They'll be like , say something British , 
and you're like oh shut up family . <laugh> 
<laugh> Right 
you s you're gonna stay here ? 
Wow . 
Bad religion ? 
Yeah yeah , yeah . 
Well 
yeah 
that's why  
yeah . 
I miss coffee . 
<laugh> Burritos . 
Oh yeah 
two two bucks . 
Where are you from in California by the way ? 
Did you really ? 
What part ? 
Yeah 
I'm from San Diego as well . 
Yeah oh man . 
Going to s like North Carol 
I'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in San Diego . 
Well 
it's it's <other> i 
there's other things too 
there's  
you just can't place it 
like 
I  when I went to school in the U_  in Santa Barbara 
which is central California 
the Mexican food is okay , 
it's just not good 
like 
and yeah it's like two bucks , 
like literally two bucks for this massive  
I miss 
yeah 
good call on that . 
Um just literally just metropolitan San Diego , 
I live like five minutes from the zoo . 
So 
North Park actually if you want to get real specific . 
Yep . 
Yes . 
On university , 
yeah . 
Yeah 
it's actually like literally half a mile from my house . 
Yeah , 
pretty cool . 
Small world 
as we were discussing before . 
Especially when we're all from the same general region . 
Right so okay , 
success on the whiteboard . 
You can harness the awesome power 
a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C_D_s 
and things we like about the city 
you know , 
I think we'll  
Um right so <other> 
moving on to not fun stuff <other> 
uh project finance . 
Um basically 
what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros . Um . <other> 
This is what the finance department has told me , the C_F_O_ 
but I don't know , 
I'm not sold on this , 
it's pretty dear , 
I mean 
twenty f 
that's like you know forty bucks for a remote . 
It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me . 
Um so 
what 
we can maybe work on that a later 
but we're gonna make a lot on it , 
the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it . 
Eur internationally . 
So <other> um 
one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably . 
Um so 
something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D_V_D_s 
but um you know 
I'll leave that to you guys 
but that's something that i i 
it is gonna be an international sold thing . <other> 
Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty . 
So we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can . 
<other> Um s right so um 
just to close up , 
I'm not sure how much time I've used 
mm next time right Project Manager , sorted . 
Um . <other> 
Is 
uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so 
um <other> and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it . 
Um <other> U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there 
and you'll also get s assignments from  in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do . 
Um mm basic and um so 
I need you to tell us what um <other> we  what the user's gonna want . 
So 
actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have , 
you know like uh so  
yeah well it is 
<other> and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between 
um so yeah 
specific instructions will be sent in your email . 
But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um 
and as more things come up we'll have meetings 
and you'll get emails and so forth . 
Um any questions , before we get started ? 
<other> You mean to like  
Hmm . 
<other> Yeah . 
<other> 
Well , 
have a think about it . 
I mean 
I'm I'm certainly op it seems 
like yeah 
it it seems like it's certainly do-able 
isn't it . 
I mean um 
or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of <other> useful function . 
The clapper . 
No I mean <laugh> 
no , 
good idea , good idea . 
We'll see what  see what  
Uh-huh y I like that <other> 
Yeah . 
That's true , 
I guess we we probably have some time , 
maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do , 
go back to um  I don't really have any . 
Let me bring up something about our basic goals here , what we want to accomplish . 
Uh project announcement . Ts ts ts <other> 
<other> <other> Yeah . 
Not so much . 
All right 
we'll find them , we're on our own . 
Yeah yeah 
let's do it , let's do . 
I'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 
'cause  
Yeah 
I mean oh yeah right . <cough> So 
initial ideas . <cough> 
Yeah . 
<cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Yeah 
that's slick 
isn't it . 
I mean like <other> 
stylist <other> 
yeah like 
a just a 
yeah . Right so 
we got five minutes more to chat about this , 
perfect . 
Um so 
we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between um <other> uh size and functionality . 
Um and we also  
I'm also gonna note for future reference this idea 
of 
um <other> so you  like  
maybe like an L_  like a touch screen type of remote ? 
I don't think one exists . 
Be a good idea . 
Yeah all the other universal remotes . 
Um <other> I don't know if there's such a thing out there , 
I guess we could do some uh do some research on or one of us could do some research on it 
about whether or not there are um multi-format like um you know PAL , N_T_S_C_ , region one  
Okay . 
Okay . 
<other> Interesting . 
Okay . 
Okay . Okay . 
<other> Um all right . So . 
I li 
I'm liking that idea , this idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features . Um . 
Um . <other> Let's see . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
<other> Uh let's see . Um . 
Yeah yeah okay . 
Think they're just called face plates ? 
I don't know . 
<laugh> 
Um . 
Mm . But if we're bundling it  <other> unless we're selling their telly with the remote . 
Um <other> 
Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing 
that comes with the remote 
that you could place something else 
that you press 
and it makes the remote page . 
Kinda like how on a lot of um <other> uh cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes <sound imitating pager> , 
could we do something like that ? 
Um yeah <other> 
I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of 
um uh you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of 
you know  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
We do have the minimum am amount 
I mean 
we were talking finances 
I dunno , 
selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty  you know it's pretty expensive 
so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price . 
Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote 
that's black and you know m massive , 
some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere . 
But um have a think about what we can do , 
have a think about what we want to do , 
how we're gonna sell it 
and um  
Mm . 
Twenty five Euros . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
They're all weaker than  
they're all stronger than the Dollar . 
Although , computer parts , all  
if you're gonna upgrade your computer , buy it in the States . 
Like um 
do you guys know Fry's ? Huge computer uh electronics store ? 
They serve um  right they sa tha s 
they will sell things overseas 
so you can buy stuff in America 
and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about . 
Right so um 
let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , 
I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um <other> project documents , 
so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure . 
And uh right so 
thanks for that . 
Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about 
bef uh goi h h getting into . 
Um . Yes . 
Thanks guys .
