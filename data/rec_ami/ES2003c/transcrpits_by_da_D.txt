<other> Uh uh okay . 
I'll just  
<other> Uh I have a presentation  
I just saved it in the uh the folder . 
Uh . 
It's uh  
Components design . 
 . 
Alright . <cough> 
So  <other> Uh . 
The case uh le that's what I wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic . 
Uh but later on  we found out that um it can be rubber as well , or titanium or even wood . 
So uh 
we decide what it's gonna be . 
Probably plastic . Uh 
we need the infra-red transmitter . 
Get that off the shelf . 
Uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , um could be plastic w or rubber even as well . Um 
<other> if you go on to the next slide . Uh  
<other> If you go on to f uh findings , 
it's like two or three slides down . 
Right . So , 
this is what I found we can use . Uh 
three different types of batteries . Um can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else uh a solar powered one . 
Um . 
<other> Yeah . 
Uh . 
Yeah , 
I don't think it would . Um . 
And solar cells , I dunno about that . 
Uh . We should probably just use conventional batteries . Um , just like in usual remote controls . 
Um . Yeah . 
Um . <other> And these are three different types of  or two different types  three different types of shapes you can have . 
Uh one is a flat one , 
and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved . 
Um <other> the materials are tha there as you can see , 
but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved , 
uh which would be  
Yeah , 
and light . 
Uh , i think so as well , yeah . 
They make mountain bikes out of that , 
don't they . 
So it's really light as well . 
Um . <other> T yeah . 
Uh . Well 
for a curved , well I was thinking to  f for to sit in your  the palm of your hand . 
Uh maybe like this , with the uh joy pad here . Joystick here . And maybe um an okay button around here , 
so that the thumb can uh use it quite easily . 
Um I don't exactly <other>  
Double curved . It probably means  this is probably double curved . 
Uh whereas a single curved would be like that . 
I guess . Or not necessarily . 
Yeah 
like that . 
Whereas this is two curves . Um 
<other> so I guess that's what they mean by uh double curve . 
Um which obviously  
it looks better than the single curve , 
but uh you can't have it in titanium , 
which is 
uh a nice material . <other> Uh 
and for the buttons , um it can have the scroll wheel 
which they use in mouses for com P_C_s . 
Uh but um it requires a more expensive chip to use , 
and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive . 
So 
you have to decide , 
there's trade-offs there . Um 
<other> if you want the buttons to be  
oh yeah , 
if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well . 
But <other> you're gonna ha 
I reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . 
You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want . 
You wanna enter just the number of it , if you know it . 
So um 
I reckon we're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway . 
Do you think ? 
Yeah . 
So , 
depends where 
gonna spend the money if you want the f fancy L_C_D_ display . 
Yep . 
Yeah 
i 
Um  <other> 
Uh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control . 
If you go to the one before that 
uh so 
it just says what it does , 
translate the key press into an infra-red signal 
and this is received by the T_V_ . 
Uh the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press 
and then uh it'll send it to the tr the amplifier . 
And uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires uh interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , uh to uh get sent to the chip . 
So 
that's just how the control works inside . 
Um we have to decide on what buttons we're gonna use . 
 . 
Um  I think we can do it if <other> uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic . 
Um and then maybe use single curved uh case . 
Because we might need it to be curved for the uh thumb to use the joyst joystick easily . 
Um and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the L_C_D_ . 
Yep I'm finished . 
Ah , okay . 
<other> Oh yeah , 
I forgot to mention that . 
The uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber . 
<other> Forgot to say that . 
<other> Yeah . 
<cough> 
If you're going with the fruit and veg thing , <other> looks like a banana . 
F if you wanna design it that way . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh>  monkey <other> . 
The U_S_B_ for which ? 
Oh right , okay . 
But didn't they just say it's just for T_V_ , 
or are we gonna  
Okay , yeah . 
 they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber . 
Yeah . <cough>
