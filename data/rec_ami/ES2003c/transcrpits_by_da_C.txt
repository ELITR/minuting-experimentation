Cost is  
Yeah . 
<other> Yeah . 
 yeah . 
Titanium , the really strong metal , titanium ? 
Is it not also it's expensive ? 
Two curves  . 
Need an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ . 
Is that  did I  
Advanced , like three eight six advance . 
Okay . 
Okay , sure . 
Mm , if we only have twelve Pounds fifty , 
twelve Euros , not even twelve Pounds . 
Twelve Euros , what's that , like eight pounds or something like that , nine Pounds ? 
Okay , 
that's good point . 
I also have a preference for rubber . 
Based on my research . 
 digital . 
Is this the joystick ? 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Mm . 'Kay . 
<other> We go . 
<other> Okay . 
<other> So uh 
to gather my research , two basic methods . 
We compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool . 
And then we we research uh fashion trends in Europe , 
what's what's the new black , 
you know , 
as it goes . <other> 
Next slide please . 
Uh we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool . 
As in they want it to do a lot of good s 
they want it to look like it does a lot , 
and if it does do a lot that's a bonus , 
but they don't care so much , 
you know . <other> 
They want it to be  
that's sounds a bit like a contradiction . 
Technology technical  technologically innovative . People want it to be that , 
but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . 
So 
like the interface is really important . 
<other> And easy to use , 
it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important  I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point . 
People want it  I is 
it has to be cooler than easy to use , 
you know , 
if it has the newest features , even if it's difficult to use ,  prefer it to have the newest features . 
And if it's easy to use that's a bonus . 
<other> The fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , 
but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . 
How that relates to a remote control I don't know . 
But I I see <laugh> 
I come on to that in the next in the next slide . 
Spongy . 
I've als I've been saying everything's the new black . 
Well 
spongy's the new black as well . 
So 
we have the choice between rubber and plastic . 
If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it's spongy , then  can I skip the rest ? 
Okay . Okay , 
so 
kinda spongy material . 
So um so 
my personal opinion ? 
<other> Um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , obviously . 
But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future 
that looks cool , 
that's that's different , 
you know , 
that's  
everyone has a white remote control , black remote control , 
you need something cool . 
Like , titanium is cool 
but it's expensive . 
And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control . 
Um now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction 
or we stay totally away from it . 
Um <other> I mean the research did come up with fruit and veg , 
so maybe it is important 
for  
it's the up to the interface guy . 
So 
if we stay away from it , s you know stay away from it , 
but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit . 
It could be something like , I say potato peeler 
but I'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than I do . 
So 
I think cool is the key . 
<other> Few questions about a spongy remote control . 
I've never seen one before . 
I've seen plastic remote controls . 
I think maybe they were  
I don't know , 
back in the day when they first came up with remote controls , they had a reason for it being 
sturdy , you know . For being strong and sturdy . 
So um 
if we want something strong and sturdy , I say stay with plastic or titanium , 
but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , 
it doesn't matter , 
it's spongy material , 
it's not gonna break , 
you know . 
I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material 
because it's not gonna be completely squeezable . 
So 
how do things fit it ? 
And if we are gonna use spongy , we can say it's long lasting , 
you know 
it's damage resistant and stuff like that , 
so . So 
just to summarise , 
people want stuff that's cool , 
that's that looks like it's cool , 
and if it is cool then that's a bonus  
doesn't have to be um 
people like fruit and veg . 
We can either go down that alley 
or stay totally away from it . 
People like spongy material . 
If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , 
and how we can further promote that idea . 
And also , this was this year . 
So , 
things change all the time , every year 
you know 
they they always talk about this year , this is the new black . 
Well 
next year something else is gonna be the new black 
and we're stuck with last year's fruit and veg type stuff . 
'Kay . 
That's me . 
<other> That's a good point . 
You can incorporate names into the menu . 
Okay . 
Even news , music . Like they do on uh sky digital kinda . 
Yeah . 
 . <laugh> 
<other> 
Okay . Course not . 
Sure , yeah . 
Sure . 
<other> The noise for when you lose the banana , um f yeah , for when you lose the remote control , <laugh> it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that , rather than a standard beep beep . 
Y you know , 
you lose the monkey  the banana , 
y <laugh> you lose the banana , 
you press a button , 
and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana . 
S 
oh , 
I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control . 
Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s , 
you know 
you s you click a button 
and it finds the frequency 
that works with your particular television . 
But why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature , 
I I don't know . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
That's because televisions , they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it  . 
Okay . 
Is it is it actually a book of names to digits , or is it like a few pages ? 
<other> I was just thinking , if we were to store this information , some type of mapping . 
This person probably need to use this feature like once , you know , when you first buy the remote control , or whenever they buy a new television , 
so 
once every s 
Yeah , 
and it's  
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah , 
you see I don't  
some of these things kinda logically follow the others . 
How can  t 
product evaluation , doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype . 
Oh , that's the  okay , sure sure sure . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay , sure . 
At this stage we still have no no target audience 
or  
'Kay . 
And it's stylish . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Yep . Okay . 
Programmable memory as well . 
For the remote control . 
We've w definitely talking some type of  
Different . 
But you're gonna need some type of flash memory or something . 
Well 
something that doesn't  
you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed , you know , once you turn off the power . 
Yeah . 
Different languages , uh different skins and stuff like that . 
Sure . <other> 
I if it was customisable as in different languages and stuff , that does open  
it is supposed to be international , 
right ? 
So . 
It would make sense if you could  
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
The fruit and veg . 
This one . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Sure . 
I mean we are trying to promote a remote control , 
but we wanna keep the company brand as well , 
so . 
<other> I think so too .
