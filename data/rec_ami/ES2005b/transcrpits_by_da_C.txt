<other> Um <other> minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you , 
however , um there are some changes that I've got from on high 
that um 
are a bit uh  
well w what I didn't actually realise it was that the uh <other> this is for a specific television . 
So the all in one idea goes out the window . 
And <cough> they require that the uh 
actually I'll get to that at the end  point number four , 
um we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . 
So um , presentations , 
were you  anybody got , raring to go ? 
Raring to go ? 
Okay . Good stuff . 
Mm . 
Oh I need to plug you in . <other> 
Just about . 
Uh there we go , 
just screw 'em on in . 
Gonna have to swap them round so  <cough> 
now , it was function F_ eight . 
That's the wee blue one . 
Blue one F_ eight . 
Should do it , good one . 
Hold on , sorry . 
 and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at a time . 
<cough> Sorry , uh . 
<cough> 
P press F_ five to start it first . 
<other> Jesus . 
Excellent . 
Oh you wanna go back ? Just escape . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . Speech recognition . 
Hmm . 
We're als we we're looking at who buys it as well .  
Uh , which I think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual , sort of . 
 
Fifteen to twe 
<other> 
Okay . <other> 
<other> 
Okay , thank you . 
Um , <cough> follow on with Helen ? 
Yeah please . 
Oh , so we do yeah . 
Fun and games . 
Don't know if the cable's gonna be long enough . 
I think I just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well . 
Okay . 
<other> 
Function F_ eight . 
Hmm . 
There you go . 
Uh F_ five . 
Um , F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing . 
<laugh> 
Uh just a left uh 
left mouse button . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
'Kay . 
<laugh> 
That can come under Arlo as well . 
Uh . 
Uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar . 
<laugh> Uh okay . 
'Kay . 
 <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
<laugh> We hope so . 
<other> 
 
Yeah , particularly if we've uh there was a bit in Raj's about R_S_I_ and things as well . 
Organic <other> . 
Mm-hmm . 
Sales ,  . 
Okay . 
Yeah it's like a , yeah . 
<laugh> 
It's  . <laugh> 
Right . 
And also the company want to keep it stuck to the T_V_ for uh to keep down the production time . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
That's cool . 
<laugh> 
Um , do you have trouble whistling ? 
<laugh> Really ? 
Ooh . <other> 
Yeah , I suppose that's true . 
Well I suppo uh you could y you could have the 
you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ?  . <laugh> 
Hmm . 
Sounds good . 
Function F_ eight for the um the uh  
Yeah . 
<cough> 
Alright . 
Let's remember that . 
 
Mm-hmm . 
But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you . 
Sorry I didn't mean to derail you there . <cough> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Ah is that what that is ? <laugh> 
Well that's cool . 
If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control , yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Right okay . <other> 
Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ? 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Ah now it's fif fifty million Euros we've gotta uh we've g <laugh> 
gotta make profit , 
so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time . 
Okay . 
Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? 
Is that is that gonna mark up a lot ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
I mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it , 
so I don't think it'd up up the price that much . 
<laugh> 
Okay . <laugh> 
Okay . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Right . 
Yeah . 
'Kay , 
thank you very much , 
um I'll take that back . 
<cough> 
<other> 
Right , also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting , 
so didn't manage to forward it on to you , 
it is  
let's see , 
I'll find it myself , um  
<other> 
Ta 
nah . <other> 
We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . 
Um , <cough> dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind . 
Um it's only for the television , 
which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television , 
and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design . 
Yellow . 
<laugh> <cough> I presume . 
Um , everything , all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow . 
And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh  
I don't know exactly how sort of incorpor 
I mean , I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something . 
Uh , where am I ? <other> 
<other> 
Okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have . 
Uh , <cough> now , 
we had as listed options we had 
speech recognition potentially , 
flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface um 
we also want to limit the number of buttons 
so we'll pretty much take that one as read . 
We'll use the the basic functions for a television . 
No teletext . 
Um <other> 
okay hold on . 
Not enough buttons you mean ? 
So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a  
or it looks like we're just cutting on the um  
I do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it . 
<laugh> Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that , 
or maybe they'll send 
some information about that , 
about um what people , 
whether people would require um teletext in a remote  teletext option in a remote control . 
 <cough> Okay um  . 
So uh I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the  a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick . 
Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display . 
However that does sound a bit like the 
more complicated design that rav uh sorry Raj um 
<other> 
said people didn't like . 
Although I guess if there's a sort of  
If you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of Windows-style drop down menus or whatever , 
I think maybe that's a bit , going a bit far 
but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , 
and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have 
um <other> it goes to a different selection of buttons , 
so it sorta keeps it simple . 
Um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ? 
Okay . 
So  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Lost , yeah . 
That's cool . 
That's cool . 
Okay , cool . 
Um 
speech recognition I take it  
I don't , I've  
I know of no products um that use speech recognition well . 
Really ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , 
or a yeah an advert an advert for B_B_C_ two on B_B_C_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Uh-huh . 
Ah , that's a good idea . 
So like a kind of backwards remote from the telly . <laugh> 
That we should just stick on , 
yeah . 
Yeah . 
And that's a sort of basic R_F_ kind of frequency so it'll be cheap . 
Uh-huh . 
<other> Yeah . 
<laugh> It might do us out of a job . 
<laugh> Um  
Okay . 
<other> I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . 
Um so I think rather than  
and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that , 
so I th 
yeah and expense and the time . 
So I think if we're going to go  
well I mean like the thing about the  there's the problem with the T_F_T_ or the L_C_D_ kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of 
uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen . 
Um , but I guess not 
I thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem . 
Um <cough> <other> uh <other> 
and how are you about the glow in the dark material ? 
Is that  
Contrast contra well . 
Yeah , okay . 
So if it's dow it's d uh 
yeah . 
Or if it's down under the couch cushions 
um which is where I usually find mine . 
Um <other>  
Okay , well we can use  
we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , 
um if we're gonna have to  
if we're gonna have the logo on as well , 
bright yellow logo in our our um 
slogan . 
Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , 
and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . 
Mm-hmm . 
Alright , so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of um <other> uh of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then . 
Do you think ? 
Uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then . 
Okay . 
Um , okay so scratch that . 
Uh so we've got 
do we want to go with the T_F_T_ idea or the  is that far too expensive ? 
<laugh> Well I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean it's uh I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself . 
Um  
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Um no , I mean  that was going on ravs uh Raj's sort of um marketing research I guess . 
Um <other>  
Uh  
So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . 
Um .  
So that's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff , um  
<other> 
Uh <other> you were finding out about teletext . 
If you could find out that uh  
Um I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a 
um expensive , 
no ? 
Oh right , okay . 
Is it not the circuits that cost  
Oh right , okay . 
Uh well that kind of takes back the R_F_ <laugh> the R_F_ remote sort of idea as well . 
<other> Um . 
<other> Five minutes . 
Okay . 
Decisions . 
Uh , votes , let's vote . 
Who wants T_F_T_ ? 
No-one does . 
Excellent , 
so we'll go with speech recognition , yeah ? 
Um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . 
And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head , 
programmability . 
Uh  
<other> Uh o okay . 
And also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . <other> 
Okay , so . 
Um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well . 
So , it just helps me summarize them . 
And um I'll put any   
I'm I'm putting anything I do in there anyway , 
so uh  
Uh pro uh project documents . 
On 
A_M_I_ scenario controller . 
Where am I ? 
Project documents , yeah , it's on your desktop as well . 
<other> 
And I will tr  
getting strings of um information , 
I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , 
as soon as I get them now , rather than  
I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so  
<cough> 
I did  . <laugh> 
<other> 
<other> 
So  
Okay . 
<other> Yeah . 
More sort of um flesh-like than plasticky sort of . 
<laugh> 
Oh no , ethics , <other> that's gonna cost us money . <laugh> 
<cough> 
Okay , safety . 
Yeah . 
It sme <other> 
smells good for children . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> That sounds , 
yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball , yeah , sorry . 
Please God no . 
Um . Well , I wouldn't th I mean , 
my reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror , so 
I think just having it 
surrounding the logo . 
Yeah . 
And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the  
what was it ? 
We put <laugh> we put fashion into  
Whoops , 
it's not working . 
Can't believe I've forgotten it  . 
We put the fashion in electronics 
. <other> I bet that'll catch on well . 
<cough> Okay , any last 
worries , queries ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> S s <laugh> 
I know what you're thinking . 
<cough> Okay then , lunchtime , 
yay . 
Okay , that felt a bit more like a  something with order and and reason to it than the last one . 
This is quite fun actually . 
I really don't  
Yeah , yeah . 
Wow you've  your first page . 
I was just writing really big . <laugh> <cough> 
I've finished the meeting now . 
Oh , everybody needs k questionnaire . 
<other>
