<other> 
It's a inspired design . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <other> Of course . <other> 
So uh , I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling , 
and uh I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? 
Um , or if  
is that a function we want in the remote ? 
I don't , but I I know a lot of people do right . 
Yeah 
it just 
 I mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too , right ? 
<other> That's costly though . 
Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um , shouting , you know , 
uh and then , what would the response be ? It beeps back at you or something ? 
<other> Okay . 
Well , uh let me set this up . 
So I plug it in , press F_ five ? 
Function F_ five ? 
Or function F_ eight ? 
Okay . 
Okay . I think it's <other> uh just to lock it in . 
It's got it . 
<other> Okay . 
Um . 
<other> So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys , 
um so it's good you went first , 
and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . 
Um so Raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , 
and um he also mentioned that uh the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour . 
Um , a lot of the buttons aren't used , 
and uh <other> 
he mentioned that they're not fun to use . 
And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , 
there could be a little microphone on it , 
and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort . 
Oh yeah , yeah , that's true . 
Well maybe you could have a 
um hmm <other> 
tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes . 
Um . 
Yeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um , 
and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , 
um <other> and not computery , 
right , so more low tech and not too many buttons . 
So I took these all into consideration 
and also I have some limitations from the boss . 
Right um , 
and practical limitations which I kinda threw out the window . 
And so I did a little research 
and unfortunately all I had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we've made before , 
which include , you know , um space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains  
Or uh or a high speed train . 
<other> Right 
and having personally worked with all these products uh I have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these . 
Right . So , 
I figured , just put 'em all together . 
You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your T_V_ , and um 
as for the user interface problem , you know , too many buttons . Give it one button 
and and it's a  you know , for the the cowboy in all of us  
 I I'm not quite sure what the the function is there but  
Yeah it's a g I mean you could have a you know a  
Right . 
So I think I I missed the budget thing , 
it was fifty million Euros ? 
And we gotta sell twenty five of them ? 
Right . <other> Okay . <laugh> 
Oh okay , so I I mixed those numbers . 
Okay . 
Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , 
cheap plastic uh , you know , 
um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less . 
An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries <other> 
um , we don't wanna have it  
Uh . 
Yeah , yeah , we could do that too . 
Um , I hadn't thought of that . 
Yeah . 
Right . 
Right , 
so so <other> 
the unirs the user interface 
uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , 
but since we're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power 
behind our product . 
Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about . 
Um so here's you know , a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me . 
Um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that 
and um <other> 
you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that . 
<other> And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it 
and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so  
uh personal preferences , I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory , 
uh non volatile memory , 
just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting . 
Oh okay . 
And the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort 
and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles . 
<other> 
That's all I got . 
<other> 
Ooh that's tight . 
Okay , I don't think we need to screw it in . 
Just push it . 
Yellow . <laugh> 
<other> 
Yeah yeah . 
Well hmm . 
Oh it's  
They're act there 
there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a  some basic speech recognition on it . 
You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh B_B_C_ one and it goes to that channel . 
Yeah , 
it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . 
They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to B_B_C_ one  . 
Right , right , 
and so there was a lot of this , you'd be watching the T_V_ and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something , 
but if you can work around that that noise problem  
<other> 
 
Right . 
Right and then it would do just you know , uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise . 
What you could do then would be you have uh <other> a remote controlled by the T_V_ speaker , 
or not a remo I'm sorry , 
a microphone by the T_V_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 
'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their T_V_s . 
But yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the T_V_ speaker 
which  
Right , 
and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television . 
Right , right . 
Right , right . 
Um . <other> 
Yeah that's certainly possible 
then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . 
If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it . 
You just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , 
you know to change the channel or to uh turn the T_V_ on and off , 
you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range . 
And uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job . 
Well , hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve . <other> 
Hmm . 
Um . 
Mm . 
Yeah , no th the material's cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know , 
and then uh if you're , if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more . 
Right . 
Right . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Um yeah we're getting a lot of features now , 
I I think  
Yeah . 
Well , I think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot , 
you know they get thrown around , 
there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or uh get damaged . 
They're pretty fragile . 
Yeah mm . 
Oh . 
Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_ , it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits . 
And it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system , 
like a  
 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Yeah .  
Yeah yeah . 
<other> 
<other> So it should be when you save 
on your desktop , so it goes save as , or  
And then uh hit that little folder up thing again . 
Again . 
All the way to the top , yeah that's up to desktop . 
Right and then project documents . 
 
Mm . 
Did you get my email ? 
Okay . 
<other> Just making sure . 
Yeah . 
Wow . 
<laugh> 
 
We could go comp yeah . 
We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball . 
And it's got the thing on the inside . 
And there's no buttons at all , 
it's always on , and just yell at it , and it works . 
And then ch children will love it . <laugh> 
Oh yellow , yellow ball . Right . 
<other> Twelve thirty . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Yep . 
<laugh> Yeah I've been using up the pages . 
<other> Another questionnaire .
