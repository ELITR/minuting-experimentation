Okay . <other> 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Wow . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
So , sorry  
I was just gonna say , 
what was the question for this ? 
Or is  are you coming on to that ? 
Okay . 
So these percentages are are what ? 
Hmm . 
Mm , mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yep , sure , that's cool , um  
Yeah . 
I can turn my computer quickly if that's okay . 
Um , yep . 
Okay , and then what do I press , F_ eight ? 
Oh right . 
Okay , cool . 
Oh . 
Yeah . No signal . 
<other> 
Okay . Cool . 
Okay and then how do I press the the big one , to get it on to the big  
F_ five 
and I press that again to get it off as well do I ? 
Okay , so um I'm the interface design designer , 
User Interface Designer sorry , 
uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user 
and um I'm I'm also  
I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , 
so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it's a big concern of ours . 
Okay , and how do I press n just the next button ? 
The arrow ? 
Okay . 
So um I looked at existing designs 
and also um the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike . 
Um and what people  fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our T_V_ I think . 
So um what they like and what they find fashionable . 
<other> And ergonomics , 
we said um , 
I don't know I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself , 
but um maybe that comes up , 
I don't know . 
And the findings , well 
the basic  that was the basic function to send messages to the television set . 
That's what people want to do . 
Um , so they need to be included , um , 
but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones . 
I don't know how to get to them , 
<other> do I press F_ five is it ?  escape ? 
Oh okay , cool . 
I haven't got my glasses on so I hope it's this one . 
These are two leading um remote controls at the moment . 
You know they're grey , 
they've 
I mean this one's got loads of buttons , 
it's hard to tell from here what they actually do , 
and they don't look very exciting at all . 
Um , personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use , 
it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff , 
um , but there you go , that's what we're up against , 
and I think we can do much better than that . 
Um 
hang on . 
F_ five , 
okay , sorry . 
Personal preferences . 
Um , well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important , um 
Uh-huh . 
And um I thought not too edgy and like a box , 
more kind of hand-held more um <other> not as uh computery and 
or organic , yeah , more organic shape I think . 
<other> Um simple designs , like the last one we just saw , 
not too many buttons 
and as Raj pointed out , only ten percent  fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons , 
so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks . 
Um , hand-held and portable I think is portamint is important 
because T_F_T_ have just um released um I think is it a a remote control for presentations or uh and a big seven inch big screen , anyway , so um  
Yeah , no seven inches isn't that big 
but um anyway um so hand-held and portable 
and uh m I thought about other functions for T_V_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that , 
so maybe we forget about that . 
It's for one T_V_ oh right okay , sure . 
And so the last thing I thought 
w which I quickly mentioned in the other one 
was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark 
um which <other> does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think . 
Easy finder with the a whistle function or something , 
or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries . 
And I think that , yep , that's it . 
Okay ? 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Um , I haven't been able to  
Mm-hmm , yeah 
or some sort of voice  
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , something . 
<other> 
Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing . 
Okay . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah sure . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well I like that design . <laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
not a problem . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Or a little base station or something ,  . 
<other> That might cost more though , 
'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's  that's cheaper to just provide batteries . 
A battery in it , kinda . 
Okay . 
<other> Okay . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm that's a good idea actually I like the programmable options . 
<laugh> 
Mm 'kay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Corporate colour . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
'Kay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Although the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap . 
Yeah . 
Well  
Mm . 
On the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff . 
Mm-hmm , okay . 
Okay , cool . 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Um  
Glow in the dark material I was thinking . 
Um , so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think . 
Often lost s was that , 
yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm , 
mm-hmm . 
<other> 
Mm . 
 
Mm-hmm . 
'Kay . 
Well what about  
this might get a bit too expensive actually , 
but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal 
you know like the ones that we can't hear or <other> something 
um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep . 
If you find if y 
Yeah . 
Mm . Yeah , that's the only thing , yeah . 
That comes with our remote control . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
That could also be built into the T_V_ though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete . 
Yeah , okay . 
Mm . 
And the expense . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Maybe not even all of it 
'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important 
so maybe um just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , 
'cause what I thought , main  
Slogan , yeah . 
Right . 
Mm-hmm . 
'Cause yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark , you can um still see the remote control . 
That was more of a a gimmick . 
Mm . 
Yeah , unnecessary . Yeah . 
Mm . 
So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a T_F_T_ screen ? 
Yeah you think so ? 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm , that's cool . 
Um 
if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick . 
Mm-hmm . 
And where is it sorry ? 
Oh  . 
Okay , cool . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
<other> What I thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material , 
it's a bit more bouncy , 
like you said they get chucked around a lot . 
Um , a bit more <other> durable and that can also be ergonomic 
and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls . 
The rubber rather than  
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh I think wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as  it won't as have many sharp corners as that , so that's something good , um  
I dunno , I mean  
<laugh> 
That's a good idea . 
<laugh> Interesting . 
Yeah , d with the colour , um does it have to be all yellow , do you know ? 
No . 
Yeah . 
Having a little bit . 
Okay cool . 
Mm mm . 
Mm-hmm , okay . 
Cool . 
Oh yeah , that's a good one that . 
Yeah so . 
<laugh> 
Wow . 
Has anybo oh . 
Has anybody pressed okay , 
it vibrates . 
It's pretty cool . 
Yeah , got small writing . 
I don't wanna waste it .
