C:  <other> Um <other> minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you , however , um there are some changes that I've got from on high that um 
D:  Okay . <other> Okay . Mm-hmm . 
C:  are a bit uh  well w what I didn't actually realise it was that the uh <other> this is for a specific television . So the all in one idea goes out the window . And <cough> they require that the uh actually I'll get to that at the end  point number four , um we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . 


C:  So um , presentations , were you  anybody got , raring to go ? Raring to go ? Okay . Good stuff . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Mm . 
B:  Um . So how  
C:  Oh I need to plug you in . <other> 
A:  <other> 
B:  S  
D:  Wow . <laugh> 
C:  Just about . 
A:  It's a inspired design . 
B:   
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Sh do you want me to hold it ? 
C:  Uh there we go , just screw 'em on in . Gonna have to swap them round so  <cough> now , it was function F_ eight . 
B:  <other> So , after that ? F_ eight . <other> f oh sorry F_ eight . 
C:  That's the wee blue one . Blue one F_ eight . Should do it , good one . 
B:  Okay . Yeah . Yeah . 


B:  Uh , me again , Rajan the Marketing Expert . Uh , as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out , sorry , yeah sure . 
C:  Hold on , sorry .  and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at a time . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . Uh actually , sorry I have to see the other  , sorry . 
C:  <cough> Sorry , uh . 
B:  Yeah , thank you . Uh , yes , I have to look at the uh market potential for this product , uh , like consumer likings and everything , what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not ? Then  
C:  <cough> P press F_ five to start it first . 
B:  Sorry . 
A:  Hmm . 
C:  <other> Jesus . 
B:  Okay . Yeah , I can , okay . 
B:  Then . Uh it was function I want to go to . 
C:  Oh you wanna go back ? Just escape . 
B:  Uh , escape , okay thank you . Then if we look at this slide , uh these are in your shared documents , you can see , like  
C:  Okay . Okay . 
B:  Uh , sorry . 
D:  So , sorry  I was just gonna say , what was the question for this ? Or is  are you coming on to that ? 
B:  So , and  
C:   
B:   <other> And then  
C:  Fifteen to twe 
B:  Yes . 
C:  <other> 
B:  I think so . 
B:  So this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales . So um this is all about 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Okay . <other> <other> 
B:  uh market potential by me . Uh , yes , th thank you . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Okay , thank you . 


C:  Um , <cough> follow on with Helen ? Yeah please . Oh , so we do yeah . Fun and games . 
D:  Yep , sure , that's cool , um  
B:  Yeah we have to take that  out . Sorry . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <other> Sorry . 
C:  Don't know if the cable's gonna be long enough . I think I just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well . 
B:  Uh sorry , I have  . <other> Brian , this one also I  . Yeah . 
C:  Okay . 
D:  I can turn my computer quickly if that's okay . 
B:  Thank you very much Brian . If you want me to help , yeah . 
D:  Um , yep . 
C:  <other> 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Okay , and then what do I press , F_ eight ? 
B:  Uh F_ eight . Function F_ eight . 
C:  Function F_ eight . 
D:  Oh right . 
B:  Mm s . 
D:  Okay , cool . 
B:  It's not coming . Function F_ eight , okay . 
D:  Oh . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . No signal . <other> 
C:  Hmm . 
B:  <other> Computer . 
C:  There you go . 
B:  Computer adjusting , yeah . 
D:  Okay . Cool . Okay and then how do I press the the big one , to get it on to the big  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh F_ five . 
D:  F_ five and I press that again to get it off as well do I ? 
C:  Um , F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing . 
B:  Escape . 


D:  Okay , so um I'm the interface design designer , User Interface Designer sorry , uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user and um I'm I'm also  I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it's a big concern of ours . Okay , and how do I press n just the next button ? The arrow ? 
C:  <laugh> Uh just a left uh 
D:  Okay . So um I looked at existing designs and also um the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike . Um and what people  fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our T_V_ I think . So um what they like and what they find fashionable . <other> And ergonomics , we said um , I don't know I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself , but um maybe that comes up , I don't know . And the findings , well 
C:  left mouse button . Mm-hmm . Okay . 'Kay . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  That can come under Arlo as well . Uh . 
D:  the basic  that was the basic function to send messages to the television set . That's what people want to do . Um , so they need to be included , um , 
D:  Um hang on . F_ five , okay , sorry . 
C:  <other> 
D:  Personal preferences . Um , well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important , um 
C:   Yeah , particularly if we've uh there was a bit in Raj's about R_S_I_ and things as well . 
D:  Uh-huh . And um I thought not too edgy and like a box , more kind of hand-held more um <other> not as uh computery and or organic , yeah , more organic shape I think . <other> Um simple designs , like the last one we just saw , not too many buttons and as Raj pointed out , only ten percent  fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons , so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Organic <other> . 
B:   
C:  Mm-hmm . Sales ,  . Okay . 
D:  Um , hand-held and portable I think is portamint is important because T_F_T_ have just um released um I think is it a a remote control for presentations or uh and a big seven inch big screen , anyway , so um  
C:  Yeah it's like a , yeah . <laugh> It's  . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , no seven inches isn't that big but um anyway um so hand-held and portable and uh m I thought about other functions for T_V_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that , so maybe we forget about that . 
C:  Right . And also the company want to keep it stuck to the T_V_ for uh to keep down the production time . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  It's for one T_V_ oh right okay , sure . And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark um which <other> does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think . Easy finder with the a whistle function or something , or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries . And I think that , yep , that's it . Okay ? 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Exactly . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Okay . Yeah . That's cool . 


A:  Well , uh let me set this up . So I plug it in , press F_ five ? Function F_ five ? 
C:  Function F_ eight for the um the uh  
A:  Or function F_ eight ? Okay . 
D:  Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing . 
A:  Okay . I think it's <other> uh just to lock it in . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  It's got it . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  <other> Okay . 
C:  <cough> 
A:  Um . <other> So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys , um so it's good you went first , and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . 
D:  <other> 
C:  Alright . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Let's remember that . 
A:  Um so Raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and um he also mentioned that uh the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour . Um , a lot of the buttons aren't used , and uh <other> he mentioned that they're not fun to use . And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort . 
C:   Mm-hmm . But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Oh yeah , yeah , that's true . Well maybe you could have a 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  um hmm <other> tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes . Um . 
C:  Sorry I didn't mean to derail you there . <cough> 
A:  Yeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um , and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , um <other> and not computery , right , so more low tech and not too many buttons . So I took these all into consideration and also I have some limitations from the boss . 
D:  <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Right um , and practical limitations which I kinda threw out the window . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  And so I did a little research and unfortunately all I had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we've made before , which include , you know , um space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Ah is that what that is ? <laugh> 
A:  Or uh or a high speed train . <other> Right and having personally worked with all these products uh I have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these . 
D:  <laugh> <laugh> 
C:  Well that's cool . If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control , yeah . 
A:  Right . So , 
D:  Yeah sure . 
A:  I figured , just put 'em all together . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your T_V_ , and um 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  as for the user interface problem , you know , too many buttons . Give it one button 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  and and it's a  you know , for the the cowboy in all of us   I I'm not quite sure what the the function is there but  
C:  Right okay . <other> 
D:  Well I like that design . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah it's a g I mean you could have a you know a  
C:  Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ? Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  Right . So I think I I missed the budget thing , it was fifty million Euros ? And we gotta sell twenty five of them ? Right . <other> Okay . <laugh> 
D:  <other> <laugh> Yeah , not a problem . 
B:  Fifty million was uh prof 
C:  Ah now it's fif fifty million Euros we've gotta uh we've g <laugh> gotta make profit , so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time . 
D:  <other> 
B:  As a profit . 
A:  Oh okay , so I I mixed those numbers . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay . Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , cheap plastic uh , you know , um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less . An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries <other> um , we don't wanna have it  
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Okay . Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? Is that is that gonna mark up a lot ? Yeah . 
A:  Uh . 
D:  Or a little base station or something ,  . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , we could do that too . Um , I hadn't thought of that . Yeah . 
D:  <other> That might cost more though , 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's  that's cheaper to just provide batteries . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Right . 
C:  I mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it , so I don't think it'd up up the price that much . 
D:  A battery in it , kinda . 
A:  Right , so so <other> the unirs the user interface uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power 
D:  Okay . <other> Okay . 
C:  <laugh> Okay . <laugh> 
A:  behind our product . 
D:  <other> 
A:  Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about . 
C:  Okay . <laugh> 
A:  Um so here's you know , a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and um <other> you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that . <other> And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so  uh personal preferences , I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory , uh non volatile memory , just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting . 
D:  Mm . Mm that's a good idea actually I like the programmable options . 
B:  Yeah , me too . 
A:  Oh okay . And the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Right . 
D:  Mm 'kay . 
A:  <other> 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  That's all I got . 
C:  'Kay , thank you very much , um I'll take that back . 
A:  <other> 
C:  <cough> <other> 
A:  Ooh that's tight . 


C:  Right , also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting , so didn't manage to forward it on to you , it is  let's see , I'll find it myself , um  <other> Ta nah . <other> 
A:  Okay , I don't think we need to screw it in . Just push it . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . Um , <cough> dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind . Um it's only for the television , which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television , and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Okay . Corporate colour . 
C:  Yellow . <laugh> <cough> I presume . Um , everything , all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Yellow . <laugh> 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh  I don't know exactly how sort of incorpor I mean , I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh , where am I ? <other> 
D:  Okay . 
C:  <other> 


C:  Okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have . 
D:  'Kay . 
C:  Uh , <cough> now , we had as listed options we had 
A:  <other> 
C:  speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll pretty much take that one as read . We'll use the the basic functions for a television . No teletext . Um <other> okay hold on . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Although the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap . 
C:  Not enough buttons you mean ? So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a  or it looks like we're just cutting on the um  
D:  Yeah . Well  Mm . On the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff . 
C:  I do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it . 
D:  Mm-hmm , okay . Okay , cool . 
C:  <laugh> Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that , or maybe they'll send 
B:  About cost . 
C:  some information about that , about um what people , whether people would require um teletext in a remote  teletext option in a remote control .  <cough> Okay um  . So uh I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the  a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick . Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display . However that does sound a bit like the 
B:  Okay . 
A:  Yeah yeah . 
C:  more complicated design that rav uh sorry Raj um <other> said people didn't like . Although I guess if there's a sort of  If you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of Windows-style drop down menus or whatever , I think maybe that's a bit , going a bit far but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have 
D:  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . 
C:  um <other> it goes to a different selection of buttons , so it sorta keeps it simple . 
C:  And also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . <other> 
A:  Yeah .  
D:  Mm-hmm . 


C:  Okay , so . Um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well . So , it just helps me summarize them . And um I'll put any   I'm I'm putting anything I do in there anyway , so uh  
A:  Yeah yeah . 
B:  Here ? Sure . 
A:  <other> 
D:  And where is it sorry ? 
C:  Uh pro uh project documents . On 
A:  <other> So it should be when you save 
C:  A_M_I_ scenario controller . 
A:  on your desktop , so it goes save as , or  
D:  Oh  . 
B:  Uh it is in shared documents ? 
A:  And then uh hit that little folder up thing again . 
C:  Where am I ? Project documents , yeah , it's on your desktop as well . 
B:  Projoct uh projector . 
A:  Again . All the way to the top , yeah that's up to desktop . Right and then project documents . 
D:  Okay , cool . 
B:  Hmm . It is not giving anything . 
C:  <other> 
B:  Shared documents . 
C:  And I will tr  getting strings of um information , I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , as soon as I get them now , rather than  I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so  
A:   
C:  <cough> 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Mm . Did you get my email ? 
C:  I did  . <laugh> 
A:  Okay . <other> Just making sure . 
C:  <other> <other> 




C:  Okay , any last 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  worries , queries ? 
A:  <other> Twelve thirty . 
C:  Okay . <laugh> S s <laugh> I know what you're thinking . <cough> Okay then , lunchtime , yay . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> That's good . 
C:  Okay , that felt a bit more like a  something with order and and reason to it than the last one . 
B:  <laugh> <laugh> 
C:  This is quite fun actually . 
D:  Wow . Has anybo oh . Has anybody pressed okay , it vibrates . It's pretty cool . 
A:  Mm . 
C:  I really don't  Yeah , yeah . Wow you've  your first page . I was just writing really big . <laugh> <cough> 
A:  Yep . 
B:  Check here . 
D:  Yeah , got small writing . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah I've been using up the pages . 
D:  I don't wanna waste it . 
C:  I've finished the meeting now . 
A:  <other> Another questionnaire . 
C:  Oh , everybody needs k questionnaire . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <other>
