Um , now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh to the past requirements .

Um , we're going to do that with a seven point scale . 
Opening a Word document now . 
Okay .

just apart from the from the thing , so that you can uh put uh 
<other> rechargeable batteries in it and just  <other> 
Yeah , yeah , okay . 
Just an idea .

If you make it double-curved , it costs one Euro more . 
But  
No , 
but does it have a lot of extra uh  
fun function more like  
Yeah . 
Yeah , uh aesthetic . 
I mean , uh you make like eleven and a half Euros profit instead of twelve and a half . 
But  I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price . 
No , we can't go above that . 
Yeah ? 
Yeah , okay . Then it's okay .

Yeah . 
This is it . 
Ah no , we have to do all those hours again . 
Go back . 
One back ? 
Costs on uh  <laugh> No redesign . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah ,   okay , yeah . 
Hmm . 
I I didn't think so . That  there was a lot of room for it . 
But , that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us . 
It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there , 
and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff . Bu 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah , that's true . 
Leadership was uh crappy . 
<laugh> Okay . 
<laugh> 
No , leadership was uh 
<other> Okay , 
I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . 
Uh , you could have  
but uh , it was your first , 
no uh no disrespect or something , 
but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more . 
So like , I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting , and  
Yeah . 
But  
About me . <laugh> 
Yeah , you made up . <laugh> 
No , it  you did better . 
Yeah . 
Much more constructive . 
<cough> 
Two guys . 
Okay . 
Means . 
Digital pen , I thought uh th the first time I did individual work , I used it . 
But , a and the first two meetings I brought it with me , 
but I didn't use it at all after the first the first meeting . 
It's it's not real real use for me . 
Not really , no . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
like when you do this . 
Smaller ? 
Oh . Sorry . 
Okay . 
New ideas ?

I don't know what I mean . 
<laugh> Oh , I have some figure . 
<laugh> Here . 
The eva the evaluation , 
the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six . 
So that's fairly uh fairly good , I think . 
Uh , that uh 
all the requirements uh are true or very true , right . Yep . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
May maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here . 
And draw it , and it's it's placed over there . 
Hmm ? No . 
Ah , very bad . 
But  
I think this is better than regular flip-overs , 
but  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
but insert image isn't available ? 
Here . Picture from scanner , clip-art .

What I really miss also is uh 
<laugh> is a d is a turtle  
is a decision uh decision system 
like um  
With the evaluation , you have to Polls like , what do you want , a one , a two , 
maybe a a l a little application like uh uh <other> give your own number and click one two three four five six seven . 
Yeah , j ju ju yeah , v voting application . 
Just a little group group decision application . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , okay .

No , it's it's not very cheap , but that  
no , but it's a development inside corporation .

Yeah , it it has some cost , but  
Yeah . 
Real Reaction . 
 <laugh>
