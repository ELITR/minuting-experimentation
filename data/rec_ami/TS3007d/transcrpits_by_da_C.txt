<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Evaluation . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . That's gonna be t problem . 
Yeah , well sure . 
Hi . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , uh well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ uh screen . 
Well , these would be the main buttons , 
h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to . 
But , well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set-up . 
We have the  more advanced menu uh setting right here . 
We have the sub-menus and stu stuff . 
We made a top  oh , or a front view . 
Just so like you wanna uh back view . 
As you can see , this uh  there , there are uh two uh weird bumps in it . 
<laugh> This is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic . 
And uh this is for the artistic effect . 
Well , what we figured is uh we'll show you a picture  later on  
you have more b a better idea after that . 
But , idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh  with these two . 
And so when you put it on the table , it will just  lay down . 
It won't <other> uh roll around or stuff . 
But it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , 
or like these old uh phones . 
Y you you may get the idea . 
So thi this is about uh how we figured it should be . 
The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers , 
like we discussed early on . 
Uh , you would s you wouldn't see the uh straight panel , but more fluidly and round . 
Yeah . 
And uh , in these bumps you could actually uh  put some electronics 
uh that would  
you can make a more thinner uh design , 
and that would actually look very nice , yeah . 
And uh , about the colour , what have  
<other> 
Yeah , f uh , as colours , do you do you have the picture in uh  
Oh yeah . 
Now , well this is the idea about uh the bumps . 
Uh , you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior . 
It uh  
you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us . 
Yeah , it's like an e but this is for children . 
We we want a more adult version . 
But , this is like a remote control for children . 
<laugh>  . A weemote . 
Yeah . 
Hey , that's actually a brilliant uh marketing stand . 
Uh , but <laugh>  
So this actually basic the idea . 
We we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this . 
<other> And and for colours , we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey . 
Those are the technological colours actually , 
so it d 
Or blue or whatever . 
 Oh yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah , maybe  yeah , perhaps you're right . 
Uh , I I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical . 
Nah . Yeah . 
Yeah , 
li like like this like this . 
This isn't this isn't too much , is it ? 
I f 
Yeah . <laugh> The buttons , 
I  <laugh> 
Yeah , 
uh something like this would be nice . 
Okay , that's that's it from us . 
<laugh> 
Uh-oh . 
<laugh> <other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Why ? 
Yeah , it's not just uh designed for people under the age of forty . It's also designed for people above forty . 
So  
I have  
I've  
Yeah , two or three , 
because it's not just  
uh the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty . 
But it's also designed for people of age above forty . So , 
I'll say it's about three . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> Yeah , I I think  
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yes . 
Yes . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Leads to user face , yeah . 
Yeah , false . 
Uh , hmm . 
Yeah , the they are big and clear .  . 
Yeah , but but the teletext button . Yeah , you can ch That's in a menu . 
So , it's w yeah , it  it it 
it isn't entirely unclear , 
but 
 So , I wouldn't give it a seven . 
I would give it a more a five or a six . 
Uh , I don I don't know . 
What do you think , uh Mister Project Manager ? 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , it has these  all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape . 
So , if you so if you have <laugh> trouble finding it  
Well , then uh then I'll go for four . 
<other> Because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false . 
Uh , 
so I'll I'll go for four . 
Wha 
<other> 
Yeah , that that's a better question actually . 
<laugh> 
Well , if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , uh then you'd uh recognise it as , whoa , that is strange . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah , what is that . Uh , 
so it's  
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , rubber , is kind of soft . 
Well , <laugh> I don yeah , it is kind of  
It  
No . Uh  
It could  yeah . 
Functional ability . 
 . 
No , it's it  I I'll go for two . 
My vote's on two . <laugh> 
Yes . 
<laugh> 
Yes , 
it  
Yeah , they are built in . 
Not down . 
<laugh> You really like the parental advisory . <laugh> 
Bu 
Yeah , he made it . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
No . 
Me , too . 
Yes . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh , n no . 
No . 
Yes . 
No . 
Uh , we have one . We have one  
 . 
No , sev zero . 
Well , that's um  
yeah , speech recognition 
and s 
A zero . 
No . No . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Just go on . 
Then we'll see uh  we'll we'll see uh wha how much we are over budget . 
Zero . 
I don't think so . 
No , this is a standard colour . 
<laugh> Yes , this is a special colour . <laugh> 
<other> That's an add-on . 
No . 
These three . 
Well , we're only four Euro over budget . 
But  
Well , other case , we can make it single-curved or uncurved . 
Yeah . Okay , sure . 
Yeah , sure . 
Okay , 
well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved . 
And that would solve the budget problem . 
Yeah . 
It's just  yeah well , the single-curve that  
Yeah . Exactly , yeah . 
<laugh> 
We going to cut  
<other> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , we just make it flat . 
But , you do l 
Function . 
Worth , does it have added worth ? 
No , um  
Yeah , well let's assume it is . 
We we should assume it i that it is . 
But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion . 
R if you uh promote a kinetic um  I  kinetic remote control , I mean , that would b sell better than an  a normal remote control . 
No , well , y I mean uh , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k uh remote control is kinetic . 
You have standard old battery control uh remote con 
<laugh> 
True . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
It is possible , but you can't use double uh curves for titanium . 
That's one of the functionability uh  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well , I th I think you two , <other> uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel , you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project . 
'Cause I think m 
I think Jeroen and I , we had a more design  we could have more  we had more room for creativity than than you two . 
<laugh> Ha . 
<laugh> Nah , the leadership wasn't crappy , it was the leader that was crappy . 
<laugh> Nah . No , 
the  <laugh> leadership was okay . <laugh> 
Yeah , it was good . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Try to learn from your mistake . <laugh> And we will never do it again . <laugh> <other> 
Yeah , that went w it went well . 
It's it's just uh  
Nah . Yeah , we we had some trouble with the pen , but  
Yeah , but us  
Yeah . 
 
<sharp in-breath> Oh . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
No , I have it working . 
But , uh yeah , well uh  
No , it doesn't have that much added value to the  
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Know what I mean . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Or text function . 
Just t t type text , and that that would be uh excellent . 
Mean  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh . 
But uh ,  problem is , well you can't discuss anything  
well you you ca uh you can , 
but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now . 
We  I mean uh w w w one one person s maybe said three . 
But , well uh I  we said  uh , no I w th think two , because this and this , 
and then you can react uh on it . 
But if you you put a three on it , uh just <other> figure well , everybody knows what I'm knowing , so they'll all just put a two on . 
Yeah , but it would   yeah . 
Yeah okay , the  for processing part . 
But then uh , I think the idea of one person entering it and the rest uh discussing it , that uh isn't that bad idea , actually . 
<laugh> Not that your opinion isn't valued , but but still . 
<other> 
<other> 
Yeah , sure . 
<laugh> Y yikes . <laugh> Seventy five pages . 
<sarcastic triumphant sound> 
<laugh> 
So you you finished it actually , and so we just have to read it and say yes or no ? 
<laugh> 
It's not double . 
Uh , it's not double anymore , eh ? 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
On thing uh  
One small thing uh , 
the added functions . Uh , was it included in the cost ? 
I don't think so , eh ? 
It's very cheap . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Okay , um hereby is  the meeting is finished . <laugh> 
<other>
