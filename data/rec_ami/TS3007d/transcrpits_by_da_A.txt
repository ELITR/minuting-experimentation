<laugh> Wouldn't wanna be Project Manager . 
<laugh> Uh , what we going to do . 
Um , once again I'm uh gonna take minutes . 
So , um no presentation for me . 
Uh , first we have a prototype presentation by G_ and G_ . 
<laugh> Afterwards some uh 
eval eval evalu 
evaluation 
s <laugh> sorry . 
Uh evaluation crit criteria . 
Uh , in combination with the finance I um <other> uh I received uh a an uh an Excel uh file 
which we have to fill in later on . 
Um , you see . 
Uh , and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half Euro . 
So , that's uh that's a big 
l so let's uh wait it uh um 
we have we have must  uh , 
we must have uh some time for that uh because it will be uh  yeah , quite a lot of mathematics . 
And after that , uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the SMARTboard , with the with our laptops , with the  all uh all this . 
And uh afterwards , uh we closing . 
Once again , forty minutes , 
so uh let's start . 
I would g give the word to um G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation . 
J_ and J_ . 
<laugh> 
<hip-hop sound> <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<other> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
No , okay . 
It's called a weemote <laugh> 
Weemote . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , I can imagine that . 
Yeah , but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people . 
Uh , we had decided to uh put uh some flashy fruity colours in it , 
uh and uh in the survey from uh Milan and Paris uh it uh it came out that uh uh the d the older people are uh more willing to uh to spend money on extra features . 
So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard , 
and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they're willing to pay uh that . 
They want uh  <other> they want more luxury stuff , 
but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that . 
So , maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But , the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours . 
Not too , but w a little , 
because that's our aim . 
Yeah . 
Well , the buttons don't have to be uh all uh all of  
yeah . 
It  
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Thank you . 
The Marketing Expert . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Sorry . 
Okay , 
so we gon we gonna evaluate the 
Yeah , the the thing we  saw . 
Okay , just saw . 
Yeah . Seven ? 
Uh , true . 
<laugh> Sorry . 
Yeah , one I think . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Yes . 
No teletext buttons . 
Teletext is in the menu . 
Volume is true . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , big and clear . 
<other> 
Oh , okay . Well , I agree . 
I was thinking very black and white . 
<laugh> Thank you J_ . <laugh> 
<sharp inhale> 
<laugh> Fruity . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Well , we p we can do it glow in the dark . 
So , if it's in the dark place , you still see it glowing . 
I think  
Ah , you must see it as 
uh , w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls , there may uh uh be there in your uh T_V_ room , this one will stand out , I think . 
Exa 
I think that that's what it's about . 
If it  
if this lying on your couch , you're you're  you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing . 
So  
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> That's our remote control . <laugh> 
True . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , but not too soft we have decided . 
Three , yeah . 
Easy to use . One . 
Yeah , can it be zero ? <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Okay , two . Yeah , two . 
What's the time ? 
We also have uh to do the evaluation , uh the production costs and uh stuff . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
You're agree , Tim ? 
You haven't seen a more innovative uh thing in uh Paris ? <laugh> 
<laugh> 
False . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , but they are built in , so it's one . 
<laugh> Okay .  <laugh> 
Freak . <laugh> 
Okay , 
thank you . 
<cough> 
<other> We'll see . 
Mm . 
Okay , we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost . 
If it's under uh twelve and half Euro , then it's uh ok uh okay . 
But i is it  if it is b 
Huh ? 
No , this isn't right . 
Okay so ,  . Redesign . 
Oh yeah , if they under  Yeah . 
No . 
Oh yeah . Yeah , it's  
sorry . 
Yeah , if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro , uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation , as we have uh experienced it . 
Otherwise , we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy . So  
Uh , we have to fill in the numbers of the component uh components . 
We have to uh fil uh , want to uh do it in and uh see uh if we stay under the twelve and a half Euro . 
So , do we have uh a hand dynamo ? 
No . 
That's zero . 
Battery , one ? 
Okay . 
Kinetic , one ? 
Okay , solar cells , zero . 
Okay , uh simple chip on print ? 
No ? 
No , advanced chip . 
Sample sensor sample speaker ? 
Three ? 
Yeah uh , but it it's one one thing , it's three Euro . 
Uh , what's the sample sensor ? 
Okay . 
Zero . 
Uh , uncurved flat . 
No . 
But is it s it's not made from a single uncurved thingy and then uh  <laugh> and then uh  
no ? Okay . 
<cough> So it's only uh once double-curved . 
Okay . 
We're now in a problem , 'cause uh we have uh reached eleven Euro yet . 
Okay , 
but uh we have  
Okay . 
Uh , rubber . 
You . 
Titanium , no ? <laugh> 
Special colour ? 
<laugh> Yeah , but we want to make uh the wood colours , uh that uh  
Yeah , one . 
Yeah , but we we going to  
yeah yeah , that's true . 
But yeah , it's it's  it  
Okay , 
the push-button , no . 
Scroll-wheel , no . 
No . 
Oh , no . 
Yes , one . 
Uh , button , no . 
No , the the  
we don't have a s 
no . Okay . 
Oh , okay . 
So , um what's the thing we can change ? 
Uh , can I uh I say something ? 
No , can I say something uh as Project Manager ? 
The kinetic thing , can we just skip it , 
because uh you have to shake it , but that's not really innovative . 
Yeah . 
Yo . 
Sorry , 
yeah , yes . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Yeah , and not really  . 
But we  
if you forget about the kinetic , 
well if we do that , 
we shall  . 
So um  
Uh , b but i but the single-curved is just  oh  
Oh , okay , okay . 
So that's wh tha that's one option . 
And then w yeah , and then we could have it , 
but uh  it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look . 
No , tho uh that that can be done . 
So uh , 
okay , a little less uh conversation . 
Sorry ? 
Fill in   
Just a 
explanation . 
I can delete it for you if you want . 
So , if we do this , uh we're on uh twelve and a half Euro . 
And we're done . 
<other> Uh well , the only uh thing that don't  <other> 
Yeah , single-curved , but there's a curve in it . So  
Yeah , it's really a static value . Yeah . 
Yeah , it is . Oh . 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah . 
Do you think ? 
Well , now you can shake your remote  control . <laugh> 
<laugh> Kinetic . 
Yeah ? 
Who  
because if you want to go to kinetic , you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , 
and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise 
thing . 
And if you make the single curve ha just a big curve , 
<laugh> then it's uh then it's uh  
yeah , one big good curve . 
<laugh> I was going to uh say nasty words , but I don't . 
This is strange by the way . 
Wood is m is is is cheaper than rubber . 
We thought that wood would be more expensive . 
Yeah , maybe . 
But uh that  
this is this is it ? 
Yeah . Okay , this is it . 
I'm gonna save it . 
Yeah . 
Okay , well , 
considering we have  
<laugh> 
Well , we were above , so we did a little redesign  
Okay , um 
now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this project . 
Uh , some uh things . 
Were there uh room for uh  
was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
That's true . I agree with that . 
Yeah . That's true . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that's true . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Uh how about the leadership ? <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Okay , thank you very much . 
Now we're done . <laugh> 
Yeah , that's true . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . I notice it too . 
I was a I was also very uh unhappy , uh very unsatisfied uh about the 
<laugh>  about the first meeting . 
So , uh I hope uh uh the the the other meetings uh 
get better 
and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk  
yeah . 
Okay , so uh that's cool . 
Uh , teamwork ? 
Well , maybe that's uh only  
Yeah well , it's for us , because uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah 
and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed . 
But , really teamwork were you two uh  
The  
Yeah ? 
No hard feelings . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Now you you must push a little while . 
Okay . 
O Just uh  
okay . 
You can be  you can go quicker , 'cause then it it won't notice it . 
I follow the Master class for the SMARTboard , 
so I think that's the that's the main issue . 
<other> Um , so uh about this one you were uh you're dealing with , 
um the the the the digital pen . 
Okay . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
No . 
Huh . 
Well  
Yeah . 
M yeah . 
Yeah . 
And it is still your own handwriting uh popping up in uh Word . 
No , uh that's true . No . 
And uh the SMARTboard is uh useful , 
but the the pen is I uh   not user-friendly , I think . 
Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things , 
and that's the  
Yeah , but that's not th the the  you  
when you  at a foreign audience , you b don't gonna wr uh write uh small . 
Yeah . 
But maybe there's some function with  
no , it isn't . 
With uh  
Yeah . 
Well , I'm gonna erase my uh name . <laugh> 
Yeah , it's a big uh big eraser . 
Um  
Well , the the idea of the touch-screen is uh  
<laugh> 
I'm just uh  
I don't know what what I mean . 
<laugh>  <laugh> No . 
<laugh> Oh . 
Oh yeah . 
That's interesting . 
Okay , 
because what does it mean ? 
All the mo yeah , are between one and two . 
Yeah . Oh , okay . Yeah , okay . 
Thank you , expert . 
<laugh> But the new ideas found for uh wi with working with this uh software ? 
Not really , yeah ? 
Yeah , I think  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
You had expected it to to be uh more more uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yep , yep . 
Yeah , that's true . 
Yeah , 
and and maybe some uh functions for uh <other> uh uh circle or uh a square . 
You have to draw it yourself now . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that that can be done already . 
But not the the the the predefined uh squares I think uh  
Hmm ? 
Sorry ? 
Well , that's nice . 
Is it  
Here . oh . 
Oh , sorry . 
Yeah . Here , that . 
So you have  
as you saw , you have a little uh  
Oh , you can  
Yeah , 
thank you . 
You can go uh 
there . 
So there the the the functionality is there , 
but it's not it's not ideal , 
and it's it's very  
it costs a lot of time to uh 
to use . 
And that's a pity , 
if you uh if you have uh thirty , forty minutes uh for this kind of things , 
and we are now with four people , 
but it  
well , imagine you are here  you're with the ten people and everyone uh  
Yeah . 
Two minutes of drawing , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah yeah . 
Yeah , just like he said with the with the  a screen which you can write , also uh a kind of voting uh mechanism . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay , so  
Uh well , just about , 
because uh 
<other> Yeah , tomorrow ? 
Uh , the costs are within the budget . 
Uh , the project is evaluated . 
But , before we going to celebrate , uh I have uh a little question which you can't answer , 
because uh there must be some kind of end report . 
I am busy with the end report right now . 
You might thinking what the hell was he doing uh  
Uh about all the meetings , what we have decided , 
a r r a report of this day . 
Uh , that must be made , 
but I don't know , 
<other> here is uh standing uh whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is  
Okay well , that uh that can be done . 
Maybe we can do it uh together . 
You can see what I've uh  
yeah ? 
So I I s I will uh put it on a story-board . 
You can see it . 
Because I think it will uh it must be uh  
Yeah , it's a three uh  with seventy five uh  
<laugh> Yeah , just about . 
Well , just a moment . 
End report . 
No no no , 
I'm just uh  
you can s you can read it 
and uh  here here it is . End report . 
Well , this not nit it  
read-only . 
But it's not uh fully finished yet . 
Um , this is about the functional design , 
the things  yeah yeah . 
Oh yeah . 
I'm uh  
when I said it , I remember I had it here . 
Marketing Expert , 
okay . Um 
about the three functions where  uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control . 
Um , it must be uh simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . 
So , this is really about wh uh what kind things uh must be in it and uh  
yeah . 
Yeah , I understand you , I can talk a little bit Dutch . <laugh> 
Oka okay , okay , 
I  
I really <other> didn't knew that . 
So , this one's first . 
You go there and you go there . 
So , okay . 
Well , maybe I can then do it 
one two three . 
If the order is in uh  is is uh important , 
that's the word for  . 
Uh , 
<other> then the conceptual design . 
Uh , well all the things we have uh discussed , 
uh the energy , which uh turn out to be uh batteries , 
so that's  
Yeah , because  yeah . 
Uh , he here it is still double-curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable . 
Uh , the buttons 
 Hmm ? 
Not double anymore . 
Nay but that  this is what um  
Yeah . 
And the the added functions like Tetris snake , 
it's under the parental control , 
the touch-screen . 
So , it's uh just a summary of what uh we had discussed uh  
Uh , it's very cheap , 
you you maybe you you you you come at uh  
It's very necessary . 
Yeah , but it still has some  
yeah . Okay , 
but so we can discuss that uh 
we can discuss that kind of things I think with the with the the board of uh  
What's it what's the company called ? 
I just keep forgetting it . 
Real Real Reaction . 
<laugh> Real Reaction , yeah . 
Okay , so uh anybody uh misses something here about uh  
Yeah , okay , 
that's that's what I'm gonna write b between now . 
But , i in here nothing uh  
Mm-hmm . <other> Yes . 
Yeah , touch-screen I've mentioned . 
Yeah , okay , 
well I gonna redesign uh something now . 
No . 
Because I think it will  
Oh , five minutes from  to finish meeting . 
<laugh> 
Oh , that's cool , Tim . 
Finish meeting now . 
Well , I'm I'm 
I'm going to finish my end report . 
I am the one who can say that . Yeah ? 
Hereby the meeting is finished . 
Yeah .
