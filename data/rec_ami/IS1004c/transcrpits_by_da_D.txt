Okay ,  . 
<laugh> <cough> 
Yep . 
Four , yeah . 
Yeah that's me . 
<cough> Uh . Well I investigate the preference more d 
I investigate deeper the preference of the users . 
Uh so the the current investigation th uh th uh 
sorry 
the current 
the n 
current trends ? 
Yeah ? 
Okay . 
<laugh>  Okay . <cough> 
Well wha <cough> what I found  
um can you  
Yeah . 
Thank you . 
What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . 
After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , 
but the most  
what they what they find more more interesting , more  or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel . 
So now more more cool aspect , ma more  a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with  
instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to to watch , to see . 
Uh also  
Well <cough> in in Euro in in Paris and and <laugh> Milan the  <laugh> 
in Paris and in Paris and Milan the the current trend of  uh of clothes , furniture and all this 
all this fashion it's <cough> it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables . 
And also <cough> in the in the U_S_A_ the the current  the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy . 
Spongy means eponge ? 
So maybe we should we should think in in this direction , so  
<laugh> 
Fruit vegetables is the the new  
have you seen the last exposition of clothes in Milan ? 
Yeah , I I didn't miss an <laugh> 
I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes . 
No no , not not yet , not yet . 
Yeah , yeah . 
So te textu textures , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Vegetable textures and all this kind . 
Uh <laugh> 
yeah , yeah . 
Uh no no , it's not . 
<cough> It's  <laugh> 
And  
Um . 
 I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit , 
but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may  could remind some kind of vegetable , 
some kind of 
instead of vegetable , some natur mm uh natural object or something . 
But yeah it it depends on the  
Yeah maybe the shape the shape  
No , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different . 
So we shouldn't be at re really attached 
to to the trend 
but  
For instance , yeah . 
African or as an elephant ? 
<laugh> 
Well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing . 
I think in my opinion we should focus on on young people 
because they are more open to new devi new devices 
and also yeah according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was 
<cough> was was able to 
to buy a a n a cooler remote control . 
What ? 
What ? 
Yeah ? 
Uh  
Is the new trend 
of the  
<laugh> 
No I think we we should think about a a shape with it  
a device with a shape of some  
Yeah . 
Don don't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ? 
Or m 
Maybe . <other> 
Um  
Yeah . 
Yeah but I li I like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons b buttons so 
Uh do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros ? <laugh> 
I think  
Well , according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation , 
so , I will give more importance to the look and feel than  rather than the 
new inputs 
and also it's  I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_ 
because you need uh internet connection , you need more things , 
it's not just buying a new control re remote , you need  buying control remote , buying uh 
more things . 
It's not so simple . 
For instance , yeah . 
Yeah for for for  given an an example yeah . <cough> 
Yeah no , it's what I already said . 
Yeah but you can u 
Yeah but the  can we use it for saying okay , channel fifty , channel twenty ? 
M Mando . 
Banana-mando yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> Looks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
What's a turbo button ? 
It con it controls the speed ? 
Yeah . 
So sounds crazy . 
I like crazy ideas . 
Yeah , of course . <laugh> 
I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so . 
You  
we can ? We can't . 
Yeah , but we can say channel twenty five . 
No ? 
It's not a lot one hundred templates , 
it's not  
Ah , it's designed for a cof <laugh> okay . 
Is it design for a coffee machine ? 
<laugh> Okay . 
<other> Yeah . 
Maybe you could ask your  the 
 you could ask the engineering department if we can  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Actually 
I was thinking that the 
the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy . 
<other> Uh I don't know the name o o in English uh  
<laugh> This  
it's not a fruit it's a vegetable . 
Green . 
And you put in the salad . 
Um 
Oui c'est ca 
Pepper . 
And it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of  
No , 
I mean in a  
I'm sure it's fun . <laugh> 
But banana is not so handy , 
I think that's handier . 
<laugh> 
Yeah you're right . 
I think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits . 
No but I think just one fruit to control everything . 
A power fr a power M a Mando , a Supermando fruit <laugh> . 
Actually I I didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control . 
So you you have to buy two things , the banana and the basis station . 
Yeah . 
Yeah but I'm a bit worried about the budget .  
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
No , I I  
<laugh> 
Maybe li like that . 
<laugh> 
What about what about this shape ? More or less . 
Yeah , 
but how many buttons do we need ? 
What a 
What about  
<laugh> 
Four millions ? 
<laugh> What about a  
I wo what about adding the  this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying  volume up volume down ? 
It's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really uh innovative 
and I don't know if it would cost a lot , just a few  five words . 
<laugh> Okay . 
Plus plus , okay . 
Maybe objective banana ? <laugh> 
Thank you .
