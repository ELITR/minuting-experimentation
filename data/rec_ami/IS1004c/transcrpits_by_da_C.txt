Afternoon . 
Yeah , 
we had falafel . 
<cough> 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Spongy means it it's like sp 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
But what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ? 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Means buttons are in the shape of fruits , 
buttons are in the frape  shape of fruits or something , apple , banana , something like that . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
That we can discuss afterwards <laugh> . 
Banana . 
Mm-hmm . 
I don't th 
it will be rolling a lot . 
But it's just a speaker right ? 
It's not a microphone . 
Mm-hmm . 
Actually I'm not reading microphone there , 
so that's why you can all have conversation , it  just to speak to you . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
In-house . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah okay , 
let's go ahead . 
Stable thing , that's right . To have  , 
mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Communicate . 
It's one way . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , that's right , yeah . 
<laugh> 
So it's a speech synthesis kind of thing , 
something has been uh stored and it's just uh spoken out . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . That's right . 
That's right . 
So this is going to be about the component design . 
So first thing is we need power source for the remote control . 
So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies , 
one is the usual batteries which are there , 
they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing 
and on top of that we can have solar cells , 
when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind . 
Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your  if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , 
there should be some flexibility in t 
Yeah . 
So there should  
we should think of something like that 
and then it should be double curve . 
The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . 
Then controls 
for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them . 
Double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if I'm right . 
So it's symmetrical kind of thing , whatever it is . 
So , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what what we want . 
So there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves . 
These are the three things , 
and there are different materials , 
with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve . 
So there there was uh there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , 
but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one , 
it'll bring the cost down 
and anyway it's  
Wooden cases  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Is it an e apple which has  
Banana is more handier as compared to this I think , and to capsicum . 
Okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated , 
just  
and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing . 
These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company 
and we we can go ahead with that . 
Yeah , we can go to the next slide . 
Then uh there are different kind of chips , 
one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . 
So we can have regular chip for control . 
Pricing is a factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip . 
And uh regular chip supports speaker support , 
so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced . 
It could be a beep kind of thing . 
Yes , yes , that's right , it's it's onto the chip , 
most most probably , not not hundred per cent sure about that . 
That will be the volume control I think which which a user shou it it should be already pre-defined . 
It should be  whatever will be the case , the chip is always going to be sitting inside . 
Mm-hmm . 
Uh , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better . 
As  
or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place , 
so that  
That's right . 
Okay . Yeah . 
So these these were the component selection and these things . 
We can go to the next slide . 
And uh these were the findings which I I saw with the web web , 
that user wants to have control more than one device  wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , 
so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_ , 
because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything , 
so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us . 
Mm . 
Of fruits . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> Remotes 
 objects , okay . 
<laugh> And uh as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing s 
and we should have it on the remote . 
So you're having a basis station . 
Okay . 
Your  
usually your remote sits on that . 
So you  
and it's  that's why it can have chargeable batteries . 
Now let's say  
Basis station is with the thing . 
It's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there . 
So now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries , they're rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost . 
So you're having the basis station and there is a button , 
if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is . Uh  
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , 
mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
Uh this is  
basis station is nothing more , just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits . 
That's right . 
But all these things are usually in-house so we don't have much problems . 
So component cost is going to be the least . 
Anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , 
L_C_D_ has already been ruled out , A_S_R_ has been ruled out . 
So it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly . 
And  
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
A  yeah , otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get b any feeling then . 
It's neither a banana nor a  
And uh going to the last slide . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay , 
so . Anyway , users'll be  
so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes . 
So that was very  
I thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody . 
That's it . 
Yep . 
Mm-hmm . 
That's right . The basis station . That's right . 
There's less space on this to put with the buttons . 
Uh what about a  
The base station . 
Right . 
Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
That's right , yeah , we need that , yeah . 
Basis station . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Turbo button . 
Okay . 
Uh for the remote ? 
Remotes don't have power on off switch . 
Okay . 
S no , that'll be controlled by the  
those buttons'll be there already , yeah . 
Means on the remote . 
Because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as well as buttons . 
They are not going to cost you much , 
everything is in-house 
and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this . 
Oh , yeah . 
That's that's another issue which I didn't think of . 
But you know our targets are very high , means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make . 
Twenty five . 
Twelve point five is the profit on one . 
Uh forty th four . 
Point point four million ? 
Point four million . 
<laugh> In the market . 
Mm-hmm . 
For the future prototypes . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
So meeting's over ? 
Okay . Okay . 
Okay . 
Thank you . 
The problem is after all this meeting there is  <laugh>
