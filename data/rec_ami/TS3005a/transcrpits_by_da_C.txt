Good morning . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay , uh 
I'm  
uh I'm the Industrial Designer 
and I uh hope to uh  look forward to uh a very uh pleasing uh end of this uh project . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
<other> 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
Seal , a seal . <laugh> 
A be <laugh> 
Mm . 
With a tail and a mouth . 
Snail . <laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Sure . 
<laugh> The hell . 
Make that cute . <laugh> 
 
<laugh> Tall . <laugh> 
B <other> 
Bunny rabbit . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> Okay , um . 
Uh I uh draw I 
I've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence . 
One of the most intelligent uh 
animals in our world . 
Yeah intelligent . 
I've I've uh  
Eraser . 
Pen . 
Well not perfect , but okay . 
<laugh> 
A lot of buttons . 
And you always lose them . 
A lot of buttons which you don't use 
or who you don't use 
Complex . 
Not user friendly . 
 
 
 
Mm . 
Black colours . 
 They use batteries 
and  batteries 
uh and poor signal . 
Uh . 
Yeah , 
different remote controls , 
yeah . 
Uh for the use of different uh devices <other> . 
 
Yeah 
but you could uh I thin uh 
there's a possibility to g uh to uh to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection 
so that if y y you only get to see them when you need 'em . 
That's possible , 
so that you only get the  
No n n no , 
just <laugh>  
Uh for example you got th uh the same size uh remote control you use everyday , 
but um <other> the usual buttons such as uh um <other> zapping uh as you call it in Dutch . Uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly . 
Or uh <other> the numbers , of course . 
But uh not uh the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television . 
You only use those uh the first time , 
or . 
So . Uh . 
Yeah , I think so , yeah . 
 
Yeah , uh teletext . 
 think so . 
Okay . 
Right . 
Uh . 
Yeah I I understand . 
<other> No . 
Yeah . 
When I think of it uh 
I think the main idea uh of this remote remote control is uh 
to make it user friendly . 
So uh 
I think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control , they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television . 
So uh 
it only has to have uh the most used buttons . 
You don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television . 
In those  in that  
Yeah 
but I  
but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference  different televisions sets on one remote control . It's impossible . 
Because uh for example Sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for  to see on one side of the screen uh teletext , and on the other side uh just n uh regular television . Uh  
Yeah , 
but uh they don't use the same signal , uh on remote control . 
Because you can't use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television . 
Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay , 
but <other> uh I think that most people uh th uh will buy the remote control because <other> 
because uh the first  they lost the one they lost first one 
or the first one is broken , 
so uh uh perhaps they have a got a an older television , 
so that option is not <other> uh optional for those uh people . 
Yeah , yeah . 
So we should take that in consideration . 
Oh mm , 
no . 
Things'll come up . 
<laugh> 
Stop the meeting now <other> . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
No ? 
No , 
the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design , 
and the in uh usability interaction  
Yeah , okay . <laugh> Okay . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
No . 
Okay . 
Oh . 
<laugh>  No problem . Okay . 
Alrighty . Okay . 
<other> <laugh>
