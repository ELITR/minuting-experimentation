Good morning . 
<laugh> 
Well <laugh> 
Well uh 
I'm uh  
and my uh function is User Interface Design , I think . 
<laugh> So uh 
that's me . 
Me too . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh . 
<laugh> 
<other> So we can't erase anything . 
Right . 
Alright . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
It's a sheep . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
 A beaver . <laugh> 
It's weird . <laugh> 
It has wings ? 
<laugh> Well 
the snail doesn't have legs . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh right . 
<laugh> 
Well . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
It's a giraffe . 
Or a dinosaur . <laugh> 
 
Yes . Giraffe . 
<laugh> 
Should I uh  
Alright . 
So 
I can draw , 
but uh  
Uh . Well . <other> Oh . 
<laugh> 
 
Oh wrong one . Uh . 
 
<laugh> Well uh 
you can guess what it is , I hope . <laugh> 
It's a rabbit . 
<laugh> And uh well uh 
it's uh quick , I guess . 
That's uh my uh favourite animal . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
A dolphin . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Right . 
Well . 
<laugh> 
With an E_ . 
<laugh> 
You can try out the eraser now . <laugh> 
 
<laugh> Not really . <laugh> 
 
I always lose them . 
<laugh> Yes . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
 
 search for the buttons , which one is which 
and uh  
<laugh> 
Well . 
Perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls . 
<laugh> Yes , 
perhaps you can integrate them or something . 
Yes . 
Your stereo and your T_V_ 
and uh . 
Perhaps that's an idea . 
Yeah , that's right . 
And which you don't use . 
Right . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
You should just give it to  . <laugh> 
<laugh> Changing channel . 
Yes . 
But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it . 
Because uh things for uh teletext , I dunno uh , <laugh> w 
what's the name ? 
Yeah . 
But <other> 
But if if it's if it's international you should uh look in  
think in Britain they have uh different things they can do with the T_V_ , 
or so uh that you can choose what you want to see . 
I dunno if you should uh take that in consideration , 
or that you just should aim for the normal T_V_s 
that uh  
And the B_B_C_  . 
Yes  . 
Yeah , 
I don't know if the they have that anywhere else , though . 
Yeah , we can leave that  . 
Yeah . 
Well 
but 
but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search . 
That's not  
Yeah , that's right . 
Yeah that's uh  . 
Well not everywhere . 
Yeah , 
you can choose the code  . 
Yeah . 
But the people have a new television , 
and c if you look into the future , then they want  will want the button , if their thing is broke . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Guess not . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah 
meeting will close in five minutes . <laugh> 
Hmm hmm . 
No 
interface . 
No 
the  
Yeah . 
 
So  
So 
I should look at uh what you should be able to do with the remote , 
or uh , or how  I don't really  
Right . Alright . 
<laugh> Me too . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Alright . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Okay . <laugh>
