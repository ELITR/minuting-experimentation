Okay . 
So welcome back . 
What do   do we have to do ? 
<other> 
So 
first . I want to say I'm the secretary , 
so I make the minutes . 
You find them in your  in the map in the From the group . 
There's the minutes from the first meeting . 
You'll find the next minutes also there . 
Then <other> 
I wanna hear from you , what you've done . 
And after that I have some new product requirements . So  
And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . 
And then we're ready . 
We have forty minutes for this meeting . 
After that we'll have lunch . 
So first I wanna ask the  <sing-song pause filling noise> Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So  
Yeah on your computer , or the  
What's the name ? 
What's the name of it ? 
It's the technical function or the functional requirements . 
<laugh> 
Working design . 
Working design . 
What is this ? 
Product documents . 
On the desktop . 
Up . 
 up . 
Up . Up . 
Up . 
Yes . 
My Documents . 
Nope . 
Gone . 
<laugh> Well you  Um  Nah . Nah , nah , nah .

<laugh> And  
Presentation of working design . 
Save as  . 
Uh it's  
Project  . 
Save . 
Very good . 
Okay . 
So  <other> 
Now have ten minutes to tell it . 
Okay . 
<other> 
Oh oh . 
Two questions . 
The battery . 
You say one battery is cheaper . 
Why ? 
Yeah but 
when you use two , you can use it two times longer . 
Okay so it's the size of the remote control . 
Okay and the buttons . 
When you use it on the television , you've  you need the television , wh which can use it . 
Okay . 
I think we have to use it also on other televisions though . 
So  
Yeah but I don't  I think it  <other> 
They are two different things though . 
We have to choose one . 
It has to work on o uh all televisions . 
Okay . 
Yeah . Good idea . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones . 
<other> 
Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ? 
Yeah but there are also design cost . 
I don't think  
When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ? 
Would you change the cover ? 
No . 
N yeah but  
I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So  
 
Yes it is 
but I don't think we have to do it . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
That's clear . <laugh> 
Okay thank you . 
So now the User Interface Designer . 
We'll got back on that later . 
'Kay , thank you . 
Then it's your turn , the marketing expert . 
<laugh> 
Okay thank you . 
Yes . 
I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition . 
So I think that can be an d good option . L_C_D_ . 
Yes . Only the L_C_D_ . 
So  
But we'll come back on that . 
Now  
<other> Oh , go on . 
What d d d um  
Um  
Uh we go   back on the decisions later . 
Now we have a few new product requirements . 
First , teletext . 
We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . 
So not necessary . 
Next . 
Only for the television . 
So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . 
Only the television . 
We look at the age group of forty plus . 
Uh no , younger than forty . 
Is a g big group , 
and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . 
Fourth point . <other> 
Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . 
Very important for the design . 
So you can see it on our site . 
Next . 
Um no . 
We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . 
So <other> like you said , we need the   . 
Maybe it's good to put it in a document . 
Now we have to decide what controls do we need . 
So maybe you can tell us . 
Sorry ? 
Yes . 
Yes , it's okay . 
Yeah but we don't use it . 
It's a  <laugh> new requirement . 
So , it's not my requirement . 
We have to do this . 
No . 
So 
what controls do we need ? 
Who first ? 
Okay . 
Uh power . 
Uh mm channel . 
Channel  
Zero to nine . 
Volume . 
Maybe it's easy to pick . 
What was w your one ? 
Techno 
Okay . 
We had w 
uh no no no no . 
Where was that example of the  
Johan . 
That was the  the the the the   
technical  
Hallo . 
Okay . 
What do we need ? 
On-off . 
Zero to nine . 
Yeah that's the channel . 
Menu ? 
Uh yes 
the n newer televisions ha do have menus . 
Uh  
  M Menu . 
I think um the only one or two numbers . 
And  
Hello ? 
That's ch 
<sounds made while typing> 
Yes . 
On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ? 
Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 
'cause it it has to work on all televisions . 
So 
we need  
N Yes . 
But if we have this  
So now we don't have a lot of buttons . 
Is this enough ? 
Mute . 
Maybe in the menu ? 
Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay . 
Maybe more ? 
<other> 
<laugh> No . 
Well . Then that's all . 
This will be the buttons . 
And  
I think that's enough for the next phase . 
So we can go on to  
Yes . 
No 
that's for the next phase . 
Um   
Phase two is the conceptual design . 
So then we'll have the concepts . 
That's for the  
So uh next point .
