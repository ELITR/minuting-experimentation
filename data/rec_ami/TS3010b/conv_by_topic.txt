A:  Okay . So welcome back . What do   do we have to do ? 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> 
D:   . 
A:  So first . I want to say I'm the secretary , so I make the minutes . You find them in your  in the map in the From the group . There's the minutes from the first meeting . You'll find the next minutes also there . Then <other> I wanna hear from you , what you've done . And after that I have some new product requirements . So  And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . And then we're ready . We have forty minutes for this meeting . After that we'll have lunch .

A:  So first I wanna ask the  <sing-song pause filling noise> Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So  
C:  That's my task . Okay . Uh I've  
C:  A little later but here it is . 
D:   
A:  Okay . So  <other> 
D:  <other> 
C:  So okay . It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . It's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it and <laugh> I don't get it . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Make it . 
A:  Now have ten minutes to tell it . 
C:  Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . I think it will be a few minutes and  First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it  uh of it . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you  I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I'll think about it . 
C:  Yes . That's it . 
D:  Mm . <laugh> 
A:  Okay . <laugh> That's clear . <laugh> Okay thank you .

C:  Where have I put it ? My Documents or not ? Hmm . I've save it on my computer , my presentation . 
A:  Yeah on your computer , or the  
C:  But where ? 
A:  What's the name ? 
C:  Uh uh uh  
A:  What's the name of it ? 
C:  It was about the working of the remote control . 
A:  It's the technical function or the functional requirements . 
C:  Nope . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Not a  of  Wait . The working design . But I've saved it . 
A:  Working design . 
C:  But now I don't know where it is . Hmm . 
A:  Working design . What is this ? Product documents . 
C:  Yeah . And I import this until  
A:  On the desktop . Up .  up . 
C:  One more . 
A:  Up . Up . Up . Yes . My Documents . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Nope . 
C:  What the fuck is this ? 
A:  Gone . <laugh> Well you  Um  Nah . Nah , nah , nah . 
C:  <other> 
A:  PowerPoint . Working design . 
C:  Yeah that's the empty one . 
A:  <laugh> And  
C:  I had one . 
A:  Presentation of working design . 
C:  Uh-huh . Open it . Okay here it is . 
A:  Save as  . 
D:  <other> 
A:  Uh it's  
D:  Desktop . 
A:  Project  . 
C:  Project . 
D:  Yeah . Okay . Well . 
A:  Save . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Very good . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


C:  First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it , um because its uh not so expensive . 
D:  <other> 
C:  And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There's a lot of small uh electronics . So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . Now   And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here's the battery . And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That's what I said , it's very difficult . And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television . 
A:  <other> 
C:  That's a short h uh how it works . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all <laugh> we all don't get it . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


C:  My preferences ? It's uh  it won't be uh  We shouldn't make it too big . 
A:  Okay so it's the size of the remote control . Okay and the buttons . When you use it on the television , you've  you need the television , wh which can use it . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . But uh I think this  our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ? Or is it also for other company  uh for other televisions ? 
A:  S Okay . I think we have to use it also on other televisions though . 
C:  Then this is an option . <other> Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we won't use the 
A:  So  Yeah but I don't  I think it  <other> They are two different things though . We have to choose one . It has to work on o uh all televisions . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah ? Okay . Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions . And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions . 
D:  Hmm . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  And I just uh have one more idea . Uh maybe it's one of your tasks . But  Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers . So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it . And also different things . 
D:  Hmm . 
A:  Yeah . Good idea . 
D:  Will this will this add to the cost ? 
C:  Yes . Uh then it won't be  uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . And then you can buy the covers . 
D:  Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it . D does it make it more difficult to design ? 
C:  I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Not much . 'Kay . 
C:  Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones . Just one . 
A:  Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones . 
C:  Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . If it won't works then we'll get something else . Then we uh won't g uh go further with it . 
A:  <other> Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ? 
C:  Uh a p a  <laugh> a cover made in uh in China , it it won't be I guess so expensive I think . 
A:  Yeah but there are also design cost . I don't think  When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ? 
C:  Maybe . I wi I won't . But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and uh the the children think , oh this is my remote control , uh I made a picture on it . Uh  
A:  Would you change the cover ? No . N yeah but  I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So  
C:  Yeah . Okay . And the other people ? What do you think about it ? <laugh> 
D:  Um  
B:  Yeah it's a good idea . But  If if it  Yeah , I don't  I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh  But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea . <laugh> 
C:  Okay . 
A:   Yes it is but I don't think we have to do it . 
B:  No . 
C:  Okay . You're the Project Manager . <laugh> 
topic_description:	other_industrial designer ideas


C:  Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . We can also make uh a button uh with a   menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu . That's  I think it's easier . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when  what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it . This is uh just uh  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Oh oh . Two questions . The battery . You say one battery is cheaper . Why ? 
C:  If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two . 
A:  Yeah but when you use two , you can use it two times longer . 
C:  Yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting .  Just  
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


A:  So now the User Interface Designer . 
B:  Oh . That's me . Uh  Come on .  . Ah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design . <other> Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh  for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . No cords attached . And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting . Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . Uh well the same idea here . Uh message to the television . And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh  and maybe uh teletext or something like that . Uh well these are two uh remotes , and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh  We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . 
A:  We'll got back on that later . 
B:  Okay yeah . Yeah well the  that was just on my mind . So uh I didn't know what uh 
D:  Yes . 
B:  what way we would go . Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk <laugh> . 
C:  'Kay . 
A:  'Kay , thank you . 
topic_description:	interface specialist presentation_None


B:  But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . Or uh uh more functions on the remote . Uh maybe more devices you can influence . Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ . <other> Yeah well that's our dilemma . Um any ideas about that ? Basic or multifunctional ? 
topic_description:	other_interface specialist ideas


A:  Then it's your turn , the marketing expert . 
D:  Okay . Uh um m Yeah . <other> Um yeah okay . This bit too far . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  So  So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . 
D:  That were my findings . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay thank you . 
topic_description:	marketing expert presentation_None


D:  Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . And we looked at uh several um things . Uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . Uh well what what will be our market . And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not . Well our findings . Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . Uh well they also zap a lot . So uh zapping uh should be very easy . And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . So a lot of unused buttons . There is more findings . Uh on the buttons . Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? And how much would they use them ? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection . And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . Uh not important they found the audio , uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings . Uh th and they also are not used very often . Then we have a few um graphs about the market . Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I <other> I think the younger will be most interest in it . But uh they are not a very big group . Um in the  we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it . Now you can clearly see young users say  . I will  that would very nice . And older user think uh they will be scared of change <laugh> I think . And they won't like it . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Well here we see the same . Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . And old users not . Uh well we uh found out that there are two  several markets at which we can aim . Uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here . And um they are more critical on their money spending . Uh the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in uh new features . But uh they spend their money more easily . Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . And the second group about forty percent . So the the first group is bigger . 
topic_description:	user requirements_None


D:  Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Um well th uh that's my second point . Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . It's about discussion we had earlier . Um  
C:  <cough> 
D:  You can find most functions on a T_V_ set . So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things . Um well the design is very important . One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one . But they found most remote controls very ugly . So the design of our remote control is very important . And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that . 
topic_description:	other_marketing expert ideas


D:  Uh yeah the first question is uh  also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . But less of them will buy it . Um well I uh  <other> Okay . What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use , remote control . So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested . And um we can make special features . But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition . 
topic_description:	user target group_None


A:  Yes . 
A:  So  But we'll come back on that . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Now  <other> Oh , go on . What d d d um  Um  Uh we go   back on the decisions later . 
topic_description:	discussion_None


C:  I have uh one question . If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher . Uh I think we don't have that in our budget . Do you think ? Like  
D:  Yes . 
B:  Mm-hmm . No . 
D:  No . 
B:  And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something . So it's  
C:  No . No . 
B:  Yeah , it's hard to uh get the younger 
C:  Uh-huh . 
B:  group . 
A:  I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition . So I think that can be an d good option . L_C_D_ . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Just the L_C_D_ ? Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yes . Only the L_C_D_ . 
topic_description:	project budget_None


A:  Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . So 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  not necessary . Next . Only for the television . So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . <other> Third . We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . Fourth point . <other> Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site . 
D:  <other> 
A:  Next . Um no . We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . So <other> like you said , we need the   . Maybe it's good to put it in a document . Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us . 
D:  Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said . 
A:  Sorry ? 
D:  The the requirements you just said , maybe we should first have a discussion about that . I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news . 
A:  Yes . Yes , it's okay . Yeah but we don't use it . It's a  <laugh> new requirement . So , it's not my requirement . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  'Kay , we'll just have to do that . Okay . 
A:  We have to do this . 
D:  Okay . Okay sorry . Then uh  
C:  No discussion about it . Okay . <laugh> Unfortunately . 
A:  No . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	new requirements_None


topic_description:	discussion_None


A:  So what controls do we need ? Who first ? 
B:  Well a power button ? 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay . Uh power . 
B:  Uh the well um I think separate channels . So  
A:  Uh mm channel . 
B:  But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something . 
A:  Channel  Zero to nine . 
B:  Uh volume . 
A:  Volume . Maybe it's easy to pick . What was w your one ? Techno 
D:  Mine ? It's the functional requirements . 
A:  Okay . We had w uh no no no no . Where was that example of the  
B:  Oh mine . 
A:  Johan . That was the  the the the the   technical  
B:  Technical . 
A:  Hallo . Okay . What do we need ? On-off . Zero to nine . 
C:  To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down . 
A:  Yeah that's the channel . 
D:  D Yeah . Do we make a menu ? 
A:  Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . Uh  
D:  <other> <laugh> Uh  
A:    M Menu . I think um the only one or two numbers . 
B:  Mm yes . 
A:  And  Hello ? That's ch <sounds made while typing> 
D:   I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection , and left-right uh for volume . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the  then to scroll through the menu and to change the options . 
A:  Yes . On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ? 
D:  Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control . 
A:  Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . So 
D:  Yes . 
C:  But then we come to the costs . 
A:  we need  N Yes . But if we have this  
D:  'Kay . But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell . 
A:  So now we don't have a lot of buttons . Is this enough ? 
B:  Mute . 
A:  Mute . Maybe in the menu ? 
B:  Um  
D:  Mm . 
B:  Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh 
A:  Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay . 
B:  thing to do . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Maybe more ? <other> <laugh> No . Well . Then that's all . This will be the buttons . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  And  I think that's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to  
C:  But now we have only the buttons . And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or  
A:  Yes . No that's for the next phase . Um   
C:  Okay . 
A:  Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we'll have the concepts . 
C:  Okay . Okay . 
A:  That's for the  So uh next point . Now we have lunch-break . After that we have t thirty minutes for work . And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . No . Your individual action , you can find them in the email . So now it's time for lunch . 
C:  Okay . 
D:  Okay . Good idea . 
A:  Thanks for coming .
