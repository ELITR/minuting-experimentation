D:   . 
A:  So first . I want to say I'm the secretary , so I make the minutes . You find them in your  in the map in the From the group . There's the minutes from the first meeting . You'll find the next minutes also there . Then <other> I wanna hear from you , what you've done . And after that I have some new product requirements . So  And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . And then we're ready . We have forty minutes for this meeting . After that we'll have lunch . 


A:  So first I wanna ask the  <sing-song pause filling noise> Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So  
C:  That's my task . Okay . Uh I've  
C:  A little later but here it is . 
D:   
A:  Okay . So  <other> 
D:  <other> 
C:  So okay . It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . It's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it and <laugh> I don't get it . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Make it . 
A:  Now have ten minutes to tell it . 
C:  Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . I think it will be a few minutes and  First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it  uh of it . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you  I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I'll think about it . 
C:  Yes . That's it . 
D:  Mm . <laugh> 
A:  Okay . <laugh> That's clear . <laugh> Okay thank you . 


A:  So now the User Interface Designer . 
B:  Oh . That's me . Uh  Come on .  . Ah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design . <other> Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh  for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . No cords attached . And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting . Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . Uh well the same idea here . Uh message to the television . And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh  and maybe uh teletext or something like that . Uh well these are two uh remotes , and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh  We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . 
A:  We'll got back on that later . 
B:  Okay yeah . Yeah well the  that was just on my mind . So uh I didn't know what uh 
D:  Yes . 
B:  what way we would go . Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk <laugh> . 
C:  'Kay . 
A:  'Kay , thank you . 


A:  Then it's your turn , the marketing expert . 
D:  Okay . Uh um m Yeah . <other> Um yeah okay . This bit too far . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  So  So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . 
D:  That were my findings . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay thank you . 


A:  Yes . 
A:  So  But we'll come back on that . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Now  <other> Oh , go on . What d d d um  Um  Uh we go   back on the decisions later . 


A:  Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . So 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  not necessary . Next . Only for the television . So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . <other> Third . We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . Fourth point . <other> Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site . 
D:  <other> 
A:  Next . Um no . We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . So <other> like you said , we need the   . Maybe it's good to put it in a document . Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us . 
D:  Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said . 
A:  Sorry ? 
D:  The the requirements you just said , maybe we should first have a discussion about that . I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news . 
A:  Yes . Yes , it's okay . Yeah but we don't use it . It's a  <laugh> new requirement . So , it's not my requirement . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  'Kay , we'll just have to do that . Okay . 
A:  We have to do this . 
D:  Okay . Okay sorry . Then uh  
C:  No discussion about it . Okay . <laugh> Unfortunately . 
A:  No . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 




A:  And  I think that's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to  
C:  But now we have only the buttons . And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or  
A:  Yes . No that's for the next phase . Um   
C:  Okay . 
A:  Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we'll have the concepts . 
C:  Okay . Okay . 
A:  That's for the  So uh next point . Now we have lunch-break . After that we have t thirty minutes for work . And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . No . Your individual action , you can find them in the email . So now it's time for lunch . 
C:  Okay .
