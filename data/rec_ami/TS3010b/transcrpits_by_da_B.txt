<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Yeah it's a good idea . But  
If if it  Yeah , I don't  
I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh  
But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea . <laugh> 
No . 
Oh . That's me . 
Uh  
Come on .  . 
Ah . 
Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design . 
<other> Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh  for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set . 
Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . 
No cords attached . 
And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . 
That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting . 
Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . 
Uh well the same idea here . 
Uh message to the television . 
And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh  and maybe uh teletext or something like that . 
Uh 
well these are two uh remotes , 
and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh  
We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . 
But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . 
Or uh uh more functions on the remote . 
Uh maybe more devices you can influence . 
Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ . 
<other> Yeah 
well that's our dilemma . 
Um any ideas about that ? 
Basic or multifunctional ? 
Okay yeah . 
Yeah well the  that was just on my mind . 
So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go . 
Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk <laugh> . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
No . 
And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something . 
So it's  Yeah , it's hard to uh get the younger group . 
Mm-hmm . 
Just the L_C_D_ ? 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Well a power button ? 
Uh the well um I think separate channels . So  
But then both the the separate channels . 
So so uh zero to nine or something . 
Uh volume . 
Oh mine . 
Technical . 
Mm yes . 
Mute . 
Um  
Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do .
