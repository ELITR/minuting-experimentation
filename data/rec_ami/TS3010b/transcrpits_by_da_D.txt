Desktop . 
Yeah . Okay . Well . 
 
<other> 
<laugh> Make it . 
<other> 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Will this will this add to the cost ? 
Yes 
but you have to m uh be able to change it . 
D does it make it more difficult to design ? 
Not much . 'Kay . 
Um  
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yes . 
Okay . 
Uh um m 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Um yeah okay . 
This bit too far . <laugh> 
So  
So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , 
about um yeah what people think . 
Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . 
And we looked at uh several um things . 
Uh among them design , 
uh d d how d did they like the use of it , 
uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . 
Uh well what what will be our market . 
And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not . 
Well our findings . 
Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . 
Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . 
And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . 
Uh well they also zap a lot . 
So uh zapping uh should be very easy . 
And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . 
So a lot of unused buttons . 
There is more findings . 
Uh on the buttons . 
Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? 
And how much would they use them ? 
Well uh the most used button is the channel selection . 
And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . 
The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . 
Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . 
Uh not important they found the audio , 
uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . 
Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings . Uh th and they also are not used very often . 
Then we have a few um graphs about the market . 
Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . 
Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . 
Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . 
And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I <other> I think the younger will be most interest in it . 
But uh they are not a very big group . 
Um in the  we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . 
If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it . 
Now you can clearly see young users say  . I will  that would very nice . 
And older user think uh they will be scared of change <laugh> I think . 
And they won't like it . 
And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . 
Well here we see the same . 
Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . 
And old users not . 
Uh well we uh found out that there are two  several markets at which we can aim . 
Uh the first are the younger , 
the age between sixteen and forty five . 
Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here . 
And um they are more critical on their money spending . 
Uh the second group is the older group . 
Aged between forty six and sixty five . 
They are less interested in uh new features . 
But uh they spend their money more easily . 
Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . 
And the second group about forty percent . 
So the the first group is bigger . 
Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . 
Uh yeah the first question is uh  also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . 
Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . 
But less of them will buy it . 
Um well I uh  <other> 
Okay . 
What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use , remote control . 
So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested . 
And um we can make special features . 
But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . 
But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition . 
Um well th uh that's my second point . 
Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . 
It's about discussion we had earlier . Um  
You can find most functions on a T_V_ set . 
So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things . 
Um well the design is very important . 
One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one . 
But they found most remote controls very ugly . 
So the design of our remote control is very important . 
And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , 
as most users use it for that . 
That were my findings . 
Yes . 
No . 
Okay . 
<other> 
Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said . 
The the requirements you just said , 
maybe we should first have a discussion about that . 
I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . 
Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news . 
<laugh> 
Okay . Okay sorry . 
Then uh  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mine ? 
It's the functional requirements . 
D Yeah . 
Do we make a menu ? 
<other> <laugh> Uh  
 
I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . 
Up-down for channel selection , 
and left-right uh for volume . 
And uh a menu uh button . 
And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , 
and you can use the same buttons . 
But the  then to scroll through the menu and to change the options . 
Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control . 
Yes . 
'Kay . 
But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . 
And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . 
So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Okay . Good idea .
