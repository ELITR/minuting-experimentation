That's my task . Okay . 
Uh I've  
Where have I put it ? 
My Documents or not ? 
Hmm . 
I've save it on my computer , my presentation . 
But where ? 
Uh uh uh  
It was about the working of the remote control . 
Nope . 
Not a  of  
Wait . 
The working design . 
But I've saved it . 
But now I don't know where it is . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
And I import this until  
One more . 
<laugh> 
What the fuck is this ? 
<other> 
Yeah that's the empty one . 
I had one . 
Uh-huh . 
Open it . 
Okay here it is . 
Project . 
Okay . 
A little later but here it is . 
So okay . 
It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . 
It's about the working of the remote control . 
I just had an half an hour j to study it 
and <laugh> I don't get it . 
Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . 
I think it will be a few minutes and  
First uh I will tell you something about the findings , 
what I discovered about the remote control . 
The working bout it  uh of it . 
Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , 
and it's the top of the remote control . 
With a little bit of science , 
uh you  
I will show that uh in in a few minutes . 
And then uh what I'll think about it . 
First , the findings . 
The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . 
Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it , 
um because its uh not so expensive . 
And there are uh a lot of uh wires , 
uh which um connect the components in it , 
the battery , 
and there are um switches and things like that . 
There's a lot of small uh electronics . 
So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . 
Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . 
Now   
And here I have the top of the remote control . 
Uh here's some kind of chip . 
Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . 
Uh you have all on your remote control . 
And uh the teletext uh button . 
And uh here's the battery . 
And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . 
And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . 
That's what I said , it's very difficult . 
And after that it will be sent to the infrared . 
And that will send it to your television . 
That's a short h uh how it works . 
Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , 
but we all <laugh> we all don't get it . 
My preferences ? 
It's uh  it won't be uh  
We shouldn't make it too big . 
Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . 
A long-lasting battery . 
Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . 
Not other materials . 
Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . 
We can also make uh a button uh with a   menu uh button . 
And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . 
And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu . 
That's  I think it's easier . 
And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . 
Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . 
Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . 
And also the bleep , when  what I told you about uh when you lost it , 
and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it . 
This is uh just uh  
Yeah . Yeah . 
If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two . 
Yeah but 
then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting . 
 Just  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But uh I think this  our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ? 
Or is it also for other company  uh for other televisions ? 
Then this is an option . <other> 
Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . 
And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . 
And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , 
but then we won't use the 
Yeah ? Okay . 
Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions . 
And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions . 
And I just uh have one more idea . 
Uh maybe it's one of your tasks . 
But  Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers . 
So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it . 
And also different things . 
Yes . 
Uh then it won't be  uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . 
And then you can buy the covers . 
I think it will be a little more difficult , 
but not too much . 
Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones . 
Just one . 
Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . 
If it won't works then we'll get something else . 
Then we uh won't g uh go further with it . 
Uh a p a  <laugh> a cover made in uh in China , it it won't be I guess so expensive I think . 
Maybe . 
I wi I won't . 
But maybe I think trendy people 
or like children where you can paint on it , 
and uh the the children think , oh this is my remote control , uh I made a picture on it . Uh  
Yeah . 
Okay . 
And the other people ? What do you think about it ? <laugh> 
Okay . 
Okay . 
You're the Project Manager . <laugh> 
Yes . That's it . 
<laugh> 
'Kay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
Yeah . I have uh one question . 
If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher . 
Uh I think we don't have that in our budget . 
Do you think ? 
Like  
No . No . 
Uh-huh . 
<laugh> 
'Kay , we'll just have to do that . 
Okay . 
No discussion about it . 
Okay . <laugh> 
Unfortunately . 
To change to the next channel , just one button . 
To move up , move down . 
But then we come to the costs . 
But now we have only the buttons . 
And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or  
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
<laugh>
