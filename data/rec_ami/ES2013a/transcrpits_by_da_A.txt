Uh yeah . 
Fine now . 
Oh , 
it's not liking us , 
it went that-a-way . 
Computer adjusting . 
Oh . 
Uh . 
Okay . <other> So . Right . 
You ready back there ? 
<laugh> 
Uh okay . 
Welcome everyone . 
Um this is the kick-off meeting for the day . 
Um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction . 
As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , 
um become acquainted with each other , 
um have a little training on tools , 
uh create a plan , 
discuss things 
and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . 
Okay . 
The new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . 
That , Steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness . 
The originality um is gonna take all of us . 
Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at  for some marketing research information from you , Sarah . 
Um and we'll get on with it . 
Okay , so 
we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design . 
Okay ? 
Right . 
Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard . 
Kate , why don't you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , I guess  
And while you're doing that 
we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , 
'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around . 
<laugh> 
Uh I do not think so , 
I think it's just to try out the whiteboard . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Ah <other> . 
<laugh> 
Uh-huh . 
Okay . 
Great . 
And the characteristics ? 
Uh-huh . 
Okay . 
Fantastic . 
Since you're handy as well , 
why don't you do yours next , Steph . 
I think it's to get us used to using the pen . 
Uh no . <laugh> 
A mouse-y ? 
Oh . 
Argh . 
Rat . 
Not a mouse , a rat . 
<laugh> 
And your favourite characteristics of that animal . 
Oh . 
Okay . 
Kate ? 
<laugh> 
Oh , 
a fish . 
Oh , okay . 
Fine . 
Favourite characteristics ? 
'Kay . 
So 
they have team elements . <other> 
I'm afraid I'm with Steph . 
And I think your pen's running out of whatever . 
But I'm afraid I take the coward's way out , 
and the cat's looking the other way . <laugh> 
He's hiding . 
Um cats are sometimes very independent . 
My parents had cats . 
Uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best . 
Okay . Now um <other> 
we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this 
and this remote control has to be sold  um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros , 
with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros . 
That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale . 
Um would be an awful lot of these , 
would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . 
Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item . 
Now 
if they cost twelve and a half , you're selling it for twenty five , you're making twelve and a half Euros each . 
Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million , 
that's t uh  
can you do the maths 
and how many are we selling ? 
Mark-up ? 
Okay . 
 
Yes , 
'cause our market um is international 
and your problem is  has to do with marketing of  
you know , 
you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that . 
To give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking . 
Something like that ? 
Okay . 
That's fifty million Euros . 
In order to make fifty million Euros , and you're only getting twelve and a half each  
That's a lot of selling . 
Two four  
To be fifty , be 
four million . You'd have to sell four million . 
Okay ? 
Right . 
Experience with a remote control . 
Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something ? 
You're both nodding , 
all three . 
Well 
I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time , 
but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated 
and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another . 
And they don't always talk to each other . 
Don't know . 
Okay . 
Are there any um ideas for the remote ? 
What would it be for 
and what group would be be for ? 
We have to think about that one . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Mm . 
<other> Okay . 
Yeah . 
Um I know this sounds like it was very quick , 
but the 
I think that's the industrial design is the first one , 
that's Kate , for the working design . 
And user , that's you S Steph , for the technical functions design , 
and for marketing the user requirements specification . 
I think there's going to be a lot of  
we have to help each other 
and work through this as a group , 
and I think we all , you know , <other> we like our kitty-cat and our rat and our fish , 
but I think we all have to like each other um to get this done . 
Uh as it says , we're gonna get individual instructions , 
but uh I don't think they allowed a lot of extra time , 
so I think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead . 
Do you all agree ? 
Alright . 
Um then I don't see any reason to prolong it 
and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now 
and go into other things . 
Alright , 
so this is the end of the first meeting . 
Thank you all .
