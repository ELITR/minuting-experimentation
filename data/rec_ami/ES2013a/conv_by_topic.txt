A:  Welcome everyone . Um this is the kick-off meeting for the day . Um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction . As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , um become acquainted with each other , um have a little training on tools , uh create a plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . 


A:  Okay . The new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . That , Steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness . The originality um is gonna take all of us . Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at  for some marketing research information from you , Sarah . Um and we'll get on with it . Okay , so we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design . Okay ? 


A:  Right . Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard . Kate , why don't you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , I guess  
B:  Uh yeah , if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces , hang on . 
A:  And while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around . 


B:  Uh right , so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal . <laugh> Do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is ? <laugh> Um  
A:  <laugh> Uh I do not think so , I think it's just to try out the whiteboard . 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> Are we all gonna draw a cat ? 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Only animal I could thin I could draw <laugh> . 
D:  I know . 
A:  <laugh> Ah <other> . 
B:  Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat . <laugh> You can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears . Um I suppose it should have a mouth as well , sort of  
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Uh-huh . Okay . 
B:  Right , yeah . 
A:  Great . And the characteristics ? 
B:  Um the favourite characteristics of the cat um  the whiskers I think , um because they're the easiest to draw . In fact , I'll give it some more  
A:  Uh-huh . 
B:  <other> Oh , and the tail 
A:  Okay . Fantastic . Since you're handy as well , why don't you do yours next , Steph . I think it's to get us used to using the pen . 
B:  <laugh> Yes . Um sure it's not to test our artistic  
A:  Uh no . <laugh> 
B:  It's a mouse . 
A:  A mouse-y ? 
C:  That's not a mouse-y , no . 
B:  No it's not a mouse . It's a wombat . 
A:  Oh . 
C:  It's a ratty . 
A:  Argh . Rat . 
B:  A what ? 
C:  A ratty . 
A:  Not a mouse , a rat . 
B:  A webbed foot . Webbed f <laugh> Oh right <laugh> . 
C:  <laugh> It's clothes . That's it's clothes . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  It's a ratty with a with a with a very long tail . 
A:  And your favourite characteristics of that animal . 
C:  I love whiskers . Uh they're intelligent and they're cheeky <other> and uh fantastic pets and very friendly . And they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework . 
A:  Oh . Okay . Kate ? 
B:  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Thanks . 
A:  Oh , a fish . 
B:  <other> Gosh , why didn't I think of fish ? That's even easier to draw than cat . <laugh> 
C:  A shark ? 
D:  Mm <other> this is very representational fish . <other> Um I like them because they're sleek and they have a lot of freedom but they also do n uh swim in groups , so . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh , okay . Fine . Favourite characteristics ? 'Kay . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  So they have team elements . <other> 
D:  Do you have a favourite one ? 
A:  I'm afraid I'm with Steph . And I think your pen's running out of whatever . But I'm afraid I take the coward's way out , and the cat's looking the other way . <laugh> He's hiding . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Um cats are sometimes very independent . My parents had cats . Uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best . Okay . 


A:  Now um <other> we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold  um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros , with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros . That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale . Um would be an awful lot of these , would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item . Now if they cost twelve and a half , you're selling it for twenty five , you're making twelve and a half Euros each . Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million , that's t uh  can you do the maths and how many are we selling ? 
A:  Okay ? Right . 


A:  Experience with a remote control . 


C:  Ooh , closing the meeting . 
A:  Yeah . Um I know this sounds like it was very quick , but the 
C:  That was quick . 
A:  I think that's the industrial design is the first one , that's Kate , for the working design . And user , that's you S Steph , for the technical functions design , and for marketing the user requirements specification . I think there's going to be a lot of  we have to help each other and work through this as a group , and I think we all , you know , <other> we like our kitty-cat and our rat and our fish , but I think we all have to like each other um to get this done . Uh as it says , we're gonna get individual instructions , but uh I don't think they allowed a lot of extra time , so I think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead . Do you all agree ? 
B:  Mm . Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Alright . Um then I don't see any reason to prolong it and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things . Alright , so this is the end of the first meeting . Thank you all . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  'Kay .
