C:  A shark ?

A:  Now um <other> we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold  um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros , with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros . That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale . Um would be an awful lot of these , would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item . Now if they cost twelve and a half , you're selling it for twenty five , you're making twelve and a half Euros each . Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million , that's t uh  can you do the maths and how many are we selling ? 
A:  Okay ? Right . 
topic_description:	project budget_None


D:  <other> Uh yeah . <other> I was just wondering if that's the um  If fifty percent is normal  
A:  Mark-up ? 
D:  B yeah . Um I would think would be more like sixty percent . But um let me  I have two thoughts . One hundred , fifty percent . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  And and your question is how many do we have to sell ? 
A:   Yes , 'cause our market um is international and your problem is  has to do with marketing of  you know , you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that . 
D:  At twenty five . Mm-hmm . Yeah , that's um  
A:  To give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking . 
D:  So that's four million of them ? 
A:  Something like that ? Okay . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  That's fifty million Euros . In order to make fifty million Euros , and you're only getting twelve and a half each  
D:  And if we make  Mm-hmm . 
A:  That's a lot of selling . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Two four  
D:  Four million . 
A:  To be fifty , be four million . You'd have to sell four million . 
D:  Hmm .

A:  Experience with a remote control . 
topic_description:	discussion_None


A:  Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something ? You're both nodding , all three . 
B:  That that that's the sorta product we're talking about , one that will work for a  in a home environment , for a T_V_s and  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Well I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time , but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another . 
C:  It is true that you always sit around  you know , you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something , there's five different remotes , and one for the D_V_D_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else . But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television . 
B:  <cough> 
D:  Mm-hmm . Y yeah . 
A:  And they don't always talk to each other . Don't know . 
D:  <other> 
A:  Okay . Are there any um ideas for the remote ? What would it be for and what group would be be for ? We have to think about that one . 
D:  We could make a Hello Kitty 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  themed remote . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  I think one in b bright colours would be good . <other> 
D:  Yeah . We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation . Well I mean there's also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great <other> products . Electrical  their industrial design is very good . 
B:  <laugh> I think one that works would be good . <laugh> 
C:  I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions . Like I've got one at home that has well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume , 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  you know , subtitles , mute , there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do , like <laugh> . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Well , that's a really good point , because I think one of the things that  being somewhat computer literate , we tend to um go to menus and then make choices , you know , so if it's like an uh volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume . We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  Mm . 
A:  Mm . <other> Okay . 
D:  Mm . We can make it smart like an iPod , you know , make everything menus .

C:  Ooh , closing the meeting . 
A:  Yeah . Um I know this sounds like it was very quick , but the 
C:  That was quick . 
A:  I think that's the industrial design is the first one , that's Kate , for the working design . And user , that's you S Steph , for the technical functions design , and for marketing the user requirements specification . I think there's going to be a lot of  we have to help each other and work through this as a group , and I think we all , you know , <other> we like our kitty-cat and our rat and our fish , but I think we all have to like each other um to get this done . Uh as it says , we're gonna get individual instructions , but uh I don't think they allowed a lot of extra time , so I think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead . Do you all agree ? 
B:  Mm . Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Alright . Um then I don't see any reason to prolong it and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things . Alright , so this is the end of the first meeting . Thank you all . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  'Kay .
