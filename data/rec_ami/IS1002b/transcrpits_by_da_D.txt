Yeah . 
Well <other> uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having <other> no teletext , people are very comfortable <other> with <other> the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not  we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now . 
So that's , from a marketing perspective I I see I see a lack . 
And so we have to go , I think , in the other direction . 
What are we gonna have that makes this thing better than  
<other> 
Right . Yeah . No , I I agree with you . 
So what I'm talking about is I see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side 
which is , what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that <other> identifies our product as better than  because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta . 
So that's that's that was my reactions . 
Yeah yeah . 
Yep . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
'Kay . 
That's right . 
I think we take with you . 
That's what I'm that's what I'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 
'cause somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy 
'cause it took  they can't ac access their teletext . 
Okay . 
'Cause we're talking about <other> eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext . 
So so it's it's not that I'm criticizing the product at all . 
It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? 
What are we bringing in to take the place of this , 
and we have to d  in my opinion we have to double up . 
If we lose one we need to bring two or three . 
So you have this ? 
Now is  would this be <other> considered just a standard uh um  
This is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here . 
We're talking about existing technology . 
Nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries . 
Okay . Okay . 
N okay . 
Mm . 
Mm the shell ? 
Okay . 
<other> 
<other> I have maybe a silly question . 
I  in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the  it's gonna be out-moded teletext . 
I I don't understand how those two things are connected . 
How does how does computers and teletext  h how  why is one eliminating the need of the other ? 
I don't understand that . 
Okay . 
Yeah 'cause , yeah , 
I just  I don't see the cross-over between computers and television . 
I mean I do see the cross-over in some sense , 
but but but but with the  the remote is is used for television , okay . 
So so if we make the cross-over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote . S 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah I don't I don't see the logic . 
I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , 
I just I I  
but I'm not a tech-mind either . 
I just don't see the cross-over between computers and and and 
 'Cause we are designing something for a television , okay . 
We are selling it to an existing market . 
That's  
Yeah , 
and and , 
yeah , 
and and we're also <other> marketing a product . It's  what I'm seeing is a is a mid-range cost product . 
So so w we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing 
because all of a sudden we are gonna have cost overruns . 
So if we drop  if we are gonna choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ? 
I don't I don't see it , 
and to me if I'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for for design I'm gonna I'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price . 
I need to make it special with a high price tag . 
I don't want to make it economically uh g uh competitive . 
I want I want to market it as exclusive . 
So I would market this product it  at eighty-nine Euros 
and come up with some really <other> beautiful exterior design or something 
th but but I don't think we have that flexibility . 
No I no I I understand what you say , 
but what I'm what I'm , 
okay  we probably need to move along , 
but my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product , 
and if I'm coming in with a with with twenty-five Euros , which is mid-market price , um then what am I going to give these people for this ? 
So that's just my question , 
but we can keep talking . 
<other> Yeah . 
Oh P Pedro , I just want to say quickly I I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , eh . 
You know sell uh  things come to my mind is uh uh something that's uh <other> um voice-activated . 
I know we're getting into some , I hope , some big money on this thing , but  
Is that for over here ? 
Okay , alright . 
That's  
'Cause uh and I think of voice-activated 
I think of of <other> how many times I've I've lost my my remote and I can't find it . 
So some way that I can I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something 
uh and and so so um  <other> 
But this 's just something . 
I'm trying to find some bells and whistles 
'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext , it's like , what are we gonna put in ? 
What makes this thing attractive ? 
And it's only for televisions . 
So we  everyth 
our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their V_C_R_s , their D_V_D_s , their <other> their televisions 
and we're coming out with one remote for television only . 
And so to me we have to make this a really special product 
I I I don't s I really have to say I don't see the market niche for this product . 
At this price I don't see it yet . 
I'm  I I go along with this , 
because this is what we're given to try to market , 
but I I don't see the market niche for this product without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Have to do  you have to do it in the box ? 
Okay well , so so that's up to you then 
to <other> to make this box in something that's absolutely extraordinary . 
Maybe make it in the form of a gun . 
We can sell it in United States . 
Well <other> you know for marketing f <other> marketing for me is uh  
and uh how do I go here ? 
Okay . 
Go go . 
Is that right ? 
Ah-ha . 
Yeah , what for me is it um  
I d I don't know what I'm marketing right now , okay , 
'til you spoke and when I wrote this , I don't know what I'm marketing . 
I just know that I I was identified as a a  we identified ourselves as a as a developer , as a manufacturer , and as a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers . 
And so the th the twenty-five Euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price . 
That's what we decided here . 
Um so what I did is I I decided that <other> that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself . 
So what we've identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design . 
We're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is . 
So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left . 
Um <other> so I would like to have a product that that we can sell easily . 
So I say inspiration , 
so having something beauty , something attractive , uh something that in a sense will sell itself . 
Uh innovation I think fits into what we're talking about here with design . 
Uh cutting edge technology , I don't think we're gonna have that , 
these were ideas I was putting together , 
um unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned . 
I I wanna make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way , 
so maybe we can have some  
I I talked about environmentally sensitive , 
uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home . 
I don't know . 
These are just thoughts . 
Uh I wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation , 
that we're new , we're aggressive , we're competitive , we're we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line . 
So to me it's about selling d uh our identity  our corporate identity along with the product . 
<other> Um what I found is that the projected costs are competitive . 
Uh we're kind of in the middle of the market , 
but what I'm seeing is that the market is ready for  I I identified new technology , 
but again , because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations , I don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing . 
If if we could have a technological something  
Mm p 
please . 
<other> Solar . <laugh> 
But solar  
<other> 
Blah , I like it . 
I like the idea , 
but we're talking about  in cost is gonna probably double . 
But boy , we can sell this thing , 
because there's no batteries , 
it's environmentally sensitive , 
i we can identify it as a safer product in some form . 
Yep , that's right . 
I really see 
But the cost i 
No no . No no , 
we have t we have to change the end cost . 
There's uh  I mean I don't see it anyway . 
Yeah , 
that's gonna be up to these guys . 
I <other>  my reaction is no , but 
Well , see I I  see I I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product . 
You know , let's let's sell this wholesale for for fifty Euros , sixty Euros . 
Let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , uh high-tech design , uh ergonomics , all of this . 
Just make this thing uh , yeah , the the the Rolls Royce of of remote controls . 
Every home's got to have it . 
If you don't have one , 
hey what kind of remote do you have ? 
Oh you've got one of those , 
oh fantastic , 
I want one of those too . 
I just don't have enough money right now . 
<other> 
<other> 
Yep , 
one one thing I don't understand is h they've they've given us this package , okay . 
Now uh in my opinion we need to give them a package back , okay . 
They say they say okay here you go . 
They gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want , 
and and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate . 
I don't think it's our place to create their product for them , 
maybe it is . 
I don't know what kind of role we have in this  in the corporate ladder uh , 
but to me it's like , okay , you have got your  here's our ideas , okay . 
And then let them look at those ideas and 
they say , yeah well , we can we can raise the price twenty percent , 
you know we like this idea , this idea no , 
but <other> to me it's it's about a choice , 
do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss ? 
beca I I do not  I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now . 
I don't see it . 
Right . 
No I understand that . 
 
Nope , 
they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions . 
They've identified this product limita 
That's why I say I don't I don't see the market niche for this . 
If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s , V_C_R_s and everything , then I can see the market niche , 
but we we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext . 
And it's like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable , 
because who wants just a television remote ? 
I don't . <other> 
That's right . 
<other> 
I I I have a tendency to agree with you . 
I really do . 
That's why I say I quest I q I question the marketability of the product . 
I really question where we create the demand . 
W <other> okay if you if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make  go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of a sudden now we're going into an a a new market area . 
So we can say low-cost uh uh um uh good design , beautiful , wa-da-da-da-da-da . 
But what I'm saying is right now we're middle market . 
<other> 
Yeah 
for for multi for a multi-function remote , that's a mid-market price . 
In a discount right now you can buy 'em on sale sometimes for about about uh eighteen , nineteen Euro , 
and that's for the multi-functions , uh D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , uh catch-alls . 
And and they have 'em in a little box in the middle , 
and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls . 
So to me <other> , to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness . 
We have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous , 
and I don't know what that is . 
It's gotta be low-cost or high-cost with with special design features . 
Or my d <other> 
<other> I mean I I <other> well we g we're talking about the other end now . 
I like it . 
I like the idea , 
but we have t we have to find out  
<other> Well . <other> 
Mm . 
Well , I think again it's it  we have a cost issue here . 
You know if we're gonna go in this direction , to me we're going to the other side of the cost range . 
Are we gonna make this  selling selling the cost as a high high-tech uh um environmentally sensitive whatever , or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range ? 
<other> Again I don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet . 
I don't see it yet . 
W <other> a question I have in in a <other>  
'cause I I I think I agree with you on , we gotta make it a box . 
The box is gonna sell it I think , the outside , the casing . 
Can can can we have multiple designs ? 
Have a modern , 
have a traditional , 
have a  you know , 
and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from . 
I don't know what that creates cost , or  
Yep one over another . 
Yeah , okay , I hear that . 
What ab what ab  
what about a a remote that's <other> that <other> doesn't maybe look like a remote ? 
Just an idea . 
Just just 
okay 'cause I mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside . 
They're selling these things everywhere . 
Maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity , is we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote 
it it opens like a telephone . 
Doesn't matter , yeah . 
I'm just jus I talking about some  something to make this thing unique . 
It  
That's the thing , I'm gonna keep thumping on . 
I'll sell whatever you guys design . 
I don't have a problem selling a product , 
that's not the issue . 
I give you ideas , 
you guys create the product . 
Once you have the finished product I'll find a way to sell it . 
Don't worry about it . 
I just give you these things now , because these are my thoughts and feelings . 
No no . 
One thing I just thought about when you were saying that , is that the p our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken  
We gotta stop ? 
Who's lost or broken their their remote . 
So <other> how many remotes do they wanna buy ? 
Can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one ? 
And so with with with this kind of system or locator or something , to to think about , how have people been been losing or breaking their remote ? 
How does this happen ? 
And and then and then design the product , maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy . 
 uh  
we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot . <laugh> 
It's uh just it's that I think it's telling us to stop our meeting . 
<other> So we have the c we probably have have on-line in our in our system , we have the ability to create this , we're talking about . 
A charging system . 
If if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics . 
No that's not what I want , I want  
Oh look it here .
