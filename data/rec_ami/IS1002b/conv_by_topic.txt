A:  So we are here to talk about functional design . Now hopefully we've all got a better idea from <other>  than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . So here's an agenda . Uh I'll open . Um you should know that I'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as I was struggling to our last time uh and that'll be easier for me now because I'm not actually giving the whole presentation . Uh the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that I forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful . 
C:  <other> <other> 
A:  Um <other> now <other> you can all give your presentations . We can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions . <other> Right , forty minutes for this meeting , so a bit more time than the last one . 


A:  Here's the additional points I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them . Uh did you all receive that email ? 
B:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  So does anyone have any overall  
D:  Well <other> uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having <other> no teletext , people are very comfortable <other> with <other> the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not  we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now . 
A:  Mm . Mm . Yep . 
D:  So that's , from a marketing perspective I I see I see a lack . And so we have to go , I think , in the other direction . What are we gonna have that makes this thing better than  
A:  Mm . Well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the Internet  <other> there is the opportunity that's presented , I guess . 
D:  <other> Right . Yeah . No , I I agree with you . So what I'm talking about is I see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is , what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that <other> identifies our product as better than  because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta . So that's that's that was my reactions . 
A:  Okay . Okay . Yeah . but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television . So we're quite fixed . So we're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that's uh that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah yeah . Yep . 
C:  <other> Yeah bu but we we're designing only the remote , we not design the T_V_ . So uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_ 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 'Kay . 
C:  that we  people use our remote with . 
D:  That's right . I think we take with you . 
A:  Hmm . 
C:  So it's kind of a stupid decision . 
A:  But there's also the potential for mark there's a market here for our lost teletext . For example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement  wants it as <other> cheap as possible . Twenty-five Euros is the selling price , we really have to innovate here I guess . 
B:  Right . 
D:  That's what I'm that's what I'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took  they can't ac access their teletext . Okay . 'Cause we're talking about <other> eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext . 
A:  Mm . K yeah . 
D:  So so it's it's not that I'm criticizing the product at all . It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? What are we bringing in to take the place of this , and we have to d  in my opinion we have to double up . If we lose one we need to bring two or three . 
A:  Mm 'kay . 
C:  <other> 
A:  Okay . Okay I think that the <other> last point is probably quite uh straightforward . Obviously the the  w it has to be branded . 
C:  So then the double R_ will be our our  
A:  'Kay . On the product yeah . Can you handle that black and yellow ? 
B:  I think one of  
C:  I tho I tho I thou I think Rol Ro Rolls-Royce might mind , but don't worry . 
B:  I think w , yeah , one of the things that we should also keep in mind um when we're doing this  I mean our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , right . So I think our kind of  our target here is to <other> have some kind of very like sleek <other> nice look remote and we want it to be functional as well , but I think one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here . You know we don't wanna a big clunker . We want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so  
A:  Mm . 
D:  So you have this ? 
A:  Nah . 


A:  So we have three presentations , and I think we'll go in order of participant number here . So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two . That's  
C:  Yes . 
A:   Okay . 
B:  That's fine . Okay so 
A:  Mm it's enough . But uh click it on off ? 
B:  so you all know me , I'm the Industrial Designer . 
B:  So yeah . That's all I have really . 
A:  Okay . Thanks . 


A:  And we have participant three , which I believe is Pedro . 
C:  <other> I  
A:  I can give you that to click on . 
C:  Hey mouse . Open . <other> 
D:  <other> 
A:  And you wanna get  
C:  When we're fighting over it's also more  lot more fun . <laugh> 
A:  View a slide show , that's what you wanna do , yeah ? Just go up to view . 
C:  Uh . 
B:  Click , don't  Yeah . 
A:  Mm 'kay 
C:  This doesn't work . <other> So yeah function design . Um you guys know me , Pedro , 


A:  But I t I think what the <other> the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it . So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Because otherwise we're just going to  I mean <other> even if it's necessary or not , if you  if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really  if it i <other> if it isn't more expensive for us to k make  because as far as I understand it , <other> it can be operated with the same set of buttons , yeah ? So it should be in there . 
B:  Right as far as  i it's just uh <other> the cost of an extra button . I mean software-wise there's really no difference . I think . 
C:  <other> Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Okay . Isn't  
D:  <other> I have maybe a silly question . I  in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the  it's gonna be out-moded teletext . I I don't understand how those two things are connected . How does how does computers and teletext  h how  why is one eliminating the need of the other ? I don't understand that . 
A:  Well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh Internet through the T_V_ for example . So that might play on what we can do . 
C:  Yeah the they're basically aiming at saying that <other> you would use  you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that and now  
B:  Scheduling . Um to find out what what you're watching even if there's commercials you know . 
C:  Yeah and now you can c look it over Internet . But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  I think I ha 
D:  Yeah 'cause , yeah , I just  I don't see the cross-over between computers and television . I mean I do see the cross-over in some sense , but but but but with the  the remote is is used for television , okay . So so if we make the cross-over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote . S 
B:  I agree . 
C:  Yeah , but it's not happen yet . Yeah . 
B:  Well for me  
A:  Well you have digital T_V_ still already . 
B:  Yeah . Unless you have a  Yeah . 
A:  Well there there is a  for example on digital T_V_ systems you have  you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts , and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example . A a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can  
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah , and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live T_V_ and things like that . They're just features from the Internet uh from computers are are coming into the T_V_ sort of under the covers , but you still use it through a teletext . So now the things to think here are that that there's gonna be more functionality , potentially that we can handle . 
D:  Okay . Okay . 
C:  Yeah but we we don't we're not aiming a command for that . That's the thing . And all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and  
B:   I think a lot of that's proprietary anyways . You're not gonna be able to , you , like command a TiVo with our remote . I don't think . 
A:  Mm . But still there there's an opportunity . If if it's <other> , for example , a trainable one then we're <other> just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it . 
C:  Yeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one , so  
A:   Mm . Okay . 
C:  Well I dunno . One way the other teletext was there but I guess we can remove it or , you know , make two separate interface designs . 
B:  I think if it's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that . Just you know  
D:  Yeah I don't I don't see the logic . I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , I just I I  but I'm not a tech-mind either . I just don't see the cross-over between computers and and and  'Cause we are designing something for a television , okay . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , and neither do I in fact . Bu uh . 
C:  <other> 
A:  I'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  i if it doesn't affect the price . Um but I I think what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future-proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe . I dunno I'm  
B:  Right it's just not  Yeah . 
D:  We are selling it to an existing market . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah but we're not putting some  there's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext . That's the problem . 
D:  That's  Yeah , and and , yeah , and and we're also <other> marketing a product . It's  what I'm seeing is a is a mid-range cost product . So so w we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing because all of a sudden we are gonna have cost overruns . So if we drop  if we are gonna choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ? 
A:  Mm 'kay . Mm . Yeah . Hmm . So if we're keeping it basic we're loo loo what we're looking to sell it basically is it's uh just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that sort of thing . 'Cause we really don't have anything else there , do we ? 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  I don't I don't see it , and to me if I'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for for design I'm gonna I'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price . I need to make it special with a high price tag . I don't want to make it economically uh g uh competitive . I want I want to market it as exclusive . So I would market this product it  at eighty-nine Euros and come up with some really <other> beautiful exterior design or something th but but I don't think we have that flexibility . 
A:  Mm-hmm . But i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty-five Euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden  stan standard T_V_ so the place  uh remote the then the place we're going to justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant <other> high-priced basic remote . Does that make sense , huh ? 
D:  No I no I I understand what you say , but what I'm what I'm , okay  we probably need to move along , but my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product , and if I'm coming in with a with with twenty-five Euros , which is mid-market price , um then what am I going to give these people for this ? So that's just my question , but we can keep talking . 
A:  Mm . Yeah we probably should . We we're doing alright for time . Yeah . Okay . Sorry that kinda cut into you there . 
B:  Well  
C:  No just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . 


C:  Um as for , you know , the the case design uh maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas . Right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small um  
A:  'Kay . Cheers . 


A:  Onto participant <other> four . 
D:  Well <other> you know for marketing f <other> marketing for me is uh  and uh how do I go here ? Okay . 
A:   <other> 
B:  Mm you can just click . 
D:  Go go . Is that right ? 
B:  No no no you just get off that . You just click anywhere . 
D:  Ah-ha . Yeah , what for me is it um  I d I don't know what I'm marketing right now , okay , 'til you spoke and when I wrote this , I don't know what I'm marketing . I just know that I I was identified as a a  we identified ourselves as a as a developer , as a manufacturer , and as a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  And so the th the twenty-five Euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price . That's what we decided here . 




A:  'Kay . Thanks guys . 
C:  Yep . 
D:  No that's not what I want , I want  Oh look it here .
