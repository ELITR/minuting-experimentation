Oh good grief . 
'Kay . 
Oh . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Shall I ? 
Okay . 
We just connect up . 
Thank you . 
There we go . 
Okay um 
so we decided on our market 
and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um 
<other> the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional  uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects 
and the the general feedback from them is that the most 
im uh w I'm sorry 
I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , 
sorry Project Manager <laugh> . 
Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device 
and we'll come to that later . 
So that was one of the first things we did . 
Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan . <other> 
Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . 
They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , 
and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . 
Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , 
is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , 
which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . 
So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third 
is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at . 
<other> Okay , um , 
now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , 
um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . 
So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? 
There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , 
uh again in contrast to last year . 
So a lot of interesting feedback there , 
both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan . 
Be interesting to see what our design people make of that . 
Unless anyone has any questions about that ? 
Not yet ? 
'Kay . 
Okay . 
<laugh> I know . 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
Does does light charge as as sunlight does ? 
Artificial light ? 
Has to be solar . 
Mm . 
Artificial light , no . 
That's going to  
I know , 
different parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm-hmm . Mm . 
Could I just ask  
referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ? 
I mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging 
or the two things not compatible ? 
Mm . 
So that affects the exterior design . 
Mm . 
Again it de 
Mm . 
It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , 
i <other> it's not gonna add anything , okay . 
Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in 
because I I personally  
right , okay . 
It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research , 
it's not a thing that people are looking for 
when we threw it open to the field yeah . 
But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . 
I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . 
I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , 
that would give the spongy feel , 
that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone . 
Like a rubber sleeve almost , yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to . 
Mm . Yeah . 
Mm . 
I don't  
s sorry to interrupt , 
I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , 
if we for example had a shell , once we open that  
yeah , so it'd be f yeah , yeah . 
Have I misunderstood you ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
I just had another idea , 
I don't know if it helps with that , 
but just to do with the R_S_I_ . 
<other> Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to <makes clicking sounds with tongue> . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
They're easy to replace as well , cheap . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Yeah just a thought  
they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , 
couldn't they ? 
A pencil or a pen , 
so they wouldn't really need a  
Mm-hmm . 
I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , 
it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in . 
If we flip open , 
now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , 
you seen those ? 
And they kind of respond to the turn of your body . 
Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display  th uh the remote control display thing . 
They don't look at themselves ? 
Just a thought . 
Yeah . 
I know what you mean , 
it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph <laugh> 
it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay . 
 trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much 
but  maybe we'll leave that one on the side . 
'Kay . 
Mm . 
Oh I think  forget about the mirror 
that was just a very quick passing thought yeah <laugh> . 
Sorry what does that stand for ? 
Okay . 
No you'd hold it  you don't  if you flip it open then you'd be  
Wouldn't you ? 
Isn't that the idea ? 
You us 
if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Kinetic ? 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Yeah , we talked about kinetic charging , 
we've deci seem to have decided on that , 
did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ? 
No , 
one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 
'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ? 
I oh I see . 
Right , okay , got you . 
Got you on that okay , 
didn't realise . 
Sorry could you repeat that last part ? 
L_C_D_ screen . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm , 
so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , 
okay . 
and it is just uh  
although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , 
we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , 
just go for the colours . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
The feel . 
'Kay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Is that going to be  
this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that's spongy . 
Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel 
which was the major thing that people wanted , market research , 
is that fancy  ? 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Yeah . 
I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , 
but I mean I totally agree . 
We looked at those remotes , 
I mean they are kind of anonymous , very similar looking things . 
This would definitely be different enough , 
I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more  
Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , 
that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming  I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on , 
which is another beauty of it . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm , so can I just recap uh Sarah , 
<other> for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , 
um <other> L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , 
we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . 
That's how far we've got , 
what else do we have to add to our decisions here ? 
Mm . 
Yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , 
but it's a good idea 
we just need to check on the cost , 
is that right ? 
And incorporating the company logo ? 
Mm . 
'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product 
don't they ? 
Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Did we  
I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , 
I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location , 
have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
You got to go through .
