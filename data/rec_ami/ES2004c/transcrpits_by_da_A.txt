<hums> 
Oops . 
Mm . 
After lunch . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
 
'Kay . 
Yep . 
<laugh> 
'Kay . 
Yep . 
Fine . It's okay with me . 
Yep . 
Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light 
because we we have to take into consideration size also , 
so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or  
and dynamo might take more space . 
Uh  
Right . 
Night . 
And are these like uh  
what are the life of the kinetic battery , 
it like it runs for long time ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
We c 
Solar would be slightly  expensives . 
It's twelve point f 
Another question is like  
sorry . 
W w which one would last the longest , 
because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . 
A remote control , like , 
so we have to s look at the life also . 
Okay . 
So  
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Second thing is  
yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , 
you call it a skin or whatever . 
So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that . 
So is that feature available in like uh titanium , 
or it's like only specific to plastic or  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Something like  
Alright . 
That could be a good idea . 
It could  
it would be comfortable to hold on also . 
Sorry I didn't get the last part , you're talking of  
Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely , you're saying like  
Uh-huh . 
Okay . 
'Kay . 
Absolutely , 
f for somebody who  very often , if he would  
a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a  
and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . 
And just one small question before like you are  , 
regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons 
like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay , uh 
would like to share something which I did here . 
First thing is uh basically on design 
we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . 
Second is we checked into competitors , 
the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . 
So y you generally see there's not much of variety 
and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . 
So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here . 
And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here . 
No particular remote is standard . 
Like , some some people have a  
<other> Here you see this ? 
This is on a  I I 
I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , 
rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized 
and they are not consistent th with other models and all . 
Okay , and second 
as already discussed with William , 
we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top 
and g graphic user interface 
basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , 
which is  
Like you have on a l uh  
icons or something y you have  is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface . 
So basically  not point or click   Press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . 
And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , 
that means the use of button . 
So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer . 
So we are having a combination of boards , 
so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels . 
 
But  
Mm-hmm . 
Okay 
and you mean to the  
And the lower distance . 
Oh f perfect . 
So the findings are too many cluttered buttons . 
Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained , 
example the volume and channel control buttons . 
All are confusing and in inconsistent . 
Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , 
there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . 
We have to check into the  for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it  this at a low cost , 
but for  
like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . 
So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here . 
Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound 
and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh  you can say trendy also ? 
And technologically innovative also . 
So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . 
My personal preferences would be like , 
as already  uh marketing department , they want something to do with fruit 
so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , 
but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh 
tomato red or whatever 
and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , 
like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh 
I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , 
so we we we would not change h that particular pattern 
because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls . 
This is central one , the one you  
yeah volume and channel . 
So keep that m  that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , 
if you look at all the models , it's here . 
This and voice recognition . 
The kinetic . 
Mm-hmm . 
Maybe we could start with the black and white . 
That that way we could upgrade later  . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
 
And for the  
sorry . 
For the body design I think plastic , 
uh w yeah 
we could use the body , 
for the inside 
and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design . 
 
Plast right . 
It's  
Uh I  it's different . 
Right . 
Acupressure , you could talk of acupressures . 
And finally the body should be retouchable , 
may maybe ch you can change the body or the case  casing  the case outside , 
it should be moulded  it  with  the design in such a way you can change it every time . 
Okay . The rubber . 
Fine . 
Yeah . 
Fine , uh we were talking of voice recognition also 
because that  we are not  for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost . 
So , are we looking at voice  ? 
Or maybe like uh William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains . 
For l yeah , the whistle . 
So we can  if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle . 
Yep . 
Uh sorry 
I didn't mention this , 
but we'll be incorporating in the design . 
Fine . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Again a questionnaire huh ? 
<hums> 
I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now .
