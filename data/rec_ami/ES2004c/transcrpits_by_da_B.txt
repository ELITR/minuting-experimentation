I'll wait until you're all um hooked up . 
Okay . 
 
Put it on in that way . 
Thanks . 
Okay . 
Welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . 
Right um this is our conceptual design meeting , 
um <other> 
I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves 
from the last meeting , 
I th I I think  yeah um . 
This is where we talk about um properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . 
So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already , 
but we'll just go over it . 
Um 
the minutes from the last time . 
Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything 
um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . 
Um 
we have decided on a  leaving out the voice recognition , 
we've decided on there being a flip design 
and um a different shape from what's normal . 
We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , 
just a different shape from what's normal , um . 
You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries 
and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , 
things like that , 
um and our market was going to be young , business , kind of range . 
Okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ? 
Yes if you feel  
 
It's okay <laugh> . 
Yeah . 
Okay thank you very much . Um 
let's start from the inside and work our way out . 
I don't think so , not yet . 
Um , yes , thank you . 
I hate those little things 
especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them . 
Okay . 
'Kay . 
<other> . 
'Kay . 
Wa <other> 
can you explain that ? 
Like a  
right , okay . 
How <other>  
what kind of  
how l long can you get out of that , 
I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? Or  
That doesn't count though does it ? 
I thought it was U_V_ like  
Any , any  
I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun . 
Uh , I don't think it counts electric lights 
no , 
but I mean not many  you don't want to limit your market . 
I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people . 
Mm , but then it would be charging through the day , 
I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening . 
Okay . 
Yeah I've seen  
But then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time 
so you're walking around , you're doing things , 
it is moving a lot of the time 
. If you'd  
I mean you switch the T_V_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side . 
Is it really gonna be enough ? 
Okay . 
So it's not  the draw on it isn't  
Okay . 
Like a dual kind of . 
Expensive as well . 
What kind of price are we looking at for  
I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ? 
Solar . 
Well they're not designed  
Practical-wise okay . 
You do get a bit of wear 
but don't calculators have a battery in them as well ? 
Mm . 
Okay , can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature ? 
Can we think about that ? 
'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing 
and it's  
Well add it in to think about um 
because , 
where am I ? 
If it is the kinetic thing 
and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape 
and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of  
we're doing something original and different 
um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much . 
But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than 
the eternal battle for control of the controls . 
No . 
Okay . 
Okay , right . 
Mm-hmm . 
What kind of things do we have to consider there ? 
Can we  
what kind of size , 
does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of  
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hinged , yeah . 
So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , 
like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not . 
'Kay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Oh it would be flat inside . 
Mm . 
I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . 
Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean  
Uh  <other> 
Like one of the palm pop thing . 
It would have to be attached . 
Okay , we'll talk about that  
so if you finish your  
and we'll come back to that . 
That's you , right okay . 
No . 
We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women . 
Well it's a remote control , 
you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_  <laugh> 
Yeah , 
no , no . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Okay , okay . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
Which means  
Okay . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? 
'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone . 
Yeah . 
That's what I was just saying , 
and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top 
and then be able to touch that for the <other> other controls , 
so have the um the volume and the programme , things like that , 
on the lower side . 
Okay . 
I can't see that , 
is that play and stop and things ? 
Or is that volume and channel ? 
Okay . 
Right . Okay . Um 
I'm not sure how long we've got left , 
but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed . 
So , we agree on  
Do we agree on the battery ? 
Yeah . 
Um , that means that there's no function for li the port , 
you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having  
so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . 
It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget , it's a 
selling point . 
I think the only 
I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , 
but I think pretty much we've used cheap  relatively cheap and simple things . 
The L_C_D_'s not cheap . 
Yeah , okay . 
And you could  
yeah . 
Okay . 
Do you want like a back-up ? 
Um , okay so we've got battery . 
The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ? 
So there's not a  really a decision to be made there , um . 
The buttons  
what did you give us as our  
The bare-board L_C_D_ or  
On the top one okay you've got the touch 
okay 
and then  
<other> Okay , okay . 
No , it's fine . 
For the inside . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Oh I think so , I think so . 
No 
I think I <other>  
we don't wanna be tacky 
if we've got a kind of different shape anyway 
um the fact  the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , 
so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , 
you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , 
but that's not really what we're focusing on , 
what we're focusing on is the m you know  
yes . 
So we could just pick anything . 
It's just different 
it's just different from everything else 
and I mean , I'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses , 
sort of beige and black 
um so you either want something that goes with that , 
which is what's on the market anyway , 
or you want something that contrasts as <other> 
you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and  
Mm . 
And you would just have an  
across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , 
you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little  
Mm . 
And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes <other> 
y you know , you could just go so far with it , 
like a puffer fish , 
you could just , you could take it wherever , 
so I think that's quite a flexible thing . 
Yes . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Okay we've got five minutes , 
<other> um , or that might've been up for a while . 
Mm-hmm . 
Have you  
Okay . 
Well they do , 
but I think we can  you could  <other> 
well it is , it is , 
I think you just address that with um advertising . 
Um , you associate the name with the individual product that it is 
and that does the work for you . 
Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , 
but everything else has a logo on it . 
The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently 
but I think it does , without that 
so I'm not worried about that . 
Depending on how i <other> 
I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so 
um that seems to make sense , 
but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about . 
But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards . 
Right I'm going to wrap it up there . 
I got a end meeting now message on my mo 
yeah 
<laugh> so . Um 
so I think we've probably got  
it says , closing we have forty minutes 
so I um think we've probably got about that time before we come back . 
It's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed 
and don't know how long that took  . 
<other> Is everyone happy ? 
<laugh> Okay .
