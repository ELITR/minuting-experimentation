<laugh> 
Yeah , yeah I was getting that impression as well . 
Etcetera . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , okay .  
That screwed in ?  
Yeah . 
'Kay ,   
Okay . 
Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components 
and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . 
Okay , first uh the  Into the method . 
The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ 
and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . 
Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 
'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't  un unfortunately aren't available . 
Um , findings , I've got my nice little picture there . 
This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five 
which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input 
and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment . 
Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options . 
There's um actually no rechargeable option available , 
so we  
I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ 
which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , 
dynamo charging , 
I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , 
people won't  
it's it's basically like wind-up radio . 
So you wind up your remote control before you use it . 
It might  
You  
Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , 
but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , 
like the the solar charging , 
'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get  when when you got T_V_ . 
No . 
Is it ? 
Alright i 
Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 
'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . 
Yeah , okay . 
But  
Yeah 
and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway . 
But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway . 
The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches 
and you d you don't even notice it . 
I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , 
I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work . 
Um yeah 
it's  
it charges into um some form of  
it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery , 
'cause they use them quite frequently in watches . 
And that'll that would l would last for um 
well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out  . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
and  
Yeah but then again 
I I think it is 
because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um <other> it's always moving for the whole day 
and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side . 
And th for the same the same reason , you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it 
and you put it  
no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be  
Mm . 
Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing 
but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case 
and they  
because , if you lie   
on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical . 
They're they're expensive , 
they don't  
Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest 
I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , 
um but the  
It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping , 
'cause if you drop stuff  
yeah 
if you if you have y 
the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big 
but I mean if  remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so . 
Y I think  
yeah , practically . 
I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot <laugh> 
whereas remotes you do , 
they can t 
Yeah they do , 
they  
yeah they've got dual things , but they're  the batteries are smaller I think . 
Mm . 
W m yeah 
so the  
Yeah 
the the s if you 
if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , 
um , I don't think you'd  
I think the  
it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in  or triple A_s would last . 
Yeah I think i I think it would , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Okay , 
well I'll move on . 
Um , my second part of my findings 
uh the mo 
most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which  pr printed circuit board , 
which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit 
and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message 
and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code 
and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts . 
Well 
well this  the thi 
the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be 
because you can you can print circuit board like that 
that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have  fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . 
If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , 
if you if you wanted to 
but um the  
there is an option to do to do it like that , 
or you could have some sort of 
array of switches 
which I'll speak about in the next bit 
so that  
And then to  uh yeah , 
so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . 
Now what I was thinking about that was  'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , 
like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote , 
but you could you could have lights behind the buttons 
and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , 
if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . 
Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , 
the  
there's the plastic 
which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case  case housing 
and 
the the main problems with the  
well you could go for wood 
but I think it would be a bit impractical . 
Titanium um very expensive just to process , 
which to make it is expensive , 
and rubber , 
well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , 
so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , 
but I was thinking more of the buttons , 
because the buttons which they've they've said 
that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture 
and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ . 
I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances 
but that's what they said . 
Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's 
quite <other> um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . 
If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , 
whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more  they can they can do sort of curved shapes . 
But whether whether or not  
because we'd have it in two separate units 
for the flip phone . 
Yeah . 
Yeah I th 
Uh . 
Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really , 
the ju just  
it w well you could make it available in the titanium , 
it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is  
it's light and strong 
but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for 
for a remote . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Rubber , yeah . 
And you can peel them off yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
T 
Yeah . 
Also the  
just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , 
the  
I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen . 
Now what I was saying before about instead of having  
you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board 
and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours 
and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection 
over  if you had them close enough , 
that would be one option . 
Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , 
but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen  
'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space , 
two they  you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch 
display . 
Uh what what  
Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could  becau you could fit it  
the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve  curved things with it , 
but um you can  
you wouldn't have  
with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off , 
you wouldn't have that with the 
with the L_C_D_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board . 
With  
W also with the  
Yeah . 
You could have a flat screen inside , yeah , 
but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside . 
It wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white , 
but there'd be touch touch buttons , 
so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , 
w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ . 
Is rubber . 
Mm . 
Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest . 
Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out 
but I I think they could get a bit easily lost , 
'cause I had  
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah okay . 
Yeah that's  
yeah that  that's the end of m my  
Yeah . 
Uh yeah . 
Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple , 
I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate  you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , 
'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking . 
Mm . 
Um . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
I mean you can  you could do it , 
you could have a  
'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out , 
but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , 
I'm not sure about  
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
If you if  
yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well , yeah we  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah I think  
I mean if  
Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have 
and also if they've got it  if they've got these parts already in stock , then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them , 
uh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them . 
So do you reckon that's a good idea that , where's the remote , I'm here thing ? 
I think that would be quite fun . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one , 
I mean they use them in calculators so . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Well you cou um . 
K no 
the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch  a battery that goes in a watch . 
So it's a lot smaller , 
so it would  
Yeah . 
Yeah the  well I think were  we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons , 
on the on the on on the top one we're gonna 
 yeah . 
On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , 
the anti-R_S_I_ ones . 
Um , okay on  we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons . 
Plastic , 
okay . 
Yeah . 
Mm no . 
Mm . 
<cough> 
You can you can just  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah 
j with these rubber these rubberised ca 
not the actual uh plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside . 
<laugh> 
Oh yeah , yeah 
the whistle ones , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , depending on the expense of it . 
And they've got in stock , 
so yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Did it ?
