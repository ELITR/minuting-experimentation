B:  the minutes from the last time . 
B:  Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything 
B:  um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . 
B:  we have decided on a  leaving out the voice recognition , 
B:  we've decided on there being a flip design 
B:  and um a different shape from what's normal . 
B:  We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , 
B:  and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , 
abst_sum - abstract: The Project Manager reviewed the decisions from the previous meeting.

D:  and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um 
D:  <other> the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional  uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects 
D:  Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan . <other> 
D:  Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . 
D:  They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , 
D:  and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . 
D:  Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , 
D:  is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , 
D:  which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . 
D:  um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . 
D:  There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , 
abst_sum - abstract: The Marketing Expert made a presentation on trend watching, including trends in user requirements and trends in fashion.

C:  Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components 
C:  and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . 
C:  'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't  un unfortunately aren't available . 
C:  This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five 
C:  which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input 
C:  Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options . 
C:  There's um actually no rechargeable option available , 
C:  I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ 
C:  which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , 
C:  dynamo charging , 
C:  I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , 
C:  So you wind up your remote control before you use it . 
C:  like the the solar charging , 
C:  'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get  when when you got T_V_ . 
B:  I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun . 
C:  But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway . 
C:  The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches 
C:  I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , 
A:  it like it runs for long time ? 
C:  well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out  . 
D:  referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ? 
C:  Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing 
C:  but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case 
C:  on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical . 
C:  Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest 
A:  W w which one would last the longest , 
A:  because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . 
B:  'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing 
D:  Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in 
D:  It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research , 
D:  But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe . 
C:  most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which  pr printed circuit board , 
C:  the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be 
C:  Now what I was thinking about that was  'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , 
C:  but you could you could have lights behind the buttons 
C:  Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , 
C:  which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case  case housing 
C:  there's the plastic 
C:  well you could go for wood 
C:  but I think it would be a bit impractical . 
C:  Titanium um very expensive just to process , 
C:  so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , 
C:  If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , 
C:  whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more  they can they can do sort of curved shapes . 
A:  yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , 
A:  So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that . 
D:  I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , 
B:  So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , 
B:  Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not . 
C:  but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen  
C:  the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve  curved things with it , 
D:  I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , 
D:  if we for example had a shell , once we open that  
C:  You could have a flat screen inside , yeah , 
C:  w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ . 
B:  I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . 
D:  <other> Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to <makes clicking sounds with tongue> . 
C:  but I I think they could get a bit easily lost , 
D:  Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display  th uh the remote control display thing . 
B:  We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women . 
B:  you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_  <laugh> 
abst_sum - abstract: The Industrial Designer presented all the components of the device and announced that several of the features already discussed would not be available.

C:  The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches 
C:  I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , 
B:  'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing

C:  so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , 
abst_sum - abstract: He suggested substituting a kinetic battery for the rechargeable batteries and using a combination of rubber and plastic for the materials.

A:  we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top 
A:  we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . 
A:  the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . 
A:  So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here . 
A:  And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here . 
A:  basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , 
A:  so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels . 
B:  Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? 
A:  So the findings are too many cluttered buttons . 
A:  Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained , 
A:  Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , 
A:  there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . 
A:  We have to check into the  for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it  this at a low cost , 
A:  So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here . 
A:  so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , 
A:  but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh 
A:  I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , 
A:  so we we we would not change h that particular pattern 
abst_sum - abstract: The User Interface Designer presented his main interface design, which included buttons for the most frequently used features and a graphic user interface on the LCD screen for other functions, to keep frequently used features easy to use.

A:  Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition ,

abst_sum - abstract: He announced that speech recognition was still an option to consider, depending on price.

B:  I'm not sure how long we've got left , 
B:  but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed . 
B:  Do we agree on the battery ? 
A:  The kinetic . 
B:  so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . 
B:  Um , that means that there's no function for li the port , 
B:  I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , 
B:  The L_C_D_'s not cheap . 
A:  Maybe we could start with the black and white . 
B:  The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ? 
D:  did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ? 
C:  the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch  a battery that goes in a watch . 
C:  Yeah the  well I think were  we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons , 
C:  On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , 
C:  Um , okay on  we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons . 
A:  For the body design I think plastic , 
D:  so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , 
D:  we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , 
B:  um the fact  the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , 
B:  so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , 
D:  This would definitely be different enough , 
D:  I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more  
B:  you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little  
D:  And incorporating the company logo ? 
D:  'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product 
B:  I think you just address that with um advertising . 
B:  Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , 
B:  The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently 
D:  I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , 
D:  have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ? 
C:  Yeah , depending on the expense of it . 
abst_sum - abstract: The Project Manager then began a discussion to decide what was going into the final design.

B:  Do we agree on the battery ? 
A:  The kinetic .

abst_sum - abstract: It was decided that a kinetic battery would be used in place of a rechargeable battery, that the remote will feature an LCD screen and rubber casing and rubber buttons, and that interchangeable rubber covers in fruit colors will be available.

B:  so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . 
B:  I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , 
A:  So we can  if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle . 
C:  Yeah , depending on the expense of it . 
D:  have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ? 
abst_sum - abstract: Speech recognition may be included if it is not too costly.

A:  The kinetic . 
B:  so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it .

abst_sum - decisions: It was decided that the remote would feature an LCD screen, rubber buttons, colorful rubber changeable skins, a kinetic battery, and possibly speech recognition if it is still within the budget to include it.

C:  'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't  un unfortunately aren't available . 
C:  There's um actually no rechargeable option available , 
abst_sum - problems: Several of the features that the group had wanted to integrate into the design were either too costly or unavailable due to new limitations from the factory.

B:  Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything 
C:  'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't  un unfortunately aren't available . 
C:  There's um actually no rechargeable option available , 
abst_sum - problems: The group had to change many of the original design elements to an alternative.
