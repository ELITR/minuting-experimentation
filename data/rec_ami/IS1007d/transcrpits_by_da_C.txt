<cough> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes <laugh> . 
Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . 
You you can s here . 
And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . 
You can uh choose the direction 
and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function . 
You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the <laugh> for the speech recognition system here . 
And here the the switch that control if you want  
Well I I I think uh it's the  
Yeah but  
Yeah . 
Well so it's a microphone array . 
<laugh> No 
it's just a single microphone , 
and you  
I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to  
well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . 
And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . 
And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger . 
Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars 
<laugh> fifteen dollars , 
but uh well it's not it's not uh  
yeah , 
but uh it's just a prototype 
and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh  voila . 
Yeah 
the  and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars .  
How many , excuse me ? 
Well uh f battery , we use uh about uh  
Yeah . 
Rechargeable of course , 
because we have the charger . 
Yeah and you just  
On uh yeah one battery . 
<laugh> 
The  
excuse me ? 
Oh yeah 
it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh  
if you uh like it's exist . 
Yeah . 
So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger 
and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright . 
Then the next time you pick it , oh 
it works <laugh> . 
Yeah just explain the button uh Norman . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yep . 
<laugh> 
Yeah it's  
So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . 
The second version is also simpler , 
we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also <laugh> . 
So basically th it's the same uh  
yeah <laugh> . 
Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . 
But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . 
Press one button uh acting as a a enter button . 
So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user . 
And uh it's also cheaper to produce . 
We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . <laugh> 
Yeah 
it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system . 
So  
<laugh> so Norman will explain to you <laugh> . 
Yeah yeah of course mm  . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Thank thank you <laugh> . 
And so mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Alright 
please uh go on Norman with the special features <laugh> . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
 
You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control 
that that you ca you can add up <laugh> to the  to your remote control 
i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on . 
H here is just the the the module for the kids 
and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up  they come up with their modules , 
they just plug in it 
and they can have all the control they want here . 
We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , 
and it acts like the previous one , 
you just plug in and it works . 
<laugh> 
The titanium 
and so it's very uh  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well so the price to produce  For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . 
Uh it's about it  
The  without without the charger 
it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems . 
Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , 
and finally three dollars for the charger . 
So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the L_C_D_ <laugh> , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . 
<laugh> It's about <laugh>  
so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars . 
But it's just if you want all functionalities . 
Excuse me ? 
Yeah . 
Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself 
since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons . 
Okay . 
A sponge . <laugh> 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Well it doesn't look much fancy 
I'll I'll say three or four . 
Yeah . 
It's it it  
<laugh> 
Technical aspects . 
Yeah a three . 
Uh four . 
I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated 
so removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . 
Well it's it's the same for both 
so <other> I will give a five , six . <laugh> 
Well five also uh 
 Norman please . <laugh> 
With lot of functionalities . 
<laugh> 
Mm for both it's the the same innovations . 
 six , let's go for six . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Talk about  
<laugh> 
Yeah 
but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen . 
If you have the L_C_D_ , 
but if n 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well I think both are really easy to use 
because there are few button buttons , 
and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so  
Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product 
so I will give a six for the easy to use . 
Yeah , 
it's cheaper to produce . 
And uh if the the  
well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so  
Yep . 
Yeah . 
Six . 
Um six . 
Yes as you say , with better uh <laugh> 
 yeah . 
And to improve the the look . 
Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so 
so let's go back to our laboratory and <laugh>  
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
It's optional yeah , 
since well according to this study uh people more <laugh> likes more to have a spongy uh <laugh> remote control than  
 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Well you can   if you had uh something li 
Oh no , 
because if you if you add uh something  
well yeah maybe 
because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but  
Yeah yeah yeah 
it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the <laugh> functionalities um on the same module , but uh  
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Well so  
Yeah yeah 
I think we are <other>  
yeah 
but we are also the um well the components will have to change 
because uh we have to deal with the shape 
and um  but I don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so  
Uh well but it's a bit complicated to  if if if you need machines to  different machines to um ah well  
Yeah yeah 
we can have the same global shape 
and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that . 
Sponge . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
So we finished the prototype uh presentation if you have uh something else to say . 
<laugh> 
That was good . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Fine yes uh <laugh> 
Very democratic . 
Thank you  <laugh> . 
Alright . 
<other> Come up with new product <laugh> . 
Yeah and also more well uh <other> more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting 
uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , 
but I think it's alright . 
We achieved uh project goal I think . 
<laugh> It's w 
yes , more or less . 
Yeah but  
Alright . 
So . 
So uh coffee machine . 
<laugh> Okay .
