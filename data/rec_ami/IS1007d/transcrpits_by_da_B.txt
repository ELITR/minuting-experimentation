<laugh> Okay . 
Yeah , 
so can you go out to the shared folder ? 
Mm the shared folder . 
Yes . 
We have a presentation . 
<laugh> 
Uh  
 
So I got the participant uh three . 
W uh <cough> . 
Three . 
It's the final design , 
yeah . 
<cough> 
S so so I discussed with Guillaume . 
Right . <laugh> 
And uh <cough> so we have <other>  
and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , 
because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . 
So we come up with two versions . 
One with and one without L_C_D_s . 
Um but both comes with a charger 
and then detachable and uh or  control module . 
And detachable big buttons for all people um . 
So <laugh> . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
No i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it . 
The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . 
<laugh> 
Yeah <cough> 
Mm . 
Yeah <cough> yeah . 
For the  
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . 
A_A_ rechargeable batteries . 
Yeah rechargeable batteries . 
We have the charger so it's no problem . 
<cough> 
<laugh> Actually uh it's a flexible thing . 
You just n uh  
<laugh> 
Yeah yeah . 
Yeah <laugh> . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
<laugh> At uh <other> yeah . 
I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , 
b this button  
yeah alright . 
This button is like the mouse  is like a joystick , 
you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction 
so you can make a turn 
and it  the additi functions associated to all the actions 
you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button <laugh> . 
You can move up , down , left , right , 
or you can do a swing . 
So a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . 
So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement <laugh> . 
Yeah . 
This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_ . 
Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ . 
Mm . 
Uh okay this is new prototype uh <laugh> . 
<laugh> Yeah yeah . 
Mm . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh no 
th actually th we'll come to that point in our  
Yeah . 
W w I'll I'll come to that point later on . 
Yeah . 
Th they <other> either these with the  uh the the charger any 
in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah . 
Uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh <laugh> . 
It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone 
but uh again depends on the types . 
I think we have to investigate more on that , but <other>  
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah 
but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to  people are willing to pay more for good design . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
<cough> 
Yeah 
we'll we'll come up to that , 
the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular 
so you want more function you pay more . 
If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , 
so is uh modular . 
Yeah yeah , 
for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it  put it back in , or you can use the other one , 
or <laugh> the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah . 
You want a microphone to put in the <laugh> speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see <laugh> . 
So  
It's pretty flexible in the yeah price <laugh> . 
Uh yeah yeah 
you should present that . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah <cough> 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah <cough> 
the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful . 
Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , 
powerful is that all the controls with <other> the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n 
but here you only have few buttons 
but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities . 
But in addition with simplicity . 
So that's the best idea , 
the cond that 
that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here <laugh> . 
Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you . 
The first one is the speech recogniser , 
again it's detachable or add-on . 
And then we also have security feature 
for example this here  oop <laugh> 
it's very robust  , 
it doesn't break 
and the material , what's the material again ? 
Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , 
again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . 
Lithium-ion may be a good one , 
but you can replace it with cheaper one , 
again you pay for what you get , 
and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . 
So when you finish watching your T_V_ <cough> and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , 
so so that's the  or is it  
that's the reminder part . 
Yeah 
and um  
And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , 
so we didn't define the vocabulary 
so it's up to the user to define 
so  
sorry ? <laugh> 
And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a  of T_V_ programmes by genre , 
and this can be used by the adult or by the children . 
So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night . 
So it's pretty powerful , 
and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . 
Yeah . 
And <cough> and for the materials that is cheap to produce 
I think uh it's quite clear from  yeah <laugh> . 
And also like the  and the fancy designs yeah . 
Maybe we can improve more on the design but <laugh> 
 uh this is the <laugh>  
Yeah <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah <cough> . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<cough> 
Mm . 
Spongy spongy . 
Mm mm . 
Mm <cough> mm . 
But the the problem is that uh <cough>  is it robust to mishandling ? 
We have  
you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy <laugh> . 
Spongy <laugh> . 
<cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<cough> So  
so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ? 
Yeah . 
But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ? 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<other> I think we can improve on the design . 
Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh  <laugh> design . 
Um we have been focused all all this <other> time on the <cough> on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . 
As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help <other> . 
Yeah <cough> . 
Yeah . 
<cough> Yeah . 
<cough> 
Mm . 
<cough> 
<other> 
Yeah <laugh> 
from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um <cough> the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , 
because uh that is really innovative , 
and for now  and another innovation we have is simplicity 
and  simplicity , few buttons , we've uh <other>  A lot of functionalities . 
So that is uh that is uh for both th 
Our gi 
I think that the our our product is uh has the best in all 
 well this is a biased judgement <laugh> 
because we designed them . 
Yeah . <cough> 
Uh the innovation is v is very high I think . 
Both . 
For both . 
It's the same innovation . 
So maybe I can put six to seven . 
Both . 
Mm . 
Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ? 
We haven't really uh determined <laugh> what are  actually actually 
it's good to have a L_C_D_ 
but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ? <laugh> 
Yeah ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah but  
Yes exactly . 
But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ . 
Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ <cough> we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , 
we give what the customer uh wants , right . 
<laugh> 
<cough> <laugh> 
Yeah <cough> 
<cough> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<cough> 
Yeah 
I think  
sorry . 
<cough> 
Yeah . 
<cough> 
Yeah . <cough> Yeah . 
Yeah . <other> 
Mm . <cough> S <cough> 
Yeah . 
I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . 
I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people . 
For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated 
because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . 
For kids they want simply the  s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , 
so that's why <cough> we have the parental module . 
Uh we can ha have  build a more complex design if if they want it , 
but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um  we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . 
So in terms of easy to use I think it's very user customisable . 
User customisation is very important 
yeah . Yeah 
so <cough>  
W uh  
I think it's the same . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> To improve on the design . 
Huh ? 
The speech recogniser is a add-on module . 
Right ? 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<cough> The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children 
 <other> when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , 
and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . 
So we might lose the customer because of this . 
I don't know , 
what do you think uh ? 
Yes exa 
what do you think , 
I don't know . You are Marketing Manag <laugh> . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<cough> But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? <laugh> 
<cough> 
Mm . 
<cough> 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Well well the other aspect is that if <other> in the  when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the  you're gonna keep the same customer , 
because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons . 
So so  
Yeah 
i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . 
So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , 
attracting them to come back in again and again . 
<laugh> We're not trying to follow the Microsoft 
and we don't want to the m  
Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be  can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? 
<laugh> Yeah , it depends on the v production . <laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
What we can change is to propose the <other> customers with skins . 
For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin 
and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah you can pl 
in what material would that be in uh ? 
Yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing <laugh> . 
<laugh> 
 I suppose that you  this criteria , is it ? 
<cough> Room for creativity . 
This room is a bit small , but <cough> 
<laugh> but I think it's okay for us to work with . <other> 
<laugh> Yeah mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's okay . 
<laugh> Good job <laugh> good job . 
<laugh> 
Thank you  <laugh> . 
Alright . 
Mm . <laugh> 
Mm we  I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . <laugh> 
Mm . <laugh> 
Mm . 
<cough> 
<laugh> Alright then , we finished ? 
Thank you very much .
