<laugh> 
Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
The cost would be le reduced . 
Is that two or one ? 
<laugh> 
Now what is the whole day rating for that ? 
Whole day's rating . 
What type of battery ? 
Something like a two A_ , A_ three size batteries ? 
Mm-hmm . 
And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ? 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Uh-huh and also the switch . 
<laugh> Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , 
because that's a major that's a  
Okay 
and if you disable speech recognition system then ? 
Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm . 
Okay . 
Yeah people are willing to pay more , 
but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . 
Or uh  
<cough> 
Something like customised . Yeah 
Mm hmm hmm hmm . 
Hmm okay . 
And this is other one ? 
Mm hmm hmm hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah that's fine . 
Okay . 
Mm hmm hmm hmm . 
<laugh> 
With the charger ? 
<laugh> I think we can use Excel <laugh> . 
Yeah it's a nice input 
but we have an other inputs from the l public demands . 
I think we will just have a rough look 
and then we can make our statements , 
and we can finalise the product based on this discu 
I think we can just go to my presentation then . 
We can wind up . 
Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions . 
So the marketing made an evaluation criteria 
and these were some of the findings , 
and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , 
but most of the people what they are interested is  first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , 
it should be very fancy with colourful 
and uh very handy to hold . 
And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative . 
Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . 
And the third one is easy to use . 
Okay and if we go to the next slide , 
here you can find  these are the latest fashion updates , 
and so this  in Paris and Milan  they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , 
so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . 
So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes . 
And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , 
it should be somewhat spongy . 
Yeah so uh <laugh> so finally we have these three criterias . 
One is fancy look , 
second is innovative , 
and third is easy to use . 
<other> So these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . 
So  and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , 
say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , 
and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this . 
So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , 
so on this scale , if it is true , if it is  if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , 
or if it is false , it doesn't  it looks uh  it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . 
So  
<other> We can make our study on this and  
No no 
we have  you have designed two products now , 
one is with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ . 
According to you , 
no 
according to you designers , 
how will feel  does it uh with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ? 
Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_ . 
On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look  how does it look ? 
D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? 
And you both agree for that ? 
<laugh> 
So I take three on  with L_C_D_ ? 
So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ? 
Four . 
And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ . 
Five with L_C_D_ and  
So without L_C_D_ ? 
No no 
according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ? 
With L_C_D_ . 
And without L_C_D_ ? 
Okay . 
No 
actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . 
So I  there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y 
then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness . 
So we can't go  <laugh> 
I mean that what you are sayin that's what the design  
No it's like this , 
I mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . 
Uh then  
No 
on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now . 
L_C_D_ ? 
Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . 
Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a 
I mean that depends upon your design , so  
I mean  
So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? 
And which  do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ? 
Yeah . 
Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates . 
So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes 
according to fruit and vegetable 
or a spongy touch 
without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . 
Even then our product is going to be very good . 
Yeah . 
Yeah that's right . 
Yeah yeah that's right . 
So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ? 
Or you want it to be six ? 
S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . 
As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , 
and it's going to be much simpler to use . 
So . 
That's going to be an optional . 
If somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no . 
It's an optional . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module 
and so that their parents can't use it <laugh> . 
In the same set , yeah , 
and and individual buttons to make them work . 
I mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple  or how many couples have a T_V_ 
or to the number or singles who have a television . 
So based on that I think  
But you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options . 
On the same P_C_B_ 
yeah yeah . 
Yeah that's right . 
I mean you could just provide with an optional  . 
So it's something like a Microsoft product <laugh> update . 
Updates and we sell it . 
We make updates and sell it  . 
And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? 
Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? 
Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and  
Or uh it could be like this  the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all . 
Yeah , yeah that's right . 
Yeah that's right . 
I think you need to look into the material . 
Yeah yeah . 
I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . 
<laugh> 
I feel it's fine , 
we know we don't need uh  I think it's okay . 
This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations . 
And the leadership was excellent . 
Yeah that's right . 
Yeah that's right . 
<laugh> 
And new ideas found . 
Any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting ? 
<laugh> I mean uh what type of product would you think  could we make this more interesting ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah 
that is within the budget . 
And the evaluation was  
Yeah that's right . 
And the next is celebration . 
So  
Yeah thank you , thank you very much .
