So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design 
and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . 
<laugh> So  . <laugh> 
So let's see the  what did you prepare . 
Sh share folder for th your presentation ? 
Because I have here  
Okay just one  . 
Why you why you you put it in the the side ? 
It's not a good place maybe  . 
Oh it's very costly , microphone array <laugh> . 
How much does it cost this one ? 
Fifteen dollars ? 
Ah it's above it's above the budget . 
How many b battery is there ? 
Battery . 
So one one battery ? 
It's kinetic reserve . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
I think it's not a good idea 
because after maybe one or two months of function is  getting destroyed . 
If you 
  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
No four dollars , it's <laugh>  good .  
And we will we will serve the charger with this ? 
With the remote control . 
Okay 
so the price of the charger included in the  
<other> 
Mm-hmm . <laugh> 
The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . 
Well that's  so  
We have we have just <laugh>  
The price of selling is twenty five Euros . 
And the price of production  
That's for this basis function 
and if you want more you pay more . 
 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
 
But  
Mm-hmm . 
Titanium . 
<laugh> 
 
What what's  
Maybe yeah . 
What's the price to p to produce ? 
With with with the charge ? 
Okay . 
We don't have charger . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
We don't have all the options <laugh> . 
Charger we don't have charger here either . 
No it's 
it's below the the the budget . 
It's below the bu the budget . 
We  
 
Yeah . 
You . 
And you ? 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Uh <other>  
For L_C_D_ . 
Without L_C_D_ . 
Uh no innovative yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
So let's remove it . 
But  
This is the problem . 
No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ . 
Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , 
and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Without L_C_D_ . 
Yeah . 
What a what what about the sys speech recognition ? 
 what about the integration of speech recognition ? 
Ah so it's optional with the  okay . 
I think it will be  I think i 
I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , 
because maybe parents will lose these uh  
Yeah . Or ma yeah . 
Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , 
so mayb better if you have all this in the same  
 
Yeah . 
So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional  uh will be optional . 
Uh  
I think it inc increase . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
I think it i increases . 
 
Hmm . 
<laugh> And and we we we we we we don't want that . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
So  
 
Project evaluation project satisfaction , for example . 
I don't know , we have to ask these question . 
We have to give answers so <laugh>  
<laugh> Project evaluation . 
 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah I think so <laugh> . 
He gave you the liberty to talk as you wants <laugh> . 
Uh the teamwork was very very good . 
I was really  I am very satisfying to work with with you . 
<laugh> Oh  . 
<laugh> Less fancy . 
De 
<laugh> 
Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . 
Yeah <laugh> free free coffee 
Yeah thank you for your work and
