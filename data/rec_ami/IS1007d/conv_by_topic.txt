C:  <cough> 
A:  So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the 
B:  <laugh> Okay . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  for the remote control . <laugh> So  . <laugh> 
topic_description:	opening_None


A:  So let's see the  what 
B:  Yeah , so can you go out to the shared folder ? 
A:  did you prepare . 
B:  Mm the shared folder . 
A:  Sh share folder for th your presentation ? 
B:  Yes . We have a presentation . 
A:  Because I have here  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Uh   So I got the participant uh three . W uh <cough> . Three . It's the final design , yeah . 
A:  Okay just one  . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <cough> S so so I discussed with Guillaume . 
C:  Mm . <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  Right . <laugh> And uh <cough> so we have <other>  and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . So we come up with two versions . One with and one without L_C_D_s . Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or  control module . And detachable big buttons for all people um . 
C:  <laugh> S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes <laugh> . Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . You you can s here . And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . You can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function . 
B:  So <laugh> . Mm . Mm . Mm-hmm . 
C:  You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the <laugh> for the speech recognition system here . And here the the switch that control if you want  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Why you why you you put it in the the side ? 
C:  Well I I I think uh it's the  
A:  It's not a good place maybe  . 
C:  Yeah but  
B:  No i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it . The the microphone picks up 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  the speeches from anywhere . 
D:  Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? 
C:  Well so it's a microphone array . <laugh> No it's just a single microphone , and you  I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to  well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh it's very costly , microphone array <laugh> . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah <cough> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . Yeah <cough> yeah . 
D:  Okay . 
C:  And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger . 
A:  How much does it cost this one ? 
C:  Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars <laugh> fifteen dollars , but uh well it's not it's not uh  yeah , but uh it's just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh  voila . 
B:  For the  Yeah . 
A:  Fifteen dollars ? Ah it's above it's above the budget . 
D:  The cost would be le reduced . 
C:  Yeah the  and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars .  
B:  Mm . Hmm . 
A:  How many b battery is there ? 
C:  How many , excuse me ? 
A:  Battery . 
C:  Well uh f battery , we use uh about uh  
B:  Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . A_A_ rechargeable batteries . 
C:  Yeah . Rechargeable of course , because we have the charger . 
B:  Yeah rechargeable batteries . We have the charger so it's no problem . 
C:  Yeah and you just  
A:  So one one battery ? 
C:  On uh yeah one battery . 
D:  Is that two or one ? 
B:  <cough> 
A:  It's kinetic reserve . 
B:  <laugh> Actually uh it's a flexible thing . You just n uh  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Now what is the whole day rating for that ? 
C:  The  excuse me ? 
D:  Whole day's rating . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  What type of battery ? 
C:  Oh yeah it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh  if you uh like it's exist . 
B:  Yeah yeah . 
D:  Something like a two A_ , A_ three size batteries ? Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah <laugh> . 
C:  So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright . Then the next time you pick it , oh 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . Mm . <laugh> At uh <other> yeah . I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button  yeah alright . This button is like the mouse  is like a joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it  the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  it works <laugh> . Yeah just explain the button uh Norman . <laugh> 
A:  Mm . 
B:  all in a single button <laugh> . You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement <laugh> . Yeah . This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_ . Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ? 
C:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months 
B:  Mm . 
A:  of function is  getting destroyed . If you 
B:  Uh okay this is new prototype uh <laugh> . 
C:  Yeah it's  
A:    <laugh> 
C:  So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . The second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also <laugh> . So basically th it's the same uh  yeah <laugh> . Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . Press one button uh acting as a a enter button . So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah yeah . 
D:  <laugh> Uh-huh and also the switch . <laugh> Okay . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm . <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  And uh it's also cheaper to produce . We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  No four dollars , it's <laugh>  good .  
D:  And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , because that's a major that's a  
B:  Oh no th actually th we'll come to that point in our  
C:  Yeah it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Okay and if you disable speech recognition system then ? 
C:  So  
B:  W w I'll I'll come to that point later on . 
D:  Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm . 
C:  <laugh> so Norman will explain to you <laugh> . 
A:  And we will we will serve the charger with this ? 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah yeah of course mm  . 
B:  Th they <other> either these with the  uh the the charger any in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah . 
A:  With the remote control . Okay so the price of the charger included in the  
B:  Uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh <laugh> . It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types . I think we have to investigate more on that , but <other>  
A:  <other> 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> Thank thank you <laugh> . And so mm-hmm . 
A:  Mm-hmm . <laugh> The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . Well that's  so  
B:  <other> Yeah . Yeah but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to  people are willing to pay more for good design . 
D:  Yeah people are willing to pay more , but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . 
A:  We have we have just <laugh>  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  The price of selling is twenty five Euros . 
B:  Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
A:  And the price of 
B:  <cough> 
C:  Alright please uh go on Norman with the special features <laugh> . 
A:  production  
D:  Or uh  
B:  Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , so is uh modular . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  That's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more . 
B:  Yeah yeah , for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it  put it back in , or you can use the other one , or <laugh> the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah . You want a microphone to put in the <laugh> speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see <laugh> . So  
A:   
D:  Something like customised . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Mm hmm hmm hmm . 
A:   
D:  Hmm okay . 
B:  It's pretty flexible in the yeah price <laugh> . 
C:   You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control 
A:  But  
B:  Uh yeah yeah you should present that . 
D:  And this is other one ? 
C:  that that you ca you can add up <laugh> to the  to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on . 
B:  <laugh> <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up  they come up with their modules , they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here . We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , and it acts like the previous one , you just plug in and it works . 
D:  Mm hmm hmm hmm . 
B:  Yeah <cough> Mm . Hmm . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Yeah <cough> the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  simplicity and powerful . Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with <other> the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities . But in addition with simplicity . So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here <laugh> . Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you . The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . And then we also have security feature for example this here  oop <laugh> it's very robust  , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? Titanium material <laugh> . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  <laugh> The titanium and so it's very uh  
A:  Titanium . 
B:  Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_ <cough> 
D:  Yeah that's fine . 
B:  and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , so so that's the  or is it  that's the reminder part . Yeah and um  
D:  Okay . 
B:  And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define so  sorry ? <laugh> And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a  of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . 
D:  Mm hmm hmm hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night . So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . Yeah . And <cough> and for the materials that is cheap to produce I think uh it's quite clear from  yeah <laugh> . And also like the  and the fancy designs yeah . Maybe we can improve more on the design but <laugh>  uh this is the <laugh>  
A:   What what's  
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Maybe yeah . What's the price to p to produce ? 
C:  Well so the price to produce  For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . Uh it's about it  
A:  With with with the charge ? 
C:  The  without without the charger it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems . 
D:  With the charger ? 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah <laugh> . <laugh> 
C:  Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . So if you uh sum up uh everything 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  We don't have charger . <laugh> 
C:  wi with the L_C_D_ <laugh> , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> I think we can use Excel <laugh> . 
C:  <laugh> It's about <laugh>  so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars . 
A:  We don't have all the options <laugh> . Charger we don't have charger here either . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  No it's 
C:  But it's just if you want all functionalities . 
A:  it's below the the the budget . 
B:  Yeah <cough> . 
C:  Excuse me ? 
A:  It's below the bu 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  the budget . We  
topic_description:	presentation of prototype(s)_None


D:  Yeah it's a nice input but we have an 
A:   
D:  other inputs from the l public demands . I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  I think we can just go to my presentation then . We can wind up . Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions . 
B:  <cough> 
D:  So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh 
topic_description:	marketing expert presentation_None


D:  in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is  first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold . And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative . 
B:  <laugh> Mm . <cough> 
D:  Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . And the third one is easy to use . 
C:  Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons . 
B:  Mm . 
topic_description:	user requirements_None


D:  Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find  these are the latest fashion updates , and so this  in Paris and Milan  they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . 
B:  Spongy spongy . Mm mm . 
D:  So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes . And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . 
B:  Mm <cough> mm . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  But the the problem is that uh <cough>  is it robust to mishandling ? 
D:  Um . 
B:  We have  you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy <laugh> . Spongy <laugh> . 
C:  A sponge . <laugh> 
topic_description:	trendwatching_None


D:  Yeah so uh <laugh> so finally we have these three criterias . One is fancy look , second is innovative , and third is easy to use . <other> So these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . So  and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , say that we have a seven point scale , 
B:  <cough> Mm-hmm . 
C:  Hmm . 
D:  from one to seven , and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Mm . 
D:  So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , so on this scale , if it is true , 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm . 
D:  if it is  if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't  it looks uh  it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . So  
B:  <cough> So  so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ? 
D:  <other> We can make our study on this and  No no we have  you have designed two products now , one is with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ? 
A:  You . 
D:  According to you , no according to you designers , how will feel  does it uh with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ? 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_ . On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look  how does it look ? D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? 
B:  Mm . Mm . 
C:  Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four . 
D:  And you both agree for that ? 
A:  And you ? 
B:  <other> I think we can improve on the design . Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh  <laugh> design . Um we have been focused all all this <other> time on the <cough> on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help <other> . Yeah <cough> . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . It's it it  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Technical aspects . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  So I take three on  with L_C_D_ ? So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ? 
C:  Yeah a three . Uh four . I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so 
D:  Four . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . 
B:  <cough> Yeah . 
D:  And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ . 
C:  Well it's it's the same for both so <other> I will give a five , six . <laugh> 
B:  <cough> Mm . <cough> 
D:  Five with L_C_D_ and  
B:  <other> 
C:  Well five also uh  Norman please . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah <laugh> from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative 
A:  Uh <other>  
B:  of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um <cough> the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because uh that is really innovative , and for now  and another innovation we have is simplicity and  simplicity , few buttons , we've uh <other>  
C:  With lot of functionalities . 
B:  A lot of functionalities . So that is uh that is uh for both th 
D:  So without L_C_D_ ? 
B:  Our gi I think that the our our product is uh has the best in all  well this is a biased judgement <laugh> because we designed them . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ? 
B:  Yeah . <cough> Uh the innovation is v is very high I think . 
D:  With L_C_D_ . And without L_C_D_ ? 
A:  For L_C_D_ . 
B:  Both . 
C:  Mm for both it's the the same innovations . 
B:  For both . It's the same innovation . So maybe I can put six to seven . 
D:  Okay . 
C:   six , let's go for six . 
A:  Without L_C_D_ . 
B:  Both . 
D:  No actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . So I  there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness . So we can't go  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  Uh no innovative yeah . 
B:  Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ? 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Talk about  
B:  We haven't really uh determined <laugh> what are  actually actually it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ? <laugh> 
D:  I mean that what you are sayin that's what the design  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  No it's like this , I mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . Uh then  
A:  <laugh> So let's remove it . 
B:  Yeah ? Yeah . Yeah but  
C:  Yeah but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen . 
A:  But  
B:  Yes exactly . 
A:  This is the problem . 
D:  No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now . 
C:  If you have the L_C_D_ , but if n 
D:  L_C_D_ ? Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ . 
D:  I mean that depends upon your design , so  
B:  Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ <cough> we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , we give what the customer uh wants , right . 
D:  I mean  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? And which  do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ? 
B:  <cough> <laugh> 
C:  Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so  
B:  Yeah <cough> . <cough> Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product so I will give a six for the easy to use . 
B:  <cough> Yeah I think  sorry . 
A:  No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ . 
B:  <cough> 
A:  Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates . So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . Even then our product is going to be very good . Yeah . 
B:  <cough> Yeah . <cough> Yeah . Yeah . <other> 
C:  Yeah , it's cheaper to produce . 
B:  Mm . <cough> S <cough> 
C:  And uh if the the  well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so  
D:  Yeah that's right . 
B:  Yeah . I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people . For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . For kids they want simply the  s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , so that's why <cough> we have the parental module . 
C:  Yep . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah yeah that's right . 
B:  Uh we can ha have  build a more complex design if if they want it , but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um  we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . So in terms of easy to use I think it's very user customisable . User customisation is very important yeah . Yeah so <cough>  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ? 
C:  Six . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  W uh  
D:  Or you want it to be six ? 
C:  Um six . 
B:  I think it's the same . Yeah . 
C:  Yes as you say , with better uh <laugh>  yeah . 
A:  Without L_C_D_ . 
D:  S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . 
C:  And to improve the the look . 
D:  As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , and it's going to be much simpler to use . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  so let's go back to our laboratory and <laugh>  
B:  <laugh> To improve on the design . 
D:  So .

topic_description:	discussion_None


A:  What a what what about the sys speech recognition ? 
B:  Huh ? 
A:   what about the integration of speech recognition ? 
B:  The speech recogniser is a add-on module . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Right ? 
D:  That's going to be an optional . If somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Ah so it's optional with the  okay . 
D:  It's an optional . 
C:  It's optional yeah , since well according to this study uh people more <laugh> likes more to have a spongy uh <laugh> remote control than  
A:  I think it will be  I think i 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these uh  
D:  Yeah , but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it <laugh> . 
A:  Yeah . Or ma yeah . Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , so mayb better if you have all this in the same  
C:   
D:  In the same set , yeah , and and individual buttons to make them work . 
A:   
B:  Oh . <cough> The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children  <other> when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . So we might lose the customer because of this . I don't know , what do you think uh ? 
A:  Yeah . So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional  uh will be optional . 
B:  Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . You are Marketing Manag <laugh> . 
D:  I mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple  or how many couples have a T_V_ or to the number or singles who have a television . So based on that I think  
A:  Uh  
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . <cough> But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? <laugh> 
C:  Well it's about the same because if  
A:  I think it inc increase . <laugh> <laugh> 
C:  Well you can   if you had uh something li 
A:  I think it i increases . 
C:  Oh no , because if you if you add uh something  well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but  
A:   Hmm . 
D:  But you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options . 
C:  Yeah yeah yeah it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the <laugh> functionalities um on the same module , but uh  
B:  <cough> Mm . <cough> Mm . Yeah . 
D:  On the same P_C_B_ yeah yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Well well the other aspect is that if <other> in the  when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the  you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons . 
D:  Yeah that's right . I mean you could just provide with an optional  . 
B:  So so  Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again . <laugh> We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  So it's something like a Microsoft product <laugh> update . Updates and we sell it . We make updates and sell it  . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> And and we we we we we we don't want that . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be  can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? <laugh> Yeah , it depends on the v production . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  <laugh>

D:  And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? 
C:  Well so  Yeah yeah I think we are <other>  yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um  but I don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so  
D:  Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and  
B:  Mm . 
D:  Or uh it could be like this  the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Uh well but it's a bit complicated to  if if if you need machines to  different machines to um ah well  
B:  Yeah . What we can change is to propose the <other> customers with skins . For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better . 
D:  Yeah , yeah that's right . 
C:  Yeah yeah we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah that's right . 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> Yeah you can pl in what material would that be in uh ? 
C:  Sponge . <laugh> 
D:  I think you need to look into the material . 
B:  Yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing <laugh> . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah yeah . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  So
