C:  <cough> 
A:  So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the 
B:  <laugh> Okay . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  for the remote control . <laugh> So  . <laugh> 


A:  So let's see the  what 
B:  Yeah , so can you go out to the shared folder ? 
A:  did you prepare . 
B:  Mm the shared folder . 
A:  Sh share folder for th your presentation ? 
B:  Yes . We have a presentation . 
A:  Because I have here  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Uh   So I got the participant uh three . W uh <cough> . Three . It's the final design , yeah . 
A:  Okay just one  . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <cough> S so so I discussed with Guillaume . 
C:  Mm . <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  Right . <laugh> And uh <cough> so we have <other>  and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . So we come up with two versions . One with and one without L_C_D_s . Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or  control module . And detachable big buttons for all people um . 
C:  <laugh> S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes <laugh> . Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . You you can s here . And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . You can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function . 
B:  So <laugh> . Mm . Mm . Mm-hmm . 
C:  You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the <laugh> for the speech recognition system here . And here the the switch that control if you want  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Why you why you you put it in the the side ? 
C:  Well I I I think uh it's the  
A:  It's not a good place maybe  . 
C:  Yeah but  
B:  No i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it . The the microphone picks up 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  the speeches from anywhere . 
D:  Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? 
C:  Well so it's a microphone array . <laugh> No it's just a single microphone , and you  I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to  well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh it's very costly , microphone array <laugh> . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah <cough> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . Yeah <cough> yeah . 
D:  Okay . 
C:  And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger . 
A:  How much does it cost this one ? 
C:  Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars <laugh> fifteen dollars , but uh well it's not it's not uh  yeah , but uh it's just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh  voila . 
B:  For the  Yeah . 
A:  Fifteen dollars ? Ah it's above it's above the budget . 
D:  The cost would be le reduced . 
C:  Yeah the  and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars .  
B:  Mm . Hmm . 
A:  How many b battery is there ? 
C:  How many , excuse me ? 
A:  Battery . 
C:  Well uh f battery , we use uh about uh  
B:  Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . A_A_ rechargeable batteries . 
C:  Yeah . Rechargeable of course , because we have the charger . 
B:  Yeah rechargeable batteries . We have the charger so it's no problem . 
C:  Yeah and you just  
A:  So one one battery ? 
C:  On uh yeah one battery . 
D:  Is that two or one ? 
B:  <cough> 
A:  It's kinetic reserve . 
B:  <laugh> Actually uh it's a flexible thing . You just n uh  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Now what is the whole day rating for that ? 
C:  The  excuse me ? 
D:  Whole day's rating . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  What type of battery ? 
C:  Oh yeah it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh  if you uh like it's exist . 
B:  Yeah yeah . 
D:  Something like a two A_ , A_ three size batteries ? Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah <laugh> . 
C:  So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright . Then the next time you pick it , oh 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . Mm . <laugh> At uh <other> yeah . I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button  yeah alright . This button is like the mouse  is like a joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it  the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  it works <laugh> . Yeah just explain the button uh Norman . <laugh> 
A:  Mm . 
B:  all in a single button <laugh> . You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement <laugh> . Yeah . This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_ . Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ? 
C:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months 
B:  Mm . 
A:  of function is  getting destroyed . If you 
B:  Uh okay this is new prototype uh <laugh> . 
C:  Yeah it's  
A:    <laugh> 
C:  So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . The second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also <laugh> . So basically th it's the same uh  yeah <laugh> . Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . Press one button uh acting as a a enter button . So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah yeah . 
D:  <laugh> Uh-huh and also the switch . <laugh> Okay . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm . <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  And uh it's also cheaper to produce . We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  No four dollars , it's <laugh>  good .  
D:  And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , because that's a major that's a  
B:  Oh no th actually th we'll come to that point in our  
C:  Yeah it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Okay and if you disable speech recognition system then ? 
C:  So  
B:  W w I'll I'll come to that point later on . 
D:  Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm . 
C:  <laugh> so Norman will explain to you <laugh> . 
A:  And we will we will serve the charger with this ? 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah yeah of course mm  . 
B:  Th they <other> either these with the  uh the the charger any in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah . 
A:  With the remote control . Okay so the price of the charger included in the  
B:  Uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh <laugh> . It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types . I think we have to investigate more on that , but <other>  
A:  <other> 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> Thank thank you <laugh> . And so mm-hmm . 
A:  Mm-hmm . <laugh> The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . Well that's  so  
B:  <other> Yeah . Yeah but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to  people are willing to pay more for good design . 
D:  Yeah people are willing to pay more , but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . 
A:  We have we have just <laugh>  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  The price of selling is twenty five Euros . 
B:  Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
A:  And the price of 
B:  <cough> 
C:  Alright please uh go on Norman with the special features <laugh> . 
A:  production  
D:  Or uh  
B:  Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , so is uh modular . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  That's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more . 
B:  Yeah yeah , for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it  put it back in , or you can use the other one , or <laugh> the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah . You want a microphone to put in the <laugh> speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see <laugh> . So  
A:   
D:  Something like customised . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Mm hmm hmm hmm . 
A:   
D:  Hmm okay . 
B:  It's pretty flexible in the yeah price <laugh> . 
C:   You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control 
A:  But  
B:  Uh yeah yeah you should present that . 
D:  And this is other one ? 
C:  that that you ca you can add up <laugh> to the  to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on . 
B:  <laugh> <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up  they come up with their modules , they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here . We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , and it acts like the previous one , you just plug in and it works . 
D:  Mm hmm hmm hmm . 
B:  Yeah <cough> Mm . Hmm . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Yeah <cough> the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  simplicity and powerful . Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with <other> the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities . But in addition with simplicity . So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here <laugh> . Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you . The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . And then we also have security feature for example this here  oop <laugh> it's very robust  , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? Titanium material <laugh> . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  <laugh> The titanium and so it's very uh  
A:  Titanium . 
B:  Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_ <cough> 
D:  Yeah that's fine . 
B:  and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , so so that's the  or is it  that's the reminder part . Yeah and um  
D:  Okay . 
B:  And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define so  sorry ? <laugh> And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a  of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . 
D:  Mm hmm hmm hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night . So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . Yeah . And <cough> and for the materials that is cheap to produce I think uh it's quite clear from  yeah <laugh> . And also like the  and the fancy designs yeah . Maybe we can improve more on the design but <laugh>  uh this is the <laugh>  
A:   What what's  
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Maybe yeah . What's the price to p to produce ? 
C:  Well so the price to produce  For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . Uh it's about it  
A:  With with with the charge ? 
C:  The  without without the charger it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems . 
D:  With the charger ? 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah <laugh> . <laugh> 
C:  Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . So if you uh sum up uh everything 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  We don't have charger . <laugh> 
C:  wi with the L_C_D_ <laugh> , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> I think we can use Excel <laugh> . 
C:  <laugh> It's about <laugh>  so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars . 
A:  We don't have all the options <laugh> . Charger we don't have charger here either . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  No it's 
C:  But it's just if you want all functionalities . 
A:  it's below the the the budget . 
B:  Yeah <cough> . 
C:  Excuse me ? 
A:  It's below the bu 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  the budget . We  


D:  Yeah it's a nice input but we have an 
A:   
D:  other inputs from the l public demands . I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  I think we can just go to my presentation then . We can wind up . Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions . 
B:  <cough> 
D:  So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh 




C:  So we finished the prototype uh presentation if you have uh something else to say . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . 
A:   Project evaluation project satisfaction , for example . I don't know , we have to ask these question . We have to give answers so <laugh>  
D:  <laugh> 
B:   I suppose that you  this criteria , is it ? 
A:  <laugh> Project evaluation .  
B:  <cough> Room for creativity . This room is a bit small , but <cough> <laugh> but I think it's okay for us to work with . <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  I feel it's fine , we know we don't need uh  I think it's okay . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah mm . 
C:  That was good . 
D:  This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations . 
B:  Mm . Yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's okay . <laugh> Good job <laugh> good job . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  And the leadership was excellent . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah I think so <laugh> . He gave you the liberty to talk as you wants <laugh> . 
C:  <laugh> Fine yes uh <laugh> . 
D:  Yeah that's right . Yeah that's right . 
A:  Uh the teamwork was very very good . I was really  I am very satisfying to work with 
C:  Very democratic . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  with you . <laugh> Oh  . 
C:  Thank you  <laugh> . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Thank you  <laugh> . 
C:  Alright . 
B:  Alright . 
D:  And new ideas found . Any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting ? 
B:  Mm . <laugh> 
C:  <other> Come up with new product <laugh> . 
D:  <laugh> I mean uh what type of product would you think  could we make this more interesting ? 
A:  <laugh> Less fancy . 
B:  Mm we  I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah and also more well uh <other> more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , but 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm . <laugh> 
C:  I think it's alright . We achieved uh project goal I think . 
D:  Yeah that is within the budget . 
A:  De 
C:  <laugh> It's w yes , more or less . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  And the evaluation was  
A:  Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . 
D:  Yeah that's right . 
C:  Yeah but  


B:  <cough> 
C:  Alright . 
D:  And the next is celebration . 
C:  So . 
D:  So  
C:  So uh coffee machine . <laugh> Okay . 
B:  <laugh> Alright then , we finished ? 
A:  Yeah <laugh> free free coffee . Yeah thank you for your work and  
D:  Yeah thank you , thank you very much . 
B:  Thank you very much .
