<laugh> Bongiorno . 
<laugh> Punish . <laugh> 
You wish . <laugh> 
Welcome . Uh  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
No . 
Alright . 
<laugh> <laugh> 
<laugh> <laugh> 
<laugh> 
But they like dark colours , 
you said in the p 
Okay . 
Well 
then I suggest that 
the corporate colours are grey and yellow . 
I had <other>  
Or we could make  oh . 
Yeah , 
o o 
I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh <laugh> telephone from uh Siemens . The yellow uh rubber telephone . 
It's the it's the rubber uh cover . 
And it's uh colourful . 
It looks likes a banana . <laugh> 
We have the fruit , we have the colours . <laugh> We have the simple design . 
Um thirty five . 
And the b 
the light blue and <other> it's also in yellow . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well , 
I don't ha really have much to add , 
um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion . Um  
<other> Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . 
Well , 
a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . 
These are both with uh with voice recognition , 
but they're very advanced and very high-tech and <other> just um , well , a weird um shape . 
So I suggest  I couldn't uh  
I had a small uh mock-up uh <other> sign on the <laugh> on  paper . 
<laugh> But it didn't work . 
My pen didn't load um the information . 
So I made a really simple <laugh> f uh a shape on uh  in um PowerPoint . 
But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow . 
But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber . 
So it's easy in your hand  Uh indeed . 
Yeah . 
Great . <laugh> 
Oh and um 
to add on um Ruud's information , 
in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , 
and still have the ease of use , 
because we have an easy interface . 
And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on . 
Yeah . 
So if you have the voice recognition , you can <other> you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it . 
Yeah . 
Right . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Great . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Like the watch . 
But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and  
if uh if you have a watch , 
you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also . 
You you walk 
and uh  but uh 
you  you're sitting on a couch . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Oh , 
we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round . 
the scroll-wheels  I had some  I had some information about it too . 
  But I th I don't think uh 
I don't think <other> there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels . 
I d 
I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , uh that's a possibility , 
but  
But Flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for  
A 
volume , okay . 
Yeah . 
Wheel . 
Yeah , 
I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb . 
So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect . 
<other> Yeah yeah , 
you can 
um  I have some information about it . 
Uh in the voice recognition you say a word  you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute . 
Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function 
and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . 
that's the sample sensor . 
So 
So if you say mute , it says mute again , 
and then it's um  well , I believe it's uh  
Yeah , 
and then uh he he repeats its action what  which he believes it is . 
So you say mute , 
he repeats mute 
and you  makes a computer sound mute , 
and then goes to the mute function . 
Yeah . Well , 
I don't have 
um  I haven't looked for uh for information about it , 
but I don't think information  uh 
y I don't think you need it on a display . 
Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh  
'cause uh  uh all  any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen , 
yeah . 
But what about um the markets <other> uh wants colourfuls uh designs ? 
So if you use titanium  <other> 
Okay . 
Oh , 
sorry . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And I would think  
And they can be implemented with a regular chip ? 
Okay , 
but we also  
uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker  
oh , 
evalu 
<other> But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all . 
Well , 
if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , 
but you can point it just <other> to the other wall . 
Yeah . 
And the regular chip . 
And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . 
Yeah . 
No . Think so too . 
But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours . 
Um no . Nothing more . 
Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ? 
Yeah , okay . 
Sorry , 
Oh , 
sorry . 
Yeah . 
yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<other> The project drawing is for the next  
Yeah , right . 
Single-curved . 
But can there be uh wor can they work together ? 
Or do we have to choose between them ? 
'Cause if we have to choose  
yeah ? 
Okay . 
What if not ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Grey and yellow . 
Yellow case and grey buttons , I think . 
I believe the  
But you have already 
um  you must have a red uh on and off button . 
And um  Well  well  
Well , 
there is . 
<laugh> Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print , 
with  and uh  
<laugh> <laugh> No . 
A scroll-wheel . 
Voice recognition , of course . 
What what did you say ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
or you could use plastic buttons . In the rubber . 
Yeah , 
b 
But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually . 
What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber . 
It is not uh something uh  
it's no information I read about it or so , 
but it's just from  
No , 
but but uh it  
Yeah , b yeah . 
Yeah , that's possible , 
but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case . 
So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
but but the the plus or the minus . 
You have to draw the  
Yeah , 
it's on the cover . 
So if you uh  
You just move the problem . 
Y 
uh can you separate these uh these  
I do . <laugh> 
Or the s uh the sideways . 
Or the the back . Or the back . 
I think  
Yes , 
especially when there are l a few buttons on it , you have uh a lot of space to touch . 
So you just have it in your hand completely 
or or  i you play with it . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Regular . 
Use with  . 
 . 
For the finishing touch . 
Uh yeah . 
But um Sebastian has everything .
