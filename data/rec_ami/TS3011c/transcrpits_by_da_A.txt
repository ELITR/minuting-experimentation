 Do you need to change anything on it ? 
Because otherwise I will already open it . 
Okay . 
Is it much changes ? 
Uh I didn't  No no . I do hot have  Only the same information . <other> 
Hello , Sebastian . 
I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well , in the control room . 
Oh , 
it's that Roo again , always late . 
Bongiorno . 
Hmm . <laugh> 
I see some interesting  
okay . 
<other> People , welcome back . 
The third meeting . <other> 
Um I have some points I would like to  uh some some issues I would like to point out . 
Um <other> first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ? 
If you do not make minutes , no problem , 
but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down , 
so I could  uh can uh um use that in the in the report . 
<other> Um the second thing , um <other> I was th uh s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I'm talking to it , but I still need to point to the television , 
because it works with infrared . 
That's quite strange . 
Okay . 
We'll come to that later , I g I think . 
Um <other> the agenda for now  
uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ? 
Okay . Um 
we wi we will have your individual presentations , 
uh then the decision on the remote control concept , 
um and uh the closing . 
Forty minutes in total for this . 
So um <other> 
I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you've made . 
Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , 
because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation . 
Um yeah . 
<laugh> 
Uh w wait a sec wait a se 
uh could you go to the previous slide ? 
Um because I'm taking minutes 
Um were the important themes enclose . 
Yeah  
The feel of  to be spongy  
okay . 
<laugh> 
Okay , so so , yeah , 
it might not be t uh it 
it shouldn't be too hard . 
It it  
maybe it rubber 
or or  
yeah . <laugh> Okay . 
Yeah . 
Well , 
that's interesting . 
You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah , it is , it is i yeah . 
Yeah . 
Do you know the phone ? 
It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five , 
I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away , 
the very  
You kn you know , Ruud , as well ? 
About th 
Okay . Okay . Um uh 
okay . 
Do you have   uh thit  that was  
Okay . <other> 
Okay , so 
the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the  our target group . 
And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials . 
Okay . 
Okay , 
Roo , 
could you do your presentation ? 
Okay , well 
it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about . 
Shape . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip 
um  I mean this is how you hold a remote control . 
Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery , 
s because um  
Yeah . 
Yeah , exactly . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah . 
Yeah . It grips automatically . Yeah , <dental inbreath> 
okay . 
Okay , good . 
Yeah . 
Way too much I think for our goal , 
yeah . 
Okay , 
b but I think we'll  
yeah . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Well , 
it would be very new to the market , 
but  <laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny . 
I mean solar is  of course it's nice , 
but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel . 
Um hand dynamo  
Well , 
maybe m 
Yeah , I know . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And wha 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay , 
because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Well  
This will be the remote , 
right ? 
Um with uh maybe a channel selector . 
What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ? 
Because this is how you keep it  
Volume ? 
Well , 
what about mute ? 
Thi i i m I guess uh th 
this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um  
And click it to muten the device . 
And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . 
So 
I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones . 
So maybe um  I guess that  that's something you two uh need to think about . 
Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Well , 
all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume . 
Nokia has a  well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , 
because you gri grab it like this . 
Yeah . I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah . 
For you too , 
yeah . 
Okay . 
Sebastian . Um  
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
It performs the action . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . Uh well  uh 
d did we already decide on the display ? 
To  
No . 
On screen display . 
Yeah . 
Okay 
th 
Okay . Good . 
Kineti 
okay . 
Okay , 
it's maybe a bit too too flashy , 
too  
yeah . 
Yeah , 
but that  that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different . 
Yeah . Okay . 
No no , 
but the uh um  that's what Sebastian said . 
He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . 
But but yet , I understood that the market is different . 
So um  
No , 
r 
rubber with colours . 
Colourful 
and  
Yeah . 
But but do we want the curved uh uh design , 
or  
I 
it's too dull . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . Okay . 
Okay , 
what about um <other> the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . 
Because it it's of cour 
Yeah . 
Well  
It depends also on your on your  
Well , 
it depends on your walls actually . 
If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably  you're probably right . 
But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um  yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue . 
So  
Yeah . 
<other> I like the scroll wheels uh idea . 
Yeah . 
Well , 
it looks  
uh yeah , well um 
according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology , 
and I mean L_C_D_ is  
well , 
ok I know , 
but it's m it's less um s standard 
than than  
Well , 
we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part . 
That's the problem . 
Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it , 
because it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it . 
Mm yeah . 
Okay , okay . 
Yeah . Okay , I I agree . 
Ruud , do you have any um anything you would like to um add or or maybe thoughts 
or  
I think i 
No ? 
Sebast 
uh nee , 
Roo ?  Roo , do you have any other  
Nothing more . Um  
Sebas 
<other> Well , 
we we <other> need to describe uh decisions now . 
So um 
on the energy , well , we decided . 
Chip . 
The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve . 
User interface um 
Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . 
I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . 
Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow . 
<other> Keep it in mind . 
And um the buttons , well we talked about it now . 
The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design . 
And for you , the product evaluation . 
Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that . 
Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . 
And I'm going uh to plan my holidays . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
it's it's 
uh  when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready . 
Yeah ? I can . 
Um maybe one of you could write it down . 
Great . 
Um  Uh you you need to help me . Um  
The casing is curved , single-curved . 
Traditional batteries uh and solar . 
No , 
they can be complementary . 
Uh al al I uh  
Every device  
Yeah . Okay , um 
th 
Battery and solar , yeah . 
Yeah , with colourful rubber . 
Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers , 
but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish . 
Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow . Yeah . 
Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course , 
but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours . 
Well , 
I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before . 
Well , 
it it doesn't have to be red . 
Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for . 
Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , 
it should be a full colour cover with such an image 
or or  
I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group , I guess . 
Black and yellow , yeah . 
Okay , 
so we have to deal with wh what's possible here . 
Yeah . 
Okay . Um 
more f more more decisions we made . Um  Um  
The scroll-heel . Yes , 
the voice recognition we already decided . 
Yeah . 
Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<other> I think rubber is nice . 
Because it uh i 
I mean what do you touch 
the button , 
and what do they want 
spongy uh uh devices , 
or or i 
 . 
Uh is that  
uh does our our supplier say so ? 
Yeah . 
You could place a  
um uh this this would be the button . 
The scroll-wheel , I mean . 
And you could place the indica th th the signals the  
No no , there's no painting , 
only uh yellow or  But it's into the rubber . 
Yeah , 
but this is on the pla 
yeah , I know . Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean . 
What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ? 
Yeah . Well actually , 
we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . 
I mean , this is this is the finishing . This is um what's on the edge . What you feel . 
But the front , on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber . 
I mean  
<other> I know , 
but do you touch this 
or do you touch this ? 
I mean , I I never touch between the buttons . 
Yeah , the side , exactly , the sideways . The side , 
but do you touch between the the  these buttons ? 
Okay . Well , 
we do not have very much time uh left . 
Um I guess you two have to figure that out . 
I'm going to leave the decision to you , 
um because you have to make its prototype , 
and um  yeah 
y 
you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities 
and uh  
so I'm going to leave it  the decision with you . 
Um Sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ? 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions . 
The chip is is not really  
Okay , well . 
Yeah . Okay . 
Um okay , 
then I think we are uh quite finished . 
Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes 
and um  
Yeah ? 
Yeah , um 
if you write  wrote anything down , uh could you put it on the shared folder ? 
Yeah . 
I know , 
but  
well  
Great . 
<cough> <laugh> 
Right .
