Um  Mm , don't think so . 
Unless uh things have suddenly change again . 
Uh don't know . 
Maybe uh you've got new information , <laugh> like uh last time . 
<laugh> Okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oop . 
<cough> 
No . 
'Kay . 
Hmm ? 
Oh . 
 . 
Yeah ,   
Okay . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
My method ? <laugh> 
Well , 
findings . Uh  
Ease of use is important , 
but uh innovation is more important , 
and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . 
And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture , 
and that they want spongy material . 
Probably watch too much Sponge Bob . 
Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . Simple shapes  uh m material . 
But we  since we are concentrating on uh the younger group  
'Kay . 
Well , uh 
one example given was this , 
so um 
I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something . 
No , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects . 
But  
Which one ? 
This ? 
Yes . 
<laugh> Uh well , 
it might . 
But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control . 
But  
Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge . 
Yeah , exactly . 
Yeah , 
and like uh the older group likes familiar materials , 
but that doesn't mean we should use wood , 
So  
Well , 
this this is an example of what they would like . 
But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group , 
I think we should use soft materials 
and uh make it colourful 
or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers . 
So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like . 
I've seen it , 
but  
'Kay . Uh that's about it . 
Yes . 
Uh soft material . 
Uh the fancy look and feel . 
Yes . Apparently . 
Yeah . 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Um  <laugh> Uh well , 
it's obvious obviously new . 
So it might attract uh the young customers . 
And 
yeah , 
the  
yeah , 
the older people liked wood . 
No the  
Yeah , 
the younger people liked soft material . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Standard ? 
Nah , um n no , I don't think so . 
M 
<other> 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
Or black and yellow . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Uh didn't  did we inc uh include the digi digits 
or uh leave them to the speech recognition ? 
'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button . 
There  the icons . 
So you don't touch the icons that much .
