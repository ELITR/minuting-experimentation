Okay . 
I think so . 
Yeah , that's a good plan . 
And I'm a marketing person . 
I wanna figure out how to sell them . 
My name is Eileen . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
No . 
Mm-hmm . 
<cough> 
<other> 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm 'kay so  
Three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay . 
Functional , conception and detailed . 
<other> Maybe we should redesign it . <laugh> 
After we've finished the remote control we'll get to that . 
Okay , I'll see what I can do . 
See if I r 
See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something . <other> 
<cough> 
So that it will record okay . 
Um uh um traditional kitty cat . 
<laugh> I've a very fat cat . 
<laugh> And it likes to sit like that . 
Okay . 
Am I supposed to wipe off that or  
okay . 
Okay . 
Uh , okay . 
I hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause I don't like snakes . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
<other>

I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things . 
That's right . 
Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help .

Mm 'kay . 
And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond  what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay so  
Okay . 
So the light sensor would activate the signal . 
Mm-hmm . 
But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it . 
Well , because you're s because you're silly . Because people are silly . 
I mean it could be on  
well , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table 
um <other> ,
