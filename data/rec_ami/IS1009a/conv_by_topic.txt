D:  No . 
A:  Here is what this thing should be . This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control . Uh should be original <laugh> , trendy , and , of course , user friendly .

A:  So maybe you wanna make some notes of that . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Okay ? 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  All right . <other> Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . Um . That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with . The same goes for the conceptual design , there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards . Detailed design , same thing basically . 
D:  Mm 'kay so  Three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Functional , conception and detailed .

D:  <other> Maybe we should redesign it . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Yes . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  After we've finished the remote control we'll get to that . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah , okay . All right ? 
topic_description:	other_project goal and design process


A:  Then , tool training try out the white board , participant can draw their favourite animal . Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? So that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board . You wanna go Eileen and

B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	other_drawing animals on the whiteboard


A:  Here's the project finance uh which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing . Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro . Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro , the market range unlimited meaning international 
D:  Mm-hmm . <other> Okay . 
A:  and the production cost should not exceed  hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro . 
D:  Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Profit . Um is fifty mm . 
A:  So these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design <other> to materials , cost , etcetera . 
topic_description:	project budget_None


A:  Now , uh the discussion I guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control ? 
D:  Oops . 
C:  Yeah , of course , using remote control . Yeah . 
A:  I exp I s 'cause we we use 'em  we use 'em , right , everyday . And um 
B:  Yes . 
A:  now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ? Would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly  better marked buttons , you know , things like that ? 
C:  Uh . 
D:  well  maybe we have to move along , okay . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay we have uh  yeah , we have to move along , but I think we have some good good points to start with here . 
C:  Yeah , good point . 
topic_description:	other_ideas about remote control design


B:  Yeah , I  
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Yes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact . Yeah , those which we get here nowadays it's very long . And um and it should have multi-purpose . Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system . 
A:  Small , right . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
C:  Audio player . Oh . Okay . 
A:  So it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically . 
B:  Yes , exactly Yes . 
C:  Hmm . 
B:  Yes . 
C:  <laugh> Divides us  <laugh> Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Exactly . 
D:  <other> At um twelve fifty Euros per  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Well . 
D:  Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> We certainly can try to  I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things . That's right . 
C:  Yeah 
A:  It should be something new  it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have . 
topic_description:	other_size and functionality


A:  Now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design . 
C:  , of course . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah , design should be , yeah  it should be different . All the  almost all the remotes  
A:  Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . Maybe it should  different colours or materials or you know . Um so yeah shapes right , you know , like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know . 
C:  Yeah , maybe ten  I do yeah , colours and al shapes also . Yeah . 
B:  Yes , exactly . Are different shapes . Yes . Yes . 
C:  Yeah of course yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help . 
topic_description:	other_how it looks


D:  I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap , because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . They can't find it . 
A:  Yes . <laugh> That is true , because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we you know , whatever . And and they  suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say , where the hell is my <laugh> my remote control yeah ? 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  <other> 
D:  So some  <other> 
A:  Well or yeah or if it's really , if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So if lost  
C:  Yeah , some beep or something like that , so that we can go  
D:  Uh so , so it's really the beep or , or a light should blink . 
B:  Or a b 
A:  If lost uh signal with b throw signal , you know . 
B:  Should ha 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  A fluorescent signal , yeah . 
D:  Mm 'kay . 
C:  Yeah , maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Exactly , I mean just <other> that's what I'm saying . I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or  
C:  May not be beep . Beep or uh it's a light , maybe it's a light . 
D:  And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond  what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ? 
A:  Okay , my  my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden , in in other words if it's like in a dark spot , uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant , at that moment it's it's like , it's like um , what you call it  a light s sensors , you know ? In in that moment it has a sensor , i it it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , I mean , that we can discuss that later , you know . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay so  
B:  Yes . 
D:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah , probably  yeah , probably it's a  yeah , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . And uh  
D:  So the light sensor would activate the signal . 
A:  That's right . You know there would be <other>  right you have to have some kind of sensor and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough . Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off , but I think they only work to certain degree and  
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yes . 
D:  But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it . 
C:  Yeah , of course , that didn't  
A:  What with  
D:  Well , because you're s because you're silly . Because people are silly . 
B:  Then , in that case  
C:  I i we can't do it . 
A:  Oh yeah well , but then those people  we can't help everybody . <laugh> 
D:  I mean it could be on  well , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table um <other> , you know , 
topic_description:	other_how to find when it is misplaced


A:  Okay , the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . I think you all  did you get uh notices on your computer for this ? Okay so well , you got the notice um  uh . The working design , I guess that's the function I_D_  uh who is this ? The industrial designer  That's you . 
C:  Me yeah . 
B:  Yes . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , it's functional de yeah , exactly , technical . 
A:  Okay . So , we looking for a working design when we come back . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> 
C:  Uh working design , yeah , it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design . 
A:  Then  And then the technical funct you are the technical function , so so you are the working design . So you have a working design and then a functional design . And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . That would be your idea . And , of course , price . That it , that it , that the price is a good price . I mean , the price is given , but , that was  
C:  Yeah , functional design , and you  
B:  Okay . 
D:  Mm-hmm . We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price . 
A:  That's right . That's right . 
B:  <other> 
A:  And , you know , specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that . I think that's the end of the show . Yeah . So um <other> we have  well , we have a twen two two two three minutes . Um any questions at this point ? Or uh suggestions ? 
D:  Mm . 
A:  I think  basically basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions uh , uh I guess , you can uh  
B:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Okay , I think I have enough to think about 'til our next meeting . How about you people ? Really ? Okay . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah , even I have . Yeah , even I have , I think , yeah . 
B:  Yes . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  'Kay . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Alright , well uh  
C:  Yeah , so let's see .
