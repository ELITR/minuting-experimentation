Okay . 
Everybody ready ? 
Uh I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves 
and everybody's name and what your function is ? 
So maybe we start with you ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
And your name is ? 
Okay . 
Very good . 
And as you already know I am Betty . 
I am the project manager for today . 
So why don't we look at the presentation <other> to see what we really are supposed to do . 
<other> Um . 
<other> Yes y opening , acquaintance , tool training  
well , the tools are , I think , we already  
I guess the tool is really our  the computer , as far as I can see . 
Uh we get ins each of us will get instructions 
and we'll take it from there . 
Project plan , that falls under the same heading pretty much . 
Um , I don't think we have any great discussion at this point . 
Um . 
Here is what this thing should be . 
This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control . 
Uh should be original <laugh> , trendy , and , of course , user friendly . 
So maybe you wanna make some notes of that . 
Okay ? 
All right . 
<other> Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . 
Um . 
That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with . 
The same goes for the conceptual design , 
there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards . 
Detailed design , same thing basically . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
I can't write with this thing . <other> 
<laugh> Yes . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah , okay . 
All right ? 
Then , tool training try out the white board , 
participant can draw their favourite animal . 
Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? 
So that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board . 
You wanna go Eileen and  
Whether you  without hanging yourself . <laugh> 
And remember you have to press so it works . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> Fat , a fat cat . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
And you're Francine , right ? 
Would you like s like just to see um how it feels , so that you have a little idea ? 
In  
No , no . No , that's okay . 
I don't know , 
we'll get to that later . 
<laugh> Okay . 
<laugh> Okay . 
<laugh> 
Here's the project finance 
uh which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing . 
Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro . 
Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro , 
the market range unlimited meaning international 
and the production cost should not exceed  hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro . 
Mm-hmm . 
So these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design 
<other> to materials , cost , etcetera . 
Now , uh the discussion I guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control ? 
I exp I s 'cause we we use 'em  we use 'em , right , everyday . 
And um 
now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing 
ye any first ideas ? 
Would you like it to be smaller , bigger , 
have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly  better marked buttons , you know , things like that ? 
Small , right . Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
So it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically . 
Well . 
It should be something new  it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have . 
Now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design . 
Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . 
Maybe it should  different colours or materials or you know . 
Um so yeah shapes right , you know , 
like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know . 
Yeah . 
Yes . 
<laugh> That is true , 
because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we you know , whatever . 
And and they  suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say , where the hell is my <laugh> my remote control yeah ? 
Well or yeah or if it's really , if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal . 
Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
So if lost  
If lost uh signal with b throw signal , you know . 
Exactly , I mean just <other> that's what I'm saying . 
I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or  
Okay , my  my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden , in in other words if it's like in a dark spot , uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant , at that moment it's it's like , it's like um , what you call it  a light s sensors , you know ? 
In in that moment it has a sensor , i it it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , 
I mean , that we can discuss that later , you know . 
That's right . 
You know there would be <other>  
right you have to have some kind of sensor 
and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough . 
Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off , 
but I think they only work to certain degree and  
What with  
Oh yeah well , but then those people  we can't help everybody . <laugh> 
Okay we have uh  
yeah , we have to move along , 
but I think we have some good good points to start with here . 
Okay , the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . 
I think you all 
 did you get uh notices on your computer for this ? 
Okay so well , you got the notice um 
 uh . The working design , I guess that's the function 
I_D_  uh who is this ? 
The industrial designer  That's you . 
Okay . 
So , we looking for a working design when we come back . 
<other> 
Then  
And then the technical funct you are the technical function , 
so so you are the working design . 
So you have a working design and then a functional design . 
And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , 
like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . 
That would be your idea . 
And , of course , price . 
That it , that it , that the price is a good price . 
I mean , the price is given , but , that was  
That's right . 
That's right . 
And , you know , specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that . 
I think that's the end of the show . 
Yeah . 
So um <other> we have  
well , we have a twen two two two three minutes . 
Um any questions at this point ? 
Or uh suggestions ? 
I think  basically basically you will get instructions to work with 
and if you have any questions uh , uh I guess , you can uh  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes . 
And see what we can come up with . 
Okay ?
