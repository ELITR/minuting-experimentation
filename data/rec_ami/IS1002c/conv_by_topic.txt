D:  N name . 
A:  Right . <laugh> 
B:  That's the end of my presentation . 


A:  So presentation from  I guess design would go best . Next . Technical functions or interface concept ? 
B:  I think  
C:  Oh interface concept . <laugh> Very long presentation . <other> 
A:  Yeah that's it . 
B:  <other> 
A:  Yes , but it has your name on it . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Well that doesn't bo bode well for it for it tats as well . Um so , somehow that thing's too big , but um  okay 
C:  That be it . 
A:  'Kay . 


A:  So on to  Y functional requirements or trend watching ? 
D:  I dunno . Trend watching I guess . Trend watching I believe . 
B:  Trend watching has a later date there . 
A:   forty six nineteen fifty seven . Yep . 
D:  See what it looks like . It's been so long . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh>  . 


A:  Okay so the question is now I guess we need t to decide on  well y you guys basically have to now go and 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  figure out the details of this thing . So , what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ? 
D:  <other> 
A:  What what overall things have we not decided on ? 
B:  Well we have to  I think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be . There's the scroll wheel , in or out ? What do you guys like in the user interface ? 
A:  I think maybe in terms of marketing , is that gonna make enough of a difference to justify the cost ? 
D:  <other> Again . Well I think it's it's  the more uniqueness you can bring to the product , the easier it is , I believe , for me to market . Uh again the push-buttons I I see are are everywhere . And so we can go with the same thing , but we're gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique . 
A:  Okay we're doing well for time here . Um we've got about another ten minutes . I think that uh  
C:  S 
A:  okay we have five minutes . So right details th <other> that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  <other> <other> 
A:  We want <other> a mode indicator . We want <other> back-lit buttons . And if we're making back-lit buttons period , do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time , so that you know if it's actually pressed or not . I've seen some remotes do that . 
C:  Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and and with a cradle , and yeah and the locator . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  With a cradle , radio transmitters , and back-lit buttons . And it's gonna look sexy <laugh> . 
C:   Or not <other> . 
B:  Or not . It might look like clay <laugh> . 
C:  Okay so you can market pe depending on that ? 
D:  Yeah yeah . Bas th that's that's easy . That's that's not a , it's a  . 'Cause we have about six , six , seven features in that alone . 
A:  Yep . 
D:  Under the title of uniquenesses . 
C:  Cool . Hmm . 


A:  Okay . The next meeting starts in thirty <other> minutes , although does it ? It starts at three twenty one , the next meeting . So we've got more than a thirty minutes . Um <other> we've got more like fifty . 
D:  Well I have  Is my  three twenty one is the next meeting ? 
A:  The the ne next meeting is three twenty one yeah . 
D:  That's that's almost uh fifty minutes . 
A:  Yeah that is . Uh they've they've changed the times from the presentations . 
D:  <other> You guys can  You guys you guys can uh create a  All kinds of things . 
B:  Probably . We'll let you know when we're done , if we can go earlier . 
D:   Thanks , yeah . 
A:  Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh  
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's gonna do , look like , how it's gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail ? 
B:  I don't think so . If we have any questions we'll just email you I guess . 
C:  <other> 
A:  Okay .
