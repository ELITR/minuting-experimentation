Mm . 
Tha 
Okay . 
Who is gonna do a PowerPoint presentation ? 
You will as well ? 
Okay . 
Yep . 
Okay I'm  
Okay . 
I'm Catherine with a C_ . 
C_A_T_H_ E_R_ I_N_E_ . 
Right . 
True . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
How long is the meeting ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> No problem . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Um just connecting this . 
Are we getting i 
Really ? 
Okay . Cool . 
Okay . So I've got a very quick uh  
Uh . 
Okay . 
So the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , 
so um I've  
oh no , 
you can't see a thing . 
<other> Oh well , 
I'm gonna draw it on the board then . 
It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it . 
We it's fine on my screen , 
but never mind . 
So um <other> the idea is that we've got the 
energy source um , 
which in our case will pr , 
oh well  okay , never mind . 
So um I think maybe uh two batteries , 
I dunno what they're called 
 six , or something like that . 
Uh and then 
<other> um 
then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , 
which could be uh an infra-red signal , 
um which will be sent by an electronic chip . 
And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . 
So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel . 
And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . 
Um and that's it really for the working design . 
Sorry 
the presentation wasn't very uh clear but  
Really ? 
Cool . 
Um , should I erase this or  
Okay . 
Fine . <laugh> 
Or suggestions ? 
Well , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s 
In indoors . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I dunno , 
swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but  
Yeah . 
Well , the thing is uh you you don't  
Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . 
I didn't think about that 
but  
Why not ? 
I just think that it's it's gonna cost more 
and I'm I'm not sure it's  you're gonna use it . 
It's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , 
but then I don't th I dunno , 
either you  if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room , 
you are gonna  
But  
Oh , we can we can keep the idea if you i 
We can see at a later stage , maybe , I don't  
Do you need the border ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> Sorry . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<other> Well <laugh> maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then . <laugh> 
Maybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a  
<laugh> 
Yep . 
 . 
Well , in the project announcement , you've got the addresses , I think . 
So Project Manager , it's participant one at A_M_I_ . <other> 
You have them i you have them , 
but we'll send you an e-mail . 
You want to have friends , don't you ? 
It wouldn't be  
Well you could  
It could come  
But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere 
<other> like just around the lock button could be the R_R_ logo or colours and  
If  . 
Cool .
