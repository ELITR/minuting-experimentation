C:  <other> 
B:  Right . True . 
D:  Mm 'kay . 


A:  Okay , right , welcome to meeting B_ . Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically , uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now . <laugh> I am your Project Manager , and , uh yeah , I'm just here to 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> <laugh> 
A:   sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . Um right , this  for the purposes of this meeting  what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things . But hopefully you've been  actually been doing something productive . So we're gonna  each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation . <other> Um . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> Mm . 
A:  Then we're gonna <other> work , you know , from each of your presentations . We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll  sort of conclude  anything else comes up at the end of it . 
B:  How long is the meeting ? 
A:  This meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that . Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you  it's  that's just one particular medium . If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can  you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can . 
B:  Okay . <laugh> No problem . <laugh> 
A:  Don't feel pressurised into using this thing . 'Cause I don't . <laugh> Uh okay . So um . You okay over there ? Reissa , are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there ? <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  I'm fine . Yeah . I uh yeah , yeah . D I mean , I I'm finishing off my presentation . 
C:  Think she's finishing up her presentation . 
D:  No no . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh I'm done . Okay . 
A:  Okay , jolly good . Alright , let's have um  well , we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with . I think the first thing we should look at is um <other> probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be . So that's gonna be you Catherine , if we wanna hear from you first . 
D:  Mm . 
B:  Okay . 


B:  Okay . Um just connecting this . Are we getting i 
A:  You don't have to worry about screwing it in just  there you go . 
B:  Really ? Okay . Cool . Okay . So I've got a very quick uh  Uh . Okay . 
D:  <cough> 


B:  So the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , so um 
B:  energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well  okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called  six , or something like that . Uh and then 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  <other> um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel . And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Um and that's it really for the working design . 
A:  Great . Okay . 
B:  Sorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but  
A:  I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally . Yeah . 
B:  Really ? Cool . Um , should I erase this or  
A:  Do you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down . Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ? 
B:  Okay . Fine . <laugh> Or suggestions ? 


A:  Okay . Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  Do you need the border ? 
C:  Uh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh . 
B:  Okay . <laugh> Sorry . 
C:  Technical  . Okay . 
D:  <other> <cough> Adjusting . 
C:  Okay , so , while this is warming up , there it is uh . 
D:  Yeah . 


C:  So I'm doing the user interface design . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um .  we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but  
A:  Mm yeah . 
C:  Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . 
C:  So uh , yeah , that's me . 
D:  <other> Mm .  . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Great . Okay . 
A:  Okay , fantastic . Right , well done , Gabriel . 


A:  Um Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby . 
D:  . Where does it go into ? 
C:   . 
D:  Here ? The blue thing . 
C:  Yeah . Uh , yeah , this is getting all  . Mm . <cough> 
D:  <other>  . 
C:  Yeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up . 
D:  Well , function F_ eight . No  oh . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , w it it just takes a wee while . 
C:  Yeah , it just takes a second uh . 
D:  Come on . 


D:  Right . Okay .  . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave  so this is research  and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um <other> current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like  like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um  per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel . 
A:  'Cause we've only got five channels . <laugh> 
D:   <laugh> exactly . <laugh> That's another thing . <other> Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like <sound imitating zapping> . 
A:  I think that's k flicking quickly between channels . 
C:  Yeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also  remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them . <other> So maybe tracking devices is a good idea . Um personal preferences . <laugh> 
C:  Mm . 
A:  <laugh> Wow . You are a child of technology , aren't you ? <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> <laugh> Um so yeah um <other> I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um <other> has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find <laugh> , so I don't know whether maybe  and also we asked them whether they wanted <other>  whether they'd be interested in um <other> voice activating . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Um also with um with buttons , <other> a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense <other>  Huh ? 
C:  Repetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing  
D:  Yeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't  I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist . <laugh> I don't think so . <laugh> 
B:  <other> Well <laugh> maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  So y so it's so it's so you got  so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of  see <other> have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this . 
D:  Yeah <other> maybe not so hard . 
C:  Mm . Mm . 
B:  Maybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Let's jus  we just want  need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury . 
D:  Maybe  
C:  Yeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> They're having a lunch break at the moment , but  yeah . I'll see if I can get  see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting . 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . I think we can do some really  in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm . Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much , or we just like flat buttons , something . 
C:  Mm . 
D:  Yeah . So that is me . 
A:  Okay . That's great , thank you very much for that , Reissa . <other> 


A:  Um okay , so we've basically we've decide we've d we've decided that it's gonna be , you know uh , we're going for a basic television remote . It's gotta be safe to use , it's gotta look cool . It's gotta be cheap . S um . 
D:  Mm . Mm . 
A:  Now going back to the uh industrial design of it , you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , uh and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries . Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . Um . <other> But a in  there's no I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years , because technology will have changed and , you know , we won't have televisions in ten years' time . <laugh> So  
B:  Yep . 
A:  I think we're all um pretty sussed on that . 


A:  Um anyone have any questions ? Everybody happy in their work ? 
D:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah , it seems like we're all on the  pretty much on the same page . 
A:  Now  this is good , we've got a good structure going on . We all know where we're going to . <laugh> Have you been ge has  have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ? 
C:  Oh it's probably just you , 'cause you're the project manager . <laugh> 
B:   . 
A:  <other> 
D:  Well , just questionnaires . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Sell  trying to sell your things  . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah ,  stuff . Um okay . Do  oh  have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other ? 
D:  <laugh> Yeah , you can . 
A:  Right . Do all you all know my e-mail address ? 
C:  Okay . No I don't . I  
D:  I think he's participant one , aren't you ? 
B:  Well , in the project announcement , you've got the addresses , I think . So Project Manager , it's participant one at A_M_I_ . <other> 
C:  Uh  Oh , it's just participant one oh okay . Yeah . 
A:  Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses ? 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Well it's just w it's just it's just par participant one , participant two . <laugh> 
B:  You have them i you have them , but we'll send you an e-mail . You want to have friends , don't you ? 
A:  <laugh>  . Send me , yeah  yeah , okay . 


A:  Mm okay . Well , well done everybody . And um , I think we uh stop for lunch now . 
C:   . Yeah , pretty soon I think , I guess that's now . 
D:  Are we are we finished ahead of schedule ? 
A:  We might possibly have done . 
B:  Cool . 
C:  Alright , see you all soon . 


A:  <other> If we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish , then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch . 
D:  <laugh> 'Kay uh . 
A:  Yeah , there you go . Right . I just have to  there's a few little bits and pieces I have to write down , but  Take your headsets off , kick back , smoke 'em if you got 'em . <laugh>
