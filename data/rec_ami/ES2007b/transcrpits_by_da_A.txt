Okay , right , welcome to meeting B_ . 
Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically , 
uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now . 
<laugh> I am your Project Manager , 
and , uh yeah , I'm just here to 
 sort of liaise between the three of you 
and get things going , get people talking 
and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . 
Um right , this  for the purposes of this meeting  
what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , 
what you've been working on for the last wee while , 
when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things . 
But hopefully you've been  actually been doing something productive . 
So we're gonna  
each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation . <other> Um . 
Then we're gonna <other> work , you know , from each of your presentations . 
We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . 
Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll  sort of conclude  anything else comes up at the end of it . 
This meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . 
So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that . 
Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , 
it it just it just says that you  it's  
that's just one particular medium . 
If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , 
you can talk to us , 
you can  you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can . 
Don't feel pressurised into using this thing . 
'Cause I don't . 
<laugh> Uh okay . So um . 
You okay over there ? Reissa , 
are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here 
or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there ? <laugh> 
Okay , jolly good . 
Alright , let's have um  
well , we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with . 
I think the first thing we should look at is um <other> probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be . 
So that's gonna be you Catherine , 
if we wanna hear from you first . 
You don't have to worry about screwing it in just  
there you go . 
Ah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Great . Okay . 
I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally . 
Yeah . 
Do you wanna just give us a moment , 
I just wanna copy this down . 
Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ? 
<laugh> Yeah , you blow on it and i <laugh> 
Yeah , 
it's worked for the last fifty years you know . 
How far away is your television ? 
It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not  doesn't have to go that far , 
does it ? 
Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall . 
Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you  you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . 
You know we don't need it . 
Yeah , exactly . 
Basically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit . 
We're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff . 
It's uh  
Okay . 
Right , well done , Catherine . 
Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm yeah . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Great . 
Yeah . 
Great . Okay . 
Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . 
This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units  stuff . 
Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or  
Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> <other> 
Um  
I would say it's  If it's simple to do , 
which I think it probably should be , 
even if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes , 
it's  like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that , 
but you know being physical . 
Look into . 
Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred <other> well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . 
It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ . 
You know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um . 
We put the fashion in electronics . 
There you go . 
So it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . 
If if remote control  well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be . 
Yeah . 
Because we need  
<other> 
Yeah . Great . 
Okay , fantastic . 
Right , well done , Gabriel . 
Um Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby . 
Yeah , w it it just takes a wee while . 
'Cause we've only got five channels . <laugh> 
I think that's k flicking quickly between channels . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Wow . 
You are a child of technology , aren't you ? <laugh> 
So there you go , yeah . 
Uh but do the younger generation have the money ? 
They they don't . 
It's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and  
People people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there . 
For people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . 
Um but no they're not  sort of  
most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , 
uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years . 
Um <other> d and tha 
and that's a <other> that's quite a minority there , 
so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent . 
Yeah . 
I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off . 
So y so it's so it's so you got  
so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of  
see <other> 
have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this . 
Let's jus  
we just want  need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> They're having a lunch break at the moment , but  yeah . 
I'll see if I can get  see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
That's great , 
thank you very much for that , Reissa . <other> 
Um okay , so we've basically 
we've decide we've d 
we've decided that it's gonna be , you know uh , we're going for a basic television remote . 
It's gotta be safe to use , 
it's gotta look cool . 
It's gotta be cheap . 
S um . 
Now going back to the uh industrial design of it , 
you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . 
I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , 
uh and that would be infra-red , 
energy source , that would be batteries . 
Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . Um . 
<other> But a in  there's no 
I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years , 
because technology will have changed and , you know , we won't have televisions in ten years' time . 
<laugh> So  
I think we're all um pretty sussed on that . 
Um 
anyone have any questions ? 
Everybody happy in their work ? 
Now  this is good , 
we've got a good structure going on . 
We all know where we're going to . 
<laugh> Have you been ge has  
have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ? 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah ,  stuff . 
Um okay . 
Do  
oh  have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other ? 
Right . 
Do all you all know my e-mail address ? 
Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses ? 
<laugh>  . 
Send me , yeah 
 yeah , okay . 
<other> Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ? 
I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , 
but I might be just going a bit  
Okay . 
Well , 
maybe you can come up with a few  with a couple of different ideas ? 
Well , see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image . 
It's gotta say  
people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a Real Reaction i product . 
There's loads of companies that called R_R_ . 
This is slog  but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type . 
Yeah . 
Well , not necessarily . But we have to incorporate it . 
Not necessarily even if i it just has to  ye 
but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products 
as opposed to a Sony product or a , you know , a Panasonic product . 
It's got to  
so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Quite poss yeah . 
Well this is all your department . 
Mm okay . 
Well , well done everybody . 
And um , I think we uh stop for lunch now . 
We might possibly have done . 
<other> If we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish , then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch . 
Yeah , there you go . 
Right . I just have to  there's a few little bits and pieces I have to write down , but  
Take your headsets off , kick back , smoke 'em if you got 'em . <laugh>
