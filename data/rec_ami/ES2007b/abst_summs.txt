A:  so I just wanna  rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that <other> wanted to know your names again . 
A:  Okay , right , welcome to meeting B_ . 
A:  Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically , 
A:  uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now . 
A:  and , uh yeah , I'm just here to 
A:   sort of liaise between the three of you 
A:  and get things going , get people talking 
A:  and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . 
A:  what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , 
A:  We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . 
A:  So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that . 
A:  This meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . 
A:  Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , 
abst_sum - abstract: The project manager had the team members re-introduce themselves and then briefed the team on his own duties and on the meeting agenda.

B:  I'm gonna draw it on the board then . 
B:  So um <other> the idea is that we've got the 
B:  energy source um , 
B:  So um I think maybe uh two batteries , 
B:  then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , 
B:  which could be uh an infra-red signal , 
B:  um which will be sent by an electronic chip . 
D:  Is a battery like the only way of  
D:  No 'cause like cha 'cause  always changing um um batteries can get like annoying . 
B:  swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but  
C:  as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? 
A:  It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not  doesn't have to go that far , 
B:  Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . 
A:  Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you  you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . 
D:  How about Bluetooth ?  
A:  Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall . 
abst_sum - abstract: The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the team discussed options for batteries and infra-red signals.

C:  Yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . 
C:  And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , 
C:  I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but  
C:  Um so things that <other> seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , 
C:  uh channel keys up-down , 
C:  but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , 
C:  ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , 
C:  judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , 
C:  So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , 
C:  so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . 
A:  Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or  
C:  No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . 
C:  what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that  a feeling about whether that's really necessary ? 
A:  I would say it's  If it's simple to do , 
C:  and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design . 
abst_sum - abstract: The user interface designer discussed what features the remote was required to have and presented two existing products which were based on different concepts.

A:  Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred <other> well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . 
A:  It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ . 
C:  Uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , 
abst_sum - abstract: The project manager then introduced some new requirements to bear in mind when designing the remote.

D:  Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , 
D:  So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . 
D:  Um <other> current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . 
D:  Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . 
D:  I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . 
D:  Um <other> has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . 
D:  and also we asked them whether they wanted <other>  whether they'd be interested in um <other> voice activating . 
C:  What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? 
A:  most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , 
A:  It's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and  
D:  but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote . 
D:  <other> Voice activation might not be the best . 
A:  I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off . 
D:  Um also with um with buttons , <other> a thing called R_S_I_ , 
C:  I think we can do some really  in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . 
abst_sum - abstract: The marketing expert presented research on consumer preferences on remotes in general and on voice recognition and the team discussed the option to have an ergonomically designed remote.

A:  we've decided that it's gonna be , you know uh , we're going for a basic television remote . 
A:  I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , 
A:  uh and that would be infra-red , 
A:  energy source , that would be batteries . 
A:  Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . Um . 
C:  <laugh> So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as  
A:  I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , 
C:  Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white  with yellow borders . 
D:  Can't we have different colours in the remotes , 
C:  And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , 
C:  so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them . 
D:  So we have to have it one colour . 
C:  Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . 
A:  but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products 
A:  so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps . 
B:  But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere 
abst_sum - abstract: The project manager briefed the team on the decisions made so far and the team discussed color options for the remote.

C:  we should probably consult with our legal department uh . 
A:  I'll see if I can get  see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting . 
abst_sum - action: The project manager will consult with the legal department to discuss the prevention of lawsuits from consumers claiming the remote caused RSI

A:  energy source , that would be batteries . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will use regular batteries.

A:  Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred <other> well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . 
A:  It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ . 
C:  so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them . 
C:  Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . 
A:  but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products 
abst_sum - decisions: The corporate image will be displayed on the remote.

D:  <other> Voice activation might not be the best . 
A:  I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will not contain a voice activation feature.

C:  and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um . 
C:  I think we can do some really  in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will have an ergonomic design.

A:  uh and that would be infra-red , 
A:  Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you  you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . 
A:  It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not  doesn't have to go that far , 
A:  Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will use a regular infra-red signal.

C:  as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? 
A:  It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not  doesn't have to go that far , 
B:  Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . 
abst_sum - problems: How powerful the infra-red signal should be.

A:  Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or  
C:  No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . 
C:  what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that  a feeling about whether that's really necessary ? 
A:  I would say it's  If it's simple to do , 
abst_sum - problems: Whether the remote should have a locking function.

D:  and also we asked them whether they wanted <other>  whether they'd be interested in um <other> voice activating . 
C:  What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? 
A:  most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,

D:  <other> Voice activation might not be the best . 
A:  I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off . 
abst_sum - problems: Whether to include a voice activation feature in the remote.

C:  Uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , 
C:  and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um . 
C:  I think we can do some really  in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements .
