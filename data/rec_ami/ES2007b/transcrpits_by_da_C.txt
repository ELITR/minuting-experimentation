Right it was function F_ eight or something . 
This one right there . 
Okay . 
Think we all   
Huh . 
Oh I thought we all were . 
Yeah , I have one too , okay . 
S 
Whoops 
I forgot to put the thing on <other>  
Okay . 
Yeah . Sure , that's a good idea . 
Uh Gabriel . 
E_L_ . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Think she's finishing up her presentation . 
Oh . <laugh> 
Yeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or  
<laugh> Bicycle power . 
One question I have , 
and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , 
as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? 
I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream . 
Uh  
That's true . 
Okay . 
Uh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh . 
Technical  . Okay . 
Okay , so , while this is warming up , 
there it is uh . 
So I'm doing the user interface design . 
Yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . 
Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , 
uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um . 
 we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , 
I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but  
Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . 
Um so things that <other> seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , 
um so up-down keys for that , 
uh channel keys up-down , 
but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , 
and uh a mute button . 
Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function . 
Uh , I don't I dunno , 
uh that's one possibility . 
And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , 
ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , 
which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , 
but I can show you  uh . 
Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , 
so you see it's rather busy , 
but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um <other> freeze frame . 
Uh and this is a user centred one . 
Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see <other> what's possible to do , 
you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes . 
And I  
judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , 
uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . 
So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , 
but it can be a little bit overwhelming , 
so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . 
Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa , 
because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this . 
So uh , yeah , that's me . 
No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . 
I mean obviously another   exists  like you like you said in in mobile phones . 
That was sort of the inspiration for it . 
Um I've never seen that with  in in all my years in in the remote business . 
I've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . 
I dunno , 
what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that  a feeling about whether that's really necessary ? 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
'Kay . 
Right . 
Mm <other> . 
Right . 
And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics . 
I think I think we have to carry that mental . 
Mm . 
Well yeah 
these , I think , we can  
so we talked about the layout in my presentation 
and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design . 
I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean . 
Uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , 
there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic 
and keyboards 
and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um . 
 . 
Yeah . 
Uh , yeah , this is getting all  . 
Mm . <cough> 
Yeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up . 
Yeah , it just takes a second uh . 
Yeah , 
you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess . 
Mm . 
No I would I would say the older the older people , yeah . 
Yeah , that would be my guess as well . 
What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? 
I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit . 
I mean , okay , there's  
Uh . 
Repetitive strain uh 
rep repetitive strain injury 
or like from doing  
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah , 
we should probably consult with our legal department uh . 
Yeah . 
I think we can do some really  in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . 
Mm . 
Yeah , it seems like we're all on the  pretty much on the same page . 
Oh it's probably just you , 'cause you're the project manager . <laugh> 
Sell  trying to sell your things  . <laugh> 
Okay . 
No I don't . I  
Uh  
Oh , it's just participant one oh okay . Yeah . 
Well it's just w it's just 
it's just par participant one , participant two . <laugh> 
<laugh> So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as  
maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that . 
Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white  with yellow borders . 
Maybe that's <other> like getting ahead of ourselves . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , 
so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them . 
Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . 
 . 
Yeah , pretty soon I think , 
I guess that's now . 
Alright , see you all soon .
