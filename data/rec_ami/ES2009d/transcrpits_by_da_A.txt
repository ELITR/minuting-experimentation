All set ? 
Cool . 
Alright , 
it is PowerPoint time . 
I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment <laugh> 
which is kind of fun . 
So uh 
here we have our detailed design meeting 
where we will um look at the prototype 
and 
um <other>  right so um , 
I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my  
that my coach was sending to me . 
It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . 
I think . <laugh> 
I don't know . 
Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary 
and I'm  therefore I'm taking the minutes , 
s so just to go 
um <other> just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , 
uh , I will open them slowly , no ? 
Wait for it , wait for it . 
<sounds imitating machine noises> 
No . 
That's how the  
<other> Wait . 
This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , 
double-clicking , 
there we go . 
So um 
basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh  last meeting was that <other> um we that we had meetings from  uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here 
um and what sort of limitations we're operating with 
um  uh excuse me 
what limitations we're operating under , 
what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing 
and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , 
I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape 
um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote 
since you could just use your voice . 
That would include some  mostly just the simple design features for a television operation 
but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . 
Um , and uh the uh uh 
the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . 
<other> So . 
That's sorted , 
back to the main <other> meet here , 
um , go ahead and take it away guys . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> <laugh> 
<laugh> Nice . <laugh> 
<other> Perfect . 
<other> Oh , right . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh 
well done yeah , yeah oh ok 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Edible televisions , it's a wave of the future . <laugh> 
Brilliant . 
<laugh> 
Brilliant . 
<laugh> 
Cool . 
No , no 
I think that's  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Right , yeah 
thanks guys 
that's very , very good work . 
I like it , 
brilliant . 
<other> Um , <other> what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um 
I got me  you've got  
you provided a number 
that actually sounds quite nice . 
Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance . 
Um , it's a spreadsheet of the parts <cough> 
and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um . 
I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , 
but it looks like  
So 
we'll just  
if we can just itemize what's in here , 
we've got this  
it's a solar cell thing 
right ? 
With a back-up battery ? 
With the ba okay . Um 
and  
Clever , clever , 
well done . 
Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um  
<other> It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time 
isn't it ? 
Okay . 
Um and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , 
I guess would be that  be the general  
<other> Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . 
Um . Push button interface um with this other drop-down 
so maybe we've got two push button interfaces 
don't we ? 
Um . 
And um a special  
I guess it's uh  we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that  throughout , 
yeah . 
<other> 
Yeah , 
it's it's quite unique . 
I like it , yeah 
it's  
So 
it looks like 
a bit over budget , um . 
So 
what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells 
<other> um or take out the back-up battery . Uh  
Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
<other> What's difficult , we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , 
it would have to be  
seems like we'd have to go back to 
square one in a way . 
Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , um  
It's either or . 
'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 
'cause they're <laugh> 
um and we can't get rid of the uh  I mean removing the  
changing the case wouldn't be so much of a 
<other> mm-mm , 
um , nor would changing the case materials . 
Um . So yeah 
that looks like to be the only thing . 
So that would be the  
it's a major change but  
Yeah . 
Alright , so 
we're in agreement on that . 
<other> Right . 
Moving along swiftly . 
Um , so 
I guess now we just go to the project evaluation 
which I will allow Sarah to take over . 
Ah 
of course , 
sorry . 
Whoosh . 
<laugh> That'd be great <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Brilliant . 
Hmm . 
Um yeah , 
I was just  
go on . 
Well 
they don't own tellys anyway 
do they ? 
Right . So , um , <other> 
this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . 
I got this slide from the coach 
and I'm not sure what it's connected to . 
Um so I guess we are going to discuss um <laugh> our project process um 
and that is gonna go into my report . 
So 
I guess this is the point where we go um <other> uh out of role it looks like 
and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth 
and how that all worked , I guess , um . 
I think so yeah . 
I think it's  I 
mm-hmm , I think so . 
I think <laugh> hope I'm not screwing up an experiment <laugh> . 
But I trust that she would jump in if I was 
so okay 
fair enough . 
Um right , um so 
any thoughts ? 
Yeah . 
What do you guys feel about the process ? 
<laugh> Mm-hmm . 
No , no whiteboard . <laugh> 
Was pretty cool tack though . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Attempts to contact coach ineffective <laugh> . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Very natural look . 
<laugh> That's the brilliance of  they had a p they had a peeler in here . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
I think , yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean . 
<laugh> Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
What did you guys think about the the the roles ? 
<other> 
That's true , 
I I got this spreadsheet <laugh> . 
Of what to do . 
Mm , mm . 
Cool . 
She said I I I 
she actually made a comment off  
boy you're getting into this 
and I really I think it's true 
I did get  I I felt like I got way too into it . 
I felt like I slipped into it a lot . 
I dunno . 
The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management . 
I usually organise crap , 
it's one thing to do , you know  set up a party with your friends , 
you know ? 
But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the  okay ? 
Yeah , yeah . 
Maybe in in Legos you know ? Be fun with Legos too , 
like make a remote control or spaceship , 
we used to have spaceship Legos  
did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos  
everybody knows  best spaceships ever . 
Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? 
Hmm . 
No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno , 
I don't  I I was just  I  
It's true huh ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team <laugh> you know it's like , kind of like , like hmm . 
It d 
But yeah . 
Interesting . It's kind of fascinating 
wasn't it ? 
I mean the whole process of  
I don't know . <other> 
I I don't know if there was a ri I th 
Mm . <other> 
Nor I . 
I wanna see the output files from these um , from the digital paper . 
I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized 
because my handwriting is crap . 
I mean , 
just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something . 
<laugh> 
T 
I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . 
You know , like 
what is the uh 
what exactly we're looking for here . 
I dunno , 
I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . 
Well , 
that's the thing I got  i in the email I got this PowerPoint file 
but this slide was just there , 
mm-hmm . 
I didn't change this one at all . 
Um ch 
Yeah well . <other> 
W  <other> I kinda like th 
Yeah 
you can't  
Yeah . 
Does kinda make you wonder , 
I mean , 
how much can you do with a remote control ? 
It's like inventing a new car . 
Yeah yeah , 
you can  
<laugh> Yeah . 
Hmm . 
<other> Um . 'Kay . 
So this was other costs . 
I dunno . 
I think this is 
forty ish 
I I I mm we should go on a bit  yeah  about the project eval , um . 
I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing . 
Like , 
what like you know what am I really doing , 
you know 
what is  
Yep . 
Hey . 
Mm . 
<other> I actually didn't do that at all though , 
every single one I  a all the presentations I either added slides 
or edited 'em . 
I di 
Oh . 
What ? 
Really ? 
Did they not have  they didn't like  uh mine  
yeah 
they didn't come like this ? 
Like with  
this was what it looks like . 
This is what that looked like , 
literally , just like that . 
Interesting . 
Uh-huh huh huh . 
Interesting . 
Any other thoughts come to mind ? 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah but <laugh>  
<laugh> 
Builds . 
Mm . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Interesting . 
<other> 
<other> 
Uh , yeah , I'd say so . 
Mm , I know . 
It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . You know from the the the basics to the conce 
although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept . 
Well 
the id 
okay 
the notion of  
yeah I mean 
i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material , 
it's just it is what it is . 
You know , 
maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of  we sh I I thought of I thought of  
rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of 
proposed idea . 
And then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever , 
I dunno . 
But . 
All in all it's kinda interesting . 
No 
just this closing one . 
No 
we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , 
but we could s you know do it  
We did the project evaluation based on um <other> Sarah's evaluation of on off switches 
and  
Mm . 
True . 
Yeah . 
'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . Um . 
Yeah . 
And it's all recorded , 
woo-hoo . 
Yeah 
what I'm gonna  I'm gonna put um <other> 
I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end 
so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like  
maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports . 
<laugh> Nice . 
Oh yeah . 
There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics . 
Yep , 
they're called um disfluencies . 
Yeah 
we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things . 
Exactly 
uh I will save this into the project documents . 
Yeah . Oh yeah . <laugh> Yeah I know . 
Come on give me some information . 
Well 
to be fair we're we're hooked  we're all hooked on the internet , 
so I mean I do the  
I know , 
imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . 
It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ? 
I mean , you know , 
it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time . 
No 
we have but I  not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous 
Mm . 
Yeah 
that's our last step . Celebration . 
'Kay 
I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . 
Cool . 
Where do you find that ? 
Is this one of those media player ? 
W 
oh . 
The default track . 
I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball . 
That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while , 
maybe this is the new version . 
Yeah , 
I guess we'll call that a a doner . 
Fab .
