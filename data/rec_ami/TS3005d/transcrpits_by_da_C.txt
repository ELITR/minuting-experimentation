Save as project . 
Oh , 
okay 
. Hmm 
hmm . Agenda . <laugh> Oh , 
sorry . 
 <laugh> <other> Okay . Get up stand up 
.  
just  
'Kay . View 
. Just 
example 
colour , so uh 
there's 
one of 
the colours 
we would like to uh 
see in our 
prototype . 
Okay ? 
 yeah , just 
uh just 
an idea about how to m th that could also be possible . Uh well 
, it's 
an idea in 
a  so . Do not forget it . To function it it doesn't really have 
to be sm 
uh big of 
course . The microphone could 
be just a minor uh 
hole uh on the left uh button . Okay um <other> we also made some 
uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work . Uh using the scroll button 
on sides 
uh y uh I uh um   Yeah , you push the scroll button and 
a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get 
uh you get the options uh becoming 
available . For example uh T_V_ settings , uh remote settings , 
et cetera . So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button , uh as you can see  oh , it's here 
, just push it in , uh the menu comes out like this 
and uh i it all becomes 
visible . 
Um  Yeah 
, that's c Yeah . 
Indeed . Okay , um it's also 
uh nice to see that um we made a small 
uh menu 
, uh 
the options 
menu uh 
becoming available when 
pressing the uh scroll uh button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used uh  which should still be used and we think that 
it's uh very handy to put it uh 
not uh under the options menu , but in uh  
Yes . In an apart uh  In a separate button , yeah . <laugh> A sign , yeah , just like  Okay , indeed . Okay , we 
can uh modify that later . Okay . 
Would you like to make 
any comments about 
next uh  Previous 
page , 
yeah , indeed . Oh my God 
. <laugh> 
<other> <laugh> It's quite large . Okay . You can see 
very clearly now that the uh teletext 
and options menu isn't 
uh taking uh much uh  uh 
it's taking 
much part of the screen , so it's very uh  when you uh <other> when you use it , doesn't uh become irritating to see . 'Cause if 
you put it on the 
top you always get see the the options menu . 'Cause people regularly uh read from 
left top to right down , so  Okay . Huh . <loud exhale>  Full screen . 
Alright . <laugh> Huh . My name , my job . <laugh> 
<laugh> Sorry 
, you used the 
PowerPoint 
 
 What ? 
<laugh> Bling . 
<other> Now 
uh the single curved idea was uh 
 Yeah , 
okay , you ge um  
Yeah . The 
sideways view 
, uh that 
that that ma Ho not that pen 
. <laugh> Not that 
pen . <laugh> <other> 
<laugh> <laugh> Suppose so . Ah 
. Oh my God , 
it 
works . Yeah , that's the single curve indeed . Yep . 
That's not very  
i it's also uh very handy 
if you make 
a side curve way to make the the 
remote control 
very thin at the bottom 
uh at a bottom at a bottom . Uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes 
uh in some uh space , and the batteries can 
be located over there , so uh  Yeah .  
No . Yeah . Okay , indeed . 
Yeah . I think so . It's pretty fancy 
.  you 
get th 
Yeah 
.  
 It's 
true , it's a one . 
<laugh> Very fancy . 
<other> It's very true 
, because we designed 
it to 
be 
very fancy , so  It's very fancy , I think . 
Have 
you ever seen a 
remote control like this ? No , okay , 
so so 
it's fancy . Yeah . <laugh> And 
uh uh the scroll is rubber , so s Eno 
enough to  I 
think .  <other> Huh 
. With the 
ones  <other> Yeah . Take a harder 
look , 
yeah , sure . It's easier than 
the 
regular 
uh remote 
control . Yeah . 
Yeah 
, they 
are a lot easier to 
find than uh th 
than on the regular remote controls where you have 
to uh 
find out what  which sign or icon means on uh every button . So you have t 
you have to use the the the manual to understand most  Yeah . I think it's uh it's 
a two , at least . It's not perfect , but  A three ? And 
why is 
that ? It said bo both the options . Yeah . 
A two , a two . 
Uh the next 
question the next question . 
Oh my God . <laugh> Yeah , 
I was 
 uh  Yeah . I 
think it's the most useful uh remote control 
ever to be manufactured 
. 
<laugh> Yeah 
, but because it has 
the regular 
uh controls , li uh as you can see in the screen now , and 
uh you 
don't have all the other options uh always uh 
on 
your screen . So it's t I think it's really 
easy to 
use . You want these options to  Uh sure . Perhaps that is 
one of the most uh  Uh because a lot of 
<other>  Channel one , channel 
four , yeah 
. <sound indicating concordance> Yeah , I think it does . 
Because all the people who can't uh 
 Uh a two . Sure 
, two 
. 
Oh . <expulsion of air> <laugh> Two . <laugh> 
Give me more . No . That's definitely 
our uh  A false , yeah . 
Yeah , 
indeed . 
<other>  
Yeah , is optional . 
Huh . 
Yeah . Yeah , it 
is it is harder to 
to like  Geez 
. We're 
getting paid 
. We're getting 
paid . 
<laugh> Uh 
. Yeah 
, it's a three , because 
you want to 
make it 
uh rather flexible but not too flexible , because 
it has 
a L_C_D_ screen . <laugh> Hard 
to lose , yeah it sh and it's easy to find . Isn't hard 
to lose . Isn't hard to lose , 
yeah . <sound imitating completion of check-boxes> Yeah 
, this this is hard to lose . This 
<other>  Two , yeah 
. And most all because 
of the option 
to  
Whoa . Uh .  put the 
cor cursor  
on the  . 
Click . True . True . <laugh> Uh yeah 
. Uh 
 Materials 
, yeah . Uh okay . So ma uh make 
it make 
it a 
two . A 
two ? I think it's 
two . 
I think 
it's two too 
, two too too . Well perhaps not . Well 
, n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that 
, 
but it's for 
a remote 
control I think it i <other> it would satisfy those needs . Yeah , the speech possibility , 
the colours . Scroll options , yeah . Yeah . The easy volume up button . Remote 
 younger people usually use the 
remote control to 
put on the volume . 
<laugh> Turn 
uh turn up the volume . 
Two . 
One two three . <laugh> Right . Uh . Okay , true , yeah . <other> I think it's easier to 
use than 
a regular remote control , 
because when 
you push 
on the options menu , you 
get the the the various options uh entirely explained . Entirely explained . 
Instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button . Yeah , you can navigate . Uh . You're 
not satisfied , okay . Let's start over again then . <laugh> <other> <other> 
<laugh> A two . Oh yeah , I 
think so . Yeah 
. And 
three . The average . <laugh> Yeah 
, 
I 
think so . Save 
. <laugh>  It's a fly . Oh m 
Yeah . Exactly 
. <laugh>  <laugh> 
<tongue clicks> <laugh> <laugh> Yeah . It 
i It wasn't too 
much . As well 
as the 
L_C_D_ screen . Whoa 
. <whistling> 
Count 
it 
. 
You got Excel 
to count . <laugh> Oh okay . 
Well I dra uh Danny , Danny 
, I'll do 
that , because 
I draw the uh No , no 
solar cell , 
no 
no no 
no . No hand dynamo . <laugh> Hand  
<sound imitating motor> On advanced chip . 
Yeah , yeah . Single nee single curved . Double curved 
was uh uh see 
uh ju three dimensional 
. But it isn't 
three dimensional , it 
isn't curved in a l 
No no no , single curved is like this . Uh 
that's the only curve you made 
, not th uh curved like 
that . That's uh 
 Huh ? Yeah . Yeah 
, we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push 
button , because when you push it 
and you w 
it won't 
just pu 
uh makes 
possible to s Not going to work ? Okay 
. Okay um  But now button supplements . We don't got the button supplements . Damn 
. Okay . <whistling> Nah 
. We could lose the 
scroll wheel . You could 
make it just a regular scroll wheel 
. Yeah 
, if 
you 
can't push 
it you have to tap the the 
options window uh button here and then uh scroll down 
with the 
d with uh <sound imitating being tongue-tied> with uh the button . Normal scroll wheel . Lose <other>  Okay , so we don't exactly need the single  We don't need a curve . 
'S possible to lose 
curve . Okay 
. <other> Yeah 
, that's meant with scr uh with s curve . The curve is 
uh in a dimension . If 
you make it 
a flat one , s n it's no curve , you 
got no curves . Yeah , okay . 
No , two . Oh , okay , indeed . Is it possible to make  <laugh> No . 
The sample speaker is 
two d 
wait , 
f s 
four points . Yeah 
, uh becau uh when you lose 
the  
<other> Yeah . <laugh> No , that's  no . Make it w 
uh when 
you made it uh uh uh a remote 
control 
of wood 
? 
<laugh> You 
don't make 
a remote 
control of  Ah 
. It isn't . What ? To knock the sample speaker , yeah 
. And sample sensor . But m yeah , course , 
but  <laugh> 
What we'll 
have . <laugh> Let's make it thirteen or 
fourteen . <laugh> A 
colour . Yeah , special colours 
, fruity colours 
. Yeah . Yeah . 
They don't sell green rubber plants . <laugh> 
Alright . No 
no no 
. If we lose the scroll 
wheel and 
make it 
totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the 
touch screen 
<other> then it's possible 
to make . And then you can <other> and then you can add to the colours . Special c 
Okay , if you lose uh <sound imitating zapping something> 
if you lose the  You lose this one , you got eleven point 
five and 
you make 
i and then you can make uh the spec single 
curve , for example . How d uh uh how 
many colours ? Special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p 
Yeah , but uh when you use more 
than one colour , it's a special colour . 
I suppose . Yeah . Nee 
we we 
also want to make ano another colour . Yeah , indeed , yeah . You 
don't need four 
of those 
<other> 
uh four of those special colours in one in one 
remote . <other> Hmm . Yeah 
, single curve . Uh . Huh . Okay . Undo , undo . <laugh> Undo . So , 
'kay 
. Twenty 
minutes ? Okay , so 
you had this list 
at start 
? <laugh> 
Alright . When 
did you 
receive this list ? 
Ah okay . 
<laugh> Ah okay 
. I suppose this is a  Okay 
, so 
we lose the scroll wheel , the 
s And the microphone 
. Okay . 
Strange . You can only re 
erase ? Oh 
. Uh , no . Bling 
. Ah 
.  just up 
somewhere b 
uh besides 
it , right . Uh , 
we already 
try . 
All I 
need is 
no mic 
. <laugh> <laugh> <whistling> Bon chance <laugh> <yawn> No 
, add 
  Yeah . S Difference 
between lines and text and the pen . 
<whistling> 
Huh , looks fucking 
boring 
now . 
<laugh> Deadlines were 
sometimes very 
short . But  And stressful . Yeah . Yeah 
. 
<other> Yeah 
, but but why not work 
here together , for example ? 
Why should 
we be separated 
from each 
other in 
those 
difference  
uh different rooms ? Yeah . Huh , oh right . 
But the technology was uh fantastic .  Work now ? Perhaps it is e Yeah 
, perhaps 
it is easier to get 
one of those uh dig digital pens or 
so and to 
uh  and lay 
it next 
to that keyboard over there . So you can draw uh  see it over 
th on the screen . Yeah . <other> It's useful , but not m 
Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and 
line is 
d being drawn at at two or 
three centimetres uh below . Alright . The project uh  because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh  have , you didn't have 
time to 
uh  to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation . So you used uh this uh the different PowerPoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the  Oh . 
<cough> Wasn't me . But I didn't  I uh 
 I used it too , but  oh well . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , because it 
shou To make some designs , it 
is very easy . Yeah 
. But 
to write it 
th yeah 
. Yeah 
, it's too 
big , it's too fat 
. <laugh> Yeah . Right 
. Yeah 
. Not too much , not too 
too too too  . <laugh> Yeah , or the 
room 
for  
it was 
the idea 
to be creative , so  You got some standard ideas 
in 
your head 
<other> and this what came 
out . Yeah . The information uh was 
sometimes uh 
a little bit too late or  Yeah . 
<laugh> <laugh> Was searching and searching 
.  
<laugh> No , w I didn't know  Make a r 
yeah . 
Yeah . 
No 
stepping on the table and then 
looking 
at 
the internet 
page . <laugh> <imitative sound> No 
. Yeah , 
more information 
about the 
costs . First of all 
I didn't think uh that we were able 
to make an L_C_D_ 
screen uh 
 first point , but uh 
it was possible uh  uh , yeah . Yeah . Uh . Faster laptop . Uh . They were they 
were just fine . Uh 
. Right . Yeah . Mm 
. Yeah 
, sure . Oh thank 
you . Bling . <laugh> You're fired . Mm 
. You 
cannot  
you can 
save it 
. You s uh 
file save as the 
J_ PEG J_ PEG . No 
. <laugh> 
No . Okay 
. <laugh> In about five 
minutes . 
Ah . Oh thank you . Whoo-hoo . Let's let's 
have party . 
<laugh> Let's 
have some 
fun . <laugh> Huh ?  
No that 
uh is one thousand 
twenty four 
. <laugh> Yeah . If it 
browse . Desktop . Mm ? 
I do 
not 
know 
. Oh ? Yeah . Okay . <laugh> <laugh> 
Okay . 
Alright . Oh .
