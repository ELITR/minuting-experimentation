. Um 
as you may 
have noticed I 
uh created separate folders because it was uh 
tending to get 
a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder . I don't know if everybody uh put 
their own uh documents in the right folder , which is for now the detailed design 
meeting . Yeah . Then I'll move this one 
. Oh 
no , this is just one 
big 
document , 
so you can leave that wherever it 
is . <laugh> And we have a evaluation left 
here . Okay . Well not main documents this 
time . 
Oh 
uh yes . I have it 
open myself I guess 
. Um well the detailed design meeting  
Huh ? 
We're finally getting somewhere hopefully . Um 
what are we going to do 
? I've opened it already . Um I'm 
still going to take some 
minutes , and if I'm right , you two 
are going to give a prototype presentation ? Aren't you ? Yes , you are 
. And uh 
m did you do something 
with evaluation criteria ? Good . And we have a correct 
agenda . 
And uh then we have to look 
at something which is less nice , the finance uh aspect , whether we 
can afford what we have designed , and if we can we can uh 
commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , how did we work together and what 
are the results , and 
how happy are we with those 
. Okay , well finance uh will be 
later . Now 
I'd like to give the word 
to you two . So a separate button for for text 
, 
okay . Mm-hmm . Thank you . 
Looks good 
. And 
I just missed 
when I was 
typing  The R_R_ stands for ? Logo , okay . <laugh> Okay well 
 <laugh> I would have 
recognised it if it 
were the right colours of course . <laugh> Okay , the evaluation criteria , huh 
? Well 
it's  looks fancy 
, especially 
with 
the green colour . And the the curves which we decided , huh ? Only what happened to the 
single curve 
we spoke about last meeting ? <laugh> Well it might work one time 
, huh 
. <laugh> Okay . Okay , but we have 
to rate 
uh these 
things now ? Okay . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Well 
I think 
uh especially 
because of 
the 
microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also . Very new thing . Well  Fancy 
 the old people 
will . 
No , it's a two . <laugh> 
Little bit 
strange we have to judge 
that ourselves , huh ? Well I'd say two on 
a scale 
 
No , okay well , that's true 
. <laugh> 
Okay , one 
two . That doesn't 
matter that much , so 
make it a one . <laugh> 
Yeah m Yeah , and you use 
these 
buttons 
the most 
, huh ? So  So which  
So which 
number are 
we 
going to 
fill 
in ? A two , yeah ? Two , 
three and  what do 
you think ? Okay , 
so we have two , 
two , three 
. A two , okay , because we 
have to  It's the 
box below it , huh 
? Otherwise we have two results 
in one 
question . Okay , next question .  Okay 
, you're 
very enthusiastic about 
your 
own design 
, huh ? As well for the for 
the older 
people ? And would it be easy for them 
to use the speech recognition ? Because that might  Yeah . Okay 
, well  M 
and easy to use . Yeah , well maybe that would make 
it even more 
easy to use for them . I'd say three . Okay , so 
we have three three 
two two or 
 So what are we going 
to do 
? <laugh> Okay , a three , I see 
. Uh 
 <laugh> Another 
question . No . Yeah . 
Yeah , but 
I think 
you should make it 
one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything 
from the results , so  Okay , a one , 
because we 
designed for 
that , huh 
? Yeah . Yeah , and 
I though 
w we 
had about 
single colours , but you can also make uh a 
wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , can't you ? Whether it looks like 
wood , it 
isn't w it isn't wood but 
 You can make a print 
on rubber 
, can't you ? Yeah . So that's 
a one then 
, huh 
? <laugh> Do you have many 
questions ? Oh 
, okay well  Yeah , 
but we 
have  We 
also  
We have to get to the money . <laugh> What  spongy . Uh-huh , yeah 
. Yeah , so 
isn't hard to lose 
you . 
<laugh> Yeah , but a har A hard 
to lose 
is good . So it should  this question should 
be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it . <laugh> A two . A two . 
Okay 
. Yeah , 
it's okay . 
That happens 
above also 
. But maybe 
when you scroll away and 
back it will be normal , but  Yep . Oh , it 
isn't , 
well okay 
. <laugh> 
Remember . There 
. Well I think 
it's it's 
uh a 
lower 
number , so better because w we designed it 
for young 
people especially , didn't we ? What do you think 
? Questions ? 
Two . Uh-huh . <laugh> 
Dissatisfy younger 
people . Um  Yeah 
, but those are more fancy 
functions , 
not not really many features or something . It has relatively few features , with 
 Yeah . Ours had other 
features with 
 Okay 
, you think one , what 
do you 
think ? You . 
 three , yeah . 
I'd say three 
, so two it 
is then or  
<laugh> Yeah . Yep . 
Yeah . Yeah 
, maybe 
maybe two 
. Well 
m th 
but the logo is 
on 
on the 
front , so  a two , yeah , 
that's  <laugh> Oh , well that's 
that's pretty 
good 
, huh ? 
That was your evaluation uh 
show , 
okay , so we don't have to 
calculate anything because 
of um these results . Okay , good . Um let's see 
 oh , it 
isn't asked to save 
but it 
did already  And this 
 Everything okay . Well 
, the next 
part uh might 
be a 
little bit difficult to do in a group , but I am willing to try it 
. Because we are going to look at 
the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet 
to do that . <other> And um I'm not sure if 
I put it in the project folder .  look on that . Um and we're 
going to calculate the 
production costs , and if they are uh under or 
at twelve Euro fifty , we're good , and if they're not 
we're going to 
uh re-design , but we have to do that uh 
very very quick I think , yes . Um I don't know if 
I put 
the Excel sheet in the n 
not in the folder . I 
think it's I think 
it's still in my own 
documents folder . Oh shit . So  Okay , 
well this is 
it . 
Um maybe I 
could ask one of 
you to uh fill it in , so that I can also uh take 
minutes , and uh maybe the other can uh 
use that thing to count uh numerous functions . Well we have to count some things 
and 
we have to think about some 
things . But you have to fill in this 
column , huh ? No , uh count uh number of 
functions , 
because for every button you have to 
pay  and there are different screen shots , 
so  or different different screens , so  Yeah , but it's it's 
more about 
the energy 
source , huh ? Do you use a hand 
dynamo , 
a battery , kinetic or solar cells ? We'll wait . Yeah . I'll just 
fill it in 
. Um 
rubber indeed ? Yeah , I 
think that will be 
our best 
bet . And what did you change ? You 
changed the uh scroll wheel and 
 Oh , but it's just 
one point 
, so 
maybe you should should 
uh  
Yeah , you should you should drop 
the speech 
recognition . And then you can keep the curve 
. Or can't you ? Or make it 
on a hand dynamo 
, but <laugh> I don't think that will 
work . Yeah , mm-hmm . Yeah , but 
uh a 
wooden remote 
control only 
helps for uh old people we discussed , yes ? Yeah , but it's only 
a half 
. But 
I think the only option is 
to drop the uh sample speaker . Yeah , but isn't it per remote 
that you 
pay ? Half ? I think you pay half 
per remote 
. So each remote with a special colour 
. I hope . <laugh> So the battery 
, we have um 
advanced 
chip on print 
. Because of  thing  Yeah , 
well you can at least 
make it curved again . Because that was very important , huh 
? So it's curved , it's 
still that 
 
so we we 
dropped the speech recognition 
together 
with the speaker . We dropped the scroll wheel . And 
the rest is the same , 
huh ? Am I right ? Yes 
. No 
, but you c 
yeah . 
Okay , 
but this this 
new remote 
we can 
afford . <laugh> Hmm ? No , I hadn't . 
I just 
received it . They don't 
work so hard at the 
finance department . <laugh> Yeah , and that's it . Twelve 
Euro fifty 
. Um and did 
you try to make 
a new design , or what were you trying to do 
? It didn't work . Hmm . Strange 
. Oh , you 
can arrange  Hmm 
, can't you then just say 
copy ? New page . Paste . Yes . 
<other> Select none 
. <laugh> 
Okay , 
and now you can erase 
. Well 
it should be possible . Oh 
no 
. Well you can draw 
over it with 
white 
uh pen . <laugh> Oh . <laugh> Yeah . Sorry . 
<laugh> Well 
but that's also 
useful for the 
evaluation 
, because I think uh we have a 
prototype now which we can afford and uh we 
only need to draw 
a little bit to get a good uh design . Doodle . And I think 
we should then move 
on to the production evaluation because of the time . Let's see , we can save this 
now . And 
move back to here . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . And then all green 
. 
Okay , 
well thank you . Oh 
, no  
. Hey , 
but you 
can erase that 
. Uh-oh 
. Right . <sound indicating frustration> And you 
can't erase 
this ? Hmm 
, strange . Okay , well 
uh just leave it 
at this and quickly 
save . Um and then 
we are going to 
the project or product evaluation . We just did  our project evaluation 
. Um well , I think I can 
sit for that 
since it's almost my final slide . 
Um what did you think about uh the 
process ? How satisfied are we ? Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . Yeah . And 
you could 
ask things 
. And 
for me it sometimes was a 
surprise who was going to present what , huh ? And uh  Yeah . So you 
would say uh 
communicate during 
our individual uh work . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Well , probably 
to simulate 
the whole working uh 
process , huh , th  you can't have 
a meeting 
uh for 
several weeks . No . So you don't think the 
SMARTboard is 
is 
really useful or  Yeah , so it's maybe 
a bit 
unnatural also 
. That wasn't me . Uh <laugh> so 
um the means , 
we discussed the smart 
board , and what about uh this digital pen 
? Yeah , well I use it as 
a a normal 
pen and and and only you use it 
to uh get it on the computer , huh ? Yeah . Yeah . Okay 
, um 
and what 
about the 
teamwork ? Yeah 
, well I think so too 
.  we  Yeah , but that 
was  it 
was our 
assignment , huh ? Okay , and maybe I 
should walk 
out of 
the room when you discuss uh this point , the leadership . <laugh> Yeah well , 
okay . And creativity 
? 
Well , 
when we 
look at this 
I'd say 
we have been creative , huh ? But  There was room 
for  
You did 
? Well , I didn't 
have time for 
that . 
At some times I  Sometimes I 
received like like five emails at at one moment , and then  <laugh> I even got 
spam . <laugh> 
Or 
something like that . <laugh> And I was working and working and 
work <laugh> Okay , well um  but after 
all we can say 
uh we are satisfied , but it it could've been uh better 
. When we get uh  when we 
have  we would have gotten uh more information 
. Yeah . Yeah , that was a 
bit mean 
to put 
it in the end . And uh what were the other points 
to to improve this whole process ? Yeah , they're pretty heavy . And 
so more 
time uh w might 
have improved the the quality of work , is what you say . Okay . 
Okay , so more time 
during the 
individual work phases 
. Um okay well uh I just got 
my warning for the 
last five minutes , so I'll move on to I guess 
my last slide , yes , which is the closing . 
Well uh 
, we managed , but 
we did it 
very quickly . 
I don't know if that's the best 
way to  when it isn't  is it  when it is too expensive to quickly re-arrange it and say , okay , this is it , but we had to do it , 
huh , because we have to have 
a design 
, and that is within the budget . 
And we evaluated . Maybe we should 
re-evaluate uh the product 
, but we did that before , and 
we also evaluated the project . 
And I think uh everybody's uh very 
happy . At least I am , with the results , so uh celebration , well , for 
the three 
of you , because uh I have to write the 
final report now . But uh <laugh> well , thank you 
very much for your co-operation 
, and I had a very nice day 
so far . <laugh> Okay . <other> Um  Yeah I 
have t 
I think we 
also 
have to go 
to our own rooms again , but um  well I at least 
. But maybe you 
can try uh to 
make a screen shot of this , so I can try to include it 
in the final report . Yeah , maybe .  wants to 
, but at least 
this one . I know , we should remove this 
, but it won't h Okay . And 
uh please put it 
in the 
project folder then , huh . Okay , well I uh  I 
hereby officially close the meeting and 
uh I hope to see you 
uh soon . <laugh> <laugh> Well , I think we'll be 
a bit a 
bit longer , but  okay . Well , happy 
celebration , 
huh ? <laugh> How 
big ? Uh not too 
. <laugh> Whatever you 
think is good . <whistling> 
<whistling> <whistling> <whistling>
