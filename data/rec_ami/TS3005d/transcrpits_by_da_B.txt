. <laugh> 
Well uh 
we 
made a 
prototype . We first start with 
the 
overall uh 
 This is about the total 
remote control 
. 
We made 
it 
green . Yeah . 
It's a fresh 
colour . 
And uh the 
screen light blue . Oh 
uh this the scroll button and the microphone 
on the on the sides here under . 
And the R_ and R_ 
logo , 
it just says R_ and 
R_ now , but uh  Any 
questions so 
far ? <laugh> Yeah . Yeah . Oh y you  perhaps you should make 
it a bit big , so people 
know it's there and uh  Uh  
Hmm . You 
push the scroll button and it's 
claps out 
if there's 
a 
 <laugh> Remote 
settings , et cetera . Yeah . Yeah . 
And you could also touch 
it so that 
it comes 
out , 
and and use the the 
the scroll thing as 
a  with your fingers 
. Yes . Yeah . Yeah 
. Perhaps 
we should 
use the teletext sign in p 
yeah . Yeah . Forgot . 
<laugh> Uh well , this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ 
screen . 
Uh the 
numbers , 
which is pretty straight forward . We 
put ano an an 
extra button 
in . We 
can erase it 
, but  It's the button where you can switch channels .  
just when you are one and you go to two 
, you can  or if you go to 
five , you can go 
back to one with that button . Yeah , that one 
, yeah . It has a name . And uh uh we put that in , I thought it would be handy there . Uh this the one number or two numbers 
button . Below that , the page 
and the sound . And 
uh in the middle the the mute . 
Uh battery indicator . <laugh> It's <laugh> it's 
a bit big . <laugh> And this is the uh 
the on off uh knop , the stand by 
uh knop . Or at least it should look 
like it . And the 
options uh of teletext . Huh . 
Yeah . Well this about it , I think . Yeah . I will put it back on 
the  <laugh> on the nice green . That's 
the logo of the  Yeah . 
It's th 
th right now 
it's only R_ R_ , but uh 
 <laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> Sorry . <laugh> Oh full screen , yeah <laugh>  . 
<laugh> Right . Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah 
. <laugh> Yeah . Well  <laugh> Yeah . It uh  oh it's 
in the background 
. Oh . 
Y you should make uh a sideways uh 
view 
. It 
will be 
, I 
guess . 
Oh 
, we 
can  
Oh g <laugh> 
I would <laugh>  smart board . <laugh> Uh can I 
draw here or uh  Ooh . So it would 
be uh something like this from the side , but with a 
bit 
of uh curve here , right ? Yeah . 
So if you v flip it like this . 
Here's  
yeah 
. Yeah . So you just make the back of this part a bit bigger , so that it lays 
a bit 
o <laugh> 
Yeah 
, that's a bit of problem maybe . 
Yeah . I think 
yeah , the 
battery should be in here , because it's just nothing , so 
if you could  Yeah . 'Cause 
otherwise I think i I think it does . I 
if you 
don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't 
like it . Yeah . 
I think it does . 
Yeah . 
I don't know whether older 
people will use it , 
but  I would make it a two or something . Yeah . Huh ? Alright , 
it's a 
one . <laugh> Oh it's 
a one 
. <laugh> Yeah . But it's a one uh  Maybe uh 
 Yeah . Well they think it's very true 
, but 
uh  
<other> Yeah , but  We should perhaps  That not . Yeah 
. <laugh> 
I think it is , because 
it has an 
L_C_D_ screen 
, 
a mi microphone . It's from 
rubber . Yeah 
. <laugh> <other> 
It's a 
one I think . 
Yeah , because 
they're right 
on 
your screen . So you 
can use the b the the arrows . They're right on 
your screen , so 
I don't know 
where you'd search . Yeah . Well 
, I 
think they are . The options are 
it  uh little bit harder , but if you 
touch the options then it's uh 
 No they're not , but they're they're 
they are 
easy to 
find . Oh . Yeah 
. I would say yeah . Yeah . Yeah , 
you can make it a two . Yeah , but 
you don't have t 
have to use the button on the right . 
You can 
touch it 
. Yeah . You you 
can touch options . 
Yeah . You can touch options and 
it's comes 
out . <laugh> The uh the um  Below . <laugh> <laugh> <laugh> It's 
different . For young people 
I think 
it's easy to use . Yeah 
. I 
think it's  <laugh> 
In the entire mankind . 
Yeah . Yeah , but uh  Yeah 
, but 
they they don't want 
the uh extra options , right ? So  Yeah 
, okay 
, but so they 
could  Uh I think it 
is . 
If they 
read a manual 
. <laugh> 
Yeah , alright . <laugh> Because it it's not it's 
not it's 
it's not 
uh difficult . You 
say you say uh record 
to to the to the speech recognition , then you say the 
question and the answer . And 
that's everything it does , the speech recognition . Yeah . I 
think it would make it uh  I would make it two . Yeah 
. <laugh> <sound indicating distaste> Three ? Oh . You ? 
Oh . Well  Two and a half . <laugh> 
Three ? 
No . <laugh> No . But um I 
mean , that's definitely one . 
Oh nee 
, oh seven is 
it ? 
It is 
. Yeah 
, uh 
the remote score . It's not 
overwhelmed . Yeah . Yep 
. Yes 
. 'Cause we make them 
in different colours , 
so that they uh 
 Yeah . That 
it that it 
looks like wood 
, like something , 
yeah . Uh I 
think you 
can . 
It it 
feels like rubber , but  <laugh> Well 
but then when you scratch 
it it does come off . So that's a bit  Oh we have time 
. <laugh> <laugh> What ? Yeah 
, yeah , it's very spongy 
. Oh but 
not 
 it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber . 
I think it's a three 
. 
Hard but  Yeah . 
You can <laugh> 
break it . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Y 
yeah 
, you could you could call it . 
Yeah , y you can 
lose it , but it isn't 
hard to lose 
. Two 
. That it's hard to lose 
? Yeah , it 
it is  
there's the  it's a six , 
you think ? <laugh> So it's a two 
. Yeah , you can lose it 
, so 
I don't   you can 
make it 
a three I   It does 
have an  a built in function . 
Nee . Hard to lose 
. Oh right . It is hard 
to lose . Yeah , 
so then this is  it is almost true 
, so a two . <laugh> <other>  <laugh> Ooh 
. <laugh> 
Oh . Oh well , it doesn't 
. I think it will , yeah . 
Uh well I  a a two . <laugh> It's 
it's much more younger 
. Yeah . I 
think it's a 
two but 
 Two two 
two . <laugh> 
Let's make everything a two 
. Younger 
people . 
It has  
What did  Yeah 
. Well that  it doesn't 
. <laugh> 
Yeah bu but  <laugh> 
I think 
they like the speech . 
You could call to your uh 
 yeah , 
and the screen 
, yeah . 
Right , that 
that that  those are 
features . 
No , aren't the 
features  the microphone's feature and that 
you can change the channel's feature , 
and that you can change the 
volume is 
feature , 
and that you can 
change the options of 
the remote 
, uh uh something 
like that . 
Yeah . Those are features . <laugh> Enough features 
? Yeah . I think two or three . Yeah 
. Yeah uh a two a two . <laugh> Just another two . <laugh> We like two . <laugh> 
Yeah , there's R_ 
and R_ in front 
. <laugh> 
Uh it's not the colour , 
so maybe 
you should 
make two , but it has R_ and R_ . Yeah 
. Yeah , but not 
R_ and R_ yellow I think . One d 
on i it's the colours and the 
 I think it is , but 
I don't know what you think . 
<laugh> And 
you can 
navigate easier , because wi with the  you 
have to push the the the arrows and  with 
a normal T_V_ uh remote 
. <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Let's make a 
different 
remote . Well  Menu . 
A two ? <laugh> We only have twos . <laugh> Uh just twos . One three and a few ones . Two 
threes . We m 
mostly have twos , so it's pretty good 
. Yeah 
. Yeah . I 
think so too . We can 
be happy . <laugh> Yeah . What is it ? It's 
like a bug 
or something . A fly , 
yeah . A f butterfly 
. Yeah 
. That's it . <laugh> Sure . 
It's good . Yeah . 
Yeah . Redesign 
. No . <laugh> 
Yeah . Yeah . So we're going 
to erase features or something 
. Do you have 
the cost or uh  
<laugh> Let's hope 
. <laugh> We're going to 
be here 
at eight o'clock . <laugh> 
We're goin 
still going 
to be here at eight o'clock . <laugh> I 
doubt it . Perhaps we've 
got features that 
don't exist in the 
Excel sheet . <laugh> <other> No , it was in my 
uh my information , so uh  Yeah . Well , if 
it doesn't work  
I want to fill it in , but uh  But you 
should uh direct  
The number of  We've got a battery 
, one or 
t two 
batteries , 
or not ? nee one 
battery , with two small batteries . Yeah . I 
would do a battery  we 
do . Right ? 
A battery . One battery 
, right ? <laugh> Electronics , simple chip  
advanced 
chip , right ? Yeah , so this 
one and 
this one . Uh we ha we have um 
single  
what ? Are we ? Oh 
yay . 
<laugh> The single . Oh the 
the  it's 
not going 
to work 
uh people . We have rubber . 
Thirteen ? With a scroll wheel , right 
? Is he integrated ? 
No , eh 
? I don't know 
. 
Oh yeah , 
right , we want it to  it's 
not it's not  
no . 
<laugh> Yep . Fifteen , 
oh , 
too bad . <laugh> 
Oh but 
with special 
colour we have . 
A special form , right 
? Oh , we don't have any buttons , so  Yeah , 
we need 
to uh 
No , uh we have fifteen 
and 
 oh , right . <sound indicating displeasure> We 
could lose the curve 
. Yeah 
, I 
would lose the curve . But 
you can't 
push it 
, so you have 
to tap 
. Yeah , alright . So 
normal scroll wheel ? And 
I think we should lose the 
curve . Yeah , but if you  
would i it is a new 
feature , it it's something special 
. No , the 
curve doesn't really  No 
, then it will  won't uh stand up 
from the 
table . Then it would just 
 Yeah . So  We 
would lose this one ? 
Yeah , 
we could s yeah , 
a bit 
. Sixteen point three . So we still  Could could we 
do it on a regular 
chip on 
print or 
something ? No ? Ma y 
you just 
can't do that , or uh  We 
changed th Yeah , 
and 
the single curved 
to uncurved . No . Yeah , but it's t Yeah , but it 
is uh 
it it is a new feature , it is something special 
. I don't 
know . 
Yeah , that's difficult . <laugh> <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Uh 
. <laugh> We 
could make 
it titanium instead of rubber . Oh . Oh can I 
ask something ? What is 
special colour ? Is 
that the 
wood uh wood uh 
 this , we 
have to 
have that one too ? Th then we still have 
too much if 
we use the uh  
Yeah , we we scrap 
that one ? See , a po three 
. <laugh> We need point three . <laugh> Uh it's 
a colour . Don't make it wood 
. Make it uh  Yeah 
, but 
it's it's special colour , is 
it a all kind 
of colours ? It's also green or uh  
Yeah , but it's a 
special colour than just rubber 
colour . You have 
to add 
something to the rubber to make 
it green 
. You don't say here's green 
rubber . Yeah 
, you can 
, you 
should  you have to lose  No , it 
is the scroll wheel , I guess . A push , yeah . 
Switch colours . It was such a 
great idea . <laugh> What 
do you mean ? Oh . But I 
think when 
you use the colour that's not originally the rubber 
then you use 
special colour 
, 'cause you 
have to add it . Yeah , so 
you always lose the special 
colour . 
You co you could make it always black , like normal remote . Oh right , yeah . Yeah 
, we should u Yeah . We 
have to 
make this like four or five or something 
. That's what it means . Yeah . Oh right , yeah . 
Is it per remote ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that's 
right , 
and you  one colour per remote . So then it is 
one . No . One 
. So 
it would be curved , 
single curve . Or not 
? So 
y you just can't make 
a nice remote 
. <laugh> It's too bad 
for the speaker . Should we 
change that 
tha that 
that's a one if not , or not ? 
Could you copy 
it 
? And make it uh  The entire uh  
Perhaps you can then copy page or 
so . Ooh . No . Oh you you made the entire 
 could you 
 <laugh> Oh not  
Well  . Would you 
? By the  
Perhaps you can save this one , and then 
copy or 
something . 
Add 
it copy page . Select all . Alright , 
something went 
wrong . 
It 
doesn't work 
. Let's forget 
. <laugh> Yeah 
. <laugh> Oh ignore that . <laugh> 
<laugh> Well , so  Too 
bad . Yeah . The 
microphone . Yeah 
. A 
and we changed something 
, I guess , 
or not ? 
We  Oh no . 
Yeah , I tried 
to copy that one , 
but it didn't 
work . 
So we could 
fix it 
like tha that it's like this . <laugh> You 
could select it 
all , 
but then you 
can't erase 
. <laugh> Erase . When you saw 
th li uh  Earlier 
when we selected it , w I couldn't erase anything . Just tap 
somewhere . Yeah . I don't 
think I can , but uh we 
can try 
. Oh , yeah , no , 
ha-ha . Yeah , we tried it earlier . It's very much 
work . <sound indicating displeasure> Yeah 
, goodbye 
mic . <laugh> Oh , I 
already erased half of the line 
. Too bad , 
oh . 
<sound indicating frustration> Like 
this ? 
Still looks nice . Oh 
, that's erase . Yeah 
, 
that's a 
bit weird . 
Oh 
, now 
I'm  line . Yeah . No , 
it's weird . <laugh> Yeah 
Bu but stressful 
. You think , 
no , 
my presentation isn't 
ready . 
Yeah . Yeah , you 
had information 
I didn't have and then 
uh  
Oh right 
. <laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah 
. No . Yeah 
, you could  Yeah . I think so too 
. Yeah 
, but 
then you can work together too 
when  A chat 
would also be uh 
 Well 
, I I 
don't really 
like the board , it 
doesn't really 
work great . Sometimes I 
think <sound indicating frustration> 
. It does work , but sometimes 
it doesn't 
erase or it doesn't uh  Yeah 
. Yeah 
. But  Well it is useful , 
but it doesn't really work all the time . Th the 
pen doesn't  The 
line is a bit off 
. Yeah , you can 
point to 
where you 
want the 
line 
to be . But 
 Yeah . <laugh> <laugh> Yeah . I  
<other> I I used it 
, it it was  you can 
use it 
, it's quite handy I think . Yeah , I used it 
to y 
to  
Yeah 
, it did 
work pretty 
well . I don't think why 
you would want to 
use it actually , but 
it it does work . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
and then you can show it to 
everybody . 
It doesn't really write normally . 
It's a bit  <laugh> <laugh> Yeah . I think it was 
great , yeah . Yeah , but 
it was 
because we didn't uh  Yeah . <laugh> <laugh> 
I thought it was good , 
but uh  Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> Well . Yeah 
. And 
you get 
get stuff from the from the computer , 
but  
Yeah

the 
first ten minutes before we got 
here , so I went , right . 
<laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Just looking 
at the screen and uh 
 <laugh> 
Yeah , an Yeah , that will be handy . <laugh> Yeah . Yea uh so tha 
actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen 
but no mic 
, or it could make 
mic but no L_C_D_ 
screen , 
when 
you look at that . Yeah . 
<laugh> Uh , 
I dunno . 
Think 
that's about it . Hmm . Heavier um  less heavy laptops . <laugh> Yeah . But that's not really uh  Yeah . Yeah , everything
