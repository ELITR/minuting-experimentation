A:  have noticed I 
A:  uh created separate folders because it was uh 
A:  tending to get 
A:  a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder . I don't know if everybody uh put 
A:  their own uh documents in the right folder , which is for now the detailed design 
C:   <laugh> <other> Okay . Get up stand up 
A:  minutes , and if I'm right , you two 
A:  are going to give a prototype presentation ? Aren't you ? Yes , you are 
A:  with evaluation criteria ? Good . And we have a correct 
A:  at something which is less nice , the finance uh aspect , whether we 
A:  can afford what we have designed , and if we can we can uh 
A:  commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , how did we work together and what 
B:  on the on the sides here under . 
B:  And the R_ and R_ 
C:  an idea about how to m th that could also be possible . Uh well 
B:  R_ now , but uh  Any 
B:  far ? <laugh> Yeah . Yeah . Oh y you  perhaps you should make 
B:  it a bit big , so people 
D:  to be , 
C:  a  so . Do not forget it . To function it it doesn't really have 
B:  settings , et cetera . Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  And you could also touch 
C:  uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work . Uh using the scroll button 
C:  uh y uh I uh um   Yeah , you push the scroll button and 
B:  and and use the the 
C:  available . For example uh T_V_ settings , uh remote settings , 
C:  et cetera . So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button , uh as you can see  oh , it's here 
C:  , just push it in , uh the menu comes out like this 
C:  pressing the uh scroll uh button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used uh  which should still be used and we think that 
C:  it's uh very handy to put it uh 
C:  Yes . In an apart uh  In a separate button , yeah . <laugh> A sign , yeah , just like  Okay , indeed . Okay , we 
B:  which is pretty straight forward . We 
B:  , but  It's the button where you can switch channels .  
B:  just when you are one and you go to two 
B:  back to one with that button . Yeah , that one 
B:  , yeah . It has a name . And uh uh we put that in , I thought it would be handy there . Uh this the one number or two numbers 
B:  uh knop . Or at least it should look 
B:  like it . And the 
B:  Yeah . Well this about it , I think . Yeah . I will put it back on 
C:  much part of the screen , so it's very uh  when you uh <other> when you use it , doesn't uh become irritating to see . 'Cause if 
A:  typing  The R_R_ stands for ? Logo , okay . <laugh> Okay well 
B:  <laugh> Right . Yeah . <laugh>

abst_sum - abstract: The project manager opened the meeting and then the user interface designer and industrial designer presented their prototype for the remote which featured an LCD screen, a scroll button, and a battery indicator.

D:  we can evaluate the design of the remote control by 
D:  the questions we   requirements from the  of the users . My name , my job , okay . The methods . Questionnaire 
D:  to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's 
D:  true or it's false by steps . One means absolutely not true , seven   means true . 
D:  The three important things of refa 
D:  <laugh>  are uh from th 
D:  , and is it easy enough to 
D:  use . And then evaluation itself 
D:  . Uh . So . Okay . First 
D:  think ? But does it  
A:  the green colour . And the the curves which we decided , huh ? Only what happened to the 
A:  we spoke about last meeting ? <laugh> Well it might work one time 
B:  I would <laugh>  smart board . <laugh> Uh can I 
B:  . Yeah . So you just make the back of this part a bit bigger , so that it lays 
C:  uh at a bottom at a bottom . Uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes 
C:  uh in some uh space , and the batteries can 
C:  be located over there , so uh  Yeah .  
D:  <laugh> With two batteries , the whole print plate and t and 
B:  don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't 
D:  the elder people . I think  <other> Yeah , I have to agree , all 
B:  but  I would make it a two or something . Yeah . Huh ? Alright , 
D:  now , it's only design . And the design . So  A two 
A:  microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also . Very new thing . Well  Fancy 
B:  <other> Yeah , but  We should perhaps  That not . Yeah 
D:  Okay . Let's give it a 
C:  it's fancy . Yeah . <laugh> And 
B:  your screen . So you 
B:  can use the b the the arrows . They're right on 
C:  ones  <other> Yeah . Take a harder 
D:  ? That was a big requirement of the old people . Are all 
B:  , I 
B:  think they are . The options are 
B:  . I would say yeah . Yeah . Yeah , 
C:  than on the regular remote controls where you have 
D:  easiest way to to to handle . True . I would rate it a  Yeah 
C:  you have to use the the the manual to understand most  Yeah . I think it's uh it's 
C:  a two , at least . It's not perfect , but  A three ? And 
A:  have to  It's the 
D:  it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . I I 
D:  I don't think you can find the option button that easy . You can touch it . Yeah , okay , but you have 
D:  here , the teletext button , right ? Okay , then okay , good . Then I think 
D:  people . Young means sixteen to forty years . And elderly from forty eight 
D:  . The scroller a 
B:  the uh extra options , right ? So  Yeah 
C:  uh controls , li uh as you can see in the screen now , and 
A:  people ? And would it be easy for them 
D:  old , you're holding 
B:  Yeah , alright . <laugh> Because it it's not it's 
A:  to use the speech recognition ? Because that might  Yeah . Okay 
B:  to to the to the speech recognition , then you say the 
B:  think it would make it uh  I would make it two . Yeah 
B:  . <laugh> <sound indicating distaste> Three ? Oh . You ? 
B:  Oh . Well  Two and a half . <laugh> 
A:  easy to use for them . I'd say three . Okay , so 
A:   <laugh> Another 
D:  . Tha that's a one 
D:  . No ? Oh yeah . Yeah , I think isn't , this 
A:  one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything 
D:  . True . Remote control has uh colours that different  that meet 
A:  from the results , so  Okay , a one , 
D:  groups . Yeah . That's true . Also with rubber ? Yeah , okay 
B:  feels like rubber , but  <laugh> Well 
A:  wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , can't you ? Whether it looks like 
A:  single colours , but you can also make uh a 
D:  one ? Okay . 
A:  , can't you ? Yeah . So that's 
D:  one , that's m rubber . Yeah 
D:  , I th think it's not the 
B:  break it . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Y 
B:  lose it , but it isn't 
C:  to lose , yeah it sh and it's easy to find . Isn't hard 
D:  lose it if you're sixty years old 
C:  , this this is hard to lose . This 
D:  . If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh  
D:  . Isn't hard to lose . Yeah . You can't lose 
A:  be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it . <laugh> A two . A two . 
B:  Uh well I  a a two . <laugh> It's 
D:  ? Very true ? No , I don't think 
B:  Let's make everything a two 
D:  have the colours . Um we have the buttons is  
D:  Okay , okay . I think 
A:  people especially , didn't we ? What do you think 
D:  features on this thing . L_C_D_ 
D:  screen and scroll . I I think they'll be quite met 
C:  control I think it i <other> it would satisfy those needs . Yeah , the speech possibility , 
B:  features  the microphone's feature and that 
D:  with their expectations . No 
A:   Yeah . Ours had other 
B:  change the options of 
D:  feature . Yeah , okay . I think 
D:   yeah , and then you 
B:  the remote 
B:  , uh uh something 
B:  Yeah . Those are features . <laugh> Enough features 
D:  I think once you've  'cause you have 
D:  , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll thing extra . Make it make it a two . Or make it uh a 
D:   Has  oh yeah , do did have  nah y 
B:  R_ and R_ yellow I think . One d 
B:  on i it's the colours and the 
B:   I think it is , but 
D:  yellow one . Maybe two . 
D:  X_ marks spot . <other> And the menu is 
B:  navigate easier , because wi with the  you 
A:  front , so  a two , yeah , 
D:  . <loud inhalation of air> Yeah , tha that's so true . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah 
B:  a normal T_V_ uh remote 
C:  Instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button . Yeah , you can navigate . Uh . You're 
D:     I think it would 
D:  lower . <laugh> So okay , we have one three , 
D:  is quite good in my opinion . That  Ooh . 
B:  yeah . A f butterfly
