Oh okay . That's 
the 
place where it's going 
to be , 
not the size 
.  Mm-hmm . Yeah , okay . Of course . Mm . Mm 
, th 
yeah . Small . <laugh> <laugh> Shit 
. 'Kay .  Evaluation . 'Kay 
, my 
task 
was 
this time 
to put up 
a questionnaire 
by which 
we can evaluate the design of the remote control by 
the questions we   requirements from the  of the users . My name , my job , okay . The methods . Questionnaire 
with seven point scale from one 
to seven 
, from true 
to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's 
true or it's false by steps . One means absolutely not true , seven   means true . 
The three important things of refa 
<laugh>  are uh from th 
of this year is  are , is the remote control fancy enough , is it in innovative enough 
, and is it easy enough to 
use . And then evaluation itself 
. Uh . So . Okay . First 
question . Is the design fancy enough 
? Project 
Manager , 
what do you 
think ? But does it  
Yeah . <laugh>  <laugh> Think . Yeah 
, yeah , you 
can . 
Isn't going to 
be a 
little bit heavy at the top ? 
<laugh> With two batteries , the whole print plate and t and 
top 
, and if you're holding it quite a lot I think  Yeah . Yeah , we have to rate . Is it fancy 
enough ? 
True is one , false is seven 
. So fancy enough means 
, does it comes 
to the younger people 
and 
the elder people . I think  <other> Yeah , I have to agree , all 
the colour colours 
don don doesn't matter that m that much 
now , it's only design . And the design . So  A two 
? Yeah , I 
n used  I 
wouldn I 
should use that 
one , 
but it doesn't  Okay , no it's two ? True is a one . Very 
true , is 
it very true 
or isn't that true ? 
Yeah , I think two . That's 
fancy enough . Then ? 
Okay . Let's give it a 
two . Is it 
innovative ? 
Enough . 
We have for the search function 
. The scroller a 
bit  
I think it's it's a one yeah 
. True . Also huh 
uh-huh  the buttons , are they easy 
to find 
? That was a big requirement of the old people . Are all 
the buttons easy to find ? Not only this buttons 
, all the buttons . I think th it's easy t Yeah , I think this is 
easy now . I 
think th 
I think 
the options buttons are not the the 
easiest way to to to handle . True . I would rate it a  Yeah 
, okay , 
that's true 
, that's true . But that's 
that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen , you can have text 
. Yeah . <other> I think it's a 
three . I personally think 
, because 
I d I don't think i maybe 
it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . I I 
think if you have the button at the right , 
I don't think you can find the option button that easy . You can touch it . Yeah , okay , but you have 
y then you have here 
s written option on 
here , the teletext button , right ? Okay , then okay , good . Then I think 
also two 
, yeah . Yep . <other> It's 
easy to use , as well for younger 
as elderl 
elderly 
people . Young means sixteen to forty years . And elderly from forty eight 
to their death . Also if you're 
sixty years old  Also Yeah , as well 
as your  if you're fif sixty 
years 
old , you're holding 
one of those 
things in your hand  No , but we're going to th make this f for a 
all kind 
of people , so it it it has to be  <laugh> If you read 
the manual ,  always . So  
Also two ? Not a seven for 
this  ? 
I would 
also say three 
. <laugh> Remotes overwhelmed with buttons . 
No , that that's that's  
yeah 
. Tha that's a one 
, I 
think , that's definitely 
a one 
. No ? Oh yeah . Yeah , I think isn't , this 
has to 
be something like 
isn't overwhelmed 
. True . Remote control has uh colours that different  that meet 
different target 
groups . Yeah . That's true . Also with rubber ? Yeah , okay 
. Yeah 
? That's a 
one ? Okay . 
Uh I have  
<laugh> <other> 
The material used is 
spongy , 
that that's uh that's 
a 
one , that's m rubber . Yeah 
, I th think it's not the 
most spongy thing . 
Yeah . 
Remote control is hard to lose . Y you can't 
you can't 
lose it if you're sixty years old 
. If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh  
set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it . It isn't hard , no . I think I think this is 
a two , personally . No 
. Isn't hard to lose . Yeah . You can't lose 
it . 
Or if you're you're sixty 
years old , your demands  I 
think  yeah , I think also . Huh ? Yeah 
? Oh , okay . No . <laugh> Okay 
okay okay 
. Remote 
control mainly be sold 
to younger 
people . Yeah ? True 
? Very true ? No , I don't think 
very true 
because the 
colours . We 
have the colours . Um we have the buttons is  
aren't that that much . 
Nah , the material isn't that  So I don I think 
I think 
it's a three . Yeah 
, 
but I uh  
Okay , okay . I think 
because  
yeah ? <loud sigh> In 
the features ? Because 
younger peoples are cr 
critical and 
wanted a lot of 
features on this thing . L_C_D_ 
screen and scroll . I I think they'll be quite met 
with their expectations . No 
. It's three features , basically , the L_C_D_  touch 
screen is 
feature . The microphone is a 
feature . Yeah , okay . I think 
 yeah , and then you 
have the audio settings 
, channel setting 
, video 
settings . <laugh> Yeah yeah . So I've chos I shou I think it's 
it's it's a one 
. Personally , yeah . 
I think once you've  'cause you have 
the channel 
features b 
uh you have the uh 
screen features , audio features , 
the 
 you have all buttons on it which you'd like , 
microphone extra 
, L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll thing extra . Make it make it a two . Or make it uh a 
fucking two . You can see the 
remote control is  R_ and R_ . 
 Has  oh yeah , do did have  nah y 
you have the 
black one . 
And we'll probably make also a 
yellow one . Maybe two . 
X_ marks spot . <other> And the menu is 
avail that is 
available is easy to use 
. <loud inhalation of air> Yeah , tha that's so true . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah 
, uh  I think that wou 
that would 
be quite 
hard to learn to 
use it . No , I'm not not convinc . <loud inhalation of air> Let's go th for 
<loud inhalation of air> 
   I think it would 
be a t yeah , two . Now 
lower . <laugh> So okay , we have one three , 
a one , that 
that have to 
got up .  Two two two two two . So two , yeah . The 
average is a two . That 
is quite good in my opinion . That  Ooh . 
Ooh . Top . 
Okay . Yes . 
No , 
it's two 
. The 
average is 
two . 
Yeah , 
I uh 
uh I uh saved it . <loud exhalation of air> <other> 
<laugh>  
f fifty five Euros . No . Yeah 
mm yeah 
, 
maybe . The microphone . <laugh> 
Yeah ? 
 maybe you're going scrap scrap 
it . No prob 
. Ah . 
Count it ? Li like write it 
be  Ah 
, okay 
, cool . 
Huh ? Yeah ? Oh 
, 
yea yeah , you design it 
. Um  <other> Yeah . Solar cell . No it took a battery ? 
Yeah . We 
have  No 
, 
we have sample speaker . 
But b 
al but we 
also have 
sample speaker , do Oh 
, we already on nine . We have double curved . 
Single . 
This one is  <other> 
This one is curved like 
this , 
right . It's curved like 
this . Yeah , bu what  
Oh , 
but we have curves like 
it and 
it . There 
are two 
curves , right ? Oh , okay I understand 
, I understand . Rubber 
. Push 
button . No , we don't have push button 
. L_C_D_ 
display . Eighteen 
and a half , damn . We have 
to lower it 
with six points . Twelve 
and half 
. We could use  I think we should 
scrap the sample speaker 
. It's four pri 
it four units . But w d wha Curved 
then it will be square . Was 
that  does that 
mean 
to it , single curve ? 
Okay . Yeah 
, but tha that that only is one . 
No , 
one . 
So we don't  Yeah , we also 
have to 
 No 
, 
otherwise we don't 
have an 
L_C_D_ screen . Single curved 
. Flat 
. Yeah , so that does doesn't doesn't 
that mu I 
think  
Scrap sample 
speaker ? That that's uh  Yes , four points 
. Yeah , but 
what what else what 
else uh do you want 
to scrap 
? F You have to  we have to scrap four points . 
Ma 
make it with wood instead of rubber ? Yeah , it 
it i Yeah , it also  uh it 
also takes 
one point less 
. Yeah 
. I think it is . Yeah . Yeah . Sample 
speaker . 
Yeah , okay , three 
. Point 
three . Huh ? Point 
twelve  . That's 
a scroll wheel . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
but a wood  
we can make it brown , 
dark brown 
, not wood . 
Is it also  no that that's just normal colour  fruit 
colours . Normal colours 
, yellow  Yeah , but then I d I 
don't think we can ever 
make to 
a twelve and half . But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to 
scrap uh s advanced chip . No then we 
have to scrap everything we 
got because how many 
colours 
we gonna make ? Five ? Then we 
have two . S touch . Then we 
can make 
 add two colours on 
it 
. Yeah 
, two colours  it . They can add two colours 
. But 
the colours . Um how 
ma uh the colours like l 
she told , is that all the colours we add or  Yeah , but we we we are  we have 
yellow , 
red , 
uh black , titanium . Ah okay . Yeah , but the rubbers alls original black . 
Yeah b Yeah 
, but 
we're gonna make it yellow  uh 
red 
, 
and then 
you add  you have two special colours on top 
of the one we have now . Yeah , but m Yeah , because we have more colours than 
only black 
. I 
 then 
I think I p I don I don't think 
they me mean they're special  Yeah , okay okay , true . True , true . We 
have two points spare . Nee one point . Mm yep 
. Y yea the scroll wheel 
is 
dropped . Yep 
. Tap . 
It should've work . Yep .  just 
tap somewhere 
. No 
? Evaluation drops . 
And erase 
the mic . <laugh> <yawn> 
Looks like 
a iPod . 
Oh . All I need 
is 
 
mic . <loud inhale and exhale> <cough> <other> 
Station page 
. I think we  it should be 
b 
it 
would be better 
if we worked a little bit together . Now we worked through each other , something he said  yeah 
, and you had information I also 
had , so some 
some things 
I had in my presentation , they already 
told , so  So yeah , that  I don't think that is 
the best 
way to work 
at  
for such project . <other> Yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together 
or 
something , 
and then 
work separate . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah m yeah 
, like she told . 
Then you 
can work 
together too by mail 
or by , I dunno , chat , something , but now we're completely separated from each other . I don't think 
that was the best way , but  Yeah 
, the technology's okay . Yeah okay , but 
I don 
I do I think becau that's 
because  Yeah 
. Yeah , like the f like a plotters or something 
, yeah 
. Yep 
yep yep yep yep . Yeah , it is 
useful , 
but  No . Yep . 
I didn't use it at all . <laugh> 
I didn't 
use . 
No  yeah . It is it is 
 yeah , it 
is easy 
for  
to design something and then 
load it 
in your computer . Yeah . Yeah . It's b bi little bit too big to 
write . 
<laugh> Yeah 
. Fat document , those . Team work was okay 
. Only thing 
that we worked through , 
past each other . With 
some things that was only problem , but  Yeah yeah 
yeah , but furthermore better . That's  
<laugh> yeah 
, no prob . 
Ah . Yeah . 
Okay . Mm-hmm 
. Little bit uh lo yeah . 
Too late 
 it 
it it 
took a lot of time before you got your 
ema yeah . I played I think seven times Solitaire something . Wha 
Oh right 
, it is there . No , I I 
never 
got that . 
I always  N 
yeah . <laugh> <other> So does this  
I think lik 
oh 
and information 
was a 
bit low I think 
, sometimes , in in in in the beginning I didn't understand what what to 
do . Yeah , like I  with with the remote  and I 
never new 
we have t we had to uh  
yeah made a made a rec a remote control . Yeah , so  So , yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
Faster . Yeah . 
Yeah , 
it only 
costs four 
units . 
Uh <loud inhale> 
yeah . 
<loud inhale> Um 
 Yeah . Nothing . I think we got it 
already 
. Yeah . <laugh> 
And furthermore 
the the the network was okay . 
Everything you loaded 
was also av available there . So  Yeah 
. Yeah , but that 
 It's now half 
past four 
 half past three , so  
Yeah , okay . Yeah , okay . Mm-hm . 
Mm .
