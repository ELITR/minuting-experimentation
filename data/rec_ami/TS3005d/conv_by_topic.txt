A:  . Um 
C:  Save as project . Oh , 
B:  . <laugh> 


A:  as you may have noticed I uh created separate folders because it was uh 
B:  Well uh 
C:  okay 
B:  we 
A:  tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder . I don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder , which is for now the detailed design meeting . Yeah . Then I'll move this one 
B:  made a 


D:  Oh okay . That's 
B:  prototype . We first start with 
A:  . Oh 
C:  . Hmm hmm . Agenda . <laugh> Oh , 
B:  the overall uh 
A:  no , this is just one 
B:   This is about the total 
C:  sorry .  <laugh> <other> Okay . Get up stand up 
B:  remote control 
A:  big document , so you can leave that wherever it is . <laugh> And we have a evaluation left here . Okay . Well not main documents this time . 
C:  .  just  'Kay . View 
B:  . 
C:  . Just 
B:  We made 
A:  Oh uh yes . I have it open myself I guess . Um well the detailed design meeting  


A:  Huh ? We're finally getting somewhere hopefully . Um what are we going to do ? I've opened it already . Um I'm still going to take some minutes , and if I'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ? Aren't you ? Yes , you are 
C:  example 
B:  it 
C:  colour , so uh 
D:  the 
C:  there's 
B:  green . Yeah . 
A:  . And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ? Good . And we have a correct agenda . And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice , the finance uh aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , how did we work together and what are the results , and how happy are we with those . Okay , well finance uh will be later . Now I'd like to give the word to you two . So a separate button for for text 
C:  one of 
D:  place where it's going 
B:  It's a fresh colour . 
C:  the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype . 


B:  And uh the screen light blue . Oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone 
C:  Okay ? 
A:  I just missed when I was 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> Sorry . <laugh> Oh full screen , yeah <laugh>  . 
C:  PowerPoint 
D:  up 


A:  ? Well it's  looks fancy , especially 
B:  Y you should make uh a sideways uh 
C:  <other> Now 
D:  a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we   requirements from the  of the users . My name , my job , okay . The methods . Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true 
C:  uh the single curved idea was uh 
B:  view 
D:  to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps . One means absolutely not true , seven   means true . 
B:  . It 
D:  The three important things of refa <laugh>  are uh from th 
B:  will be 
D:  of this year is  are , is the remote control fancy enough , is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to 
C:   Yeah , okay , you ge um  
B:  , I guess . 
D:  use . And then evaluation itself . Uh . So . Okay . First question . Is the design fancy enough 
C:  Yeah . The sideways view 
D:  ? Project 
B:  Oh 
D:  groups . Yeah . That's true . Also with rubber ? Yeah , okay 
B:  It it 
C:  . We're 
B:  feels like rubber , but  <laugh> Well but then when you scratch 
D:  . Yeah 
C:  getting paid . We're getting 
A:  w we 
D:  ? That's a 
A:  had about single colours , but you can also make uh a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , can't you ? Whether it looks like wood , it 
B:  it it does come off . So that's a bit  Oh we have time . <laugh> <laugh> What ? Yeah 
C:  paid . 
D:  one ? Okay . 
A:  isn't w it isn't wood but  You can make a print on rubber 
D:  Uh I have  
B:  , yeah , it's very spongy . Oh but 
A:  , can't you ? Yeah . So that's a one then , huh ? <laugh> Do you have many questions ? Oh 
C:  <laugh> Uh 
D:  <laugh> <other> 
B:  not  it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber . 
D:  The material used is spongy , 
C:  . Yeah , it's a three , because 
B:  I think it's a three 
A:  , okay well  Yeah , 
D:  that that's uh that's 
C:  you want to 
A:  but we have  We 
D:  a 
B:  . Hard but  Yeah . 
C:  make it 
A:  also  We have to get to the money . <laugh> What  spongy . Uh-huh , yeah 
C:  uh rather flexible but not too flexible , because 
D:  people . Yeah ? True ? Very true ? No , I don't think 
C:  it make it a 
B:  Let's make everything a two . Younger 
D:  very true because the 
C:  two . A 
D:  colours . We 
C:  two ? I think it's 
B:  people . It has  What did  Yeah 
D:  have the colours . Um we have the buttons is  
A:  uh a 
D:  aren't that that much . Nah , the material isn't that  So I don I think 
C:  two . I think 
D:  I think it's a three . Yeah 
B:  . Well that  it doesn't 
C:  it's two too , two too too . Well perhaps not . Well 
D:  , but I uh  Okay , okay . I think 
A:  lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially , didn't we ? What do you think ? Questions ? 
B:  . <laugh> Yeah bu but  <laugh> I think 
D:  because  yeah ? <loud sigh> In the features ? Because younger peoples are cr critical and they 
A:  Two . Uh-huh . <laugh> Dissatisfy younger 
C:  , n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that 
A:  people . Um  Yeah 
B:  they like the speech . You could call to your uh 
D:  wanted a lot of 
A:  , but those are more fancy 
B:   yeah , and the screen 
C:  , but it's for 
B:  , yeah . 
D:  that have to got up .  Two two two two two . So two , yeah . The 
C:  Yeah . Exactly 
B:  like a bug 
D:  average is a two . That is quite good in my opinion . That  Ooh . Ooh . Top . 
B:  or something . A fly , yeah . A f butterfly . Yeah 
C:  . <laugh>  <laugh> 
B:  . That's it . <laugh> Sure . 
D:  Okay . Yes . 
C:  <tongue clicks> <laugh> <laugh> Yeah . It 
D:  No , 
B:  It's good . Yeah . 
D:  it's two 
C:  i It wasn't too 
D:  . The 
B:  Yeah . Redesign . No . <laugh> Yeah . Yeah . So we're going to erase features or something 
C:  much . As well as the 
B:  . Do you have 
D:  average is 
B:  the cost or uh  
D:  two . 


A:  okay , so we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results . Okay , good . Um let's see  oh , it isn't asked to save but it did already  And this  Everything okay . Well 
D:  Yeah , 
B:  <laugh> Let's hope 
D:  I uh uh I uh saved it . <loud exhalation of air> <other> 
B:  . <laugh> We're going to 
C:  L_C_D_ screen . Whoa 
D:  <laugh>  f fifty five Euros . No . Yeah 
A:  , the next part uh might 


A:  be a little bit difficult to do in a group , but I am willing to try it . Because we are going to look at 
D:  mm yeah 
A:  the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that . <other> And um I'm not sure if 
B:  be here 
D:  , 
B:  at eight o'clock . <laugh> 
A:  I put it in the project folder .  look on that . Um and we're going to calculate the production costs , and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty , we're good , and if they're not 
C:  . <whistling> 
B:  We're goin 
A:  we're going to uh re-design , but we have to do that uh very very quick I think , yes . Um I don't know if I put the Excel sheet in the n 
B:  still going to be here at eight o'clock . <laugh> I doubt it . Perhaps we've got features that 
A:  not in the folder . I 
B:  don't exist in the Excel sheet . <laugh> <other> No , it was in my 
A:  think it's I think 
C:  Count 
D:  maybe . The microphone . <laugh> 
A:  it's still in my own documents folder . Oh shit . So  Okay , 
C:  it 
B:  uh my information , so uh  Yeah . Well , if 
C:  . 
D:  Yeah ? 
B:  it doesn't work  I want to fill it in , but uh  But you 
A:  well this is 
D:   maybe you're going scrap scrap 
A:  it . 
B:  should uh direct  The number of  We've got a battery , one or 
D:  it . No prob . Ah . Count it ? Li like write it 
C:  You got Excel to count . <laugh> Oh okay . 
B:  t two 
C:  Well I dra uh Danny , Danny , I'll do 
A:  Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in , so that I can also uh take minutes , and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions . Well we have to count some things 
B:  batteries , or not ? nee one battery , with two small batteries . Yeah . I 
D:  be  Ah , okay 
B:  would do a battery  we 
D:  , cool . Huh ? Yeah ? Oh 
A:  and we have to think about some things . But you have to fill in this column , huh ? No , uh count uh number of functions , because for every button you have to pay  and there are different screen shots , so  or different different screens , so  Yeah , but it's it's more about 
C:  that , because I draw the uh No , no 
D:  , 
B:  do . Right ? 
C:  solar cell , no no no no . No hand dynamo . <laugh> Hand  <sound imitating motor> On advanced chip . 
D:  yea yeah , you design it . Um  <other> Yeah . Solar cell . No it took a battery ? 
D:  we can make it brown , 
A:  , we have um 
D:  . Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped . Yep 
A:  you try to make 


A:  evaluation , because I think uh we have a prototype now which we can afford and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh design . Doodle . And I think 
D:  a iPod . 
A:  we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time . Let's see , we can save this 
D:  Oh . All I need 
B:  that's a bit weird . 
C:  between lines and text and the pen . 
D:  is 
B:  Oh 
C:  <whistling> 
A:  now . And move back to here . <laugh> 
B:  , now I'm  line . Yeah . No , 
C:  Huh , looks fucking 
A:  Mm-hmm . And then all green 
B:  it's weird . <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  . 
C:  boring 
D:   
B:  Bu but stressful 
A:  Okay , 
B:  . You think , 
A:  well thank you . Oh , no  . Hey , 
B:  no , my presentation isn't 
D:  mic . <loud inhale and exhale> <cough> <other> 
A:  but you can erase that 
C:  now . <laugh> Deadlines were 
A:  . Uh-oh . Right . <sound indicating frustration> And you 
B:  ready . Yeah . Yeah , you had information I didn't have and then 
C:  sometimes very 
A:  can't erase 
C:  short . But  And stressful . Yeah . Yeah 
B:  uh  
D:  Station page . I think we  it should be 
A:  this ? Hmm , strange . Okay , well uh just leave it at this and quickly save . Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation . We just did  our project evaluation . Um well , I think I can sit for that since it's almost my final slide . Um what did you think about uh the 
D:  b 
B:  Oh right . <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  it 
C:  . 
D:  would be better 
C:  <other> Yeah , but but why not work 


A:  process ? How satisfied are we ? Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . And 
C:  here together , for example ? 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . No . Yeah , you could  Yeah . I think so too 
A:  you could 
C:  Why should we be separated 
A:  ask things 
D:  if we worked a little bit together . Now we worked through each other , something he said  yeah , and you had information I also had , so some some things I had in my presentation , they already told , so  So yeah , that  I don't think that is the best 
B:  . Yeah 
A:  . And for me it sometimes was a 
B:  , but then you can work together too when  A chat would also be uh 
C:  from each other in 
B:   Well 
A:  surprise who was going to present what , huh ? And uh  Yeah . So you would say uh 
B:  , I I 
D:  way to work at  for such project . <other> Yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together 
A:  communicate during 
B:  don't really 
A:  our individual uh work . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Well , probably 
C:  those 
D:  or something , and then work separate . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah m yeah , like she told . 
C:  difference  uh different rooms ? Yeah . Huh , oh right . But the technology was uh fantastic .  Work now ? Perhaps it is e Yeah 
A:  to simulate 
B:  like the board , it 
D:  Then you 
B:  doesn't really 
D:  can work 
A:  the whole working uh process , huh , th  you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks . No . So you don't think the 
B:  work great . Sometimes I 
C:  , perhaps 
B:  think <sound indicating frustration> . It does work , but sometimes it doesn't 
D:  together too by mail or by , I dunno , chat , something , but now we're completely separated from each other . I don't think that was the best way , but  Yeah , the technology's okay . Yeah okay , but I don 
C:  it is easier to get 
A:  SMARTboard is 
B:  erase or it doesn't uh  Yeah 
C:  one of those uh dig digital pens or 
D:  I do I think becau that's 
B:  . Yeah . But  Well it is useful , but it doesn't really work all the time . Th the 
C:  so and to 
D:  because  Yeah . Yeah , like the f like a plotters or something 
C:  uh  and lay 
B:  pen doesn't  The line is a bit off . Yeah , you can 
C:  it next to that keyboard over there . So you can draw uh  see it over th on the screen . Yeah . <other> It's useful , but not m Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is 
D:  , yeah 
B:  point to 
D:  . Yep yep yep yep yep . Yeah , it is useful , but  No . Yep . 
B:  where you 
A:  is really useful or  Yeah , so it's maybe a bit 
B:  want the 
C:  d being drawn at at two or 
B:  line to be . But  Yeah . <laugh> <laugh> Yeah . I  <other> I I used it 
D:  I didn't use it at all . <laugh> I didn't 
C:  three centimetres uh below . Alright . The project uh  because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh  have , you didn't have 
B:  , it it was  you can 
A:  unnatural also . That wasn't me . Uh <laugh> so 
D:  use . 
C:  time to 
B:  use it , it's quite handy I think . Yeah , I used it to y 
C:  uh  to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation . So you used uh this uh the different PowerPoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the  Oh . 
B:  to  
C:  <cough> Wasn't me . But I didn't  I uh  I used it too , but  oh well . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah 
A:  um the means , we discussed the smart board , and what about uh this digital pen ? Yeah , well I use it as 
C:  Yeah , because it 
B:  , it did work pretty 
D:  No  yeah . It is it is 
B:  well . I don't think why you would want to use it actually , but it it does work . <laugh> 
A:  a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer , huh ? Yeah . Yeah . Okay , um 
C:  shou To make some designs , it 
B:  Yeah , and then you can show it to everybody . It doesn't really write normally . 
C:  is very easy . Yeah . But to write it 
D:   yeah , it 
C:  th yeah 
B:  It's a bit  <laugh> <laugh> Yeah . I think it was great , yeah . Yeah , but 
C:  . Yeah , it's too 
D:  is easy for  
C:  big , it's too fat . <laugh> Yeah . Right 
A:  and what 
D:  to design something and then load it in your computer . Yeah . Yeah . It's b bi little bit too big to 
C:  . Yeah 
B:  it was because we didn't uh  Yeah . <laugh> <laugh> 
D:  write . 
C:  . Not too much , not too 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . Fat document , those . Team work was okay 
B:  I thought it was good , but uh  Yeah . 
C:  too too too  . <laugh> Yeah , or the 
D:  . Only thing that we worked through , 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  about the 
C:  room 
A:  teamwork ? Yeah , well I think so too 
D:  past each other . With 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> Well . Yeah . And 
C:  for  
A:  .  we  Yeah , but that was  it 
D:  some things that was only problem , but  Yeah yeah yeah , but furthermore better . That's  <laugh> yeah 
C:  it was 
A:  was our assignment , huh ? Okay , and maybe I should walk 
B:  you get get stuff from the from the computer , but  
D:  , no prob . Ah . Yeah . 
A:  out of the room when you discuss uh this point , the leadership . <laugh> Yeah well , okay . And creativity 
B:  Yeah 
D:  Okay . Mm-hmm . Little bit uh lo yeah . 
B:  . You just sit there for ten minutes . Yeah ,  where is that 
C:  the idea 
A:  ? Well , when we 
C:  to be creative , so  You got some standard ideas 
D:  Too late 
B:  email ? 
D:   it 
A:  look at this I'd say we have been creative , huh ? But  There was room for  You did 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  in 
B:  <laugh> Oh 
C:  your head <other> and this what came out . Yeah . The information uh was sometimes uh 
A:  ? Well , I didn't 
B:  did you 
C:  a little bit too late or  Yeah . <laugh> <laugh> Was searching and searching 
D:  it it 
B:  ? Is it on there ? <laugh> Is it on there ? I 
C:  .  <laugh> No , w I didn't know  Make a r yeah . 
D:  took a lot of time before you got your ema yeah . I played I think seven times Solitaire something . Wha Oh right 
B:  didn't find the  didn't look but uh  <laugh> <other>  I didn't look , but  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  , it is there . No , I I 
B:  I 
C:  No 
B:  got like one email after ten minutes or something . <laugh> That's what we said . <laugh> And it  not a lot uh  No , the first one . I didn't know uh 
A:  have time for that . At some times I  Sometimes I 
D:  never 
A:  received like like five emails at at one moment , and then  <laugh> I even got spam . <laugh> 
D:  got that . I always  N 
C:  stepping on the table and then 
D:  yeah . <laugh> <other> So does this  I think lik 
C:  looking 
B:   nee . And I didn't know what to do for 
A:  Or 
D:  oh and information 
A:  something like that . <laugh> And I was working and working and 
B:  the 
C:  at 
D:  was a 
B:  first ten minutes before we got 
D:  bit low I think , sometimes , in in in in the beginning I didn't understand what what to do . Yeah , like I  with with the remote  and I 
B:  here , so I went , right . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Just looking at the screen and uh 
C:  the internet page . <laugh> <imitative sound> No 
D:  never new we have t we had to uh  yeah made a made a rec a remote control . Yeah , so  So , yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
C:  . Yeah , more information 
B:   <laugh> Yeah , an Yeah , that will be handy . <laugh> Yeah . Yea uh so tha actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ 
D:  Faster . Yeah . 
C:  about the costs . First of all I didn't think uh that we were able 
A:  work <laugh> Okay , well um  but after all we can say uh we are satisfied , but it it could've been uh better . When we get uh  when we have  we would have gotten uh more information . Yeah . Yeah , that was a 
C:  to make an L_C_D_ 
D:  Yeah , it only costs four units . Uh <loud inhale> 
B:  screen , when 
C:  screen uh  first point , but uh 
D:  yeah . 
B:  you look at that . Yeah . 
C:  it was possible uh  uh , yeah . Yeah . Uh . Faster laptop . Uh . They were they were just fine . Uh . Right . Yeah . Mm 
B:  <laugh> Uh , 
D:  <loud inhale> Um  Yeah . Nothing . I think we got it 
B:  I dunno . Think that's about it . Hmm . Heavier um  less heavy laptops . <laugh> Yeah . But that's not really uh  Yeah . Yeah , everything worked . Yeah 
A:  bit mean to put it in the end . And uh what were the other points to to improve this whole process ? Yeah , they're pretty heavy . And 
C:  . Yeah 
D:  already 
B:  , but it's just the 
D:  . Yeah . <laugh> And furthermore 
B:  the off hours between that you will work alone . Then it pops up  pop up 
D:  the the the network was okay . 
A:  so more time uh w might 
D:  Everything you loaded 
C:  , sure . Oh thank you . Bling . <laugh> You're fired . Mm 
B:  screen came . Five minutes in 
D:  was also av available there . So  Yeah . Yeah , but that 
B:  the meeting 
C:  . You 
B:  . No . <laugh> Huh 
D:   It's now half 
C:  cannot  
A:  have improved the the quality of work , is what you say . Okay . Okay , so more time during the 
D:  past four 
C:  you can 
D:   half past three , so  Yeah , okay . Yeah , okay . Mm-hm . Mm . 
B:  . You did ? Well  Oh , right . Well  <laugh> <laugh> Yeah .

D:  No prob . Mm-hmm . I 
C:  save it 


A:  individual work phases . Um okay well uh I just got my warning for the last five minutes , so I'll move on to I guess my last slide , yes , which is the closing . Well uh , we managed , but we did it very quickly . I don't know if that's the best way to  when it isn't  is it  when it is too expensive to quickly re-arrange it and say , okay , this is it , but we had to do it , huh , because we have to have a design , and that is within the budget . And we evaluated . Maybe we should re-evaluate uh the product , but we did that before , and we also evaluated the project . And I think uh everybody's uh very happy . At least I am , with the results , so uh celebration , well , for the three of you , because uh I have to write the final report now . But uh <laugh> well , thank you very much for your co-operation , and I had a very nice day so far . <laugh> Okay . <other> Um  Yeah I have t

B:  Yeah , but it's  it isn't 
C:  J_ PEG J_ PEG . No 
A:  I think we 
D:  PEG ? No . <sound imitating an explosion> 
B:  a picture or , well , is it ? No , isn't possible . 
A:  also have to go to our own rooms again , but um  well I at least . But maybe you can try uh to make a screen shot of this , so I can try to include it in the final report . Yeah , maybe .  wants to 
B:  But you can 
C:  . <laugh> 
B:  make a 


B:  screen shot , I think . 
C:  No . Okay . <laugh> In about five
