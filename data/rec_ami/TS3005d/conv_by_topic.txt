A:  . Um 
C:  Save as project . Oh , 
B:  . <laugh> 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  as you may have noticed I uh created separate folders because it was uh 
B:  Well uh 
C:  okay 
B:  we 
A:  tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder . I don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder , which is for now the detailed design meeting . Yeah . Then I'll move this one 
B:  made a 
topic_description:	opening_None


D:  Oh okay . That's 
B:  prototype . We first start with 
A:  . Oh 
C:  . Hmm hmm . Agenda . <laugh> Oh , 
B:  the overall uh 
A:  no , this is just one 
B:   This is about the total 
C:  sorry .  <laugh> <other> Okay . Get up stand up 
B:  remote control 
A:  big document , so you can leave that wherever it is . <laugh> And we have a evaluation left here . Okay . Well not main documents this time . 
C:  .  just  'Kay . View 
B:  . 
C:  . Just 
B:  We made 
A:  Oh uh yes . I have it open myself I guess . Um well the detailed design meeting  
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  Huh ? We're finally getting somewhere hopefully . Um what are we going to do ? I've opened it already . Um I'm still going to take some minutes , and if I'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ? Aren't you ? Yes , you are 
C:  example 
B:  it 
C:  colour , so uh 
D:  the 
C:  there's 
B:  green . Yeah . 
A:  . And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ? Good . And we have a correct agenda . And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice , the finance uh aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , how did we work together and what are the results , and how happy are we with those . Okay , well finance uh will be later . Now I'd like to give the word to you two . So a separate button for for text 
C:  one of 
D:  place where it's going 
B:  It's a fresh colour . 
C:  the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype . 
topic_description:	opening_None


B:  And uh the screen light blue . Oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone 
C:  Okay ? 
A:  I just missed when I was 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> Sorry . <laugh> Oh full screen , yeah <laugh>  . 
C:  PowerPoint 
D:  up 
topic_description:	presentation of prototype(s)_None


B:  on the on the sides here under . And the R_ and R_ 
C:   yeah , just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible . Uh well 
B:  logo , it just says R_ and R_ now , but uh  Any questions so far ? <laugh> Yeah . Yeah . Oh y you  perhaps you should make it a bit big , so people know it's there and uh  Uh  Hmm . You 
C:  , it's 
B:  push the scroll button and it's 
D:  to be , 
C:  an idea in a  so . Do not forget it . To function it it doesn't really have 
B:  claps out 
D:  not the size .  Mm-hmm . Yeah , okay . Of course . Mm . Mm 
C:  to be sm uh big of course . The microphone could 
B:  if there's a  <laugh> Remote settings , et cetera . Yeah . Yeah . And you could also touch it so that 
C:  be just a minor uh 
B:  it comes 
D:  , th 
C:  hole uh on the left uh button . Okay um <other> we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work . Uh using the scroll button on sides 
D:  yeah . Small . <laugh> <laugh> Shit 
B:  out , 
D:  . 'Kay .  Evaluation . 'Kay , my 
C:  uh y uh I uh um   Yeah , you push the scroll button and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get 
B:  and and use the the the scroll thing as a  with your fingers 
C:  uh you get the options uh becoming available . For example uh T_V_ settings , uh remote settings , et cetera . So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button , uh as you can see  oh , it's here , just push it in , uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible . Um  Yeah , that's c Yeah . Indeed . Okay , um it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small 
B:  . Yes . Yeah . Yeah . Perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah . Yeah . Forgot . <laugh> Uh well , this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ 
C:  uh menu , uh the options menu uh 
B:  screen . 
C:  becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used uh  which should still be used and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu , but in uh  Yes . In an apart uh  In a separate button , yeah . <laugh> A sign , yeah , just like  Okay , indeed . Okay , we 
B:  Uh the 
A:  , okay . Mm-hmm . Thank you . Looks good 
C:  can uh modify that later . Okay . 
B:  numbers , which is pretty straight forward . We put ano an an 
C:  Would you like to make any comments about next uh  Previous page , yeah , indeed . Oh my God . <laugh> <other> <laugh> It's quite large . Okay . You can see 
B:  extra button in . We can erase it , but  It's the button where you can switch channels .  just when you are one and you go to two , you can  or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button . Yeah , that one , yeah . It has a name . And uh uh we put that in , I thought it would be handy there . Uh this the one number or two numbers button . Below that , the page and the sound . And uh in the middle the the mute . Uh battery indicator . <laugh> It's <laugh> it's a bit big . <laugh> And this is the uh the on off uh knop , the stand by uh knop . Or at least it should look 
C:  very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't 
B:  like it . And the options uh of teletext . Huh . Yeah . Well this about it , I think . Yeah . I will put it back on 
C:  uh taking uh much uh  uh 
D:  task 
B:  the  <laugh> on the nice green . That's the logo of the  Yeah . 
C:  it's taking much part of the screen , so it's very uh  when you uh <other> when you use it , doesn't uh become irritating to see . 'Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu . 'Cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down , so  Okay . Huh . <loud exhale>  Full screen . 
B:  It's th 
C:  Alright . <laugh> Huh . My name , my job . <laugh> <laugh> Sorry 
A:  . And 
B:  th right now it's only R_ R_ , but uh 
C:  , you used the 
B:   <laugh> 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  typing  The R_R_ stands for ? Logo , okay . <laugh> Okay well 
C:   
B:  <laugh> Right . Yeah . <laugh> <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . Well  <laugh> Yeah . It uh  oh it's 
A:   <laugh> I would have recognised it if it 
D:  was 
C:   What ? 
A:  were the right colours of course . <laugh> Okay , the evaluation criteria , huh 
D:  this time 
B:  in the background . Oh . 
C:  <laugh> Bling . 
D:  to put 
topic_description:	discussion_None


A:  ? Well it's  looks fancy , especially 
B:  Y you should make uh a sideways uh 
C:  <other> Now 
D:  a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we   requirements from the  of the users . My name , my job , okay . The methods . Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true 
C:  uh the single curved idea was uh 
B:  view 
D:  to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps . One means absolutely not true , seven   means true . 
B:  . It 
D:  The three important things of refa <laugh>  are uh from th 
B:  will be 
D:  of this year is  are , is the remote control fancy enough , is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to 
C:   Yeah , okay , you ge um  
B:  , I guess . 
D:  use . And then evaluation itself . Uh . So . Okay . First question . Is the design fancy enough 
C:  Yeah . The sideways view 
D:  ? Project 
B:  Oh 
D:  groups . Yeah . That's true . Also with rubber ? Yeah , okay 
B:  It it 
C:  . We're 
B:  feels like rubber , but  <laugh> Well but then when you scratch 
D:  . Yeah 
C:  getting paid . We're getting 
A:  w we 
D:  ? That's a 
A:  had about single colours , but you can also make uh a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , can't you ? Whether it looks like wood , it 
B:  it it does come off . So that's a bit  Oh we have time . <laugh> <laugh> What ? Yeah 
C:  paid . 
D:  one ? Okay . 
A:  isn't w it isn't wood but  You can make a print on rubber 
D:  Uh I have  
B:  , yeah , it's very spongy . Oh but 
A:  , can't you ? Yeah . So that's a one then , huh ? <laugh> Do you have many questions ? Oh 
C:  <laugh> Uh 
D:  <laugh> <other> 
B:  not  it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber . 
D:  The material used is spongy , 
C:  . Yeah , it's a three , because 
B:  I think it's a three 
A:  , okay well  Yeah , 
D:  that that's uh that's 
C:  you want to 
A:  but we have  We 
D:  a 
B:  . Hard but  Yeah . 
C:  make it 
A:  also  We have to get to the money . <laugh> What  spongy . Uh-huh , yeah 
C:  uh rather flexible but not too flexible , because 
D:  people . Yeah ? True ? Very true ? No , I don't think 
C:  it make it a 
B:  Let's make everything a two . Younger 
D:  very true because the 
C:  two . A 
D:  colours . We 
C:  two ? I think it's 
B:  people . It has  What did  Yeah 
D:  have the colours . Um we have the buttons is  
A:  uh a 
D:  aren't that that much . Nah , the material isn't that  So I don I think 
C:  two . I think 
D:  I think it's a three . Yeah 
B:  . Well that  it doesn't 
C:  it's two too , two too too . Well perhaps not . Well 
D:  , but I uh  Okay , okay . I think 
A:  lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially , didn't we ? What do you think ? Questions ? 
B:  . <laugh> Yeah bu but  <laugh> I think 
D:  because  yeah ? <loud sigh> In the features ? Because younger peoples are cr critical and they 
A:  Two . Uh-huh . <laugh> Dissatisfy younger 
C:  , n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that 
A:  people . Um  Yeah 
B:  they like the speech . You could call to your uh 
D:  wanted a lot of 
A:  , but those are more fancy 
B:   yeah , and the screen 
C:  , but it's for 
B:  , yeah . 
D:  that have to got up .  Two two two two two . So two , yeah . The 
C:  Yeah . Exactly 
B:  like a bug 
D:  average is a two . That is quite good in my opinion . That  Ooh . Ooh . Top . 
B:  or something . A fly , yeah . A f butterfly . Yeah 
C:  . <laugh>  <laugh> 
B:  . That's it . <laugh> Sure . 
D:  Okay . Yes . 
C:  <tongue clicks> <laugh> <laugh> Yeah . It 
D:  No , 
B:  It's good . Yeah . 
D:  it's two 
C:  i It wasn't too 
D:  . The 
B:  Yeah . Redesign . No . <laugh> Yeah . Yeah . So we're going to erase features or something 
C:  much . As well as the 
B:  . Do you have 
D:  average is 
B:  the cost or uh  
D:  two . 
topic_description:	evaluation of prototype(s)_None


D:  Manager , what do you think ? But does it  
B:  , we can  
D:  Yeah . <laugh>  <laugh> Think . Yeah 
A:  with the green colour . And the the curves which we decided , huh ? Only what happened to the single curve 
B:  Oh g <laugh> 
D:  , yeah , you can . 
A:  we spoke about last meeting ? <laugh> Well it might work one time 
C:  , uh that that that ma Ho not that pen 
B:  I would <laugh>  smart board . <laugh> Uh can I 
C:  . <laugh> Not that pen . <laugh> <other> 
B:  draw here or uh  Ooh . So it would 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> Suppose so . Ah . Oh my God , 
B:  be uh something like this from the side , but with a 
C:  it works . Yeah , that's the single curve indeed . Yep . 
D:  Isn't going to 
B:  bit of uh curve here , right ? Yeah . So if you v flip it like this . 
A:  , huh . <laugh> Okay . Okay , but we have 
C:  That's not very  
D:  be a 
B:  Here's  
C:  i it's also uh very handy if you make 
D:  little bit heavy at the top ? 
B:  yeah . Yeah . So you just make the back of this part a bit bigger , so that it lays a bit 
C:  a side curve way to make the the 
B:  o <laugh> Yeah , that's a bit of problem maybe . 
C:  remote control 
A:  to rate 
B:  Yeah . I think 
C:  very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom . Uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes uh in some uh space , and the batteries can be located over there , so uh  Yeah .  No . Yeah . Okay , indeed . Yeah . I think so . It's pretty fancy .  you 
B:  yeah , the battery should be in here , because it's just nothing , so if you could  Yeah . 'Cause 
C:  get th 
D:  <laugh> With two batteries , the whole print plate and t and 
C:  Yeah 
D:  top 
B:  otherwise I think i I think it does . I 
C:  .  
D:  , and if you're holding it quite a lot I think  Yeah . Yeah , we have to rate . Is it fancy 
B:  if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it . Yeah . I think it does . 
C:   It's 
D:  enough ? 
C:  true , it's a one . 
B:  Yeah . I don't know whether older 
A:  uh these things now ? Okay . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Well I think 
D:  True is one , false is seven . So fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people . I think  <other> Yeah , I have to agree , all 
B:  people will use it , but  I would make it a two or something . Yeah . Huh ? Alright , 
C:  <laugh> Very fancy . <other> It's very true 
D:  the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now , it's only design . And the design . So  A two ? Yeah , I 
C:  , because we designed 
B:  it's a 
A:  uh especially 
B:  one . <laugh> Oh it's 
A:  because of 
D:  n used  I 
A:  the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also . Very new thing . Well  Fancy 
C:  it to 
B:  a one . <laugh> Yeah . But it's a one uh  Maybe uh 
A:   the old people will . 
D:  wouldn I 
A:  No , it's a two . <laugh> 
B:   Yeah . Well they think it's very true 
C:  be 
D:  should use that 
B:  , but 
C:  very fancy , so  It's very fancy , I think . 
B:  uh  <other> Yeah , but  We should perhaps  That not . Yeah 
A:  Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves , huh ? Well I'd say two on a scale 
D:  one , but it doesn't  Okay , no it's two ? True is a one . Very 
B:  . <laugh> 
C:  Have 
B:  I think it is , because it has an 
D:  true , is it very true or isn't that true ? Yeah , I think two . That's fancy enough . Then ? 
B:  L_C_D_ screen 
A:   No , okay well , that's true 
B:  , a mi microphone . It's from rubber . Yeah 
C:  you ever seen a remote control like this ? No , okay , so so 
D:  Okay . Let's give it a 
B:  . <laugh> <other> It's a 
C:  it's fancy . Yeah . <laugh> And uh uh the scroll is rubber , so s Eno 
B:  one I think . 
A:  . <laugh> Okay , one two . That doesn't 
C:  enough to  I think .  <other> Huh 
D:  two . Is it 
B:  Yeah , because they're right 
D:  innovative ? 
A:  matter that much , so make it a one . <laugh> Yeah m Yeah , and you use 
B:  on 
C:  . With the 
D:  Enough . We have for the search function 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


D:  . The scroller a 
B:  your screen . So you can use the b the the arrows . They're right on 
D:  bit  
A:  these buttons 
C:  ones  <other> Yeah . Take a harder look , 
D:  I think it's it's a one yeah 
B:  your screen , so I don't know 
D:  . True . Also huh uh-huh  the buttons , are they easy 
C:  yeah , sure . It's easier than 
B:  where you'd search . Yeah . Well 
C:  the 
D:  to find 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


D:  ? That was a big requirement of the old people . Are all the buttons easy to find ? Not only this buttons 
C:  regular 
B:  , I think they are . The options are it  uh little bit harder , but if you 
C:  uh remote 
B:  touch the options then it's uh  No they're not , but they're they're they are 
C:  control . Yeah . 
D:  , all the buttons . I think th it's easy t Yeah , I think this is 
C:  Yeah 
B:  easy to find . Oh . Yeah . I would say yeah . Yeah . Yeah , you can make it a two . Yeah , but 
C:  , they are a lot easier to find than uh th 
D:  easy now . I 
C:  than on the regular remote controls where you have 
D:  think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to to handle . True . I would rate it a  Yeah 
A:  the most , huh ? So  So which  So which number are 
C:  to uh 
B:  you don't have t have to use the button on the right . 
D:  , okay , that's true , that's true . But that's 
C:  find out what  which sign or icon means on uh every button . So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most  Yeah . I think it's uh it's a two , at least . It's not perfect , but  A three ? And why is 
B:  You can 
D:  that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen , you can have text 
B:  touch it 
A:  we going to 
D:  . Yeah . <other> I think it's a three . I personally think 
A:  fill in ? A two , yeah ? Two , 
B:  . Yeah . You you 
C:  that ? It said bo both the options . Yeah . 
B:  can touch options . Yeah . You can touch options and 
A:  three and  what do you think ? Okay , so we have two , 
D:  , because 
C:  A two , a two . 
D:  I d I don't think i maybe 
C:  Uh the next question the next question . 
A:  two , three . A two , okay , because we 
D:  it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . I I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy . You can touch it . Yeah , okay , but you have 
B:  it's comes out . <laugh> The uh the um  Below . <laugh> <laugh> <laugh> It's different . For young people I think 
D:  y then you have here 
C:  Oh my God . <laugh> Yeah , 
B:  it's easy to use . Yeah 
D:  s written option on here , the teletext button , right ? Okay , then okay , good . Then I think also two , yeah . Yep . <other> It's easy to use , as well for younger 
B:  . I 
C:  I was 
B:  think it's  <laugh> In the entire mankind . 
A:  have to  It's the box below it , huh 
D:  as elderl 
C:   uh  Yeah . I 
B:  Yeah . Yeah , but uh  Yeah 
A:  ? Otherwise we have two results in one 
C:  think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured 
D:  elderly 
B:  , but 
A:  question . Okay , next question .  Okay 
B:  they they don't want 
C:  . 
A:  , you're very enthusiastic about 
D:  people . Young means sixteen to forty years . And elderly from forty eight 
B:  the uh extra options , right ? So  Yeah 
A:  your 
D:  to their death . Also if you're sixty years old  Also Yeah , as well 
C:  <laugh> Yeah , but because it has the regular 
B:  , okay , but so they 
C:  uh controls , li uh as you can see in the screen now , and uh you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen . So it's t I think it's really easy to 
B:  could  Uh I think it 
A:  own design , huh ? As well for the for the older 
D:  as your  if you're fif sixty 
C:  use . You want these options to  Uh sure . Perhaps that is one of the most uh  Uh because a lot of <other>  Channel one , channel 
B:  is . 
D:  years 
A:  people ? And would it be easy for them 
D:  old , you're holding one of those things in your hand  No , but we're going to th make this f for a 
C:  four , yeah 
B:  If they read a manual . <laugh> Yeah , alright . <laugh> Because it it's not it's not it's it's not 
D:  all kind of people , so it it it has to be  <laugh> If you read the manual ,  always . So  
A:  to use the speech recognition ? Because that might  Yeah . Okay 
B:  uh difficult . You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition , then you say the 
A:  , well  M maybe that's the most user friendly 
D:  Also two ? Not a seven for this  ? 
C:  . <sound indicating concordance> Yeah , I think it does . 
B:  question and the answer . And 
A:  and easy to use . Yeah , well maybe that would make 
B:  that's everything it does , the speech recognition . Yeah . I think it would make it uh  I would make it two . Yeah . <laugh> <sound indicating distaste> Three ? Oh . You ? Oh . Well  Two and a half . <laugh> 
C:  Because all the people who can't uh  Uh a two . Sure , two . 
A:  it even more easy to use for them . I'd say three . Okay , so 
B:  Three ? No . <laugh> No . But um I 
C:  Oh . <expulsion of air> <laugh> Two . <laugh> Give me more . No . That's definitely 
D:  I would 
B:  mean , that's definitely one . 
D:  also say three . <laugh> Remotes overwhelmed with buttons . 
B:  Oh nee 
C:  our uh  A false , yeah . Yeah , 
B:  , oh seven is 
A:  we have three three 
D:  No , that that's that's  
C:  indeed . 
B:  it ? It is 
A:  two two or  So what are we going to do 
C:  <other>  
B:  . Yeah , uh 
A:  ? <laugh> Okay , a three , I see . Uh  <laugh> Another question . No . Yeah . 
B:  the remote score . It's not overwhelmed . Yeah . Yep 
D:  yeah 
C:  Yeah , is optional . 
A:  Yeah , but 
D:  . Tha that's a one 
B:  . Yes 
C:  Huh . 
A:  I think 
D:  , I think , that's definitely a one . No ? Oh yeah . Yeah , I think isn't , this 
B:  . 'Cause we make them in different colours , 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , it 
B:  so that they uh  Yeah . That it that it looks like wood , like something , 
D:  has to be something like 
C:  is it is harder to 
A:  you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results , so  Okay , a one , because we 
D:  isn't overwhelmed . True . Remote control has uh colours that different  that meet 
B:  yeah . Uh I think you 
C:  to like  Geez 
D:  different target 
A:  designed for that , huh ? Yeah . Yeah , and I though 
B:  can . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


D:  one , that's m rubber . Yeah , I th think it's not the most spongy thing . 
B:  You can <laugh> 
A:  . Yeah , so 
B:  break it . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Y yeah , you could you could call it . Yeah , y you can 
C:  it has 
D:  Yeah . Remote control is hard to lose . Y you can't 
B:  lose it , but it isn't 
C:  a L_C_D_ screen . <laugh> Hard to lose , yeah it sh and it's easy to find . Isn't hard to lose . Isn't hard to lose , 
D:  you can't 
A:  isn't hard to lose 
B:  hard to lose . Two . That it's hard to lose ? Yeah , it 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


D:  lose it if you're sixty years old 
C:  yeah . <sound imitating completion of check-boxes> Yeah , this this is hard to lose . This 
B:  it is  there's the  it's a six , 
D:  . If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh  set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it . It isn't hard , no . I think I think this is 
B:  you think ? <laugh> So it's a two . Yeah , you can lose it 
D:  a two , personally . No . Isn't hard to lose . Yeah . You can't lose 
B:  , so I don't   you can make it a three I   It does have an  a built in function . 
D:  it . 
C:  <other>  Two , yeah 
A:  you . <laugh> Yeah , but a har A hard 
C:  . And most all because of the option 
D:  Or if you're you're sixty 
B:  Nee . Hard to lose . Oh right . It is hard to lose . Yeah , so then this is  it is almost true

D:  features on this thing . L_C_D_ screen and scroll . I I think they'll be quite met 
B:  Right , that that that  those are 
C:  a remote control I think it i <other> it would satisfy those needs . Yeah , the speech possibility , the colours . Scroll options , yeah . Yeah . The easy volume up button . Remote  younger people usually use the remote control to 
B:  features . No , aren't the features  the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature , and that you can change the volume is 
D:  with their expectations . No 
C:  put on the volume . 
D:  . It's three features , basically , the L_C_D_  touch 
A:  functions , not not really many features or something . It has relatively few features , with 
B:  feature , and that you can change the options of 
D:  screen is 
A:   Yeah . Ours had other features with 
D:  feature . The microphone is a feature . Yeah , okay . I think 
C:  <laugh> Turn 
D:   yeah , and then you 
B:  the remote , uh uh something like that . Yeah . Those are features . <laugh> Enough features ? Yeah . I think two or three . Yeah . Yeah uh a two a two . <laugh> Just another two . <laugh> We like two . <laugh> 
A:   Okay 
D:  have the audio settings 
A:  , you think one , what 
D:  , channel setting , video settings . <laugh> Yeah yeah . So I've chos I shou I think it's 
C:  uh turn up the volume . 
B:  Yeah , there's R_ 
C:  Two . One two three . <laugh> Right . Uh . Okay , true , yeah . <other> I think it's easier to 
D:  it's it's a one . Personally , yeah . I think once you've  'cause you have 
B:  and R_ in front 
D:  the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features , audio features , the  you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll thing extra . Make it make it a two . Or make it uh a 
B:  . <laugh> 
A:  do you think ? You .  three , yeah . 
B:  Uh it's not the colour , 
A:  I'd say three , so two it is then or  <laugh> Yeah . Yep . Yeah . Yeah 
C:  use than 
B:  so maybe you should make two , but it has R_ and R_ . Yeah . Yeah , but not 
D:  fucking two . You can see the 
C:  a regular remote control , 
D:  remote control is  R_ and R_ .  Has  oh yeah , do did have  nah y 
C:  because when 
B:  R_ and R_ yellow I think . One d on i it's the colours and the  I think it is , but I don't know what you think . 
C:  you push 
A:  , maybe maybe two 
D:  you have the black one . And we'll probably make also a yellow one . Maybe two . X_ marks spot . <other> And the menu is 
B:  <laugh> And you can navigate easier , because wi with the  you 
A:  . Well m th but the logo is on on the front , so  a two , yeah , that's  <laugh> Oh , well that's that's pretty 
D:  avail that is 
C:  on the options menu , you 
B:  have to push the the the arrows and  with 
D:  available is easy to use . <loud inhalation of air> Yeah , tha that's so true . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah 
B:  a normal T_V_ uh remote . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Let's make a 
C:  get the the the various options uh entirely explained . Entirely explained . Instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button . Yeah , you can navigate . Uh . You're 
D:  , uh  I think that wou that would 
A:  good 
B:  different 
C:  not satisfied , okay . Let's start over again then . <laugh> <other> <other> 
D:  be quite hard to learn to 
B:  remote . Well  Menu . A two ? <laugh> We only have twos . <laugh> Uh just twos . One three and a few ones . Two 
C:  <laugh> A two . Oh yeah , I 
D:  use it . No , I'm not not convinc . <loud inhalation of air> Let's go th for <loud inhalation of air>    I think it would be a t yeah , two . Now lower . <laugh> So okay , we have one three , a one , that 
C:  think so . Yeah . And three . The average . <laugh> Yeah 
B:  threes . We m mostly have twos , so it's pretty good 
C:  , 
B:  . Yeah 
C:  I 
B:  . Yeah . I think so too . We can 
C:  think so . Save 
A:  , huh ? That was your evaluation uh show , 
C:  . <laugh>  It's a fly . Oh m 
B:  be happy . <laugh> Yeah . What is it ? It's 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  okay , so we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results . Okay , good . Um let's see  oh , it isn't asked to save but it did already  And this  Everything okay . Well 
D:  Yeah , 
B:  <laugh> Let's hope 
D:  I uh uh I uh saved it . <loud exhalation of air> <other> 
B:  . <laugh> We're going to 
C:  L_C_D_ screen . Whoa 
D:  <laugh>  f fifty five Euros . No . Yeah 
A:  , the next part uh might 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  be a little bit difficult to do in a group , but I am willing to try it . Because we are going to look at 
D:  mm yeah 
A:  the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that . <other> And um I'm not sure if 
B:  be here 
D:  , 
B:  at eight o'clock . <laugh> 
A:  I put it in the project folder .  look on that . Um and we're going to calculate the production costs , and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty , we're good , and if they're not 
C:  . <whistling> 
B:  We're goin 
A:  we're going to uh re-design , but we have to do that uh very very quick I think , yes . Um I don't know if I put the Excel sheet in the n 
B:  still going to be here at eight o'clock . <laugh> I doubt it . Perhaps we've got features that 
A:  not in the folder . I 
B:  don't exist in the Excel sheet . <laugh> <other> No , it was in my 
A:  think it's I think 
C:  Count 
D:  maybe . The microphone . <laugh> 
A:  it's still in my own documents folder . Oh shit . So  Okay , 
C:  it 
B:  uh my information , so uh  Yeah . Well , if 
C:  . 
D:  Yeah ? 
B:  it doesn't work  I want to fill it in , but uh  But you 
A:  well this is 
D:   maybe you're going scrap scrap 
A:  it . 
B:  should uh direct  The number of  We've got a battery , one or 
D:  it . No prob . Ah . Count it ? Li like write it 
C:  You got Excel to count . <laugh> Oh okay . 
B:  t two 
C:  Well I dra uh Danny , Danny , I'll do 
A:  Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in , so that I can also uh take minutes , and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions . Well we have to count some things 
B:  batteries , or not ? nee one battery , with two small batteries . Yeah . I 
D:  be  Ah , okay 
B:  would do a battery  we 
D:  , cool . Huh ? Yeah ? Oh 
A:  and we have to think about some things . But you have to fill in this column , huh ? No , uh count uh number of functions , because for every button you have to pay  and there are different screen shots , so  or different different screens , so  Yeah , but it's it's more about 
C:  that , because I draw the uh No , no 
D:  , 
B:  do . Right ? 
C:  solar cell , no no no no . No hand dynamo . <laugh> Hand  <sound imitating motor> On advanced chip . 
D:  yea yeah , you design it . Um  <other> Yeah . Solar cell . No it took a battery ? 
D:  we can make it brown , 
A:  , we have um 
D:  . Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped . Yep 
A:  you try to make 
topic_description:	costing_None


B:  A battery . One battery , right ? <laugh> Electronics , simple chip  advanced chip , right ? Yeah , so this 
D:  Yeah . We 
A:  the energy source , huh ? Do you use a hand dynamo , a battery , kinetic or solar cells ? We'll wait . Yeah . I'll just 
B:  one and this one . Uh we ha we have um single  what ? Are we ? Oh yay . 
D:  have  No , we have sample speaker . 
A:  fill it in 
C:  Yeah , yeah . Single nee single curved . Double curved 
A:  . Um 
C:  was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional 
D:  But b 
B:  <laugh> The single . Oh the the  it's not going 
D:  al but we also have sample speaker , do Oh , we already on nine . We have double curved . 
C:  . But it isn't three dimensional , it 
B:  to work uh people . We have rubber . Thirteen ? With a scroll wheel , right ? Is he integrated ? No , eh 
D:  Single . This one is  <other> This one is curved like 
B:  ? I don't know 
C:  isn't curved in a l No no no , single curved is like this . Uh that's the only curve you made , not th uh curved like 
D:  this , right . It's curved like 
B:  . Oh yeah , right , we want it to  it's not it's not  
D:  this . Yeah , bu what  Oh , but we have curves like 
A:  rubber indeed ? Yeah , I 
C:  that . That's uh  Huh ? Yeah . Yeah , we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button , because when you push it and you w 
A:  think that will be 
D:  it and it . There are two curves , right ? Oh , okay I understand , I understand . Rubber . Push button . No , we don't have push button . L_C_D_ 
B:  no . 
C:  it won't 
B:  <laugh> Yep . Fifteen , oh , too bad . <laugh> Oh but with special 
C:  just pu 
B:  colour we have . 
D:  display . Eighteen and a half , damn . We have 
C:  uh makes possible to s Not going to work ? Okay . Okay um  But now button supplements . We don't got the button supplements . Damn 
B:  A special form , right ? Oh , we don't have any buttons , so  Yeah , we need to uh No , uh we have fifteen 
D:  to lower it 
C:  . Okay . <whistling> Nah . We could lose the 
B:  and  oh , right . <sound indicating displeasure> We could lose the curve . Yeah 
C:  scroll wheel . You could make it just a regular scroll wheel 
B:  , I would lose the curve . But you can't push it , so you have 
D:  with six points . Twelve and half . We could use  I think we should 
C:  . Yeah 
B:  to tap . Yeah , alright . So normal scroll wheel ? And 
C:  , if 
D:  scrap the sample speaker 
C:  you 
B:  I think we should lose the 
C:  can't push 
D:  . It's four pri 
B:  curve . Yeah , but if you  
C:  it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down 
B:  would i it is a new feature , it it's something special 
C:  with the d with uh <sound imitating being tongue-tied> with uh the button . Normal scroll wheel . Lose <other>  Okay , so we don't exactly need the single  We don't need a curve . 
B:  . No , the curve doesn't really  No 
A:  our best bet . And what did you change ? You 
C:  'S possible to lose 
B:  , then it will  won't uh stand up 
D:  it four units . But w d wha Curved then it will be square . Was 
C:  curve . Okay 
B:  from the table . Then it would just  Yeah . So  We would lose this one ? 
C:  . <other> Yeah , that's meant with scr uh with s curve . The curve is uh in a dimension . If 
D:  that  does that 
B:  Yeah , we could s yeah , 
D:  mean to it , single curve ? 
B:  a bit . Sixteen point three . So we still  Could could we do it on a regular 
C:  you make it a flat one , s n it's no curve , you got no curves . Yeah , okay . No , two . Oh , okay , indeed . Is it possible to make  <laugh> No . The sample speaker is 
D:  Okay . Yeah , but tha that that only is one . 
B:  chip on 
D:  No , 
B:  print or something ? No ? Ma y 
D:  one . So we don't  Yeah , we also 
B:  you just can't do that , or uh  We 
C:  two d wait , 
D:  have to  No 
B:  changed th Yeah , 
C:  f s four points . Yeah 
D:  , otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen . Single curved 
B:  and the single curved 
C:  , uh becau uh when you lose 
B:  to uncurved . No . Yeah , but it's t Yeah , but it 
D:  . Flat . Yeah , so that does doesn't doesn't 
B:  is uh it it is a new feature , it is something special 
C:  the  
A:  changed the uh scroll wheel and  Oh , but it's just one point 
B:  . I don't know . Yeah , that's difficult . <laugh> <laugh> 
D:  that mu I think  
A:  , so maybe you should should 
D:  Scrap sample speaker ? That that's uh  Yes , four points 
A:  uh  Yeah , you should you should drop 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  . Yeah , but what what else what 
A:  the speech recognition . And then you can keep the curve 
C:  <other> Yeah . <laugh> No , that's  no . Make it w 
B:  <laugh> Uh . <laugh> We 
D:  else uh do you want 
B:  could make it titanium instead of rubber . Oh . Oh can I ask something ? What is 
A:  . Or can't you ? Or make it on a hand dynamo 
C:  uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote 
D:  to scrap ? F You have to  we have to scrap four points . Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? Yeah , it 
C:  control 
B:  special colour ? Is that the wood uh wood uh 
C:  of wood 
A:  , but <laugh> I don't think that will work . Yeah , mm-hmm . Yeah , but 
B:   this , we 
C:  ? 
D:  it i Yeah , it also  uh it 
C:  <laugh> You don't make a remote control of  Ah . It isn't . What ? To knock the sample speaker , yeah 
B:  have to have that one too ? Th then we still have 
C:  . And sample sensor . But m yeah , course , 
D:  also takes one point less . Yeah . I think it is . Yeah . Yeah . Sample 
A:  uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed , yes ? Yeah , but it's only a half 
B:  too much if we use the uh  Yeah , we we scrap 
D:  speaker . 
B:  that one ? See , a po three . <laugh> We need point three . <laugh> Uh it's 
D:  Yeah , okay , three 
C:  but  <laugh> What we'll 
D:  . Point 
A:  . But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker . Yeah , but isn't it per remote 
D:  three . Huh ? Point 
C:  have . <laugh> Let's make it thirteen or fourteen . <laugh> A 
B:  a colour . Don't make it wood 
D:  twelve  . That's a scroll wheel . <laugh> 
B:  . Make it uh  Yeah 
C:  colour . Yeah , special colours , fruity colours . Yeah . Yeah . They don't sell green rubber plants . <laugh> 
B:  , but it's it's special colour , is 
D:  Yeah , but a wood  
B:  it a all kind of colours ? It's also green or uh  
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


B:  Yeah , but it's a special colour than just rubber 
C:  Alright . No 
D:  dark brown , not wood . Is it also  no that that's just normal colour  fruit 
B:  colour . You have to add something to the rubber to make it green 
C:  no no . If we lose the scroll 
B:  . You don't say here's green rubber . Yeah , you can 
D:  colours . Normal colours , yellow  Yeah , but then I d I don't think we can ever 
C:  wheel and 
B:  , you should  you have to lose  No , it is the scroll wheel , I guess . A push , yeah . Switch colours . It was such a 
C:  make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen 
D:  make to a twelve and half . But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to 
B:  great idea . <laugh> What do you mean ? Oh . But I 
D:  scrap uh s advanced chip . No then we have to scrap everything we 
B:  think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber 
C:  <other> then it's possible 
D:  got because how many colours we gonna make ? Five ? Then we have two . S touch . Then we can make  add two colours on 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


C:  to make . And then you can <other> and then you can add to the colours . Special c 
D:  it . Yeah 
B:  then you use special colour 
C:  Okay , if you lose uh <sound imitating zapping something> if you lose the  You lose this one , you got eleven point 
D:  , two colours  it . They can add two colours . But the colours . Um how 
C:  five and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single 
B:  , 'cause you have to add it . Yeah , so 
C:  curve , for example . How d uh uh how many colours ? Special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p 
D:  ma uh the colours like l she told , is that all the colours we add or  Yeah , but we we we are  we have yellow , 
C:  Yeah , but uh when you use more than one colour , it's a special colour . I suppose . Yeah . Nee 
B:  you always lose the special 
D:  red , uh black , titanium . Ah okay . Yeah , but the rubbers alls original black . 
C:  we we also want to make ano another colour . Yeah , indeed , yeah . You 
D:  Yeah b Yeah 
B:  colour . You co you could make it always black , like normal remote . Oh right , yeah . Yeah , we should u Yeah . We 
C:  don't need four of those 
D:  , but we're gonna make it yellow  uh 
B:  have to make this like four or five or something . That's what it means . Yeah . Oh right , yeah . 
D:  red , and then you add  you have two special colours on top of the one we have now . Yeah , but m Yeah , because we have more colours than 
C:  <other> uh four of those special colours in one in one 
B:  Is it per remote ? Yeah . Yeah , that's right , and you  one colour per remote . So then it is one . No . One 
D:  only black . I  then I think I p I don I don't think 
A:  that you pay ? Half ? I think you pay half 
B:  . So 
D:  they me mean they're special  Yeah , okay okay , true . True , true . We 
B:  it would be curved , single curve . Or not ? So 
A:  per remote . So each remote with a special colour . I hope . <laugh> So the battery 
B:  y you just can't make a nice remote . <laugh> It's too bad for the speaker . Should we 
C:  remote . <other> Hmm . Yeah , single curve . Uh . Huh . Okay . Undo , undo . <laugh> Undo . So , 
D:  have two points spare . Nee one point . Mm yep 
B:  change that 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  advanced chip on print . Because of  thing  Yeah , 
B:  tha that 
C:  'kay 
B:  that's a one if not , or not ? 
A:  well you can at least make it curved again . Because that was very important , huh 
B:  Could you copy 
C:  . Twenty 
B:  it ? And make it uh  The entire uh  
C:  minutes ? Okay , so 
A:  ? So it's curved , it's still that 
B:  Perhaps you can then copy page or 
A:   so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker . We dropped the scroll wheel . And 
B:  so . Ooh . No . Oh you you made the entire  could you  <laugh> Oh not  Well  . Would you 
D:  . Tap . 
A:  the rest is the same , huh ? Am I right ? Yes . No 
D:  It should've work . Yep .  just 
A:  , but you c yeah . 
B:  ? By the

D:  tap somewhere

C:  at start ? <laugh> Alright . When did you 
B:  something went wrong . It doesn't work 
C:  receive this list ? Ah okay . 
B:  . Let's forget . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Oh ignore that . <laugh> <laugh> Well , so  Too bad . Yeah . The microphone . Yeah 
A:  Okay , but this this new remote 
B:  . A and we changed something 
D:  . No 
A:  we can afford . <laugh> Hmm ? No , I hadn't . 
B:  , I guess , or not ? 
D:  ? Evaluation drops . 
C:  <laugh> Ah okay . I suppose this is a  Okay , so we lose the scroll wheel , the s And the microphone 
A:  I just received it . They don't work so hard at the 
B:  We  Oh no . Yeah , I tried 
A:  finance department . <laugh> Yeah , and that's it . Twelve

C:  erase ? Oh . Uh , no . Bling . Ah 
B:  but it didn't work . So we could 
A:  Euro fifty . Um and did 
B:  fix it like tha that it's like this . <laugh> You could select it all , 
C:  .  just up 
B:  but then you 
D:  And erase 
C:  somewhere b 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


A:  a new design , or what were you trying to do ? It didn't work . Hmm . Strange 
B:  can't erase . <laugh> Erase . When you saw th li uh  Earlier 
A:  . Oh , you 
B:  when we selected it , w I couldn't erase anything . Just tap 
A:  can arrange  Hmm 
B:  somewhere . Yeah . I don't think I can , but uh we 
C:  uh besides 
A:  , can't you then just say 
C:  it , right . Uh , we already 
B:  can try . Oh , yeah , no , ha-ha . Yeah , we tried it earlier . It's very much

A:  copy ? New page . Paste . Yes . 
C:  need is 
A:  <other> Select none . <laugh> Okay , 
C:  no mic 
A:  and now you can erase

A:  . Well it should be possible . Oh 
B:  , goodbye mic . <laugh> Oh , I already erased half of the line 
C:    Yeah . S Difference 
A:  no . Well you can draw 
B:  . Too bad , oh . <sound indicating frustration> Like 
A:  over it with white uh pen . <laugh> Oh . <laugh> Yeah . Sorry . <laugh> Well 
D:  Looks like 
B:  this ? Still looks nice . Oh , that's erase . Yeah 
A:  but that's also 
B:  , 
A:  useful for the 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  evaluation , because I think uh we have a prototype now which we can afford and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh design . Doodle . And I think 
D:  a iPod . 
A:  we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time . Let's see , we can save this 
D:  Oh . All I need 
B:  that's a bit weird . 
C:  between lines and text and the pen . 
D:  is 
B:  Oh 
C:  <whistling>

C:  short . But  And stressful . Yeah . Yeah 
B:  uh  
D:  Station page . I think we  it should be 
A:  this ? Hmm , strange . Okay , well uh just leave it at this and quickly save . Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation . We just did  our project evaluation . Um well , I think I can sit for that since it's almost my final slide . Um what did you think about uh the
