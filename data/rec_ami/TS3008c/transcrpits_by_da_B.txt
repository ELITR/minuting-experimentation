Uh , okay . 
<other> Again . 
Hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Uh , may be better , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Oh . 
Oh titanium is probably trendy , I think . 
 . 
Well , maybe a little bit expensive . 
I don't know . 
Yeah , production cost . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I  
Different colours also . 
<laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
<other> Okay . 
 uh  
Ah . 
Well , I shall go to the next slide . Um 
um , I still don't have any information about user requirements . 
I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh  
Yeah , but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements . 
I ha I ha I have the I have  
nothing . 
Well , I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of . 
I dunno if they're  maybe a little bit more , but  
Yeah . 
Yeah , I I uh <other> well , I pointed them out here , just to make it a little bit easier . 
Um 
Another function uh is  of course we already discuss it on the side . 
Um , I don't know what costs of it . 
Uh , I've no idea about it . 
Uh , I was also looking for what you said , for  I got an email uh uh about uh L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control . 
I don't know if that's a good idea , or maybe it's a little bit too much for twelve and a half . Production . 
If we got already uh something like a base . 
Yeah , I don't know . 
I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it . Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting . But  
The remote control . 
<laugh>  a little uh too  <laugh> A little bit  
A little bit too big , I think . 
Exactly . 
Um , yeah . Well , the functions are are not more to discuss , I think . 
It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the  no V_C_R_ or that kind of  
uh , so that's very easy . 
Um  
Mm-hmm . 
Well , that's next channel . I mean  next channel . 
Uh  
Um  
oh , I I got an email with  <laugh> with an uh a remote control with a base . 
So , it's uh just an idea . 
And I um  <other> uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small  
<other> 
Well , I'm not a e I'm the expert for user-friendly , but not for trendiness . 
Maybe it  <other> 
<other> Well uh <laugh>  
okay , that's your point . 
Um , yeah . Yeah , okay . 
Yeah , I've nothing to <laugh> s 
Uh , with a little bit larger , yeah . 
I thought so , but maybe with the  
Yeah , that groups . 
Large ? 
Yeah . 
Most  the most used uh buttons . 
True . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Uh , that was all y 
uh personal preference I didn't have . 
I didn't had any time left . 
<cough> 
It's there . 
Yeah , click on it . 
Couple time . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Well , how uh  
But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's <laugh> sake with <laugh> remote control ? 
Uh , make it a banana ? 
<other> 
<other> 
Yeah , but th <laugh> 
yeah , but that  <laugh> 
Yeah , but that's  
Yeah uh uh  
But d don't we need a creative artist or something like that to m make it to feel like a a a a vegetable or fruit ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
 
<laugh> 
But , we we have to um  There have to be the the the the firm colours , our own uh colours has to be in it . 
Yellow , a Real Reaction . 
Uh , yeah . 
<laugh> We uh f 
A yellow do 
Uh , yeah . 
Yeah , and the button then . 
Okay , yeah . 
Okay .

and we also have to  yeah . 
<laugh> 
And I also  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , I dunno . 
<laugh> . Oh , okay . 
We can  you away . 
<laugh> Yeah , I don't know . 
Uh , uh I  i if it's it's a simple p 
No , that that's right , 
and uh I also have to think about new functions , maybe buttons or something like that to control it . 
Kind of L_C_D_ or something or  
But how does it display then ? 
W when I go to the second channel , what what does it show me ? 
About that programme ? 
Yeah . 
Is it fashion ? 
<other> I don't know . 
That's not up to you . That's up to market if i if it's trendy . 
<laugh>  <other> Because our our motto is we put fashion  
<laugh> 
Yeah , if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured . 
Coloured  
If you have black and white or something , or grey , that's  
<laugh> 
<other> It's too much uh maybe uh with with the L_C_D_ and the docking station and  
With one thing special . 
Not a whole package of specialty . 
And uh the  
<laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
It's just an it's just an idea . 
It's a it's  
True . 
Well uh I uh  
Yeah , I dunno . 
<laugh> 
No , it's too much . 
It's overdone . 
<laugh> 
<other> Democratically . 
<laugh> 
With a spongy Bob feel . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , you just can drop it . Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
But not black I think . 
Well if if it's fruit and vegetables , it have to be colourful . 
But can we ge uh uh  
Can we combine it or something ? Uh with uh yellow and black ? 
Make it a bee ? 
<laugh> A bee . <laugh> 
Yeah ,  it's our  yeah . We we have to use yellow . 
<other> 
Different fronts . 
Yeah . 
Uh , you can you can l uh let choose the customer which colour he wants , yeah . 
Yeah , Three three or four uh four uh colours , or something like that . 
Well , yeah , 
the  
Three to one . 
<other> That's  
And tita uh titanium , is  uh is is it a no ? 
Is  
It's just like that , th this titanium . 
No , not all , not all of them . 
<laugh> 
Uh , I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic . 
In trendy things . 
Yeah . 
It's cold in the winter . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
You have that uh M_P_ three player of Nike , I saw . 
Isn't that titanium with a little bit of rubber ? 
Isn't it  
Is plastic ? Well , it's titanium looking . 
Yeah , he is . Here he is . 
Uh , the  I don't know if you know the M_P_ three player of Nike . 
'Kay , uh that that's very uh with rubber , so it's very 
rough . 
<cough> True . 
Yeah yeah , true . 
Yeah , maybe that's good idea , yeah . 
But if you want to la uh yeah , last longer than two weeks or something like that , you can maybe  
I don't know . 
What time does  
<laugh> 
The rubber . 
Yeah . Uh no , not too much I think . 
Or you just make uh one colour , uh maybe with a a z a kind of like a big wave or something like uh  
In in another colour . 
Not more than two colours I think . 
It's a g a little bit too flashy . 
The funct yeah , I was I was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea . 
Yeah . 
The volume , teletext and  
<other> 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah , b

Okay , that's not mu not much functions . So  
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Too much colour , i it uh  when you got it in a living room , it's too much maybe 
. It has to be  
Yeah . 
No . 
Oh , okay , yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> I hope so .
