<laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Keyboard work . Yeah . 
Alright . 
<other> 
<other> <laugh> 
That's true , I guess . Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Huh . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yep . 
<laugh> 
<other> Yeah , that'll be for the future , I guess . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . Definitely . 
Alright . 
<other> Yeah . That's okay . 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm yeah . 
<laugh> Then you  
and then you've got a flag s <laugh> Very big R_C_ . Yeah . 
<laugh> 
No . 
Next channel , previous channel . 
I think it depends on the function . 
Well , if you save uh  Perhaps uh s tiny buttons aren't user-friendly , then we wouldn't im implement that of course . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh , that's right . 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Those are probably the the th 
Yes . 
Those are probably the b four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control . 
Sorry ? 
Yeah , sure . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
You don't care . 
No , <laugh> sorry . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Oh . 
Go away . 
Come on . 
 . 
Oh , great . 
Well , I've done some research again about trends on the internet . 
Um I've done some investigation , and uh well I uh got some information from fashion watchers from Paris and uh Milan . 
<other> Some uh some findings  
the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control . 
Uh , well , we were going to imply that , so that's nice . 
The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the R_C_ . 
Uh , our market really likes really likes that . 
And uh the third point there in this uh order if  of importance , the third point , is a high ease of use . 
And uh , well , for the idea , I've put some trends uh for the market of elderly people . 
Dark colours , simple recognisable shapes . 
So we probably won't do that . 
The younger market likes uh  
Well ,  the  themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material . 
I found this image , which is uh  Well , it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables . 
I don't see the spongy part in it . 
But with a little bit of fancy  
<laugh> Exactly . 
I got some ideas  
Uh well , yeah , pictures isn't really good word , but um 
some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe . 
Uh , catchy colours . 
Fruit is uh yellow , green , red , whatever . 
So , remote controls in in catchy colours . 
Uh , no , we don't want dark colours . 
<laugh> No , I just put them there to uh , yeah , uh for general idea . 
And uh , the docking st 
uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself . 
But to  
Yeah , the  <other> 
To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station . 
At the bottom of the docking station or whatever . 
And uh , we could bring one line with a dark colour uh to um uh p uh yeah <other> 
uh uh v how do you say ? 
Yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want <laugh> maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour . 
I mean it it it reaches a different market uh , but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to b to uh bring uh like a black R_C_ on the market or whatever . Yes . 
Yeah , there's there's always a 
Well there there's always empty space of course on a remote control . 
I mean I think this part of the R_C_ uh well <laugh> the upper the upper part or whatever is uh is not not used with buttons , I guess . 
So you you can put some fruity things  
No , of course not . 
Especially i 
Yeah , yeah . Yeah , exactly . 
If we make it little bit greenish . 
A <laugh> and we could use <laugh> one of these for 
the uh w what is it ? 
Uh  
Isn't  
Wha whatever . 
Yeah , sure . 
Yeah . 
Well , w we can uh  w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things . 
This is then the uh pear . 
I don't know the English word , so forget it . 
<laugh> And um , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is uh is n <laugh> not easy for a remote control , but m yeah . 
Mayb maybe two or three . 
Yeah . 
No sure , 
but but  
B but that's great , 
and and and what I was  
what what I was saying , the catchy colours  
Yeah . 
Yeah , uh not really . Pictures was a was a bad word , but  
Well we c yeah . 
Yeah , sure . 
Maybe we can if if we got our docking station over here . 
I can't draw with this thing , 
but I'll try . 
If this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here . 
It doesn't work . 
And then  
Well , the button button over here or whatever , 
I don't know . 
On the front , of course , 
because else you can't find it . 
Well , that were my ideas a little bit . 
I'll close 'em down . 
Um , go away . 
Conceptual design , yes . 
The agenda . 
Well , it's nice , of course . But I don't I don't know what to display on it . 
I mean  
Yeah , but it should be li like this big , and I don't think  
Yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen , because  
Yeah , I don't know . 
Programme information . 
But  
Well a lot a lot of T_V_s indeed show uh when you uh zap to a  
But then we also uh w need to bring out a line of T_V_s 
which we were planning to , 
but whatever . 
Because the T_V_ has to send information back to the R_C_ , and I don't know if that's possible . 
Yes , yes , o of course it's possible , 
but you gotta uh implement it in the T_V_s , and I don't think everyone's gonna buy a Real Reaction T_V_ within a month after the release of our uh remote control . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
That's true , that's true , it breaks f yeah , it it it's not very solid , it's uh frag fragile . 
No . No . I don't think so ei either . 
<laugh> . Ah . <laugh> 
<laugh> Bastard . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , I guess . 
No . 
Yeah , that's true , 
if you uh  Yeah . 
<laugh> No . <laugh> 
Well , I think it's uh I think it's pretty trendy , to be honest , 
uh but um I don't know if if if  
well , I'm coming back to the costs again , but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits . 
And I think uh especially colour L_C_D_ , which is indeed pretty trendy . But I don't think  Uh , I think it will be too expensive . 
Uh , did it say a price also uh for for uh monogramme uh L_C_D_ or uh coloured L_C_D_ ? 
Yeah really , 
if y if you c i 
I in in two thousand and four you can't uh put something on the market which is a monogramme . 
<laugh> Really . <laugh> 
 
Yeah . 
W we've we've gotta find a balance , of course . 
And I think  
We have a pear . 
<laugh> 
Is that so ? Was it  <other> it wasn't just a prototype ? 
Exactly , 
I've never seen it in a store . 
I think it's a little too much , yeah . 
<laugh> Okay . 
<laugh> No . 
<laugh>  . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
Yeah , for the spongy uh feel . <laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah , airbag . 
If you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out , yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
No . 
Yeah , b yeah , that's what w I I was pointing at . 
What ? 
Oh , a bee . Oh . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Hmm . 
Well , we can as as I 
draw really nicely over there . 
<laugh> We can put the logo on our uh on our base station . 
Uh , yeah . And maybe very very tiny on the remote control itself . 
But , i 
Yeah . I guess that's that's enough . 
That's way too Nokia . 
Yeah , definitely . Just bring more designs on the market . 
Why not , yeah . 
Sure . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , that's true . 
Yeah , I think it I think it does . 
Yeah , o 
On the other hand , if you want to make fruit  fruity stuff with uh  
Yeah , that's true , that's true . 
Yes . Yeah . 
What ? 
Oh , yeah . Okay , yeah . 
Yeah , I see . 
Yeah , but but but  
Yeah , I th I think that's difficult , 
because uh that's different material , and then you gotta have like uh uh uh two material lines of of of  
Yeah , if it's just a colour uh which you uh which you change then , I guess it's it's nice to have one of these . 
Uh  
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Uh yeah , yeah . 
Yes . 
New prints on it . Yep . 
How do you mean ? 
Th th the uh base in a in another  
Yes . 
How the buttons  yeah . 
Yeah . 
No , definitely not . 
Yes , definitely . 
No , I think that's too vulnerable . 
Yeah , but that's that's  I was thinking that's gotta be on the television . 
Mm . 
<other> Yeah , if it's c if  
Yeah , I think it's okay to to add a menu button for uh  
and if the T_V_ doesn't have a menu , then  
Yeah . 
Yeah , you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever . 
Mm , yeah . 
A mute and a teletext and a menu . 
That's all . 
Hmm . 
Great . Yeah . 
Yeah , definitely . 
Are we gonna do something with the uh spongy thing there ? 
Yeah , that's true , that's true . 
Yeah , it's kinda fruity , and with th with catchy colours uh uh w 
Yeah , definitely . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
I guess so . 
Yes . 
Yea yeah . 
Yep . 
Something like that . 
I guess not . 
Do you , guys ? 
No ? 
In the shared folder . 
You'll see in you email , I guess . 
Yeah , I don't know . I don't know . 
<laugh> Construct one , yeah . 
<laugh> 
Alright , shall we get back to work ? 
Great . 
Yeah . 
<other> Bastard . 
You lazy  <laugh>
