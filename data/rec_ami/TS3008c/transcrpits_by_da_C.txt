Yes . 
<laugh> 
Okay , when we talk about uh components design , um it's really about the material and the  and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of . 
Um , a remote control consist of uh components 
and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material . 
We have to choose th uh these uh wisely 
and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of  in uh in buying uh the remote controls . 
Um , the components of a remote control are of course uh the case . 
Uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic 
uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh  yeah , it feels uh good in your hand . 
Mm the buttons has to be uh solid too , and the material is soft rubber . 
Uh I've got a uh email from the possibilities of Real Reaction . 
Um 
uh they're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber , the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too . 
Mm  
It's okay . Yeah . 
I when we use a rubbled  a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to  
uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , 
which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . Uh  
Um 
the energy source , uh I've got a lot of possibilities for that too . 
Um , 
uh the basic battery , 
which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um  
Uh here you have to have a hand uh  yeah , kinetic uh energy . 
Also in uh this one , like in the watches , 
but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and  
so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . 
Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls . 
Um 
uh also the case material , 
uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird . 
Uh , they don't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium . 
Um 
the chip  
uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf . 
Also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it . 
Um , the base station is also off the shelf , 
all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory . 
Mm , 
I've told about uh the three first points . 
Mm , the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the LED transmitter uh transmitter . 
Uh , it's all uh off the shelf 
and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company . 
Um , another possibility . I uh yeah , I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays . 
Could be uh something special to our uh remote control , 
and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more , 
but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five Euros . 
Ah yeah . 
<laugh> I th I got an email with uh some examples and it  these were were the most trendiest one . 
You see uh a covers , which can be  
Um , I don't know . Um  
Yes . 
Yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh  
maybe a kind of uh whole uh 
um 
a whole set of uh different uh remote controls . 
Maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh 
with a  huge variety of uh 
uh house uh stuff . 
Like uh <laugh> maybe radios and uh television also uh in this in this  in the same style , but  
Yes , 
because we have to uh  we have to  <laugh> we have to bring the logo and all the stuff uh back into it . 
Thank you . <laugh> 
Uh-huh . 
Maybe we can bring t uh uh teletext to the t <laugh> to the remote control . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
But you're the expert . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
You did the research . 
<laugh> It's from your research . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Grapes . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
For a big team of artists . <laugh> 
But uh but I think we don't have to make 
we can't make all uh ten designs . 
We have to make one design I th I I think . 
But pictures of fruit , vegetables vegetables  
Yes , you can put a logo on top of it . 
Yes , it's really fruity . <laugh> 
With a strawberry on top . 
Only if we  
Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it , for the channel you're on . 
No , no , only the T_V_ channel with the  with uh with <other> uh four programmes . 
You can uh zap through them with the page up page down button . 
Yes , it can  
On your  
No , on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also . 
So why not on your remote ? 
Uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide 
on t on teletext , yes . Also on the internet . 
But  
Yes , but you also want to know what's next . 
Yes , that's uh really possible . <laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
No . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
No uh um  
<laugh> Y yes , you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions . 
Uh , then you push a button . 
The title and the information about the programme . 
But but uh  
yeah , what he said was right , about the televisions , they have to be uh customised to the  
But maybe in future it will be a giant hit , and when you are the first 
you have the biggest uh  
Yes , you can put uh a little L_C_D_ display on it with uh with lots of information . 
But uh I haven't thought about it . 
But whe but when you put a a a transparent uh plastic uh uh screen on top of it , it i it isn't vulnerable . 
You can throw with it and  
When when you put uh maybe a colour L_C_D_ t uh screen on it , it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from  
<laugh> 
But uh I've got a  the email with uh with the possibilities . <laugh> And L_C_D_ was a possibility for the remote control . 
So why don't we use it . 
No , but it doesn't sa say anything about a colour or  
But , mm , I alf I also got a possibility to put uh a scroll button on it . 
But  
<other> 
I didn't think that  <laugh> 
Yes , but o on the  
No , when y 
But it look  
Yes , but that remote controls are already on the market . The simple  
Yes , but but when you want to have something special  
<laugh> Yes , but you had a picture of it from another company . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yes , it was already made . Tha the remote control on the docking station . 
Yes , he have a picture of it . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mayb <laugh> 
<laugh> I will rule the world with it . <laugh> 
Yes , maybe a bit of a cushion is  
Yes . 
Like a b 
yes . 
Maybe it  
but then we have to look that it uh w uh will not um be too childish to see . 
Yes , real real good colours . <laugh> 
Hmm . 
But that's not really fruity . 
Uh fronts 
of the  
We can have uh different uh uh fronts of the 
telephone . 
Are these designs ? 
Yes . 
It  this a real uh young young and dynamic uh uh styles . 
 Yes . 
Yes ,   
But also w 
Yes , b bu but when we use s soft 
mm  
Mm . 
But it it  then it uh  you can't throw it it . It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff 
when you throw with uh titanium  <laugh> with your remote control . 
No uh , 
titanium is a bit uh it's a bit harder . 
But also on the colours , the young  
Yes , but a titanium remote control , when you're uh watching T_V_ uh or your hands are a little bit sweaty , and the  
Yes . <laugh> 
Sports and gaming . Define 
Yes , it's w but it is uh plastic . 
Yes , w we can do that on the on the  
We can make this as a style too . 
Uh , this is uh just a  
No , we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic . 
Uh  
I don't have the information . Uh , I I didn't got it  
Yes . 
Like the M_P_ three player . 
Uh , in a lot of other uh 
in a lot of other product uh categories like uh even in b in bags industry . Uh , they began with uh t typical uh leather bags , but then they became stylish , with all all si all sort of colours , 
and w kind of fon  of uh of fronts , like we can use on the telephone and it  
Like Eastpack uh began a revolution with it with all this uh kind of bags and and colours and and  
Yes , and and styles . 
They have uh also uh a kind of uh um 
uh roses on it , 
a and uh  
Then we can always uh use the same design for a greater resemblance , but with new uh with new colours , new  
yes . 
There there are three uh components three components type . 
You have the buttons , the the case uh itself , and the rubber and th 
Yes . 
Yeah , or or when you use the buttons as black , it  you can use two colours as well uh  
<other> 
But then you have to put uh up and down and uh left and right  
Okay . 
Uh  
What are we going to do now ? 
<laugh> 
I will make one in the next uh twenty minutes . <laugh> 
Back to the pen . 
<laugh>
