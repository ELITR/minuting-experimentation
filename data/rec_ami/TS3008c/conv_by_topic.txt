A:  Okay , all set ? Welcome to the conceptual design meeting . 
B:  Uh , okay . 
C:  Yes . 
A:  The agenda . The opening . I'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , uh and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting . So um , <other> who wants to start off ? Technical uh designer again ? Okay . 
B:  <other> Again . Hmm . 
A:  Uh , yeah . Uh , before we begin it , I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder , but they're still not uh quite okay . It uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other . So  But uh , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just <other> ordinary keyboard . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  <laugh> Okay . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh , may be better , yeah . 
D:  Keyboard work . Yeah . 
A:  I think it  will will be more uh easy for you to read the minutes . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Alright .

D:  <laugh> 
C:  um a whole set of uh different uh remote controls . Maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh 
A:  Huh . 
C:  with a  huge variety of uh 
A:  Well , it's a possibility , too . 
C:  uh house uh stuff . Like uh <laugh> maybe radios and uh television also uh in this in this  in the same style , but  
B:  Different colours also . 
A:  Uh-uh . 
D:  <other> Yeah , that'll be for the future , I guess . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Yes , because we have to uh  we have to  <laugh> we have to bring the logo and all the stuff uh back into it . 
A:  <laugh> Next time we're here . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Oh , okay . 
D:  Yeah . Definitely . 
topic_description:	industrial designer presentation_None


C:  Okay , when we talk about uh components design , um it's really about the material and the  and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of . Um , a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material . We have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of  in uh in buying uh the remote controls . Um , the components of a remote control are of course uh the case . Uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh  yeah , it feels uh good in your hand . 
D:  <other> 
C:  Mm the buttons has to be uh solid too , and the material is soft rubber . Uh I've got a uh email from the possibilities of Real Reaction . Um uh they're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber , the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too . Mm  It's okay . Yeah . I when we use a rubbled  a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to  uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . Uh  Um 
B:  Oh . 
C:  the energy source , uh I've got a lot of possibilities for that too . Um , uh the basic battery , which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um  Uh here you have to have a hand uh  yeah , kinetic uh energy . Also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and  so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls . 
D:  <other> <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> <other> 
C:  Um uh also the case material , uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird . 
B:  Oh titanium is probably trendy , I think . 
D:  That's true , I guess . Yeah . 
B:   . Well , maybe a little bit expensive . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  I don't know . 
D:  Huh . 
C:  Uh , they don't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium . Um the chip  uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf . Also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it . Um , the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory . Mm , I've told about uh the three first points . Mm , the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the LED transmitter uh transmitter . Uh , it's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company . Um , another possibility . I uh yeah , I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays . Could be uh something special to our uh remote control , and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more , but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five Euros . 
A:  Twelve and a half . 
C:  Ah yeah . 
A:  Actually  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , production cost .

C:  <laugh> I th I got an email with uh some examples and it  these were were the most trendiest one . You see uh a covers , which can be  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  What are those , t tooth uh brushes , or so 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Um , I don't know . Um  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  But it's actually kind of uh  well , it resembles the design I had in mind for this proj You know the the cartoonish <other> Alessi kind of design . 
B:  I  
C:  Yes . 
D:  Yep . 
C:  Yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh  maybe a kind of uh whole uh 
A:  And we can we can steal their ideas . 
topic_description:	existing products_None


A:  Okay . 
B:  <other> Okay . 
C:  Thank you . <laugh> 
D:  Alright . 
B:   uh  
D:  <other> Yeah . That's okay . 
B:  Ah . 
D:  <cough> 
B:  Well , I shall go to the next slide . Um 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  um , I still don't have any information about user requirements . I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting . 
B:  Yeah , but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements . I ha I ha I have the I have  
A:  Didn't we ? Oh , okay . Well , tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi Just  no , but we decided to use only b basic functions only . 
B:  nothing . Well , I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  I dunno if they're  maybe a little bit more , but  
A:  Well we  maybe we can think of that later . W just  these are the ones you already summed up in the  
B:  Yeah . Yeah , I I uh <other> well , I pointed them out here , just to make it a little bit easier . Um 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Another function uh is  of course we already discuss it on the side . Um , I don't know what costs of it . Uh , I've no idea about it . Uh , I was also looking for what you said , for  I got an email uh uh about uh L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control . I don't know if that's a good idea , or maybe it's a little bit too much for twelve and a half . Production . If we got already uh something like a base . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh-huh . 
A:  That might get redundant also maybe . I don't know what kind of information it would  
B:  Yeah , I don't know . I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it . Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting . But  
D:  Mm yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah , it's okay . 
C:  Maybe we can bring t uh uh teletext to the t <laugh> to the remote control . <laugh> 
B:  The remote control . <laugh>  a little uh too  <laugh> A little bit  
D:  <laugh> Then you  and then you've got a flag s <laugh> Very big R_C_ . Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> Okay . <laugh> That's not  
B:  A little bit too big , I think . 
A:  <other> It was not a good idea . 
B:  Exactly . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Um , yeah . Well , the functions are are not more to discuss , I think . It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the  no V_C_R_ or that kind of  uh , so that's very easy . 
A:  No . No . 
D:  No . 
B:  Um  
A:  But you do mention the next and previous uh button . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Well , that's next channel . I mean  next channel . Uh  
A:   
D:  Next channel , previous channel . 
A:  Oh , okay , o okay okay . 
B:  Um  oh , I I got an email with  <laugh> with an uh a remote control with a base . So , it's uh just an idea . 
A:  Huh . 
B:  And I um  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> It's from your research . <laugh> 
D:  Sorry ? Yeah , sure . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> So  
B:  Okay . Uh , that was all y uh personal preference I didn't have . I didn't had any time left . So  <laugh> Yeah ,  . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay . No uh , that's coo it's cool . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> You don't care . No , <laugh> sorry . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	interface specialist presentation_None


B:  <other> uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small  <other> 
C:  But you're the expert . <laugh> 
D:  I think it depends on the function . 
B:  Well , I'm not a e I'm the expert for user-friendly , but not for trendiness . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Maybe it  <other> 
D:  Well , if you save uh  Perhaps uh s tiny buttons aren't user-friendly , then we wouldn't im implement that of course . 
B:  <other> Well uh <laugh>  okay , that's your point . Um , yeah . Yeah , okay . 
A:  <other> <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , I've nothing to <laugh> s 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger . 
D:  Oh , that's right . 
B:  Uh , with a little bit larger , yeah . I thought so , but maybe with the  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have  yeah , they have to be large . Uh , I mean th th the the two two basic buttons , you know , the  to skip channels and to uh  
B:  Yeah , that groups . Large ? Yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
A:  I think  yeah , I don't know why , but I think that is  that's t trendy too , because that's the mo it  it  you know , it's uh acc acc um accentu uh , how do you say it ? 
B:  Most  the most used uh buttons . 
D:  Those are probably the the th 
A:  It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t 
D:  Yes . 
B:  True . Yeah . 
D:  Those are probably the b four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  You did the research . 
A:  And you want to acc accentuate that , you know .

A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <cough> 
D:  Oh . Go away . Come on . 
B:  It's there . Yeah , click on it . 
D:   . 
B:  Couple time . 
D:  Oh , great . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Well maybe c <laugh> then we have to do something with Sponge Bob then . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Exactly . I got some ideas  Uh well , yeah , pictures isn't really good word , but um 
B:  <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe . Uh , catchy colours . Fruit is uh yellow , green , red , whatever . So , remote controls in in catchy colours . Uh , no , we don't want dark colours . <laugh> No , I just put them there to uh , yeah , uh for general idea . And uh , the docking st uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself . But to  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  It doesn't stroke with the with the dark colours . <other> Not the dark colours ? Okay . Okay . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , the  <other> To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station . At the bottom of the docking station or whatever . And uh , we could bring one line with a dark colour uh to um uh p uh yeah <other> uh uh v how do you say ? 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  For diversity or something . Uh  
D:  Yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want <laugh> maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour . I mean it it it reaches a different market uh , but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to b to uh bring uh like a black R_C_ on the market or whatever . Yes . 
B:  Well , how uh  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's <laugh> sake with <laugh> remote control ? Uh , make it a banana ? 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  No , but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit . It's like a pear or something . 
D:  Yeah , there's there's always a 
B:  <other> 
D:  Well there there's always empty space of course on a remote control . I mean I think this part of the R_C_ uh well <laugh> the upper the upper part or whatever is uh is not not used with buttons , I guess . So you you can put some fruity things  
A:  No , I don't think you have to do it like  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> 
A:  Yeah , but it that doesn't have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the the the the round curves . And so y I I think this  y it already sem resembles uh something like a pear to me or something . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  No , of course not . Especially i 
B:  Yeah , but th <laugh> yeah , but that  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , yeah . Yeah , exactly . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , but that's  
D:  If we make it little bit greenish . 
A:  Yeah . You do get the idea , eh ? The fruity kind of round  'Kay . 
B:  Yeah uh uh  
D:  A <laugh> and we could use <laugh> one of these for the uh w what is it ? 
A:  Yeah , uh  yeah , I don't know . <laugh> Uh , this is a b yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Grapes . 
D:  Uh  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Isn't  Wha whatever . 
B:  But d don't we need a creative artist or something like that to m make it to feel like a a a a vegetable or fruit ? 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , yeah . Of course we have uh  <other> 
D:  Yeah , sure . Yeah . 
A:  we have a very big uh the s 
D:  Well , w we can uh  w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things . This is then the uh pear . I don't know the English word , so forget it . <laugh> And um , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is uh is n <laugh> not easy for a remote control , but m yeah . 
C:  For a big team of artists . <laugh> 
A:  Of d design team , yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Yeah , but  <laugh> It's pear , I guess . 
C:  But uh but I think we don't have to make 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  we can't make all uh ten designs . We have to make one design I th I I think . 
A:  No . No , but I think it's it's already what we were were up to . Uh , it's  it doesn't have to resemble uh what I already said , a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like a fruity thing going on . And it's  it looks fruity to me . 
D:  Mayb maybe two or three . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:   
D:  No sure , but but  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  B but that's great , and and and what I was  what what I was saying , the catchy colours  
A:  And uh , but I do like the  yeah , I do like uh the f uh to  the idea of making a a y uh , a catchy colour design and a d because I do  I think a dark colour would be nice too . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  But pictures of fruit , vegetables vegetables  
A:  Maybe it's too much , you know . 
B:  But , we we have to um  There have to be the the the the firm colours , our own uh colours has to be in it . Yellow , a Real Reaction . 
D:  Yeah , uh not really . Pictures was a was a bad word , but  
A:  Okay , but what are the  This is yellow . 
D:  Well we c yeah . 
C:  Yes , you can put a logo on top of it . 
D:  Yeah , sure . 
A:  But I don't think our our company colours are this fashionable . 
B:  Uh , yeah . 
D:  Maybe we can if if we got our docking station over here . I can't draw with this thing , but I'll try . If this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here . It doesn't work . And then  
B:  <laugh> We uh f 
C:  Yes , it's really fruity . <laugh> 
B:  A yellow do Uh , yeah . Yeah , and the button then . 
C:  With a strawberry on top . 
A:  Yeah , on uh n uh on the bottom of the remote you can do  
D:  Well , the button button over here or whatever , I don't know . 
B:  Okay , yeah . 
D:  On the front , of course , because else you can't find it . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  Well , that were my ideas a little bit . I'll close 'em down . Um , go away . 
A:  Okay . 
topic_description:	marketing expert presentation_None


D:  Well , I've done some research again about trends on the internet . Um I've done some investigation , and uh well I uh got some information from fashion watchers from Paris and uh Milan . <other> Some uh some findings  the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control . Uh , well , we were going to imply that , so that's nice . The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the R_C_ . Uh , our market really likes really likes that . And uh the third point there in this uh order if  of importance , the third point , is a high ease of use . And uh , well , for the idea , I've put some trends uh for the market of elderly people . Dark colours , simple recognisable shapes . So we probably won't do that . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  The younger market likes uh  Well ,  the  themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material . I found this image , which is uh  Well , it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables . I don't see the spongy part in it . But with a little bit of fancy  
topic_description:	trendwatching_None


A:  Okay , you  can you open the conceptual design presentation ? 
D:  Conceptual design , yes . 
A:  See what was on the agenda . 
B:  <laugh> Lazy . <laugh> 
D:  The agenda . 
A:  This is his own remote . Because um , maybe we can start with the technical uh functions , but I don't think it's there  uh , yeah um , do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display , for example ? 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , it's nice , of course . But I don't I don't know what to display on it . I mean  
C:  Only if we  
A:  <laugh> Me neither . 
C:  Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it , for the channel you're on . 
D:  Yeah , but it should be li like this big , and I don't think  
A:  Yeah , but it's so  
C:  No , no , only the T_V_ channel with the  with uh with <other> uh four programmes . You can uh zap through them with the page up page down button . 
A:  I don't think we should do it . 
D:  Yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen , because  
C:  Yes , it can  On your  No , on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also . So why not on your remote ? 
A:  Yeah , but  no . I do I think it's a bit redundant , actually . And it's also not  I don't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something , it's  
D:  Yeah , I don't know . 
B:  Well well what would you display on it then ? 
C:  Uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide 
D:  Programme information . But  
B:  But is it  isn't that a already on T_V_ , a lot of new T_V_s ? 
C:  on t on teletext , yes . Also on the internet . But  
D:  Well a lot a lot of T_V_s indeed show uh when you uh zap to a  
A:  But you're already watching the T_V_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yes , but you also want to know what's next . 
D:  But then we also uh w need to bring out a line of T_V_s which we were planning to , but whatever . Because the T_V_ has to send information back to the R_C_ , and I don't know if that's possible . 
B:  Yeah , and we also have to  yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yes , that's uh really possible . <laugh> 
D:  Yes , yes , o of course it's possible , but you gotta uh implement it in the T_V_s , and I don't think everyone's gonna buy a Real Reaction T_V_ within a month after the release of our uh remote control . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <other> <laugh> 
B:  And I also  
A:  I really understand you want to make your job more exciting <laugh> by putting an L_C_D_ in it , but I I really don't think it's a good n goo because it also doesn't stroke with  we wanted uh c When we talk about the materials , uh it's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it . It was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it . But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image . You know , it's like more vulnerable , and it adds nothing really , you know . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . That's true , that's true , it breaks f yeah , it it it's not very solid , it's uh frag fragile . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . You could make it , but it's just  it it doesn't  I don't think it  it's coherent with the design we're after . 
D:  No . No . I don't think so ei either . 
A:  But that's my opinion . Well , you you y Okay , we can vote for it . You want the L_C_D_ display . I don't want to and <laugh> he doesn't , so it's up to him . <laugh> If we wanna  
C:  <laugh> No . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> . Ah . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , I dunno . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  And I've read somewhere that I've got some kind of veto veto uh rights . 
B:  <laugh> . Oh , okay . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Bastard . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> So I can also say  
B:  We can  you away . 
A:  But did we skip the  Yeah , you could do  m but what what i so what i but do you think we should  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah , I don't know . Uh , uh I  i if it's it's a simple p 
A:  We're not even sure what what information we want to display on it . So  
B:  No , that that's right , and uh I also have to think about new functions , maybe buttons or something like that to control it . Kind of L_C_D_ or something or  
C:  No uh um  <laugh> Y yes , you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions . 
D:  Yeah , I guess . 
B:  But how does it display then ? W when I go to the second channel , what what does it show me ? 
C:  Uh , then you push a button . The title and the information about the programme . But but uh  yeah , what he said was right , about the televisions , they have to be uh customised to the  
B:  About that programme ? 
A:  Nah , that's not gonna work . 
C:  But maybe in future it will be a giant hit , and when you are the first 
D:  No . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  you have the biggest uh  
A:  Oh , well uh I've seen it done before . Do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes , they have d L_C_D_ displays , but then it's very functional to indicate which  what uh uh device you are controlling . So it's  that that's what I've seen . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , that's true , if you uh  Yeah . 
C:  Yes , you can put uh a little L_C_D_ display on it with uh with lots of information . But uh I haven't thought about it . 
A:  But it just  it j it doesn't doesn't match with the  our whole basic concept . 
C:  But whe but when you put a a a transparent uh plastic uh uh screen on top of it , it i it isn't vulnerable . You can throw with it and  
A:  Well yeah , yeah , okay . That's maybe not the most important , but it's just  
B:  Is it fashion ? 
C:  When when you put uh maybe a colour L_C_D_ t uh screen on it , it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from  
A:  I don't think so . 
B:  <other> I don't know . That's not up to you . That's up to market if i if it's trendy . <laugh>  <other> Because our our motto is we put fashion  
A:  Yeah , well do you ha do you have to   You haven't looked after the trendiness of L_C_D_ displays , have you ? 
D:  <laugh> No . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Well , I think it's uh I think it's pretty trendy , to be honest , uh but um I don't know if if if  well , I'm coming back to the costs again , but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits . And I think uh especially colour L_C_D_ , which is indeed pretty trendy . But I don't think  Uh , I think it will be too expensive . 
C:  But uh I've got a  the email with uh with the possibilities . <laugh> And L_C_D_ was a possibility for the remote control . So why don't we use it . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah yeah yeah . 
D:  Uh , did it say a price also uh for for uh monogramme uh L_C_D_ or uh coloured L_C_D_ ? 
A:  Yeah , but we're gonna  if it  
B:  Yeah , if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured . Coloured  
D:  Yeah really , if y if you c i 
B:  If you have black and white or something , or grey , that's  
D:  I in in two thousand and four you can't uh put something on the market which is a monogramme . <laugh> Really . <laugh> 
A:  Then uh then you better don't  yeah , d <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  No , but it doesn't sa say anything about a colour or  But , mm , I alf I also got a possibility to put uh a scroll button on it . But  <other> 
A:  Uh uh I really don't feel the whole idea of an L_C_D_ display . I'm sorry . It can't co you cannot convince me . I don't know how  well how to  with you guys , but  
C:  I didn't think that  <laugh> 
D:   
A:  I don't really feel it . We already  we're uh  Yeah , we already have the the th th th base station gadgets , and want  and it  uh uh , do  it has to be a simple design , which sturdy , which soft  
B:  <other> It's too much uh maybe uh with with the L_C_D_ and the docking station and  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yes , but o on the  
D:  W we've we've gotta find a balance , of course . And I think  
B:  With one thing special . Not a whole package of specialty . 
A:  I don't think  I j uh , and really , I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything , you know , on a design level . Uh , I think it's slicker to have no L_ CEDs . Y we want to  it's simplicity , w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons , so you don't need an L_C_D_ . 
C:  No , when y But it look  Yes , but that remote controls are already on the market . The simple  
A:  It doesn't fit in our philosophy uh behind the whole remote . 
C:  Yes , but but when you want to have something special  
A:  Yeah , but we already have the docking station , which is  
C:  <laugh> Yes , but you had a picture of it from another company . 
D:  We have a pear . 
B:  And uh the  
A:  <laugh>  It has to be developed , but  no , but it  that's  <laugh> that's our that's our killer feature . That's our  what makes it special . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> <laugh> 
B:  It's just an it's just an idea . It's a it's  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yes , it was already made . Tha the remote control on the docking station . 
A:  Yeah , we're gonna develop our own r n docking station . 
B:  True . 
D:  Is that so ? Was it  <other> it wasn't just a prototype ? 
C:  Yes , he have a picture of it . 
B:  Well uh I uh  Yeah , I dunno . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Exactly , I've never seen it in a store . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh , but re we really have to cut this off , I re I know you  I I I I <laugh> I get the idea you really like it , you know , the the L_C_D_ thing , but I I think it's it's not a good idea , and we have already mentioned all the arguments . I don't  uh , do you guys agre How do you guys think ? I d 
B:  No , it's too much . 
D:  I think it's a little too much , yeah . 
B:  It's overdone . 
A:  Okay , we s skip the <laugh> L_C_D_ display . I'm sorry , maybe you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Okay . 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> 
B:  <other> Democratically . 
D:  <laugh> No . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh>  . 
C:  Mayb <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> I will rule the world with it . <laugh> 
A:  But  <laugh> Probably so . Okay . But for the technical part . The m material , I think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber . Uh 
D:  <laugh> Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
C:  Yes , maybe a bit of a cushion is  
A:  Yeah yeah yeah , p Exactly . This is what it w Yeah , but it it was already what we're uh we're after , you know , to give it uh , you know , the soft touch in your hands and also to , know , like  Yeah , that is y the b airbag kind of thing . You can st throw it at your little brother's head . 
D:  Yeah , for the spongy uh feel . <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  Yes . 
B:  With a spongy Bob feel . Yeah . 
C:  Like a b yes . 
D:  <laugh> Yeah , airbag . 
B:  Yeah , you just can drop it . Yeah . 
D:  If you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out , yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . No no no , not that comfy . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Maybe it  but then we have to look that it uh w uh will not um be too childish to see . 
A:  Yeah yeah . Yeah . Okay , that's a that's a good point . And that's why I like the dark t col dark colour bit , you know , because it may be  the design uh , it's uh maybe it is a bit of the  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  But not black I think . 
A:  it's a bit nineties maybe , what we're what we're up to rat fun to this point . 
D:  No . 
B:  Well if if it's fruit and vegetables , it have to be colourful . 
A:  Yeah , that's that's true , but but it has to be a little big solid . It mustn't be too , n you know , th too overwhelming , then when you put it on your  just  
D:  Yeah , b yeah , that's what w I I was pointing at . 
B:  But can we ge uh uh  Can we combine it or something ? Uh with uh yellow and black ? 
A:  Yeah . Yeah , maybe so . 
B:  Make it a bee ? 
D:  What ? Oh , a bee . Oh . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> A bee . <laugh> 
A:  No , uh I don't like the yellow and black combination  . But it is our company colours . Apparently . <laugh> 
C:  Yes , real real good colours . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah ,  it's our  yeah . We we have to use yellow . 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Hmm . 
C:  Hmm . 
A:  I don't like yellow , and uh maybe  I don't know . 
D:  Well , we can as as I 
C:  But that's not really fruity . 
D:  draw really nicely over there . <laugh> We can put the logo on our uh on our base station . Uh , yeah . And maybe very very tiny on the remote control itself . But , i 
A:  But  Okay , but what  uh , what are other tef technical things we have to discuss ? 
B:  <other> 
C:  Uh fronts 
A:  <other> 
C:  of the  We can have uh different uh uh fronts of the 
A:  Should we do that ? I don't think you  we should do that . Maybe just bring it out in different colours , but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that's also too much . People don't wanna spend more money on their remote <laugh> control , I guess . 
C:  telephone . 
B:  Different fronts . 
D:  Yeah . I guess that's that's enough . That's way too Nokia . 
B:  Yeah . Uh , you can you can l uh let choose the customer which colour he wants , yeah . Yeah , Three three or four uh four uh colours , or something like that . 
C:  Are these designs ? 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  Yeah , definitely . Just bring more designs on the market . 
A:  But uh , without  gon uh okay . So , are we through the technical part then ? 
D:  Why not , yeah . 
C:  Yes . 
A:  Okay . So we uh agreed upon uh n uh well , not u unanimously or how you call it , but  Yeah . 
C:  It  this a real uh young young and dynamic uh uh styles . 
B:  Well , yeah , the  Three to one . <other> That's  
A:  The materials you uh mentioned in your your personal preferences were all  were quite okay . O o only only the last point your  no titanium's not not out of question , I guess . 
C:   Yes . 
B:  And tita uh titanium , is  uh is is it a no ? Is  
C:  Yes ,   But also w 
B:  It's just like that , th this titanium . 
C:  Yes , b bu but when we use s soft 
A:  But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium , as well ? Makes it in a homogeneous uh design . 
C:  mm  
D:  Sure . 
C:  Mm . 
B:  No , not all , not all of them . 
C:  But it it  then it uh  you can't throw it it . It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  when you throw with uh titanium  <laugh> with your remote control . No uh , 
A:  <laugh> It will it will break other stuff w <laugh> when it's plastic , as well . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  titanium is a bit uh it's a bit harder . But also on the colours , the young  
D:  Yeah , that's true . 
A:  No , but uh uh , you should ma Yeah . Okay , think of the possibilities and make it in  completely titanium . Well would it be more trendy ? More chic ? 
D:  Yeah , I think it I think it does . 
B:  Uh , I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic . 
C:  Yes , but a titanium remote control , when you're uh watching T_V_ uh or your hands are a little bit sweaty , and the  
B:  In trendy things . 
D:  Yeah , o On the other hand , if you want to make fruit  fruity stuff with uh  
B:  Yeah . It's cold in the winter . <laugh> 
C:  Yes . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , but I I really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing . But the question is i then it's , you know , is is  it fits in our s philosophy to make it uh sturdy and simple and uh , know , like uh  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , that's true , that's true . 
C:  Sports and gaming . Define . 
A:  When you make it titanium , it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually don't need . And when it's big and plastic , it's like some fun stuff you can always have around . It's always fun to have something big and plastic around . 
D:  Yes . Yeah . 
B:  You have that uh M_P_ three player of Nike , I saw . Isn't that titanium with a little bit of rubber ? 
C:  Yes , it's w but it is uh plastic . 
B:  Isn't it  Is plastic ? Well , it's titanium looking . 
C:  Yes , w we can do that on the on the  
D:  What ? 
B:  Yeah , he is . Here he is . Uh , the  I don't know if you know the M_P_ three player of Nike . 'Kay , uh that that's very uh with rubber , so it's very 
D:  Oh , yeah . Okay , yeah . 
A:   Yeah , that's beautiful . 
D:  Yeah , I see . 
C:  We can make this as a style too . Uh , this is uh just a  
D:  Yeah , but but but  
B:  rough . 
A:  Oh , maybe th maybe this is an  <other> 
D:  Yeah , I th I think that's difficult , because uh that's different material , and then you gotta have like uh uh uh two material lines of of of  
C:  No , we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic . 
D:  Yeah , if it's just a colour uh which you uh which you change then , I guess it's it's nice to have one of these . Uh  
C:  Uh  
A:  No , I do like the idea of maybe a t titanium kind  type of body w and then with s plastic colouration  around it . You know , like the the soft stuff , but I don't know if it's possible . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  I don't have the information . Uh , I I didn't got it  
A:  But you can't make the plastic give uh the ti titanium look . But make it just like shiny . Maybe we should uh shou 
B:  <cough> True . 
C:  Yes . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah yeah , true . Yeah , maybe that's good idea , yeah . But if you want to la uh yeah , last longer than two weeks or something like that , you can maybe  
C:  Like the M_P_ three player . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  And uh and 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  maybe we sh should we t  I don't know if we should talk about  uh , how how much time have we got left ? 
C:  Uh , in a lot of other uh 
B:  I don't know . What time does  
A:  Forty minutes . 
C:  in a lot of other product uh categories like uh even in b in bags industry . Uh , they began with uh t typical uh leather bags , but then they became stylish , with all all si all sort of colours , and w kind of fon  of uh of fronts , like we can use on the telephone and it  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  Like Eastpack uh began a revolution with it with all this uh kind of bags and and colours and and  
A:   You putting in different colours . 
C:  Yes , and and styles . They have uh also uh a kind of uh um 
A:  Okay . 
C:  uh roses on it , a and uh  
D:  Uh yeah , yeah . 
A:  Okay . Yeah , but w yeah . <laugh> Well , it is . It's a possibility . But , let's think about the bas 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Then we can always uh use the same design for a greater resemblance , but with new uh with new colours , new  yes . 
D:  Yes . New prints on it . Yep . 
A:  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . But wha th our basic idea  y I mean , you gonna  we're probably gonna have like two type of materials , like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it . And and pro and lights . We have to incorporate the lights too . But , uh do w gonna  gonna  are we going to give it a two-tone colour look , like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour ? Is that the idea ? Is that a good idea ? 
D:  How do you mean ? Th th the uh base in a in another  
B:  The rubber . 
A:  How many colours are we  how many colours are we gonna  we're uh uh f uh f Only five minutes left , by the way . How many colours are we gonna give it ? Like two-tone colour ? T 
D:  Yes . 
C:  There there are three uh components three components type . You have the buttons , the the case uh itself , and the rubber and th 
B:  Yeah . Uh no , not too much I think . 
D:  How the buttons  yeah . 
A:  I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , <other> and the cushions as well should be in another colour . 
C:  Yes . 
B:  Or you just make uh one colour , uh maybe with a a z a kind of like a big wave or something like uh  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay , but not more than  Well , yeah , it's   No . Maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting . 
B:  In in another colour . Not more than two colours I think . It's a g a little bit too flashy . 
D:  No , definitely not . Yes , definitely . 
C:  Yeah , or or when you use the buttons as black , it  you can use two colours as well uh  
A:  Okay . But we have to uh think of some other uh important things . Uh  oh yeah , the the functionalities of the the buttons . 
C:  <other> 
B:  The funct yeah , I was I was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea . 
A:  No . 
D:  No , I think that's too vulnerable . 
A:  <other> 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  I think this is okay , the  so we have the basic . Then we have the numbers . We have the power button . We have we have a teletext button . 
B:  The volume , teletext and  
A:  And maybe want to access a a menu or something . Most T_V_s have a menu . 
D:  Yeah , but that's that's  I was thinking that's gotta be on the television . 
B:  <other> 
A:  Yeah , but I think you ha I really need a menu button . That's just i the only button  only  
B:  Yeah yeah yeah yeah , b Yeah , but wha what kind of menu ? Is uh  isn't that different from every television ? 
A:  You know , I  <other> No , I think most T_V_s have an uh a menu nowadays to access the uh uh screen settings . And so  
D:  Mm . <other> Yeah , if it's c if  Yeah , I think it's okay to to add a menu button for uh  and if the T_V_ doesn't have a menu , then  
B:  <other> 
A:  But that that covers all the all the other settings . It covers everything then . 
C:  But then you have to put uh up and down and uh left and right  
D:  Yeah . Yeah , you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever . 
A:  No , you can use the  And you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that . Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh uh ten uh rem uh yeah , mute . A teletext and a menu , and then then i that's it . It's all we need . Okay , uh another stuf some stuff <other> about the the the design of the docking station . Something important about a s uh , no , uh which sh uh should remind us of the remote itself , I guess . 
C:  Okay . 
D:  Mm , yeah . A mute and a teletext and a menu . 
B:  Mute . 
D:  That's all . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Hmm . Great . Yeah . 
B:  Okay , that's not mu not much functions . So  
D:  Yeah , definitely . Are we gonna do something with the uh spongy thing there ? 
A:  Uh , in one colour . Just use  I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s uh side . And we will make it spongy and  and uh and uh well , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did  I think this is kind of fruity , you know . Just round shapes with uh  
C:  Uh  
D:  Yeah , that's true , that's true . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , it's kinda fruity , and with th with catchy colours uh uh w 
A:  <laugh> Yeah , but we're gonna have to  we really have to think  I think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but  and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying , that when you uh , know , some things is just over the top , and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks , you   it just gets annoying , because it's so big and flashy . Uh , it has to be some level of subtlety , but we have to  still have to think of how we manage to uh 
D:  Yeah , definitely . 
A:  to get to that . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . Guess we're through then . 
D:  Okay . I guess so . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  But we  I think also we just  so we have to do something with colour but also , I I think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind . I think that's uh adds to the  too much colour maybe m um  
D:  Yes . 
B:  Yeah . Too much colour , i it uh  when you got it in a living room , it's too much maybe . It has to be  
D:  Yea yeah . 
A:  But our des design experts will uh work that out . 
topic_description:	discussion_None


A:  Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute . So we will wrap up . 
D:  Yep .
