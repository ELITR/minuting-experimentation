Okay , all set ? 
Welcome to the conceptual design meeting . 
The agenda . 
The opening . 
I'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , 
uh and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting . 
So um , <other> who wants to start off ? 
Technical uh designer again ? 
Okay . 
Uh , yeah . Uh , before we begin it , I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder , 
but they're still not uh quite okay . 
It uh it uh still some technical difficulties 
so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other . 
So  
But uh , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just <other> ordinary keyboard . 
I think it  will will be more uh easy for you to read the minutes . 
<laugh> <other> 
Twelve and a half . 
Actually  
What are those , t tooth uh brushes , or so 
But it's actually kind of uh  
well , it resembles the design I had in mind for this proj 
You know the the cartoonish <other> Alessi kind of design . 
And we can we can steal their ideas . 
Huh . 
Well , it's a possibility , too . 
Uh-uh . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Next time we're here . <laugh> 
Oh , okay . 
Okay . 
Oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting . 
Didn't we ? 
Oh , okay . 
Well , tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi 
Just  
no , but we decided to use only b basic functions only . 
Okay . 
Well we  maybe we can think of that later . 
W just  
these are the ones you already summed up in the  
Okay . 
Yeah . 
That might get redundant also maybe . 
I don't know what kind of information it would  
Yeah . Yeah , it's okay . 
<laugh> 
Okay . <laugh> That's not  
<other> It was not a good idea . 
Okay . 
No . No . 
But you do mention the next and previous uh button . 
 
Oh , okay , o okay okay . 
Huh . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> <laugh> 
Well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger . 
Well , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have  yeah , they have to be large . 
Uh , I mean th th the the two two basic buttons , you know , the  to skip channels and to uh  
I think  yeah , I don't know why , but I think that is  that's t trendy too , 
because that's the mo it  it  you know , it's uh acc acc um accentu uh , 
how do you say it ? 
It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t 
Yeah . 
And you want to acc accentuate that , you know . 
<laugh> So  
Okay . 
No uh , that's coo it's cool . 
<laugh> 
Well maybe c <laugh> then we have to do something with Sponge Bob then . <laugh> 
It doesn't stroke with the with the dark colours . 
<other> Not the dark colours ? Okay . 
Okay . 
For diversity or something . Uh  
No , but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit . 
It's like a pear or something . 
No , I don't think you have to do it like  
Yeah , but it that doesn't have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the the the the round curves . 
And so y I I think this  y it already sem resembles uh something like a pear to me or something . 
Yeah . 
You do get the idea , eh ? The fruity kind of round  
'Kay . 
Yeah , uh  yeah , I don't know . 
<laugh> Uh , this is a b yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah , yeah . Of course we have uh  <other> 
we have a very big uh the s 
Of d design team , yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah , but  
<laugh> It's pear , I guess . 
<laugh> 
No . 
No , but I think it's it's already what we were were up to . 
Uh , it's  it doesn't have to resemble uh what I already said , a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like a fruity thing going on . 
And it's  it looks fruity to me . 
And uh , but I do like the  
yeah , I do like uh the f uh to  the idea of making a a y uh , a catchy colour design and a d because I do  I think a dark colour would be nice too . 
Maybe it's too much , you know . 
Okay , but what are the  
This is yellow . 
But I don't think our our company colours are this fashionable . 
Yeah , 
on uh n uh on the bottom of the remote you can do  
Okay . 
Okay , you  can you open the conceptual design presentation ? 
See what was on the agenda . 
This is his own remote . 
Because um , maybe we can start with the technical uh functions , 
but I don't think it's there  
uh , yeah um , 
do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display , for example ? 
<laugh> Me neither . 
Yeah , but it's so  
I don't think we should do it . 
Yeah , but  no . I do I think it's a bit redundant , actually . 
And it's also not  I don't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something , 
it's  
But you're already watching the T_V_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I really understand you want to make your job more exciting <laugh> by putting an L_C_D_ in it , 
but I I really don't think it's a good n goo 
because it also doesn't stroke with  
we wanted uh c 
When we talk about the materials , uh it's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it . 
It was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it . 
But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image . 
You know , it's like more vulnerable , 
and it adds nothing really , you know . 
Yeah , yeah . You could make it , but it's just  it it doesn't  I don't think it  it's coherent with the design we're after . 
But that's my opinion . 
Well , you you y 
Okay , we can vote for it . 
You want the L_C_D_ display . I don't want to and <laugh> he doesn't , so it's up to him . 
<laugh> If we wanna  
And I've read somewhere that I've got some kind of veto veto uh rights . 
<laugh> So I can also say  
But did we skip the  
Yeah , you could do  
m but what what i so what i but do you think we should  
We're not even sure what what information we want to display on it . So  
Nah , that's not gonna work . 
Yeah . 
Oh , well uh I've seen it done before . 
Do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes , they have d L_C_D_ displays , 
but then it's very functional to indicate which  what uh uh device you are controlling . 
So it's  that that's what I've seen . 
But it just  it j it doesn't doesn't match with the  our whole basic concept . 
Well yeah , yeah , okay . That's maybe not the most important , 
but it's just  
I don't think so . 
Yeah , well do you ha do you have to   You haven't looked after the trendiness of L_C_D_ displays , have you ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
Yeah , but we're gonna  if it  
Then uh then you better don't  yeah , d 
<laugh> 
Uh uh I really don't feel the whole idea of an L_C_D_ display . 
I'm sorry . 
It can't co you cannot convince me . 
I don't know how  well how to  with you guys , but  
I don't really feel it . 
We already  we're uh  
Yeah , we already have the the th th th base station gadgets , 
and want  and it  uh uh , do  
it has to be a simple design , which sturdy , which soft  
I don't think  
I j uh , 
and really , I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything , you know , on a design level . 
Uh , I think it's slicker to have no L_ CEDs . 
Y we want to  
it's simplicity , w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons , so you don't need an L_C_D_ . 
It doesn't fit in our philosophy uh behind the whole remote . 
Yeah , but we already have the docking station , which is  
<laugh>  It has to be developed , 
but  no , but it  that's  <laugh> 
that's our that's our killer feature . 
That's our  what makes it special . 
Yeah , we're gonna develop our own r n docking station . 
<laugh> 
Uh , but re we really have to cut this off , 
I re I know you  I I I I <laugh> 
I get the idea you really like it , you know , the the L_C_D_ thing , but I I think it's it's not a good idea , and we have already mentioned all the arguments . 
I don't  uh , 
do you guys agre How do you guys think ? 
I d 
Okay , we s skip the <laugh> L_C_D_ display . 
I'm sorry , 
maybe you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something . 
But  
<laugh> Probably so . 
Okay . 
But for the technical part . 
The m material , I think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber . Uh 
Yeah yeah yeah , p Exactly . 
This is what it w Yeah , but it it was already what we're uh we're after , you know , to give it uh , you know , the soft touch in your hands 
and also to , know , like  
Yeah , that is y the b airbag kind of thing . 
You can st throw it at your little brother's head . 
Yeah . No no no , not that comfy . 
Yeah yeah . Yeah . Okay , that's a that's a good point . 
And that's why I like the dark t col dark colour bit , you know , 
because it may be  the design uh , it's uh maybe it is a bit of the  
it's a bit nineties maybe , what we're what we're up to rat fun to this point . 
Yeah , that's that's true , but but it has to be a little big solid . 
It mustn't be too , n you know , th too overwhelming , 
then when you put it on your  just  
Yeah . 
Yeah , maybe so . 
No , uh I don't like the yellow and black combination  . 
But it is our company colours . Apparently . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
I don't like yellow , 
and uh maybe  I don't know . 
But  
Okay , but what  uh , what are other tef technical things we have to discuss ? 
<other> 
Should we do that ? 
I don't think you  we should do that . 
Maybe just bring it out in different colours , 
but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that's also too much . 
People don't wanna spend more money on their remote <laugh> control , I guess . 
Yeah , yeah . 
But uh , without  gon uh 
okay . 
So , are we through the technical part then ? 
Okay . 
So we uh agreed upon uh n uh well , not u unanimously or how you call it , but  Yeah . 
The materials you uh mentioned in your your personal preferences were all  were quite okay . 
O o only only the last point your  
no titanium's not not out of question , I guess . 
But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium , as well ? 
Makes it in a homogeneous uh design . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> It will it will break other stuff w <laugh> when it's plastic , as well . 
<other> Yeah . <laugh> 
No , but uh uh , you should ma Yeah . 
Okay , think of the possibilities and make it in  completely titanium . 
Well would it be more trendy ? More chic ? 
Yeah , but I I really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing . 
But the question is i then it's , you know , is is  it fits in our s philosophy to make it uh sturdy and simple and uh , know , like uh  
When you make it titanium , it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually don't need . 
And when it's big and plastic , it's like some fun stuff you can always have around . 
It's always fun to have something big and plastic around . 
 Yeah , that's beautiful . 
Oh , maybe th maybe this is an  <other> 
No , I do like the idea of maybe a t titanium kind  type of body w and then with s plastic colouration  around it . 
You know , like the the soft stuff , 
but I don't know if it's possible . 
But you can't make the plastic give uh the ti titanium look . 
But make it just like shiny . 
Maybe we should uh shou 
And uh and 
maybe we sh should we t  I don't know if we should talk about  uh , 
how how much time have we got left ? 
Forty minutes . 
Okay . 
 You putting in different colours . 
Okay . 
Okay . Yeah , but w yeah . 
<laugh> Well , it is . It's a possibility . 
But , let's think about the bas 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
But wha th our basic idea  y I mean , you gonna  we're probably gonna have like two type of materials , like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it . 
And and pro and lights . We have to incorporate the lights too . 
But , uh do w gonna  gonna  are we going to give it a two-tone colour look , like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour ? 
Is that the idea ? Is that a good idea ? 
How many colours are we  how many colours are we gonna  we're uh uh f uh f 
Only five minutes left , by the way . 
How many colours are we gonna give it ? 
Like two-tone colour ? T 
I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , <other> and the cushions as well should be in another colour . 
Okay , but not more than  
Well , yeah , it's   
No . 
Maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting . 
Okay . 
But we have to uh think of some other uh important things . 
Uh  oh yeah , the the functionalities of the the buttons . 
No . 
<other> 
I think this is okay , 
the  
so we have the basic . 
Then we have the numbers . We have the power button . We have we have a teletext button . 
And maybe want to access a a menu or something . 
Most T_V_s have a menu . 
Yeah , but I think you ha I really need a menu button . 
That's just i the only button  only  
You know , I  
<other> No , I think most T_V_s have an uh a menu nowadays to access the uh uh screen settings . And so  
But that that covers all the all the other settings . It covers everything then . 
No , you can use the  
And you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that . 
Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh uh ten uh rem 
uh yeah , mute . A teletext and a menu , and then then i that's it . 
It's all we need . 
Okay , uh another stuf some stuff <other> about the the the design of the docking station . 
Something important about a s uh , no , uh which sh uh 
should remind us of the remote itself , I guess . 
Uh , in one colour . 
Just use  
I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s uh side . 
And we will make it spongy and  
and uh and uh well , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did  
I think this is kind of fruity , you know . Just round shapes with uh  
<laugh> Yeah , but we're gonna have to  we really have to think  
I think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but  and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying , 
that when you uh , know , 
some things is just over the top , 
and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks , you   it just gets annoying , because it's so big and flashy . 
Uh , it has to be some level of subtlety , 
but we have to  still have to think of how we manage to uh 
to get to that . 
Okay . 
Guess we're through then . 
But we  I think also we just  
so we have to do something with colour but also , I I think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind . 
I think that's uh adds to the  
too much colour maybe m um  
But our des design experts will uh work that out . 
Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute . 
So we will wrap up . 
Or is there anything we'd like to discuss ? 
That's right . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Well , you will read the minutes uh in the  you can find them in the  
pro probably . 
Yeah  uh no , for su for sure 
because I'm will now type them out . 
Uh , y yeah . 
I think uh  
But  toilet paper roll and uh  
Okay . 
Yep . 
I was waiting for the l last message , but  
Mm yeah .
