C:  Okay , when we talk about uh components design , um it's really about the material and the  and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of . 
C:  Uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic 
C:  uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh  yeah , it feels uh good in your hand . 
C:  I when we use a rubbled  a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to  
C:  uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , 
C:  which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . Uh  
C:  uh the basic battery , 
C:  which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um  
C:  Uh here you have to have a hand uh  yeah , kinetic uh energy . 
C:  Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls . 
C:  uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird . 
B:  Oh titanium is probably trendy , I think . 
B:  Well , maybe a little bit expensive . 
C:  uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf . 
C:  all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory . 
C:  Um , another possibility . I uh yeah , I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays . 
C:  Could be uh something special to our uh remote control , 
C:  and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more , 
C:  Yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh  
C:  <laugh> I th I got an email with uh some examples and it  these were were the most trendiest one .

B:  Oh titanium is probably trendy , I think . 
B:  Well , maybe a little bit expensive . 
abst_sum - abstract: He suggested that the case should be double-curved, and be made from plastic and rubber rather than wood or titanium.

C:  uh the basic battery , 
C:  which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um  
C:  Uh here you have to have a hand uh  yeah , kinetic uh energy . 
C:  Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls . 
abst_sum - abstract: He also recommended using basic batteries rather than solar or kinetic power.

C:  Um , another possibility . I uh yeah , I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays . 
C:  Could be uh something special to our uh remote control , 
C:  and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more , 
abst_sum - abstract: He also mentioned the possibility of using an LCD screen to add something special.

B:  um , I still don't have any information about user requirements . 
B:  I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh  
A:  Oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting . 
B:  Yeah , but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements . 
A:  Well , tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi 
B:  Well , I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of . 
A:  these are the ones you already summed up in the  
B:  Uh , I was also looking for what you said , for  I got an email uh uh about uh L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control . 
B:  I don't know if that's a good idea , or maybe it's a little bit too much for twelve and a half . Production . 
B:  I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it . Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting . But  
B:  Um , yeah . Well , the functions are are not more to discuss , I think . 
B:  It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the  no V_C_R_ or that kind of  
A:  But you do mention the next and previous uh button . 
B:  Well , that's next channel . I mean  next channel . 
B:  uh personal preference I didn't have . 
B:  And I um  <other> uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small  
abst_sum - abstract: The user interface designer went over the functions to be included in the remote.

B:  And I um  <other> uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small  
A:  Well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger . 
A:  Well , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have  yeah , they have to be large . 
A:  It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t 
abst_sum - abstract: The group discussed using large buttons for the most frequently used functions.

D:  Well , I've done some research again about trends on the internet . 
D:  the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control . 
D:  The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the R_C_ . 
D:  And uh the third point there in this uh order if  of importance , the third point , is a high ease of use . 
D:  The younger market likes uh  
D:  Well ,  the  themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material . 
D:  Uh , catchy colours . 
D:  uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself . 
D:  To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station . 
D:  Yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want <laugh> maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour .

abst_sum - abstract: The younger market also likes the theme of fruit and vegetables and spongy material, which could be implemented through fruity colours and using a spongy material for the base.

B:  But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's <laugh> sake with <laugh> remote control ? 
A:  No , but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit . 
A:  Yeah , but it that doesn't have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the the the the round curves . 
D:  Well , w we can uh  w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things . 
D:  <laugh> And um , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is uh is n <laugh> not easy for a remote control , but m yeah . 
A:  yeah , I do like uh the f uh to  the idea of making a a y uh , a catchy colour design and a d because I do  I think a dark colour would be nice too . 
C:  But pictures of fruit , vegetables vegetables  
A:  Maybe it's too much , you know . 
B:  But , we we have to um  There have to be the the the the firm colours , our own uh colours has to be in it . 
A:  But I don't think our our company colours are this fashionable . 
D:  If this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here . 
A:  How many colours are we gonna give it ? 
A:  Like two-tone colour ? T 
A:  I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , <other> and the cushions as well should be in another colour . 
B:  Not more than two colours I think . 
B:  It's a g a little bit too flashy . 
A:  I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s uh side . 
A:  I think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but  and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying , 
A:  I think this is kind of fruity , you know . Just round shapes with uh  
abst_sum - abstract: The group discussed how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme, as well as the company colours and logo.

A:  do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display , for example ? 
D:  Well , it's nice , of course . But I don't I don't know what to display on it . 
C:  Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it , for the channel you're on . 
D:  Yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen , because  
A:  Yeah , but  no . I do I think it's a bit redundant , actually . 
B:  Well well what would you display on it then ? 
C:  Uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide 
A:  But you're already watching the T_V_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control . 
A:  I really understand you want to make your job more exciting <laugh> by putting an L_C_D_ in it , 
A:  But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image . 
C:  When when you put uh maybe a colour L_C_D_ t uh screen on it , it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from  
D:  well , I'm coming back to the costs again , but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits . 
A:  and really , I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything , you know , on a design level . 
A:  Okay , we s skip the <laugh> L_C_D_ display . 
abst_sum - abstract: The group discussed whether to include an LCD screen, and eventually decided against it.

A:  Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute . 
A:  Well , you will read the minutes uh in the  you can find them in the  
D:  In the shared folder . 
A:  because I'm will now type them out . 
D:  You'll see in you email , I guess . 
C:  What are we going to do now ? 
abst_sum - abstract: The project manager closed the meeting and told the group they would receive emails about their tasks for the next meeting.

A:  But uh , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just <other> ordinary keyboard . 
A:  Well , you will read the minutes uh in the  you can find them in the  
D:  In the shared folder . 
A:  because I'm will now type them out . 
abst_sum - action: The project manager will write up the minutes and put them in the shared folder, using a keyboard instead of the digital pen.

D:  You'll see in you email , I guess . 
C:  What are we going to do now ? 
abst_sum - action: The rest of the group will receive instructions via email.

A:  Okay , we s skip the <laugh> L_C_D_ display . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will not feature an LCD screen.

A:  Maybe just bring it out in different colours , 
A:  but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that's also too much . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will be available in different colour schemes, but not with changeable fronts.

A:  But wha th our basic idea  y I mean , you gonna  we're probably gonna have like two type of materials , like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it . 
abst_sum - decisions: The case will be made of plastic and rubber.

A:  Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh uh ten uh rem 
D:  A mute and a teletext and a menu . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will feature power, skip, volume, mute, teletext and menu buttons.

A:  Uh , yeah . Uh , before we begin it , I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder , 
A:  It uh it uh still some technical difficulties 
A:  so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other . 
A:  But uh , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just <other> ordinary keyboard . 
abst_sum - problems: The project manager had problems using the digital pen to write the minutes.

B:  But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's <laugh> sake with <laugh> remote control ?

abst_sum - problems: The industrial designer was keen to incorporate an LCD screen, but the others were not so sure.

A:  The m material , I think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber . Uh 
A:  But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium , as well ? 
C:  But it it  then it uh  you can't throw it it . It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff 
B:  Uh , I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic . 
D:  On the other hand , if you want to make fruit  fruity stuff with uh
