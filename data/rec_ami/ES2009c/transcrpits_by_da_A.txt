That's great . 
Alright , 
let me just PowerPoint this up . 
<other> <other> <other> 
Right so um 
this meeting will be about the conceptual design , 
don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , 
it's just something important that we need to do . 
Um , think of it  's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . 
In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . 
Um . Right so um , 
apologies for the last meeting , 
it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , 
um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . 
Um , fair enough , 
thanks for the input , 
's always good . Um . 
So , 
basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , 
um , and gonna go through you , 
uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me 
um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . 
<other> And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic 
uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . 
So , 
perfect . 
So , 
without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to . 
Alright Nathan , 
take it away . 
It is Nathan right ? 
I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ? 
<other> Good . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Nice . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
What kind of th thickness are we looking at ? 
Okay , 
brilliant . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
<laugh> M Maybe  
is there an option that we can have that off or on 
so a person can select like  
Yeah I like the idea , 
it's a good idea . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Can we do marketing piloting too ? 
Try to see what kind  before we launch  can we see how they're received ? 
Okay . Okay . 
Okay , 
perfect . 
Great , 
thank you very much Nathan . 
That's perfect , 
so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here . 
<laugh> 
Fascinating , compelling even . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Tomatoes . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Slick , slick . 
Interface , oh the interface graphics for the um  
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah , it's like , yep <laugh> 
it's ubiquitous 
isn't it ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> Great , 
thanks for that Sarah . 
Ron ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team 
at the  <laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <laugh> Yeah , 
I can see . <laugh> 
Mm . 
Great . 
Great , wonderful Ron , cool . 
Lot of good ideas , good facts to have . 
That's what they need , it's like a little dongle 
it just sticks up this further 
so you don't have to stand up every time , 
just connect it , my kingdom . 
Right so , 
good to know all that stuff , 
thanks guys , um . <other> 
Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , 
um , I figure we can just go down the line 
and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um . 
Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um <other> various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ? 
'Kay . 
'Kay . 
Mm-hmm . 
To produce each one . 
Mm . 
<other> Hmm . 
Well . 
There is , 
it's just , it is a question of  and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money . 
Um , from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin <other> um that would mean selling it from twenty five . 
If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five . 
So  
<laugh> <laugh> From the board , 
um , well <other>  
That's true , 
I mean  
<other> And that's  to be fair the um the per cent of the market  
we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , 
we're gonna make  
I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , 
we just couldn't , not for twenty-five Euros , 
so 
we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins 
rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , 
but that's something that we can have finance deal with . 
Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen 
or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ? 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
No 
we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , 
there's always the opportunity , 
if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we  yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . 
Alright , 
let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our <other> um <other> our main selling point here . 
<other> So  
<other> The voice rec thing , 
I mean , <other> if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , 
I think we might have to drop the voice rec . 
Yeah . 
<other> Hmm . 
What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ? 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
<other> I can't see how it wouldn't , 
I mean , there's you know the old aphorism , 
you can have it fast , 
you can have it cheap 
or you can have it quality , 
pick two of three . 
You know , you can't you can't have all three . 
It's just impossible . 
Well 
if we're gonna pick betwe e 
alright 
so we have to pick between one of the two . Um . 
Otherwise , yeah , we just  it just becomes cost prohibitive . 
What  
which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ? 
'Kay . 
What does the cost look like Ron ? 
Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ? 
Nathan ? 
Mm . 
Right . 
<other> 
Mm . 
Okay . So 
I'm getting  
alright so 
more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Sorted . 
We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition . 
Yeah , 
well 
we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it  what <other> f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype 
but yeah that's our next step , 
it'll be a developing of prototype . 
Yes . 
We'll just run through it yeah , yeah , um . 
You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . 
Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? 
Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ? 
Mm . 
Mm . Yep . 
<laugh> <other> Right . 
Okay . 
What do you think Ron ? 
Okay . 
Hmm . 
<other> Yeah . 
Well 
we have to have buttons on it too as well . 
But that's done , that's no bother 
I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have  
or like um <other> who is it , 
Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass 
and you know 
and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers . 
I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing , 
it could still have the basic buttons on it . 
Um , 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well . 
And maybe a menu button and so forth , 
you know um 
use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever 
you know 
I mean we can sort that out . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah , 
I mean a nice  although we do um wh uh is  
I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing 
and get back to it 
but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um  
<other> Still , I mean , yeah , along those lines . 
Yeah I like that , I like that idea a lot . 
Um , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . 
And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh  using like a rubber kind of softer feel , 
um you know 
li lik 
if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit  gives just a bit . 
You know 
something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it . 
Mm 'kay . 
Yeah 
let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control . 
But to be fair , yeah , I mean , you just c you could just put it  literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up . 
<other> Yeah I like it , I like the idea , that's good . 
Um and we've sorted of discussed costs , 
<other> um . I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um . 
<other> We'll have more of an idea when the prototype  have more of a  
we'll have more of an idea later on . 
Um . And we just yeah go from there . 
<other> Um , so 
we've revisited the touch screen 
and more or less ruled that out , 
um , I think so we're more or less con we  wh wh 
we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um <other> a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex . 
Like maybe have menu things . 
Mm . 
Yes . 
<other> Yeah 
we've also got the the me the thing of , 
if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we  yeah . 
B But no I mean 
we could do a slide or a compartment , 
you know , 
like if it  say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there . 
Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um  like on a D_V_D_ player . 
You know 
you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them 
and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that . 
Well 
it seems like <other> 
I dunno 
it seems to me that we could just do the um  stick with the rubber 
'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um <other> rubber for the outside case 
we might as well stick with that um . 
Mm 'kay , um . 
<other> We've already kind of covered this as well . 
That seems to be selling <other> 
um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um . 
<other> Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . <other> 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
<other> Um . Yeah alright , well , 
more or less covered what we need to cover I think 
fi an an 
any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype . 
<other> Right . 
I was just gonna step on to um <other> <laugh> 
I wasn't ? 
Oh , 
my bad <laugh> 
um sorry . 
The 
um , yeah okay 
I was just gonna assign tasks in the next 
b anyth any oth 
any other final thoughts before we go ahead and 
 cool ? 
<other> Um . 
Yeah . 
Well 
then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , 
you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something . 
That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the  thing . 
Yeah , I think that's probably a good id 
okay so 
let's work on <other> uh multiple case colours . 
But yeah , 
stick with the same kind of kinda  yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . 
Cool . 
Alright , so 
we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . 
I want the uh  I'd like  
Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , 
what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . 
Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . <other> 
And um Ron if you can 
figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . 
Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . 
Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . 
Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , <other> um <laugh> using um <other> prototype building materials um <laugh> . 
And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well . 
So that's what to start with for now , 
is that alright , 
you guys feel clear about this ? 
Alright . 
I guess we'll just hit the bricks . 
Thanks guys .
