A:  Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . 
A:  Well , teletext goes out . 
A:  and they don't want it , 
A:  Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . 
abst_sum - abstract: There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product.

A:  because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . 
abst_sum - abstract: The target group will be people below 30.

D:  They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . 
D:  Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . 
D:  And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . 
D:  They also like that , 
abst_sum - abstract: It transpires that customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes, especially if they include LCD screens and speech recognition.

D:  Furthermore , it's uh <other> seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . 
D:  A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their <laugh> in their living room . 
D:  Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn . 
abst_sum - abstract: Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being difficult to learn and easy to lose.

C:  And the <other> the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , 
C:  The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . 
C:  Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , 
abst_sum - abstract: The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared.

C:  uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , 
C:  So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , 
B:  I like user-centr centred uh <other> uh also the best . 
abst_sum - abstract: The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons.

A:  And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . 
D:  No not clickable . 
A:  Uh well I think so , yes . Um  
D:  Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? 
abst_sum - abstract: They plan to include an LCD screen to display relevant information.

C:  and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , 
A:  <laugh> We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons  
C:  Channel , yeah . 
C:  Volume control . 
A:  Uh the mute button . 
A:  Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . 
A:  Menu button . 
C:  Yeah . I think that's important . 
abst_sum - abstract: Other functions are served by push buttons: OK, menu, screen sizing, AV, settings buttons, mute, digits 1-9, power, volume control, channel up/down with the last three types being prominent on the device.

A:  and the design comes into the next round ? 
abst_sum - abstract: The exact design and placement of the components will be decided in the next meeting.

A:  and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So  
abst_sum - action: Each member of the team will come for the next meeting with their views on function and design issues that they had not time to consolidate during this meeting.

D:  So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than  I think . 
abst_sum - decisions: The solution to complaints about remote controls being difficult to learn is to focus on an intuitive design instead of a thorough manual.

B:  I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . 
A:  but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . 
abst_sum - decisions: The idea of interchangeable fronts was mentioned again; if it were adopted, the company should be recognisable in all the available fronts as well as the remote itself.

C:  So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , 
C:  uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , 
B:  I like user-centr centred uh <other> uh also the best . 
abst_sum - decisions: The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons.

A:  And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . 
D:  No not clickable . 
D:  Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? 
A:  Uh well I think so , yes . Um  
abst_sum - decisions: An LCD screen is going to be used to display information, but would not be interactive.

A:  <laugh> We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons  
C:  Channel , yeah . 
C:  Volume control . 
A:  Uh the mute button . 
A:  Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . 
A:  Menu button . 
C:  Yeah . I think that's important . 
abst_sum - decisions: The buttons are going to include: OK, menu, screen sizing, AV, settings buttons, mute, digits 1-9, power, volume control, channel up/down.

A:  Alright so no button for that . 
A:  Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ? 
abst_sum - decisions: There is no need for a special button to recognise two-digit numbers.

None
abst_sum - decisions: The power button will be placed at the top separately.

C:  But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . 
A:  Th that's a bit uh waste . 
D:  I do think we have to put that underneath a clip . 
abst_sum - decisions: The less frequently used buttons will not be hidden under a flip, as it had been previously suggested, as there are not that many of them; they will just be clearly separated from the more important ones.

D:  But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences . 
A:  but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . 
A:  That's very irritating , I think . 
D:  Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was <other> t kinda true . 
B:  I think we we should use something like this um to um  The the channel up and channel down button ? <other> Yeah , in circle , you know ? 
D:  So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . 
B:  Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . 
D:  So the the <other> channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down . 
B:  No I don't think . 
C:  I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , 
C:  but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . 
abst_sum - problems: A discussion on ergonomic solutions like placing the main buttons (power, channel selection, volume) where they can be easily reached with the thumb (as many users complain of RSI), did not reach a conclusion as to whether this would actually cause more repetitive movements.

D:  Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . 
C:  It's going to be expensive . Yeah . 
D:  I don't have any information on that . So  <laugh> 
B:  I think that's uh difficult to realise also . 
D:  And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . 
D:  Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features . 
B:  Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition . 
B:  <other> Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . 
abst_sum - problems: Some advanced features, like LCD screen with program information or speech recognition, would be very important in order to attract their target group, but there are costing issues that have not been clarified yet.

D:  I think it should be at the top . 
B:  Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . 
A:  because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . 
A:  We don't want them to look like a calculator . 
C:  I think it's still important to have it at the top , 
abst_sum - problems: There was some disagreement as to whether the LCD screen should be placed at the top or the bottom of the remote.

D:  But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences . 
A:  but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . 
A:  That's very irritating , I think . 
B:  I think we we should use something like this um to um  The the channel up and channel down button ? <other> Yeah , in circle , you know ? 
D:  Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was <other> t kinda true . 
D:  So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . 
B:  Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . 
D:  So the the <other> channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down . 
B:  No I don't think . 
C:  I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , 
C:  but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . 
abst_sum - problems: No consensus was reached regarding the positioning of the main buttons (zapping, volume, power) either: should they be placed close together or more scattered (to avoid RSI complaints)?

A:  And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video . 
D:  Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh  
abst_sum - problems: A special AV button for direct access to the video channel, although its necessity was disputed, because there are alternative solutions that make it obsolete.
