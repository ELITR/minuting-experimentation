<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Oh . 
Oh . 
Oh , that's a shame . 
<other> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
No . 
I don't think  
Yeah . 
Yes 
you should  You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work . <other> 
Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think . 
Yeah right . 
It sh it should be there , the manual . 
But but not to explain how the remote works . 
Only   
Hmm . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
No . 
<other> 
<other> 
I think that's uh difficult to realise also . 
<other> 
No 
and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think . 
Yeah . 
<other> No . 
Oh you go . 
<laugh> 
<laugh>  
Yeah , go ahead . 
<other> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
High tech . <laugh> 
You can also like  
Yeah , I was thinking you can  <other> 
<other> 
Are some of the the the um  
Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . 
Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some 
Hmm ? 
Well  
Yeah alright , but  
Yeah , 
but if you s say them up and down , they they'll understand it  , I think . 
Eighty per cent would . 
Yeah that's true . 
Yeah but  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Well I thought um everybody on the website <other> uh would see the same thing , 
but obviously <other> that's not the case . 
Yeah . 
For instance you couldn't see this . <laugh> 
Um  
Yeah . Well I'm Mike  , User Interface Designer . 
The the method ? 
Well  I used my own experience with remotes , 
took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . 
Um  
Yes , 
these are from from another uh manufacturer . 
Um  This one is engineering-centred , 
so this one has the most functions and um things . 
Um  
I like user-centr centred uh <other> uh also the best . 
Um  
Well , I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff . 
Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one . 
But  
Yes . 
Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel . 
Um  
I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need . 
<other> I um I kinda like the shape . 
<other> I think this is what we talked about . 
But  
No 
I've  Well I showed it somewhere . Um  
<other> Oh yeah . 
I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . 
So we can can uh yeah customise the  
Mm ? <other> 
Yeah . <other> 
It's a front . 
It's not the the whole remote that changes , of course . 
You can  
Mm . 
Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . 
So l like Ericsson does  every uh  
S something like this . <other> 
It's recognisable . 
Um  
Yeah ? 
Yeah yeah . Something like that , 
in the  Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Um  Well so uh uh like I said I thought we'd we'd use more function . If we we had to include more functions . 
But we don't . 
So um  
Yeah . 
I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need . 
Maybe some less . 
Like eject we don't need , and some other buttons we don't need . 
I think uh  
Yeah , I will . 
I think uh for the remote um uh less is more . 
<other> The less buttons the better the design . Um  
We should go with that concept I think . 
I know . 
Mm . 
Yeah , 
but what kind of features ? 
Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition . 
But I've  
<laugh> 
Yeah , that's nice . <other> 
Yeah , 
we should keep that simple too . 
It will  <other> 
No , 
it should be uh integrated . 
I think  <other> 
Yeah , 
something like on um some radios in car . 
You  
Where it's , yeah , walking to  Yeah . <other> 
Wa Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<other> Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . 
Or maybe you will get that information uh  
<laugh> Yeah . 
At the top or at the bottom ? 
Yeah but  
Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . 
'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom . <other> 
Yeah , no Mm . 
Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , 
and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . 
I c 
Well I d I think that's that's ugly but  
<other> I th 
Yeah . 
Power button always 
 Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , y you gotta zap like this 
or <laugh> you want to  Yeah . 
Yeah you don't want  
You want uh  Yeah it it it must be a remote . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
At the bottom ? 
<other> In a few minutes  
Oh yeah , oh yeah , I totally agree . Yeah . 
<laugh> 
He's the boss . <laugh> 
No it's our job . 
For all of us I think . <other> 
<other> The ten numbers ? Yeah ? 
Volume ? 
I think we we should use something like this um to um  The the channel up and channel down button ? <other> Yeah , in circle , you know ? 
And and a volume control also in it . 
Yes , 
as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons . <other> 
Yeah . 
I think these should be in one big circle in the middle . 
<other> 
Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . 
They they need to be centred . 
<other> Volume hardly . 
No I don't think . 
Yeah but  
Yeah but  
No . <laugh> 
<other> The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important . So  
Well they are used four times an hour , so  
Power bu button should be left at the top . <other> 
Mm . Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Well consensus , um  We we can put it in the middle , so  
Alright . 
No . 
Well just when you push a one one and  
No , <other> 
if you  
On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other , <other> d it  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
We we can make <other> make uh a little row of like four buttons down here . 
Or at  
Yeah alright then . 
Oh , they can be small or round like buttons . 
Why go to video ? 
That's just zero . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Yeah , but you can can zap down  <other> 
Yes , I think th 
No , then you press ninety nine . 
I think go to video is an irrelevant button , but  
<other> 
Yeah well y you must have . 
Yeah you yeah you have one one button from <other> s set frequency o or something , 
and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh  
Yeah , alright . 
I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah . 
Yeah , the  
Or the volume or something like that . 
Your pen . 
I thought we'd uh lunch uh right now , or not ? 
Yeah , lunch break . 
 <laugh>
