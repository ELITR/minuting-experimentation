Well I'll uh start just with another presentation , 
so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting . 
<laugh> Okay . 
I've put some uh new things in the in the map . 
Uh oh . <other> 
This is it . 
I don't know the shortcut , so  
Ah F_ five . 
Well our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in . 
And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it . 
Well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we uh thought we had dec decided . 
But uh  
Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you . 
I think you have prepared uh all three uh ? <laugh> 
Um we'll look at th the new project requirements 
we uh  I dunno . 
Y you also have uh received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ? 
Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements , 
and I'll have a look if  
Well I think we should show them before your presentations , 
because it's not really uh smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't , because of the new requirements . 
Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions . 
We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be . 
And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely . Uh  
Uh yeah , I think so . <laugh> 
Well uh  the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet . 
Um <other> now I'll look at  show  this board . 
Um  
Well uh notes , first meeting . 
Now . 
I gave a disc a a presentation . 
Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards 
and then we discussed some first ideas . 
So we said that uh we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , 
and uh look at their uh remote controls . 
We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have , our technical releases . 
Uh not too many one buttons . 
One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . 
And um well they can have two functions , 
because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television . 
Um the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar . 
<laugh> It's uh one of our ideas . 
<laugh> Yeah well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago , 
so it's not quite uh  <laugh> But well I have to do it . 
The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from  , 
and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible . 
It should be uh recognisable at all times . 
Yes . 
Well fronts were to be  just like mobile telephones . 
And uh the technical aspects um  And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards . 
Well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting . 
It's quite logical al all of it . 
Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . 
I got this mail from uh our bosses . 
Well , teletext goes out . 
We will not use teletext . 
Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext . 
Well  
the second is a bit sh pity 
because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ 
and they don't want it , 
because of our time we have for this project . 
So that's a shame , 
because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . 
Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point . 
Um well it's a bit pity 
because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it . 
Yeah . 
Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . 
So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um  
Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . 
Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company . 
Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yes . 
I I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have , our company . 
It's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics . 
So maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something . 
Alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations . 
You want to start ? 
<laugh> Oh you have to start ? 
I didn't see anything about uh who had to start . 
Well s then start . 
Okay . 
Well uh  
 You already uh opened uh PowerPoint . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<other> Well  <other> 
It should actually uh  It should actually be loose from the television , 
because it can also be used for other televisions . 
So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . 
No 
you can click it on your television . 
<laugh> Yeah in another room , yeah . 
Well yes . 
Yeah . 
Well we'll have a look at it , yeah . 
Yep . 
Well there sh should always be a menu , 
but it c can be very short . 
Yes okay . 
Well we are a design team , 
we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point . 
So 
Well we'll have a look . 
Um yes ? 
Yep . 
Well  
Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we can't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh  
Yeah . 
Well  
Yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh  
<laugh> Nigh 
I know . <laugh> 
It's not yet a standard uh development uh those so  
We sh 
Yeah absolutely . 
Yep . 
 
'Kay . 
Alright . 
Yes . 
Well you  
I c I can uh still see your presentation . 
It's in the  
Well uh next um I dunno who is next . 
Yes . 
Well go ahead . 
<sighs> 
Yip . 
F_ five . 
<laugh> F_ five . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Click . <laugh> 
Yep . 
<laugh> 
<clicks tongue> 
<other> 
Yeah . 
So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that . 
And a button for T_V_ . So  
<laugh> 
Well but but <other> 
if you have um the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same um well moves . 
But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , 
and that's on of the things about R_S_I_ . 
No 
but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . 
Yes 
I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons . 
<other> 
Well it it's  
Well also i if someone puts <other> picks up his uh remote  
Yeah . If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel . 
That's very irritating , I think . 
Yep . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> That's your part of the job . <laugh> 
Yep . 
<laugh> Okay . 
Well we understand . 
We understand . 
Oh right , no . 
Nice . 
Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation . 
How late is did we start his presentation uh ?  
Wha 
Yeah . 
Well then we have still the time , so  <laugh> 
But we do have to come to a decision , right later on . 
So  
<laugh>  
Oh yeah ? 
Uh ? 
<laugh> Okay , yeah well . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I like user-centred . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
We also do that . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Well absolutely , 
but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . 
So we cannot just uh make someone w 
No 
but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front . 
So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone . 
Yeah , we must . 
Yeah well and and  
Yes . 
'Kay . 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front . 
Those kind of things . 
Yes . Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Alright . 
Yeah ? 
Well what if we um  
I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , 
and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , 
a f a little uh  
You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do . 
Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m um a lot , 
but not  
Yeah . 
<laugh> Competitors . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Well maybe w we could uh s 
On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something , 
or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . 
And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . 
Yeah . 
Those kind of things , 
uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s . 
And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you're currently watching . 
Yeah . 
For example . 
It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it . 
Yeah . 
Well maybe . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
R_D_S_s or something . 
Well I think it's you got  It just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling , 
and it's not uh  That's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh  
Yeah . 
No . 
Uh well I think so , yes . Um  
We're g 
No but we're we'll have to look into that . 
Um we can use this board again , I think . 
Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue . 
<other> Where is my presentation ? <laugh> Uh  
 
Uh  
Well  
I mean we're all here now , I think . 
These I've already given you . 
So we have to decide on the different remote control functions . 
So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special . 
Yes . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
<other> 
That thing is terrible . 
Uh  
Well  
Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point , 
because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . 
So and and I I like to use the ones on the top . 
So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window  
Yes 
but we we we we don't want that . 
We don't want them to look like a calculator . 
We want to look it like our original but familiar  
<laugh> Yea 
Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh  <other> We White ? <laugh> 
Width . 
Uh format yeah format ? Line width ? Width ? 
Yeah ? 
It's a bit off . 
Well . <laugh> 
Well uh let's uh talk about that later uh  <laugh> 
It's special pen . 
Yeah . 
No . 
I think it should be at the button , bottom . 
Bottom . The L_C_D_ . 
Yeah . 
Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , 
and then look at the design . 
Because we have to decide this . 
Yeah . 
Yes . 
<laugh> Well we have a power button . 
Guys ? 
Guys ? 
<laugh> We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons  
Uh  
Yes . 
Uh the mute button . 
I h love that one . 
Yes . 
Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . 
Well that's that's also design . 
Yes . 
Um  <other> 
Well h ho 
Yes . Yes . 
They are for some uh video uh  
<clicks tongue> 
Apart . 
So people have to move their hand . 
And they get less uh complaints of R_S_I_ . 
 
That's what I always do , 
because all my i important buttons are the same place . 
Yes ? 
Well not  
Yes . 
Uh-huh . 
Up and down far apart from each other ? 
Well not too much . <laugh> 
Well for example the power button , 
you can <other>  
If someone is constantly z zapping , it's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it . 
Because I have someone  But the buttons is way . 
So that one can be put away . 
The power button can uh be uh uh  
<other> 
Yes . 
Oh man , 
five minutes . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
well five minutes left . 
Yep . 
Um how are we going to do it with those numbers ? 
Well I have it here . 
Yeah well that's going to take too too much time . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
Well the L_C_D_ . 
Um you are Industrial , 
you are User Interface . 
So I think it's going to go to Mike . 
But you will have to make consensus with  . 
Well  
Well it's a bit hard , 
because we are going to be uh individually . 
That's a bit uh  
Yes . 
Yes it is . 
Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions , 
and the design comes into the next round ? 
Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ? 
Alright these functions . 
The number f 
Well yes , that's alright . 
W the number function . 
Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ? 
How do you want it to do then ? 
It it has to r recognise one as <other> there could still come more . 
Yes . 
Alright so no button for that . 
Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote ? 
So  
No , 
we'd uh just said we didn't uh  
<other> Well uh  <laugh> 
<other> Um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant . 
So just for a television is that all we need ? 
Teletext is gone . 
So all those buttons that <other> ar are to do with teletext  
Oh screen placing . 
We'll have uh those uh buttons about uh  And uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting . 
Uh there's um <other> screen . You can make it wider and less wide . 
And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video . 
Those two ? 
But it's just two , and we make a clip ? 
Th that's a bit uh waste . 
Yes . 
Or at the top . <laugh> 
Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go . <laugh> 
Yes . 
Yeah 
Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote . 
Yes ? Yes . Yes . 
Well any other uh  
Go to video , that's always on your remote control . 
To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_ . 
Well l n no not at not at my remote . 
Yeah . 
Yes . 
I don't . 
I go to ninety-nine . <laugh> 
Th that's the button uh  No . 
No you can ch push zero . 
Yeah . Yeah , 
I I think that one button is uh  I use it uh  
Yeah ? 
These buttons , I don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote . 
It's it's incorporated with p m plus and down , uh those  
<other> 
So we still  have one uh four ? 
Ch ch 
Okay . 
Oh the Okay button ? <laugh> 
Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . 
Menu button . 
Channel , setting , menu . 
 
We have to go . <laugh> 
Okay . 
So um Save . 
Yes see . 
Yes 
I have put it in . 
Here . 
<laugh> 
Alright . 
Guys ? 
We're going to uh go to our uh rooms , 
and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So  
<laugh> 
Well see you uh  
W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now uh so uh  
Lunch . 
Ah . We didn't exactly do everything but  <laugh> So
