Great man . 
Who starts ? 
Alright , great . 
Alright . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yes . 
'Kay . 
Yeah . 
No . 
You're the only one . <laugh> 
Alright . 
'Kay . 
Alright . 
Right . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Alright . 
Yeah . 
But let's forget about it . 
It's just time-consuming , 
so we uh have to go on . 
Yes . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Right . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> I think I have to start . 
<laugh> Oh no , no problem . 
I I just have to uh to think which file's mine , 
'cause I was uh bit in a hurry . 
I think it's this one . 
But I'm not sure . 
 
Hmm ? Yeah . S 
Right . 
Yes . This is it . 
Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . 
Um to start with these points . 
Uh next sheet ? 
Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , 
because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . 
Uh , furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use . 
<other> Um then I tell something about um the most important issues . 
So we have to focus on those three thing three things . 
And in the end I'll um show you our target <other> audience or our target product users , customers . 
Well , <other> um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly . 
That's seventy five per cent of the current users . 
They don't like it , 
so we might think about fronts in that section . Um  
They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . 
So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control . 
<other> Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . 
Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . 
So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . 
Furthermore , it's uh <other> seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . 
Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . 
Yeah , yeah right . 
Right . 
A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their <laugh> in their living room . 
So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . 
I dunno , maybe that's an idea . 
'Cause it's uh a big  I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room . 
Yeah 
but what if you lose your click-on device ? 
Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ? 
Nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room . 
So  
Well a beeping device would be  
Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . 
Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn . 
So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it . 
Yeah but people don't read manuals . 
No . 
I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual . 
Yeah . Right . 
And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes . 
Alright . 
And we don't have much time . 
So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than  I think . 
Yeah right , right . 
Next point . Um R_S_I_ . 
Well that's about twenty per cent I thought . 
But uh the designer should uh take it uh <laugh> should uh  Wie zeg ik dat ? Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote . 
It should be a good in your hand . <other> 
Right , 
this is the most important part . 
Um , we're  
Like the requirements said , we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience . 
Um , <other> that's about sixty per cent of the market , 
so it's uh quite important . 
Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . 
Uh  I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that . 
So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs . 
Yeah but <other> they think it's really important . 
So if we want to s 
If we have a big  
<other> If we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , I dunno . 
We have to uh  
Yeah , 
I don't know . 
I don't have any information on that . So  <laugh> 
Right . 
And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . 
They also like that , 
but research is very uh costly . So  
Yeah , but <other> it <other> it might be important for the sale . 
Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition . 
So we might consider L_C_D_ screens . 
Alright . 
Alright . 
Um , I think that's it . Um  
I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . 
So you can  
Right . 
Yeah . Right . 
Alright . 
<laugh> Next button . <laugh> 
Oh right . 
Purple <laugh> . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . A bit . 
Maybe you can select it . So it uh inverts . 
 the p the whole picture . 
Nah , uh never mind . 
Yeah . 
Alright . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Right . 
Can I say something ? 
Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . 
Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . 
Well teletext is not an option , so that uh  
But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences . 
Right . 
Make them big , 
make them easy to uh to press . 
Right . 
Yeah , right . Right . 
Yeah , that's right . 
That's right . That's right . 
We 
But  
Yeah . 
That's very important . 
And  
But is that is that useable ? 
Do people , uh when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ? 
It's a f it's a new feature , 
you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it . 
Yeah , he feels it immediately . 
Yeah , that's right . Yeah . 
Right , continue . 
Sorry . <laugh> 
Yeah , that's right . 
Alright . 
<laugh> 
Alright . 
Yeah , it's clear . 
<other> I dunno . 
I think uh w About twenty minutes ago ? 
Losing time losing time . <laugh> 
Yeah right . 
So  
I don't think so . 
Yeah right . 
These are already in use ? 
Alright , okay . 
Well  
Yeah , me too . 
Mm . 
But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ? 
Alright . 
Yeah , right . 
Yeah . 
But it  
Yeah , that's right 
Yeah , that's a must . 
We must have that . 
We can make a symbol of the company right here . 
And <other> if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front . So the symbol's always on 
 Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
But let's not focus on the front  . <laugh> 
Alright . 
Yeah , I agree . 
I've I've got another point . 
Um there are two target audi audiences , 
and we've uh chose for the younger one . 
Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features . 
They are high high interested in feature . 
But they are more critical . 
Fo 
Yeah , critical . 
So  
The younger audience . 
So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people . 
Mm-hmm . 
Clip aren't used much . 
Yeah right . 
Yeah but  Yeah . 
Here , look at these numbers . 
The newest features are , like I said , are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control . 
Our audience , these people , are very like these uh features . 
You see ? 
So we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent . 
The concurrent ? <laugh> 
Competitors , right . 
<other> So , I do think we have to uh have some features . 
Even though they cost a little more . 
Right . Right . 
Like a ticker-tape . 
Which programme you are l watching or something . 
Yeah , right . Yeah right . 
No not clickable . 
Nah , no no no . 
Yeah , 
just at at the top . 
So when you s <other> you sit like this you can can watch . 
I think it should be at the top . 
Yeah right . It's a ticker-tape idea . 
Well it's just one script . <other> 
Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming . 
So I don't think that's the issue . 
Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? 
'Kay . 
Right , 
I don't know if I can find that , but  
Next time . 
Yeah right . 
Yeah , I understand what you're saying . 
We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look . 
Right . 
At the top . 
I think the top is more uh  
When you s How do you zap ? 
You just sit in your chair ? 
With the remote ? 
Yeah but that's where your hand ball might be . 
Yeah , I dunno . 
We'll draw two , 
and then we'll see uh  <other> 
No <laugh> 
Um he thinks  
Yeah , right . 
He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom , 
and I think it's better at the top . 
But your  
Yeah . 
The the ticker  The L_C_D_ is like like small . 
<other> It's it's wide . 
It's not not high . But <other>  
Yeah right . 
But  We're making a remote with <other> with a few functions you know . 
We 
<other> 
High-tech  . <laugh> 
<other> 
Width . 
 Th that's not a problem . 
<other> When I draw here it 
 Oh . Huh ? 
Yeah , it's off . 
<other> It <laugh> it needs to be calibrated again . Well <other>  
Where ? 
<other> Alright , we have to make a decision now , 
because we don't have much time . Um  
I think we have uh a few functions , 
and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it , 
and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand . 
At the bot 
So  
We are two uh V_S_ two . <laugh> 
Right . Great . 
And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s . 
It's uh your it's your job . <laugh> 
Yeah , right . 
Alright , let's keep it central . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Right . 
You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance . 
Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was <other> t kinda true . 
When  <laugh> when you uh put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , 
and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about . 
So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . 
Um  
Frequency of uh button use . 
Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour . You can see . 
So the the <other> channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down . 
 <other> You 
thinking uh about R_S_I_ ? 
Y look at uh look at the frequency . 
Nei not too much , but  
Nei nei nei n I I totally agree . 
But just  
Yeah . Right . 
Yeah . I agree . 
And should and should be red . 
Right , just make some decisions . 
The most important things we have to uh  
I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now . 
Just uh you decide that , 
you decide that , 
and <other> ready . 
Yeah . 
Nei . We're  No  <other> 
We're deciding now , so  
Top or bottom ? 
Okay . 
Yeah , right . Okay . 
Yeah , okay . 
No . 
Do you still have the pictures over there ? 
Yeah , that's about it . 
You do need the uh multi Or did uh  
No , like this one . 
You do need them ? 
Yeah , I know . 
But are we  
Alright , alright uh  <laugh> Now okay . 
Right . 
Yeah , 
it's most useable this way . 
<other> 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Right . 
I do think we have to put that underneath a clip . 
<other> 
Yeah . Okay , right . 
Well if you <other> you take those th If you <other>  
Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh  
Yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ . 
Ah uh well whatever , <other> . 
Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , 
if you wa if you have a new T_V_ . You have to set the channels . 
Right all th these uh different buttons you have to  
Ah , I do . <laugh> 
Right . 
That's the only one we put uh in there . 
For a screen uh fu uh channel setting . 
Programme , right . 
Uh  
<other> 
 
Ah . Great . 
Alright . 
Ah . Okay .  
<laugh> Get into my belly . <laugh>
