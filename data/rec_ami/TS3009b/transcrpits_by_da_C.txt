Mm . 
Well , yeah . 
No . <laugh> 
Oh . 
We have forty minutes for this uh discussion ? 
Alright . 
Huh ? 
<other> Yeah . 
<laugh> <other> 
Mm-hmm , now it's right . 
It's meant to be easily wiped out , yeah . <other> 
Mm-hmm . 
I I disagree , 
but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree I guess . 
Oh , alright . 
Yeah , we are a <other> real fashionable company . 
I read uh I read it on the  
I didn't know what company we were , 
but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff . 
So it has to be uh a modern design . 
That's important to know , uh when you design a thing of course . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<other> The order ? No . <other> 
<laugh> You can zap away . Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh . 
<other> Oh ? 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . Uh  
I didn't read it ? 
Oh , alright . 
 users to uh add one ? Do you think ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah alright . 
Because they don't use it ? Alright . 
Well maybe for the  If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I don't know it ? 
<other> Isn't it part of the of the u 
No . No . Never mind . 
Consider the m 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
It's going to be expensive . Yeah . 
Well we'll uh consider it uh . 
We'll think abo we'll think  
No , we'll look we'll look into that later . 
Alright ? 
We have very demanding clients . 
Yeah , yeah , alright . 
Well we'll consider both 
and and see what uh what what we can find , I think . 
We don't rule them out uh yet . 
Shall I give a technical talk ? 
Alright . 
Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design . 
<other> We have that here . 
Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the  
F_ F_ five . 
Yep . 
Well , the working design , 
that's my uh  
Well alright uh , you know who I am and what I do . 
So uh we have this . 
It's a bit uh unclear 
because I wanted to copy paste something . 
It was originally in black and white 
but it became black and purple . 
But I think you can read it . 
Um well um I think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . 
Uh well you can see uh  
 
And I then can select I can select on the dings  
It goes to the next page . 
Well , you can read it , 
it's not too difficult . 
Meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . 
You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , 
uh and the sender , w which is the LED , 
the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set . 
And uh the source is of course the user . 
Uh the user interface is um <other> uh the <other> the  the buttons of course . 
And the <other> the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , 
and the chip uh sends it to the LED , 
and the LED sends it to the receiver . 
That's the that's the basic idea . 
Very basic . 
Um well I have uh <other> uh <laugh> put it in a in in in a <other> a couple of basic steps . 
Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . 
It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed . 
The key  a signal to a chip , 
uh the chip senses the connection . <other> uh and recognise the key . 
So <other> well you understand . 
The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . 
And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course . 
Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , 
and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the <other> the signal , and performs the assigned task . 
Ah bu Yeah , but we don't . 
Uh we  <laugh> 
No no , but  Yeah . 
Exactly . 
Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote . 
I've some couple of pictures here . 
It's a very basic one . 
And uh  if we if we're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it , it uh won't look anything like this , but  
This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . 
It has uh very little buttons and  
But it it uh it's it's quite um  
Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . 
They're uh far enough apart and an anything . 
It's not very um uh not very high-tech uh 
indeed , 
and it's not very user-friendly . 
Uh if you look at the shape , it's uh just a simple long box uh shape . 
So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , 
uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , 
and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , 
because they are the the most important buttons 
and you can immediately  
You don't have to look and and search for them . 
Well you you can't have any uh every button <other> under the thumb , of course . 
Yeah . 
Well ,  . 
But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb . 
I think that's a good idea , 
and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , 
because uh they don't use it uh all the time . 
Well it's uh pretty pretty <other> basically uh as you said . 
And I have some pictures of the inside workings , 
but uh I don't want to get too technical , 
because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you . 
So yeah  exactly  
this is uh how it uh looks from the inside . 
And uh well that's about it I think . 
Oh yeah , I still have this . 
Oh I had to delete this , 
but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new  
But I had too too little time , 
but uh don't uh don't look at it please . 
I I think it's it's clear uh how it works . 
Alright . 
That's the most important thing . 
Alright . Uh  
Right . 
Yeah , 
uh there are different uh  We have all have different home pages , with different links . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
 You can't really see uh the differ from different sides . 
But I think uh  
Uh you can draw it if you  Yeah . 
We can put it on the on the back side . 
Yeah , so that you don't replace the symbol , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ? 
The younger uh  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh 
<other> uh  
No 
um mm usually  
But  
Yeah I think <other> m most  
Most uh  <other> 
Mm-hmm . Uh . 
Yeah . Our competitor . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have , 
uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen . <other> 
But should it uh really be uh clickable , uh <other> 
or <other> or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy . <other> 
But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and <other> that kind of thing . 
Alright . 
Shouldn't we start with the most important parts ? 
The L_C_D_ screen alright  
but we should start with the power button ? 
Uh  
Huh ? 
And then uh  
Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here . 
<other> I dunno what uh you were talking about but  
 we are busy with something  . 
Uh-huh . 
Why do you think it's better at the bottom ? 
But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , 
so that there's room for the for the interface . 
Uh-huh . 
And and we can  <other> 
Bottom . 
Well <other> that's <other> a bit exaggerated . 
Well , I agree with you  . 
It's it's also more recognisable . 
It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top . <laugh> 
Yeah w well , 
but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe <other> important aspect like familiarity uh completely away , 
uh because <other> I think it's uh  
I think it's still important to have it at the top , 
because it's uh it's more familiar that way . 
<laugh> A little a little bit . 
<laugh> Maybe you should another pen . 
Maybe that's uh better . 
 You e you only have one pen for that screen . Yeah . 
Yeah . I I agree . 
Well I'm the <other> I I'm the designer , so um  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Uh we uh we were busy with that . 
Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing . 
So , we have the power button . 
Yeah of course . 
Uh it's uh . Yeah . W wh 
While you have to agree , I can say  it's like this and <other> you must agree . Yeah . 
Channel , yeah . 
Volume control . 
Um  
Well let's look at your uh design . Uh  
Uh-huh . 
 Yeah . 
But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a D_V_D_ player or something . So  
Yeah , 
it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand . 
Y  
Yeah . It's good to move uh from time to time . Yeah . 
No but now y 
W would we have to choose a way in middle ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Mm-hmm . 
<other> Oh . 
Far apart ? 
<laugh> <other> 
I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , 
but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . 
Yeah . 
C c can you make you make  
We can use uh the drawing board now , I think . 
Uh it it doesn't work well 
but  But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing . 
Mm . Alright . 
Well uh yeah I I still think it's it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top , so 
 Yeah . 
You say familiarity isn't important but  <other> 
Yeah d 
Yeah . 
As we we we we agreed , we do have a L_C_D_ . 
So that's that's enough . Yeah . 
There's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero . 
Oh , like that . 
Um  
They'd recognise it . 
Th that's the most  
That that's very easy . Yeah . 
I think these are the the most important functions . 
 basic function . 
Oh yeah . 
Uh just two just two under uh under uh  <other> <sighs> 
I I think uh  
But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . 
Uh that's that's too complicated . 
You can just put it somewhere 
 They they aren't used much , not as much as those other , 
so you can put it somewhere  
Yeah s bit smaller and s 
Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah . 
Yeah or at the top , yeah . 
What do you think uh those those buttons ? 
Above or down ? 
And w where ? 
Well we design it later . 
We have it , and we design later where everything goes . Yeah . 
The the video channel uh ? 
No no not always . 
Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel . 
But it's easy to go  <other> 
If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero . 
It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button . 
Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah , sk <other> 
Yeah y you you you you have screen width . 
Yeah to uh oh yeah of course 
to configure the programme the  Yeah . 
Yeah . 
You should  
Yeah . I think that's important . 
Uh   And and the settings to change the brightness <other> 
the settings to change the brightness and the contrast . 
Channel , yeah . 
Chief ? 
Chief ? 
Th the menu menu button is also important . 
Then you can uh  
Where ? <laugh> 
I don't see it . 
Oh Menu , alright . 
In the menu . 
And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something . 
Because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu . 
Yeah . Or the volume , yeah . 
Yes chief . 
Yeah this is this is your thing . 
I am hungry . <laugh> 
See you later mate . <other>
