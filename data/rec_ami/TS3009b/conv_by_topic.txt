D:  Great man . Who starts ? 
A:  Well I'll uh start just with another presentation , so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting . 
D:  Alright , great . Alright . 
A:  <laugh> Okay . I've put some uh new things in the in the map . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Uh oh . <other> This is it . I don't know the shortcut , so  Ah F_ five . Well our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in . And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it . 
C:  Mm . 
D:  Yes . 
A:  Well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we uh thought we had dec decided . But uh  Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you . 
D:  'Kay . 
A:  I think you have prepared uh all three uh ? <laugh> Um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh  I dunno . Y you also have uh received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ? 
C:  Well , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  No . <laugh> 
D:  No . You're the only one . <laugh> 
A:  Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements , and I'll have a look if  Well I think we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really uh 
C:  Oh . 
D:  Alright . 
A:  smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't , because of the new requirements . Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions . We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be . 
D:  'Kay . 
A:  And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely . Uh  
C:  We have forty minutes for this uh discussion ? 
A:  Uh yeah , I think so . <laugh> Well uh  the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet . 
C:  Alright . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Alright . 
A:  Um <other> now I'll look at  show  this board . Um  Well uh notes , first meeting . Now . I gave a disc a a presentation . Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas . So we said that uh we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , and uh look at their uh remote controls . We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have , our technical releases . Uh not too many one buttons . One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . And um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television . 
D:  Right . 
C:  Huh ? <other> Yeah . 
A:  Um the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar . <laugh> It's uh one of our ideas . <laugh> Yeah well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago , so it's not quite uh  <laugh> But well I have to do it . The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from  , and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible . 
C:  <laugh> <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm , now it's right . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  It should be uh recognisable at all times . Yes . Well fronts were to be  just like mobile telephones . 
C:  It's meant to be easily wiped out , yeah . <other> 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  And uh the technical aspects um  And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards . Well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting . It's quite logical al all of it . 
C:  Mm-hmm .

A:  Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . I got this mail from uh our bosses . Well , teletext goes out . We will not use teletext . 
B:  Oh . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext . Well  
C:  I I disagree , but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree I guess . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ and they don't want it , because of our time we have for this project . 
B:  Oh . 
D:  Alright . 
C:  Oh , alright . 
B:  Oh , that's a shame . 
A:  So that's a shame , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point . Um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it . 
D:  Yeah . But let's forget about it . It's just time-consuming , so we uh have to go on . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <other> 
A:  Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um  Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company . 
D:  Yes . 
C:  Yeah , we are a <other> real fashionable company . I read uh I read it on the  I didn't know what company we were , but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff . So it has to be uh a modern design . That's important to know , uh when you design a thing of course . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Mm . <laugh> 
A:  Okay . Yes . I I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have , our company . It's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  So maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something .

A:  Alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations . You want to start ? <laugh> Oh you have to start ? I didn't see anything about uh who had to start . Well s then start . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . <other> I think I have to start . <laugh> Oh no , no problem . I I just have to uh to think which file's mine , 'cause I was uh bit in a hurry . 
C:  <other> The order ? No . <other> 
B:  Mm . <laugh> 
A:  Okay . Well uh  
D:  I think it's this one . But I'm not sure .  
A:   You already uh opened uh PowerPoint . 
D:  Hmm ? Yeah . S Right . 
B:  <cough> 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yes . This is it . 
topic_description:	None


D:  Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . Um to start with these points . Uh next sheet ? 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . Uh , furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use . <other> Um then I tell something about um the most important issues . So we have to focus on those three thing three things . And in the end I'll um show you our target <other> audience or our target product users , customers . 
D:  Alright . Um , I think that's it . Um  
A:  Alright . 
D:  I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . So you can  Right . 
A:  Yes . Well you  I c I can uh still see your presentation . 
D:  Yeah . Right . 
A:  It's in the  
topic_description:	None


D:  Well , <other> um the first findings are that people um 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  think most controls are very kind of ug ugly . That's seventy five per cent of the current users . They don't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . Um  They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control . <other> Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . Furthermore , it's uh <other> seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . Yeah , yeah right . 
C:  <laugh> You can zap away . Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . Uh  
D:  Yeah but people don't read manuals . 
C:  I didn't read it ? Oh , alright .  users to uh add one ? Do you think ? 
D:  No . 
B:  No . I don't think  
D:  I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Yeah alright . Because they don't use it ? Alright . 
B:  Yes you should  You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work . <other> 
A:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah . Right . 
A:  Well there sh should always be a menu , but it c can be very short . 
D:  And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes . 
B:  Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think . 
A:  Yes okay . 
C:  Well maybe for the  If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I don't know it ? 
D:  Alright . 
B:  Yeah right . It sh it should be there , the manual . But but not to explain how the remote works . Only   
D:  And we don't have much time . So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than  I think . 
A:  Well we are a design team , we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point . 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah right , right . 
C:  <other> Isn't it part of the of the u No . No . Never mind . 
B:  <other> 
A:  So Well we'll have a look . Um yes ? 
D:  Next point . Um R_S_I_ . Well that's about twenty per cent I thought . But uh the designer should uh take it uh <laugh> should uh  Wie zeg ik dat ? Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote . It should be a good in your hand . <other> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Consider the m Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yep . 
D:  Right , this is the most important part .

D:  A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their <laugh> in their living room . So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . I dunno , maybe that's an idea . 'Cause it's uh a big  I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room . So  <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> Well  <other> 
C:  Oh . <other> Oh ? 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  It should actually uh  It should actually be loose from the television , because it can also be used for other televisions . So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . No you can click it on your television . 
D:  Yeah but what if you lose your click-on device ? Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ? 
A:  <laugh> Yeah in another room , yeah . Well yes . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room . 
B:  <other> 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  So  Well a beeping device would be  Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn . So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it . 
A:  Well we'll have a look at it , yeah . 
topic_description:	None


D:  Um , we're  Like the requirements said , we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience . Um , <other> that's about sixty per cent of the market , so it's uh quite important . Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . Uh  I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that . So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs . 
A:  Well  Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we can't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh  
C:  It's going to be expensive . Yeah . 
B:  No . 
D:  Yeah but <other> they think it's really important . So if we want to s If we have a big  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> If we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , I dunno . We have to uh  
C:  Well we'll uh consider it uh . 
A:  Well  Yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh  <laugh> Nigh I know . <laugh> 
C:  We'll think abo we'll think  
D:  Yeah , I don't know . I don't have any information on that . So  <laugh> 
B:  <other> 
C:  No , we'll look we'll look into that later . Alright ? 
D:  Right . And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . They also like that , but research is very uh costly . So  
B:  <other> I think that's uh difficult to realise also . 
D:  Yeah , but <other> it <other> it might be important for the sale . 
C:  We have very demanding clients . 
A:  It's not yet a standard uh development uh those so  
B:  <other> No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think . 
D:  Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition . So we might consider L_C_D_ screens . 
A:  We sh Yeah absolutely . 
B:  Yeah . <other> No . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , alright . Well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , I think . We don't rule them out uh yet . 
D:  Alright . 
A:  Yep .  'Kay .

A:  Well uh next um I dunno who is next . You uh got uh  
C:  Shall I give a technical talk ? Alright . 
B:  Oh you go . 
A:  Yes . Well go ahead . <sighs> 
C:  Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design . 
A:  Yip . 
C:  Meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set . 
B:  Yeah , go ahead . 
D:  Yeah . Alright . 
C:  And uh the source is of course the user . Uh the user interface is um <other> uh the <other> the  the buttons of course . And the <other> the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver . That's the that's the basic idea . Very basic . 
B:  <other> 
A:  Yep . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Um well I have uh <other> uh <laugh> put it in a in in in a <other> a couple of basic steps . Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  The key  a signal to a chip , uh the chip senses the connection . <other> uh and recognise the key . So <other> well you understand . The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course . 
A:  <clicks tongue> <other> 
C:  Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the <other> the signal , and performs the assigned task . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that . And a button for T_V_ . So  
C:  Ah bu Yeah , but we don't . Uh we  <laugh> No no , but  Yeah . Exactly . Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote . I've some couple of pictures here . It's a very basic one . And uh  if we if we're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it , it uh won't look anything like this , but  
B:  <other> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . 
C:  And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh I don't want to get too technical , because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you . 
A:  Yep . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah , that's right . 
A:  <laugh> That's your part of the job . <laugh> 
C:  So yeah  exactly  this is uh how it uh looks from the inside . And uh well that's about it I think . Oh yeah , I still have this . Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new  But I had too too little time , but uh don't uh 
A:  Yep . 
D:  Alright . 
A:  <laugh> Okay . Well we understand . We understand . Oh right , no . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  don't look at it please . I I think it's it's clear uh how it works . Alright . That's the most important thing . 
D:  Alright . Yeah , it's clear . 
A:  Nice . 
C:  Alright . Uh  
topic_description:	None


C:  <other> We have that here . Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the  F_ F_ five . 
A:  F_ five . <laugh> F_ five . 
C:  Yep . Well , the working design , that's my uh  
D:  Alright . <laugh> Next button . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Well alright uh , you know who I am and what I do . So uh we have this . It's a bit uh unclear because I wanted to copy paste something . It was originally in black and white but it became black and purple . But I think you can read it . Um well um I think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . Uh well you can see uh  
D:  Oh right . Purple <laugh> . 
B:  <laugh>  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . A bit . Maybe you can select it . So it uh inverts . 
C:   And I then can select I can select on the dings  It goes to the next page . 
D:   the p the whole picture . Nah , uh never mind . 
A:  Click . <laugh> 
C:  Well , you can read it , it's not too difficult . 
topic_description:	None


C:  It has uh very little buttons and  But it it uh it's it's quite um  Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . They're uh far enough apart and an anything . It's not very um 
B:  <laugh> High tech . <laugh> 
C:  uh not very high-tech uh indeed , and it's not very user-friendly . Uh if you look at the shape , it's uh just a simple long box uh shape . So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur . Yeah . 
D:  Right . Can I say something ? Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . Well teletext is not an option , so that uh  But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Yeah , because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately  
D:  Right . Make them big , make them easy to uh to press . 
A:  Well but but <other> if you have um the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same um well moves . But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , and that's on of the things about R_S_I_ . 
C:  You don't have to look and and search for them . 
B:  You can also like  
D:  Right . Yeah , right . Right . 
B:  Yeah , I was thinking you can  <other> <other> 
D:  Yeah , that's right . That's right . That's right . We 
B:  Are some of the the the um  
C:  Well you you can't have any uh every button <other> under the thumb , of course . 
A:  No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would 
D:  But  Yeah . That's very important . And  
A:  reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . 
B:  Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some Hmm ? 
A:  Yes I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons . 
D:  But is that is that useable ? Do people , uh when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ? 
A:  <other> 
D:  It's a f it's a new feature , you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it . 
B:  Well  
A:  Well it it's  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah alright , but  Yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they'll understand it  , I think . Eighty per cent would . 
A:  Well also i if someone puts <other> picks up his uh remote  Yeah . If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel . That's very irritating , I think . Well . <laugh> No . 
C:  Well ,  . 
D:  Yeah , he feels it immediately . Yeah , that's right . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah that's true . Yeah but  <laugh> 
D:  Right , continue . Sorry . <laugh> 
C:  But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb . I think that's a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , because uh they don't use it uh all the time . Well it's uh pretty pretty <other> basically uh as you said .

B:  Yeah . Well I'm Mike  , User Interface Designer . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  The the method ? Well  I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . Um  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  These are already in use ? 
B:  Yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer . Um  
D:  Alright , okay . 
B:  This one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things .

A:  Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation . How late is did we start his presentation uh ?  
C:  Right . 
D:  <other> I dunno . I think uh w About twenty minutes ago ? 
A:  Wha Yeah . 
D:  Losing time losing time . <laugh> 
A:  Well then we have still the time , so  <laugh> But we do have to come to a decision , right later on . 
D:  Yeah right . So  
A:  So  <laugh>  
B:  Mm . Well I thought um everybody on the website <other> uh would see the same thing , but 
D:  I don't think so . 
B:  obviously <other> that's not the case . 
C:  Yeah , uh there are different uh  We have all have different home pages , with different links . Yeah . 
A:  Oh yeah ? 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah right . 
A:  Uh ? 
B:  For instance you couldn't see this . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Okay , yeah well . 
B:  Um  
topic_description:	None


B:  This one is user-centred . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Um  
D:  Well  Yeah , me too . 
A:  I like user-centred . <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  I like user-centr centred uh <other> uh also the best . 
A:  We also do that . 
B:  Um  Well , I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff . 
D:  Mm . 
B:  Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one . But  
D:  But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ? 
B:  Yes . Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel . Um  
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Alright . 
B:  I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need . <other> I um I kinda like the shape . <other> I think this is what we talked about . But  
D:  Yeah , right . Yeah . 
C:   You can't really see uh the differ from different sides . But I think uh  
B:  No I've  Well I showed it somewhere . Um  
C:  Uh you can draw it if you  Yeah . 
B:  <other> Oh yeah . I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . So we can can uh yeah customise the  
A:  Mm-hmm . Well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . So we cannot just uh 
B:  Mm ? <other> Yeah . <other> It's a front . It's not the the whole remote that changes , of course . You can  
A:  make someone w No but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front . So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone . 
D:  But it  
B:  Mm . 
D:  Yeah , that's right . 
B:  Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . So l like Ericsson does  every uh  
D:  Yeah , that's a must . We must have that . 
A:  Yeah , we must . Yeah well and and  
C:  We can put it on the on the back side . 
B:  S something like this . <other> It's recognisable . 
A:  Yes . 'Kay . 
D:  We can make a symbol of the company right here . And <other> if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front . So the symbol's always on  Yeah . 
B:  Um  Yeah ? 
C:  Yeah , so that you don't replace the symbol , yeah . 
B:  Yeah yeah . Something like that , in the  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah yeah yeah . Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front . Those kind of things . Yes . Okay . 
D:  Yeah , yeah . But let's not focus on the front  . <laugh> 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah . Um  Well so uh uh like I said I thought we'd we'd use more function . If we we had to include more functions . But we don't . So um  
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah . I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need . Maybe some less . Like eject we don't need , and some other buttons we don't need . I think uh  
D:  Alright . 
C:  Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ? 
B:  Yeah , I will . I think uh for the remote um uh less is more . <other> The less buttons the better the design . Um  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I agree . 
B:  We should go with that concept I think . I know .

D:  I've I've got another point . Um there are two target audi audiences , and we've uh chose for the younger one . Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features . They are high high interested in feature . But they are more critical . Fo Yeah , critical . So  The younger audience . So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people . 
A:  Yeah ? 
B:  Mm . 
C:  The younger uh  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Uh we uh we were busy with that . Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing . So , we have the power button . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s . It's uh your it's your job . <laugh> 
A:  Yes . 
C:  Yeah of course . Uh it's uh . Yeah . W wh 
A:  <laugh> Well we have a power button . Guys ? 
B:  No it's our job . For all of us I think . <other> 
C:  While you have to agree , I can say  it's like this and <other> you must agree . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , right .

A:  Well what if we um  I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , a f a little uh  You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh <other> uh  No um mm usually  
D:  Clip aren't used much . 
A:  Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m um a lot , but not  
D:  Yeah right . 
C:  But  
B:  Yeah , but what kind of features ? Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition . But I've  
C:  Yeah I think <other> m most  
D:  Yeah but  Yeah . 
C:  Most uh  <other> 
D:  Here , look at these numbers . The newest features are , like I said , are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control . Our audience , these people , are very like these uh features . You see ? So we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent . The concurrent ? <laugh> Competitors , right . <other> So , I do think we have to uh have some features . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Uh . 
A:  <laugh> Competitors . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . Our competitor . Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . Well maybe w we could uh s On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something , or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . Yeah . 
D:  Even though they cost a little more . Right . Right . Like a ticker-tape . Which programme you are l watching or something . 
B:  Yeah , that's nice . <other> 
A:  Those kind of things , uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s . And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you're currently watching . 
D:  Yeah , right . Yeah right . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have , uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen . <other> 
A:  Yeah . For example . It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it . 
B:  Yeah , we should keep that simple too . It will  <other> 
C:  But should it uh really be uh clickable , uh <other> or <other> or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy . <other> 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  No not clickable . Nah , no no no . Yeah , just at at the top . So when you s <other> you sit like this you can can watch . I think it should be at the top . 
A:  Well maybe . 
B:  No , it should be uh integrated . I think  <other> 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , something like on um some radios in car . You  Where it's , yeah , walking to  Yeah . <other> 
D:  Yeah right . It's a ticker-tape idea . 
A:  R_D_S_s or something . 
C:  But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and <other> that kind of thing . 
B:  Wa Yeah . 
D:  Well it's just one script . <other> 
A:  Well I think it's you got  It just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling , and it's not uh  That's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh  
D:  Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming . So I don't think that's the issue . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . No . 
C:  Alright . 
D:  Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? 
A:  Uh well I think so , yes . Um  
B:  <other> Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . 
D:  'Kay . Right , I don't know if I can find that , but  
A:  We're g No but we're we'll have to look into that . 
B:  Or maybe you will get that information uh  <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  Next time . Yeah right . 
A:  Um we can use this board again , I think . Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue . <other> Where is my presentation ? <laugh> Uh  
D:  Yeah , I understand what you're saying . 
A:   Uh  
A:  Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , and then look at the design . Because we have to decide this . 
B:  He's the boss . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . Great .

D:  We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look . 
A:  Well  I mean we're all here now , I think . These I've already given you . So we have to decide on the different remote control functions . 
D:  Right . 
A:  So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special . 
D:  At the top . 
C:  Shouldn't we start with the most important parts ? The L_C_D_ screen alright  but we should start with the power button ? Uh  
B:  At the top or at the bottom ? 
A:  Yes . 
D:  I think the top is more uh  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  When you s How do you zap ? You just sit in your chair ? 
B:  Yeah but  
A:  <other> <other> 
C:  Huh ? 
D:  With the remote ? 
B:  Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . 'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom . <other> 
A:  That thing is terrible . 
D:  Yeah but that's where your hand ball might be . Yeah , I dunno . 
A:  Uh  
B:  Yeah , no Mm . 
C:  And then uh  
D:  We'll draw two , and then we'll see uh  <other> 
C:  Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here . <other> I dunno what uh you were talking about but  
D:  No <laugh> Um he thinks  Yeah , right . He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom , and I think it's better at the top . 
C:   we are busy with something  . Uh-huh . Why do you think it's better at the bottom ? 
A:  Well  
B:  Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . I c 
D:  But your  
C:  But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there's room for the for the interface . 
D:  Yeah . The the ticker  The L_C_D_ is like like small . <other> It's it's wide . It's not not high . But <other>  
B:  Well I d I think that's that's ugly but  
C:  Uh-huh . 
B:  <other> I th 
A:  Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point , because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . So and and I I like to use the ones 
C:  And and we can  <other> 
B:  Yeah . Power button always  Yeah . 
C:  Bottom . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah , y you gotta zap like this or <laugh> you want to  Yeah . 
A:  on the top . So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window  
D:  Yeah right . But  
C:  Well <other> that's <other> a bit exaggerated . Well , I agree with you  . 
D:  We're making a remote with <other> with a few functions you know . We 
C:  It's it's also more recognisable . It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the 
D:  <other> 
A:  Yes but we we we we don't want that . We don't want them to look like a calculator . We want to look it like our original but familiar  
C:  the thing on top . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah you don't want  You want uh  Yeah it it it must be a remote . 
C:  Yeah w well , but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe <other> important aspect like familiarity uh completely away , uh because <other> I think it's uh  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  High-tech  . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Yea 
D:  <other> 
A:  Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh  <other> We White ? <laugh> 
C:  I think it's still important to have it at the top , because it's uh 
D:  Width . 
A:  Width . Uh format yeah format ? Line width ? Width ? 
D:   Th that's not a problem . <other> When I draw here it  Oh . Huh ? 
C:  it's more familiar that way . 
A:  Yeah ? 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  It's a bit off . Well . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , it's off . 
C:  <laugh> A little a little bit . 
D:  <other> It <laugh> it needs to be calibrated again . Well <other>  
A:  Well uh let's uh talk about that later uh  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Maybe you should another pen . Maybe that's uh better . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:   You e you only have one pen for that screen . Yeah . 
D:  Where ? <other> Alright , we have to make a decision now , because we don't have much time . Um  
A:  It's special pen . Yeah . No . 
D:  I think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand . 
C:  Yeah . I I agree . 
A:  I think it should be at the button , bottom . 
C:  Well I'm the <other> I I'm the designer , so um  <laugh> 
B:  At the bottom ? <other> In a few minutes  Oh yeah , oh yeah , I totally agree . Yeah . 
A:  Bottom . The L_C_D_ . 
D:  At the bot 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  So  We are two uh V_S_ two . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh>

A:  Guys ? <laugh> We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons  
D:  Alright , let's keep it central . 
B:  <other> The ten numbers ? Yeah ? 
C:  Channel , yeah . 
A:  Uh  
B:  Volume ? 
C:  Volume control . 
A:  Yes . 
C:  Um  
D:  Mm . 
A:  Uh the mute button . I h love that one . 
C:  Well let's look at your uh design . Uh  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Uh-huh . 
B:  I think we we should use something like this um to um  The the channel up and channel down button ? <other> Yeah , in circle , you know ? 
A:  Yes . Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . Well that's that's also design . 
B:  And and a volume control also in it . 
A:  Yes . 
D:  Right . 
A:  Um  <other> 
C:   Yeah . But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a D_V_D_ player or something . So  
A:  Well h ho Yes . Yes . They are for some uh video uh  
B:  Yes , as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons . <other> 
D:  You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yes . Oh man , five minutes . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , well five minutes left . Yep . 
D:  Right , just make some decisions . The most important things we have to uh  
A:  Um how are we going to do it with those numbers ? 
C:  C c can you make you make  We can use uh the drawing board now , I think . Uh it it doesn't work well but  But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing . 
A:  Well I have it here . 
D:  I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now . Just uh you decide that , you decide that , and <other> ready . 
A:  Yeah well that's going to take too too much time . Yes . 
B:  Mm . Yeah . 
C:  Mm . Alright . 
A:  Yes . Well the L_C_D_ . Um you are Industrial , you are User Interface . So I think it's going to go to Mike . But you will have to make consensus with  . Well  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Well consensus , um  We we can put it in the middle , so  
A:  Well it's a bit hard , because we are going to be uh individually . That's a bit uh  
D:  Nei . We're  No  <other> We're deciding now , so  
A:  Yes . 
D:  Top or bottom ? 
C:  Well uh yeah I I still think it's it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top , so  Yeah . You say familiarity isn't important but  <other> 
A:  Yes it is . Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ? 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ? 
C:  Yeah d 
D:  Yeah , right . Okay . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Alright . 
A:  Alright these functions . The number f Well yes , that's alright . W the number function . Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ? 
C:  As we we we we agreed , we do have a L_C_D_ . So that's 
D:  Yeah , okay . 
C:  that's enough . Yeah . 
B:  No . 
A:  How do you want it to do then ? 
C:  There's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero . 
B:  Well just when you push a one one and  
A:  It it has to r recognise one as <other> there could still come more . 
B:  No , <other> if you  On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other , <other> d it  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Oh , like that . Um  
A:  Yes . 
C:  They'd recognise it . Th that's the most  That that's very easy . Yeah . 
A:  Alright so no button for that . 
D:  No . 
A:  Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote ? 
C:  I think these are the the most important functions . 
D:  Do you still have the pictures over there ? 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  So  
D:  Yeah , that's about it . You do need the uh multi Or did uh  No , like this one . You do need them ? Yeah , I know . But are we  
A:  No , we'd uh just said we didn't uh  
B:  <other> 
D:  Alright , alright uh  <laugh> Now okay . 
A:  <other> Well uh  <laugh> <other> Um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant . So just for a television is that all we need ? 
D:  Right . Yeah , it's most useable this way . 
C:   basic function . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Teletext is gone . So all those buttons that <other> ar are to do with teletext  Oh screen placing . 
D:  <other> 
A:  We'll have uh those uh buttons about uh  
D:  <other> 
A:  And uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting . Uh there's um <other> screen . You can make it wider and less wide . And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video . 
D:  Yeah . Right . I do think we have to put that underneath a clip . 
C:  Oh yeah . 
A:  Those two ? But it's just two , and we make a clip ? 
C:  Uh just two just two under uh under uh  <other> <sighs> 
D:  <other> 
A:  Th that's a bit uh waste . 
B:  We we can make <other> make uh a little row of like four buttons down here . 
A:  Yes . 
D:  Yeah . Okay , right . 
C:  I I think uh  
A:  Or at the top . <laugh> Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go . <laugh> 
B:  Or at  Yeah alright then . 
C:  But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . Uh that's that's too complicated . You can just put it somewhere  They they aren't used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere  
A:  Yes . Yeah 
B:  Oh , they can be small or round like buttons . 
C:  Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah . Yeah or at the top , yeah . What do you think uh those those buttons ? Above or down ? 
A:  Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote . 
C:  And w where ? Well we design it later . We have it , and we design later where everything goes . Yeah . 
A:  Yes ? Yes . Yes . Well any other uh  
D:  Well if you <other> you take those th If you <other>  
B:  Why go to video ? 
A:  Go to video , that's always on your remote control . To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_ . 
D:  Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh  
C:  The the video channel uh ? 
B:  That's just zero . Yeah . 
A:  Well l n no not at not at my remote . 
C:  No no not always . Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel . 
B:  <other> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , but you can can zap down  <other> 
D:  Yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ . 
A:  Yes . 
B:  Yes , I think th 
A:  I don't . I go to ninety-nine . <laugh> 
B:  No , then you press ninety nine . I think go to video is 
D:  Ah uh well whatever , <other> . 
B:  an irrelevant button , but  
A:  Th that's the button uh  No . 
C:  But it's easy to go  <other> If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero . It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button . 
A:  No you can ch push zero . Yeah . Yeah , I I think that one button is uh  I use it uh  
D:  Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , if you wa if you have a new T_V_ . You have to set the channels . Right all th these uh different buttons you have to  
B:  <other> 
A:  Yeah ? These buttons , I don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote . 
D:  Ah , I do . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah , sk <other> Yeah y you you you you have screen width . 
A:  It's it's incorporated with p m plus and down , uh those  
B:  Yeah well y you must have . Yeah you yeah you have one one button from <other> s set frequency o or something , and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh  
A:  <other> 
D:  Right . That's the only one we put uh in there . 
A:  So we still  have one uh four ? 
D:  For a screen uh fu uh channel setting . 
A:  Ch ch 
C:  Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the  Yeah . 
D:  Programme , right . 
A:  Okay . Oh the Okay button ? <laugh> Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . Menu button . 
D:  Uh  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , alright . 
C:  You should  Yeah . I think that's important . Uh   And and the settings to change the brightness <other> the settings to change the brightness and the contrast . 
A:  Channel , setting , menu .  We have to go . <laugh> 
D:  <other> 
A:  Okay . 
C:  Channel , yeah . 
D:   
A:  So um Save . 
C:  Chief ? Chief ? 
A:  Yes see . 
C:  Th the menu menu button is also important . Then you can uh  
A:  Yes I have put it in . 
C:  Where ? <laugh> I don't see it . Oh Menu , alright . 
A:  Here . <laugh> 
B:  I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah . 
C:  In the menu . And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something . Because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu . Yeah . Or the volume , yeah . 
B:  Yeah , the  
A:  Alright . 
B:  Or the volume or something like that .

B:  I think these should be in one big circle in the middle . 
D:  Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was <other> t kinda true . When  <laugh> when you uh put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about . So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . 
A:  <clicks tongue> Apart . So people have to move their hand . And they get less uh complaints of R_S_I_ . 
C:  Yeah , it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand . Y  Yeah . It's good to move uh from time to time . Yeah . 
A:   That's what I always do , because all my i important buttons are the same place . 
B:  <other> Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . They they need to be centred . 
D:  Um  
A:  Yes ? 
C:  No but now y W would we have to choose a 
A:  Well not  
D:  Frequency of uh button use . Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour . You can see . So the the <other> channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down . 
C:  way in middle ? 
A:  Yes . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> Volume hardly . 
A:  Uh-huh . 
C:  <laugh> Mm-hmm . 
B:  No I don't think . 
C:  <other> Oh . Far apart ? 
A:  Up and down far apart from each other ? 
D:   <other> You thinking uh about R_S_I_ ? 
B:  Yeah but  Yeah but  No . <laugh> 
A:  Well not too much . <laugh> 
D:  Y look at uh look at the frequency . Nei not too much , but  
C:  <laugh> <other> 
B:  <other> The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important . So  
C:  I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . 
A:  Well for example the power button , you can <other>  If someone is constantly z zapping , it's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it . Because I have someone  But the buttons is way . So that one can be put away . 
B:  Well they are used four times an hour , so  
D:  Nei nei nei n I I totally agree . But just  Yeah . Right . Yeah . I agree . 
A:  The power button can uh be uh uh  
B:  Power bu button should be left at the top . <other> 
A:  <other> 
D:  And should and should be red .
