D:  Great man . Who starts ? 
A:  Well I'll uh start just with another presentation , so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting . 
D:  Alright , great . Alright . 
A:  <laugh> Okay . I've put some uh new things in the in the map . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Uh oh . <other> This is it . I don't know the shortcut , so  Ah F_ five . Well our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in . And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it . 
C:  Mm . 
D:  Yes . 
A:  Well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we uh thought we had dec decided . But uh  Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you . 
D:  'Kay . 
A:  I think you have prepared uh all three uh ? <laugh> Um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh  I dunno . Y you also have uh received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ? 
C:  Well , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  No . <laugh> 
D:  No . You're the only one . <laugh> 
A:  Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements , and I'll have a look if  Well I think we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really uh 
C:  Oh . 
D:  Alright . 
A:  smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't , because of the new requirements . Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions . We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be . 
D:  'Kay . 
A:  And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely . Uh  
C:  We have forty minutes for this uh discussion ? 
A:  Uh yeah , I think so . <laugh> Well uh  the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet . 
C:  Alright . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Alright . 
A:  Um <other> now I'll look at  show  this board . Um  Well uh notes , first meeting . Now . I gave a disc a a presentation . Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas . So we said that uh we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , and uh look at their uh remote controls . We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have , our technical releases . Uh not too many one buttons . One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . And um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television . 
D:  Right . 
C:  Huh ? <other> Yeah . 
A:  Um the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar . <laugh> It's uh one of our ideas . <laugh> Yeah well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago , so it's not quite uh  <laugh> But well I have to do it . The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from  , and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible . 
C:  <laugh> <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm , now it's right . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  It should be uh recognisable at all times . Yes . Well fronts were to be  just like mobile telephones . 
C:  It's meant to be easily wiped out , yeah . <other> 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  And uh the technical aspects um  And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards . Well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting . It's quite logical al all of it . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 


A:  Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . I got this mail from uh our bosses . Well , teletext goes out . We will not use teletext . 
B:  Oh . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext . Well  
C:  I I disagree , but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree I guess . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ and they don't want it , because of our time we have for this project . 
B:  Oh . 
D:  Alright . 
C:  Oh , alright . 
B:  Oh , that's a shame . 
A:  So that's a shame , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point . Um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it . 
D:  Yeah . But let's forget about it . It's just time-consuming , so we uh have to go on . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <other> 
A:  Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um  Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company . 
D:  Yes . 
C:  Yeah , we are a <other> real fashionable company . I read uh I read it on the  I didn't know what company we were , but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff . So it has to be uh a modern design . That's important to know , uh when you design a thing of course . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Mm . <laugh> 
A:  Okay . Yes . I I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have , our company . It's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  So maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something . 


A:  Alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations . You want to start ? <laugh> Oh you have to start ? I didn't see anything about uh who had to start . Well s then start . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . <other> I think I have to start . <laugh> Oh no , no problem . I I just have to uh to think which file's mine , 'cause I was uh bit in a hurry . 
C:  <other> The order ? No . <other> 
B:  Mm . <laugh> 
A:  Okay . Well uh  
D:  I think it's this one . But I'm not sure .  
A:   You already uh opened uh PowerPoint . 
D:  Hmm ? Yeah . S Right . 
B:  <cough> 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yes . This is it . 


D:  Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . Um to start with these points . Uh next sheet ? 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . Uh , furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use . <other> Um then I tell something about um the most important issues . So we have to focus on those three thing three things . And in the end I'll um show you our target <other> audience or our target product users , customers . 
D:  Alright . Um , I think that's it . Um  
A:  Alright . 
D:  I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . So you can  Right . 
A:  Yes . Well you  I c I can uh still see your presentation . 
D:  Yeah . Right . 
A:  It's in the  


A:  Well uh next um I dunno who is next . You uh got uh  
C:  Shall I give a technical talk ? Alright . 
B:  Oh you go . 
A:  Yes . Well go ahead . <sighs> 
C:  Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design . 
A:  Yip . 
C:  Meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set . 
B:  Yeah , go ahead . 
D:  Yeah . Alright . 
C:  And uh the source is of course the user . Uh the user interface is um <other> uh the <other> the  the buttons of course . And the <other> the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver . That's the that's the basic idea . Very basic . 
B:  <other> 
A:  Yep . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Um well I have uh <other> uh <laugh> put it in a in in in a <other> a couple of basic steps . Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  The key  a signal to a chip , uh the chip senses the connection . <other> uh and recognise the key . So <other> well you understand . The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course . 
A:  <clicks tongue> <other> 
C:  Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the <other> the signal , and performs the assigned task . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that . And a button for T_V_ . So  
C:  Ah bu Yeah , but we don't . Uh we  <laugh> No no , but  Yeah . Exactly . Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote . I've some couple of pictures here . It's a very basic one . And uh  if we if we're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it , it uh won't look anything like this , but  
B:  <other> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . 
C:  And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh I don't want to get too technical , because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you . 
A:  Yep . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah , that's right . 
A:  <laugh> That's your part of the job . <laugh> 
C:  So yeah  exactly  this is uh how it uh looks from the inside . And uh well that's about it I think . Oh yeah , I still have this . Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new  But I had too too little time , but uh don't uh 
A:  Yep . 
D:  Alright . 
A:  <laugh> Okay . Well we understand . We understand . Oh right , no . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  don't look at it please . I I think it's it's clear uh how it works . Alright . That's the most important thing . 
D:  Alright . Yeah , it's clear . 
A:  Nice . 
C:  Alright . Uh  


B:  Yeah . Well I'm Mike  , User Interface Designer . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  The the method ? Well  I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . Um  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  These are already in use ? 
B:  Yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer . Um  
D:  Alright , okay . 
B:  This one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things . 


D:  I've I've got another point . Um there are two target audi audiences , and we've uh chose for the younger one . Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features . They are high high interested in feature . But they are more critical . Fo Yeah , critical . So  The younger audience . So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people . 
A:  Yeah ? 
B:  Mm . 
C:  The younger uh  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Uh we uh we were busy with that . Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing . So , we have the power button . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s . It's uh your it's your job . <laugh> 
A:  Yes . 
C:  Yeah of course . Uh it's uh . Yeah . W wh 
A:  <laugh> Well we have a power button . Guys ? 
B:  No it's our job . For all of us I think . <other> 
C:  While you have to agree , I can say  it's like this and <other> you must agree . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , right . 


A:  Guys ? We're going to uh go to our uh rooms , and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So  
B:  Your pen . 
D:  Ah . Great . 
C:  Yes chief . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Alright . 
B:  I thought we'd uh lunch uh right now , or not ? 
A:  Well see you uh  W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now uh so uh  
C:  Yeah this is this is your thing . 
D:  Ah . Okay .  
B:  Yeah , lunch break . 
C:  I am hungry . <laugh> 
A:  Lunch . 
D:  <laugh> Get into my belly . <laugh> 
A:  Ah . We didn't exactly do everything but  <laugh> So  
B:   <laugh> 
C:  See you later mate . <other>
