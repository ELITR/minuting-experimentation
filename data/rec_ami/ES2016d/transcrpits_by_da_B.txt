<laugh> Can try to plug that in there 
but  
Right . 
That's what we have there . 
That's plastic . 
Plastic covered with rubber . 
We might uh add some more underneath here . 
Maybe give it , give it a form . 
I mean you're supposed to hold it like that , 
but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , 
so  yeah , 
you have some rub yeah . 
Exactly , 
 use both . 
Might as well think about  
Th think about the button as well . 
Like either put either one  one on either side or 
not do it at all . 
It's a quick on-off button . 
That's um 
yeah I think it's pretty important . 
So you don't have to fiddle with that . 
Right ? 
Um that's not um  
I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . 
You wanna play with that over there . 
There you go . 
Right . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <vocal noise> . 
<other> 
I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average . 
However the colour , we don't have a say in that . 
That has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company . 
So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely . 
'S nothing you can say about that . 
I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . 
But  
Right . 
Right . 
It's different . 
You don't want your uh three feet huge L_C_D_ dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that . 
Yeah . 
<cough> 
Yeah . <other> 
It's very intuitive , I think yeah . 
<other> S give it a one . 
Right . 
Right . 
So that's a one . 
Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore . 
<laugh> 
Oops . 
Hmm . 
Well what  
S 
Mm . 
Oh yeah . 
You probably  
Mm . 
<other> 
Y you could add an extra feature actually . 
Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . 
We could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far . 
Yes . 
It's it's  
Um the  
it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff , 
where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . 
That can't cost much . 
So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , 
so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your  stick it behind your T_V_ and the other  
Right . 
That'd be tough then . 
<cough> Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . 
Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control . 
Let's add one of those features and say yes . <laugh> 
Two . 
Uh  
<cough> 
It's all just  
It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to  <laugh> <other> 
right 
right 
right right . 
Yeah not really . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Right . 
Yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of . 
It's not a one though . 
One would be the whole thing 
to fold and stuff . 
Yeah . 
So that's a four at most . 
Y yes . 
More  
<other> 
<other> Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour , 
but it definitely is  
 . 
<laugh> 
I'm impressed . 
I can't do that without a calculator . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Fifty percent , you're kidding . 
<laugh> P 
It's too much . 
Um  
Uh  
<Whistle> 
Battery . 
Two . 
At four it's gonna be too heavy , 
so that that's not our problem . 
People can change it every month . 
<laugh> They won't know until after they bought it . 
<cough> 
 . 
That's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah . 
Double curved , yes . 
Plastic . 
N no . 
No that's just one . 
It's just one mo single mould , we can do that . 
Exactly , right . 
That's not a special colour . 
It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special . 
S <other> 
Yes unfortunately . 
We could of course make the buttons wood . 
<laugh> Say mahogany or so 
Mm-hmm or titanium . 
Uh just  
<laugh> 
Yeah that's too much . 
It's hard to believe . 
So we'll go for the hand dynamo huh ? <laugh> 
<laugh> 
I mean let's let's face it , 
it also depends on the software on the on the television . 
You can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen . 
So s yeah let's take away the  
Yeah . Yeah . 
Right . 
Right . We may not need it . 
There you go . 
Perfect . 
<laugh> 
<Vocal noise> 
<laugh> Okay , the  
So we can just take away a heck of a lot of the  <laugh> 
there you go . 
 central ? 
Oh that's just  
yeah . 
There you go 
. Oops . 
There you go . 
One more criteria . 
<laugh> Fair enough . <laugh> 
Great . <other> 
Yeah . 
Just half a day , you have a remote . 
There you go . 
Super super . 
<other> Well that's not my fault . 
That's obviously the people I work for uh that work for me , 
uh they've just you know  
Heads are gonna roll , believe me . 
Yes yes . 
<cough> 
 .
