<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Pretty impressive . 
<laugh> 
Kind of a banana . 
<other> I do . 
Okay . 
You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . 
Um . 
Okay . 
So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . 
Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . 
And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . 
And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . 
Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . 
So 
we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . 
And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . 
With seven being false , we did not achieve that . 
 . 
Okay . 
So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? <laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah I think the colours detract a little bit . <laugh> 
That's true . 
Yeah . 
Um okay so , 
do you think , since we  This was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ? 
Does that sound good ? 
What do you think ? 
Three ? Four ? 
Five ? 
<laugh> Four is fair . 
Okay . 
Okay , 
the second one . 
Did we make it simple for new users ? 
One , 
'kay . 
Okay . 
Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ? 
I'd say that  
So one ? 
Yeah ? <laugh> 
Okay . 
Okay 
um the fourth one . 
How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? 
One of the number one complaints . 
<laugh> Whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
That's true . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Annoying alarm or something ? 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
So . 
Are we adding one of these two features ? 
 gonna say  
okay . 
So we're <laugh> back to a one ? 
Or a two ? 
Two , 'kay . 
Okay . 
Are we technologically innovative ? 
From iPod yeah . <laugh> 
But for remotes  
yeah . 
Two ? Three ? 
But how many remotes do you see like this ? 
Not so many . 
<laugh> 
Really ? 
Okay . 
<other> That's gonna hurt us . 
Okay . 
Um spongy material ? 
'Kay . 
And lastly , 
did we put the fashion in electronics ? 
I'd say we did . 
<laugh> 
'Kay . 
Alright . 
Now we just gotta calculate . 
Six eight twelve sixteen . 
Seventeen divided by s 
Eight . 
<laugh> 
Well I haven't done math in years . 
What two  
<laugh> I dunno . 
Okay we'll say two point four two . 
Right ? 
How does that look ? 
<laugh> It's been a while . 
Oh no . 
They just told me to 
<other> pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it <laugh> basically . 
So that's that . 
<cough> 
Oh my god . 
Okay . 
Yeah we'll go with that . 
Not too shabby . 
<laugh> 
Right . <laugh> 
Oh . 
Bright yellow . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> It'd look really lovely . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Leave it blank . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
<laugh> Perfect . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
 . 
What's the blue part ? 
Oh that's the batteries . 
Okay . <laugh> 
<other> 
Looks more like a banana . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Trying to fill in some time there . <laugh> 
Good teamwork  . <laugh> 
<other>

No I know . 
I'm
