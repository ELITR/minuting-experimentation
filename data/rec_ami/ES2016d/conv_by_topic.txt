A:  <other> Yep . Soon as I get this . 


A:  Okay . This is our last meeting . Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation . <other> Um then we will um do an evaluation . Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . Um let's see , minutes from the last meeting . Um we looked at uh the the trends . We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . It was twice as important as anything else . Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . Um and a spongy feel . So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . Um looking at other other devices . Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that . Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . But I think we've still decided not to go with that . <other> Then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . Um and basically how , what were making for the prototype . So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over . 
C:  The prototype discussion . 
A:  The prototype yeah . 


A:  Do you need a  this ? 
C:  No . <cough> 
A:  Okay . 
B:  <laugh> Can try to plug that in there but  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  There is our remo  the banana . 


C:  Um <other> yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana . Um but it would be held in such a fashion , where it is , obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . So that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . You have to use your imagination a little bit . And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through . 
A:  Very nice . 
C:  And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . Volume up and down . And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . It's that that simple . That just represents the infrared uh beam . That's a simple on and off switch . Um I don't know , we could use the voice . T that blue bits should be yellow , d that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose . And um <other> that's about it . It's as simple as you , we could make it really . Is there anything you want to add ? 
B:  Right . That's what we have there . That's plastic . Plastic covered with rubber . We might uh add some more underneath here . Maybe give it , give it a form . I mean you're supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , so  yeah , you have some rub yeah . Exactly ,  use both . Might as well think about  
C:  Yeah . Doesn't make much make much difference . You could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  T the actual thing might be smaller . <other> Yeah . 
B:  Th think about the button as well . Like either put either one  one on either side or 
A:  What but what's that button ? 
B:  not do it at all . It's a quick on-off button . That's um 
C:  Just the on and off . 
A:  Uh , 'kay . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  yeah I think it's pretty important . So you don't have to fiddle with that . 
A:  'Kay . 
B:  Right ? Um that's not um  I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . You wanna play with that over there . There you go . 
A:  <other> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  It's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy Play-Doh , but  
A:  Would you like to uh  
B:  Right . 
D:  Pretty impressive . 
A:  Well done . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Kind of a banana . 
C:  And whether or not it would fall into the cost  everything I suppose . With the scroll and the L_C_D_ . 
A:  Well luckily we are going to find out . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> 
A:  Or not luckily . 


A:  Um do you have a marketing presentation for us . 
D:  I do . 


D:  Okay . You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . Um . Okay . So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . So we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . With seven being false , we did not achieve that .  . Okay . 
D:  Okay . Are we technologically innovative ? 
B:  Uh  
C:  <other> I'd say so . Uh don't get many mo remote controls with 
B:  <cough> It's all just  
C:  screens on . 
B:  It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to  <laugh> <other> right right right right . 
C:  Yeah it's stolen technology . But we have  . 
D:  From iPod yeah . <laugh> 
A:  It's  <laugh> But there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow . Course that wasn't really  we were kinda forced to take that colour . 
D:  But for remotes  yeah . 
C:  Fa 
D:  Two ? Three ? 
C:   'cause it's stolen . No maybe not . 
A:  I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah not really . 
D:  But how many remotes do you see like this ? Not so many . 
C:  <other> 
B:  <other> 
A:  If we added the screaming factor <laugh> then we go up . <laugh> Um I would say we're probably at four . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Right . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Really ? Okay . <other> That's gonna hurt us . 
D:  Alright . Now we just gotta calculate . Six eight twelve sixteen . Seventeen divided by s 
C:   . 
A:  Seven is  
D:  Eight . 
A:  Two point  
D:  <laugh> 
A:   two point four ? 
C:  Is that some long division ? No . 
D:  Well I haven't done math in years . 
A:  Something . 
D:  What two  <laugh> I dunno . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Just , I'm sure there's a  . 
D:  Okay we'll say two point four two . Right ? How does that look ? 
B:  I'm impressed . I can't do that without a calculator . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> It's been a while . 
C:  No I can't do long  very impressive . 
A:  And what what is the acceptable criteria ? Is there like a scale that we have to hit ? 
D:  Oh no . They just told me to 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it <laugh> basically . 
A:  <laugh> Alright then . 
D:  So that's that . 


A:  Okay . Well , let's see . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  Okay . 
B:  There you go . Perfect . 
A:  Well there we go . Twelve point five . 
C:  There we go . 
D:  <laugh> Perfect . 
A:  Okay . 
A:  <other> Okay so the costs under twelve point five Euro . Was no . We redesigned it . Now it's yes . 


A:  Next slide . Project evaluation . Uh project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found . Um  So  I guess that  Let's see here . I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me . But I'd like to hear your thoughts . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Fair enough . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Trying to fill in some time there . <laugh> 
A:  Uh h what did you think of our project process ? 
C:  I think we did  yeah I think we did quite well . Um  
B:  Great . <other> 
A:  <cough> 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Good . 
D:  Good teamwork  . <laugh> 
B:  Just half a day , you have a remote . There you go . 
C:  Yeah . Right from the start of the day . 
A:  Yeah I think  
C:  We sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought . 
A:   we st we started off a little little weak . Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning . Um <laugh> um  
D:  <other> <laugh> 
A:  But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . Um room for creativity ? There was that . Um I think we tried a lotta different things and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things . Um you guys worked together well as a team . And um the means ? Which was the whiteboard and the pens . 
C:  Yeah . We've used the whiteboard . 
B:  Super super . 
A:  I had some problem with the pen I think , but <laugh> minus your p 
D:  Minus your PowerPoint fiasco . 
B:  <other> Well that's not my fault . That's obviously the people I work for uh that work for me , uh they've just you know  
D:  No I know . I'm  yeah . Incom <laugh> 
A:  Well  
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Heads are gonna roll , believe me . 
A:  Have a  we have a list of employees that you would like fired . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> 
B:  Yes yes . 
A:  Okay . N new ideas found ? Um  
B:  <cough> 
D:  Mm . Kinda . 
A:  Yes for the remote . Maybe no not f for 
C:  Technology used . 
A:  technology . 


A:  Alright . Closing . Costs are within the budget . Project is evaluated . Um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary . That's it . 
C:  Excellent . 
A:  And I still have to do my minutes for the last meeting . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Actually . Um so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up . 
D:  We might have a while though . 
A:  And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that . But that's the end of our meeting . 
B:   .
