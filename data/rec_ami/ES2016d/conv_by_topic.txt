A:  <other> Yep . Soon as I get this . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  Okay . This is our last meeting . Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation . <other> Um then we will um do an evaluation . Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . Um let's see , minutes from the last meeting . Um we looked at uh the the trends . We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . It was twice as important as anything else . Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . Um and a spongy feel . So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . Um looking at other other devices . Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that . Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . But I think we've still decided not to go with that . <other> Then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . Um and basically how , what were making for the prototype . So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over . 
C:  The prototype discussion . 
A:  The prototype yeah . 
topic_description:	opening_None


A:  Do you need a  this ? 
C:  No . <cough> 
A:  Okay . 
B:  <laugh> Can try to plug that in there but  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  There is our remo  the banana . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


C:  Um <other> yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana . Um but it would be held in such a fashion , where it is , obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . So that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . You have to use your imagination a little bit . And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through . 
A:  Very nice . 
C:  And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . Volume up and down . And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . It's that that simple . That just represents the infrared uh beam . That's a simple on and off switch . Um I don't know , we could use the voice . T that blue bits should be yellow , d that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose . And um <other> that's about it . It's as simple as you , we could make it really . Is there anything you want to add ? 
B:  Right . That's what we have there . That's plastic . Plastic covered with rubber . We might uh add some more underneath here . Maybe give it , give it a form . I mean you're supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , so  yeah , you have some rub yeah . Exactly ,  use both . Might as well think about  
C:  Yeah . Doesn't make much make much difference . You could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  T the actual thing might be smaller . <other> Yeah . 
B:  Th think about the button as well . Like either put either one  one on either side or 
A:  What but what's that button ? 
B:  not do it at all . It's a quick on-off button . That's um 
C:  Just the on and off . 
A:  Uh , 'kay . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  yeah I think it's pretty important . So you don't have to fiddle with that . 
A:  'Kay . 
B:  Right ? Um that's not um  I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . You wanna play with that over there . There you go . 
A:  <other> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  It's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy Play-Doh , but  
A:  Would you like to uh  
B:  Right . 
D:  Pretty impressive . 
A:  Well done . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Kind of a banana . 
C:  And whether or not it would fall into the cost  everything I suppose . With the scroll and the L_C_D_ . 
A:  Well luckily we are going to find out . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> 
A:  Or not luckily . 
topic_description:	presentation of prototype(s)_None


A:  Um do you have a marketing presentation for us . 
D:  I do . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


D:  Okay . You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . Um . Okay . So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . So we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . With seven being false , we did not achieve that .  . Okay . 
D:  Okay . Are we technologically innovative ? 
B:  Uh  
C:  <other> I'd say so . Uh don't get many mo remote controls with 
B:  <cough> It's all just  
C:  screens on . 
B:  It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to  <laugh> <other> right right right right . 
C:  Yeah it's stolen technology . But we have  . 
D:  From iPod yeah . <laugh> 
A:  It's  <laugh> But there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow . Course that wasn't really  we were kinda forced to take that colour . 
D:  But for remotes  yeah . 
C:  Fa 
D:  Two ? Three ? 
C:   'cause it's stolen . No maybe not . 
A:  I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah not really . 
D:  But how many remotes do you see like this ? Not so many . 
C:  <other> 
B:  <other> 
A:  If we added the screaming factor <laugh> then we go up . <laugh> Um I would say we're probably at four . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Right . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Really ? Okay . <other> That's gonna hurt us . 
D:  Alright . Now we just gotta calculate . Six eight twelve sixteen . Seventeen divided by s 
C:   . 
A:  Seven is  
D:  Eight . 
A:  Two point  
D:  <laugh> 
A:   two point four ? 
C:  Is that some long division ? No . 
D:  Well I haven't done math in years . 
A:  Something . 
D:  What two  <laugh> I dunno . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Just , I'm sure there's a  . 
D:  Okay we'll say two point four two . Right ? How does that look ? 
B:  I'm impressed . I can't do that without a calculator . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> It's been a while . 
C:  No I can't do long  very impressive . 
A:  And what what is the acceptable criteria ? Is there like a scale that we have to hit ? 
D:  Oh no . They just told me to 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it <laugh> basically . 
A:  <laugh> Alright then . 
D:  So that's that . 
topic_description:	evaluation of prototype(s)_None


D:  So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> <vocal noise> . 
C:  <other> 
A:  I think it's definitely different than anything else out there . So if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes I would say , I would say most definitely . It's bright . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  I would  . It's bright . It's  
A:  It still has your traditional black . 
C:  It's curved . It's not  there's no sharp 
B:  <other> 
C:  angles to it . 
A:  Yep , not angular . 
D:  Mm . 
B:  I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average . However the colour , we don't have a say in that . 
D:  <laugh> Yeah I think the colours detract a little bit . <laugh> 
C:  Some people might say it . Yeah . 
B:  That has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company . So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely . 'S nothing you can say about that . I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . But  
A:  Mm . 
D:  That's true . 
A:  <other> Yep . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah something more modern to go  a a modern colour to go with the modern form . 
B:  Right . Right . It's different . You don't want your uh three feet huge L_C_D_ dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that . 
D:  Um okay so , do you think , since we  This was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ? Does that sound good ? 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <cough> 
D:  What do you think ? Three ? Four ? 
A:  I would say 
D:  Five ? <laugh> Four is fair . Okay . 
A:  four . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . <other> 
A:  Very non-committal , four . 
D:  Okay , the second one . Did we make it simple for new users ? 
B:  It's very intuitive , I think yeah . 
C:  Yeah . I think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had . 
B:  <other> S give it a one . 
D:  One , 'kay . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Okay . Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ? 
C:  Uh yeah . 'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls  most common , which are channel and volume . And then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further . Yeah . 
D:  I'd say that  
B:  Right . 
A:  Mm-hmm . S scrolling through and selecting a few . 
B:  Right . 
D:  So one ? Yeah ? <laugh> 
B:  So that's a one . 
A:  I think that's a one . 
D:  Okay . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


D:  Okay um the fourth one . How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? One of the number one complaints . 
B:  Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . It's bright yellow . Bright yellow's hard to lose . But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . That was what we'd we'd mentioned . 
D:  <laugh> Whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could  
C:  Just just to use , to find it when it was lost . But like I said , like I don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily . And it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . That's gonna be a difficult shape to  
B:  Oops . Hmm . Well what  
A:  And it is quite bright and  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . Maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ? 
B:  S 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Uh  
C:  I mean you know  loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , I mean a million ways . You can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  That's true . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  But if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit I think . 
D:  Mm . 
B:  Oh yeah . You probably  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Probably two . You know . If we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  I'd say two . 
B:  <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  With the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Y you could add an extra feature actually . Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  We could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far . 
A:  Which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a  
B:  Yes . 
C:  Yeah true . But I mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . They're cheap . So it can't be that 
D:  Annoying alarm or something ? Yeah . 
B:  It's it's  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Um the  it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff , where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . That can't cost much . 
C:  expensive . 
A:  Some sort of proximity <other>  
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your  stick it behind your T_V_ and the other  
C:   stick it on the T_V_  . 
A:  <other> Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Right . That'd be tough then . <cough> Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  So . Are we adding one of these two features ?  gonna say  okay . 
B:  Let's add one of those features and say yes . <laugh> 
A:  Okay . 
D:  So we're <laugh> back to a one ? Or a two ? Two , 'kay . 
C:  Two . 
B:  Two . 
A:  Two . 
topic_description:	how to find when misplaced_None


D:  Okay . Um spongy material ? 
B:  Yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of . 
A:  We have some spongy , yeah . 
C:  Yeah as much as as needed , I think . 
D:  'Kay . 
B:  It's not a one though . One would be the whole thing 
A:  No . Yeah . Because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side  the bottom  the underneath on the back . 
B:  to fold and stuff . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  So that's a four at most . 
A:  Probably a four at most . 
D:  And lastly , did we put the fashion in electronics ? 
A:  Possibly even a five . <other> 
B:  Y yes . More  
D:  I'd say we did . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  If your fashion is b is Carmen Miranda , you betcha . <laugh> 
B:  <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  <other> Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour , but it definitely is  
C:  On the  
A:  It's true . 
C:  Yeah . Be what we were told , and they'd say yeah , definitely . 
B:   . 
D:  'Kay .

A:  Okay . Well , let's see . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  Okay . 
B:  There you go . Perfect . 
A:  Well there we go . Twelve point five . 
C:  There we go . 
D:  <laugh> Perfect . 
A:  Okay . 
A:  <other> Okay so the costs under twelve point five Euro . Was no . We redesigned it . Now it's yes . 
topic_description:	costing_None


A:  Now we get to do the budget numbers . You didn't know that you were gonna have a budget . But we do . Okay . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah so . You'd been going a long time dividing that . It's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on . 
D:  Oh my god . Okay . 
C:  Two point four two basically . 
D:  Yeah we'll go with that . 
B:  <laugh> Fifty percent , you're kidding . <laugh> P 
D:  Not too shabby . 
A:  So I have here an  Yeah . We want a fifty percent profit on this . Oh you can't really see that very well . 
C:  <laugh> Charge about three hundred quid for it . 
A:  <laugh> Twelve and a half Euros is what supposed to cost us . Okay , so  
B:  It's too much . 
topic_description:	project budget_None


A:  Well let's see . The f the  
B:  Um  
A:  Wonder if I can make this  
B:  Uh  
A:  What the  <other> Oh it won't let me do that . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  Alright so at top , I don't know if you guys can read that or not . I can't 'cause I don't have my glasses on , but so we've got the energy source . There's uh four , five , six categories . We have energy source , electronics , case . Then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements . 
B:  <Whistle> Battery . 
A:  Okay so  Uh first of all energy source , we picked battery . Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ? Probably 
C:  <other> 
A:  some e either two or four . 
B:  Two . 
A:  Two ? <other> Like it . <laugh> 
B:  At four it's gonna be too heavy , so that that's not our problem . People can change it every month . 
A:  <laugh> Excellent . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> They won't know until after they bought it . <cough> 
A:  This is consumerism . Alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker . 
B:   . 
C:  We're advanced chip are we ? 
B:  That's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah . 
A:  'Kay ,  we have one of those . 'Kay then the case is a  Probably it's double curved . 
B:  Double curved , yes . 
A:  Case materials are plastic . 
B:  Plastic . 
A:  Um I guess it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom . Is that right or is it just one ? 
B:  N no . No that's just one . 
A:  Maybe it's one because of the  
B:  It's just one mo single mould , we can do that . 
A:  'Kay . 
C:  Yeah  yeah . 
D:  Right . <laugh> 
A:  I guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , which is nice . Special colour ? 
B:  Exactly , right . 
D:  Oh . 
B:  That's not a special colour . It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special . 
D:  Bright yellow . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Interface type . We have pushbutton , scroll-wheel interface , integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton , and an L_C_D_ display . 
C:  S 
B:  S <other> 
C:  That's  Yeah . 
A:  So we actually have the L_C_D_ display 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  And then  
A:  and then is it the integrated or is it  
C:  I'd say the integrated . 
B:  Yes unfortunately . 
A:  Yeah . 'Kay . Button supplement ? Special colour ? Um special form ? Special material . 
C:  Mm . 
B:  We could of course make the buttons wood . <laugh> Say mahogany or so 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> <laugh> It'd look really lovely . <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  Or titanium . They cost us all the same . 
B:  Mm-hmm or titanium . 
C:   remote control  . 
B:  Uh just  
A:  Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , <laugh> we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  No that's getting a bit tiny . 
A:  Um  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . I'd ignore that . 
D:  Leave it blank . 
A:  Okay . We're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a L_C_D_ and scroll . So our total is fifteen point five . Which I believe is 
B:  Yeah that's too much . 
A:  by three Euros over . 
B:  It's hard to believe . So we'll go for the hand dynamo huh ? <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  So the only thing better than um a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake . 
C:  If it w 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on . And just had a scroll wheel interface . And the L_C_D_ display . I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah 'cause the  
D:  <cough> 
A:  Well 'cause we have to have both right ? 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  I mean let's let's face it , it also depends on the software on the on the television . You can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen . So s yeah let's take away the  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even , if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T_V_ itself . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . Right . 
A:  So we may not need the L_C_D_ display ? 
C:  Uh that is possible yeah . 
B:  Right . We may not need it .

A:  Next slide . Project evaluation . Uh project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found . Um  So  I guess that  Let's see here . I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me . But I'd like to hear your thoughts . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Fair enough . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Trying to fill in some time there . <laugh> 
A:  Uh h what did you think of our project process ? 
C:  I think we did  yeah I think we did quite well . Um  
B:  Great . <other> 
A:  <cough> 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Good . 
D:  Good teamwork  . <laugh> 
B:  Just half a day , you have a remote . There you go . 
C:  Yeah . Right from the start of the day . 
A:  Yeah I think  
C:  We sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought . 
A:   we st we started off a little little weak . Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning . Um <laugh> um  
D:  <other> <laugh> 
A:  But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . Um room for creativity ? There was that . Um I think we tried a lotta different things and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things . Um you guys worked together well as a team . And um the means ? Which was the whiteboard and the pens . 
C:  Yeah . We've used the whiteboard . 
B:  Super super . 
A:  I had some problem with the pen I think , but <laugh> minus your p 
D:  Minus your PowerPoint fiasco .
