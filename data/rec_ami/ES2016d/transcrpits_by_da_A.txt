Yep . 
Soon as I get this . 
Okay . 
This is our last meeting . 
Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . 
Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation . 
<other> Um then we will um do an evaluation . 
Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . 
Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . 
Um then we'll do the evaluation , 
and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , 
or hopefully everything will fall right in line . 
Um let's see , 
minutes from the last meeting . 
Um we looked at uh the the trends . 
We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . 
It was twice as important as anything else . 
Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . 
Um and a spongy feel . 
So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . 
Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . 
Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . 
Um looking at other other devices . 
Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that . 
Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . 
Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . 
Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . 
But I think we've still decided not to go with that . 
<other> Then we looked at the components um 
the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , 
um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . 
Um and basically how , 
what were making for the prototype . 
So I'm going to leave it at that 
and let you guys take over . 
The prototype yeah . 
Do you need a  this ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Very nice . 
Mm-hmm . 
What but 
what's that button ? 
Uh , 'kay . 
'Kay . 
<other> 
Would you like to uh  
Well done . 
Well luckily we are going to find out . 
Or not luckily . 
Um do you have a marketing presentation for us . 
I think it's definitely different than anything else out there . 
So if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes I would say , I would say most definitely . 
It's bright . 
It still has your traditional black . 
Yep , not angular . 
Mm . 
<other> Yep . 
<laugh> 
Yeah something more modern to go  
a a modern colour to go with the modern form . 
Yeah . 
I would say 
four . <laugh> 
Very non-committal , four . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
S scrolling through and selecting a few . 
I think that's a one . 
<laugh> 
So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could  
And it is quite bright 
and  
Uh  
Yeah . 
But if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit I think . 
Probably two . 
You know . 
If we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then 
I'd say two . 
With the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget . 
Which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a  
<laugh> 
Some sort of proximity <other>  
<other> Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Two . 
It's  <laugh> 
But there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow . 
Course that wasn't really  
we were kinda forced to take that colour . 
I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . <laugh> 
If we added the screaming factor <laugh> then we go up . 
<laugh> Um I would say we're probably at four . 
We have some spongy , yeah . 
No . 
Yeah . 
Because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side  the bottom  the underneath on the back . 
Probably a four at most . 
Possibly even a five . 
<other> 
If your fashion is b is Carmen Miranda , you betcha . <laugh> 
It's true . 
Seven is  
Two point  
 two point four ? 
Something . 
And what what is the acceptable criteria ? 
Is there like a scale that we have to hit ? 
<laugh> 
Alright then . 
Okay . 
Well , let's see . 
Now we get to do the budget numbers . 
You didn't know that you were gonna have a budget . 
But we do . 
Okay . 
So I have here an  
Yeah . 
We want a fifty percent profit on this . 
Oh you can't really see that very well . 
<laugh> Twelve and a half Euros is what supposed to cost us . 
Okay , so  
Well let's see . 
The f the  
Wonder if I can make this  
What the  
<other> 
Oh it won't let me do that . 
Okay . 
Alright so at top , I don't know if you guys can read that or not . 
I can't 'cause I don't have my glasses on , 
but so we've got the energy source . 
There's uh four , five , six categories . 
We have energy source , electronics , case . 
Then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements . 
Okay so  
Uh first of all energy source , we picked battery . 
Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ? 
Probably 
some e either two or four . 
Two ? 
<other> Like it . <laugh> 
<laugh> Excellent . 
This is consumerism . 
Alright so 
for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker . 
'Kay , 
 we have one of those . 
'Kay then the case is a  Probably it's double curved . 
Case materials are 
plastic . 
Um I guess it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom . 
Is that right or is it just one ? 
Maybe it's one because of the  
'Kay . 
I guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , 
which is nice . 
Special colour ? 
<laugh> Interface type . We have pushbutton , scroll-wheel interface , integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton , and an L_C_D_ display . 
So we actually have the L_C_D_ display 
and then is it the integrated or is it  
Yeah . 
'Kay . 
Button supplement ? Special colour ? 
Um special form ? Special material . 
<laugh> 
Or titanium . 
They cost us all the same . 
Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , 
<laugh> we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements . 
Um  
Okay . 
We're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a L_C_D_ and scroll . 
So our total is fifteen point five . 
Which I believe is 
by three Euros over . 
<laugh> 
So the only thing better than um a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake . 
Yeah 
'cause the  
Well 'cause we have to have both right ? 
Mm-hmm . 
So we may not need the L_C_D_ display ? 
Well there we go . 
Twelve point five . 
Okay . 
So we just remove our <laugh> 
screen here . 
<Vocal noise> 
Besides look at what the L_C_D_ does to our lovely remote . 
Back to the design room boys . 
<laugh> 
<other> Okay so 
the costs under twelve point five Euro . 
Was no . We redesigned it . Now it's yes . 
Next slide . 
Project evaluation . 
Uh project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found . 
Um  
So  
I guess that  
Let's see here . 
I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me . 
But I'd like to hear your thoughts . 
<laugh> 
Uh h what did you think of our project process ? 
<cough> 
Good . 
Yeah I think  
 we st we started off a little little weak . 
Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning . 
Um <laugh> um  
But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . 
Um room for creativity ? 
There was that . 
Um I think we tried a lotta different things 
and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things . 
Um you guys worked together well as a team . 
And um the means ? 
Which was the whiteboard and the pens . 
I had some problem with the pen I think , 
but <laugh> minus your p 
Well  
<laugh> 
Have a  
we have a list of employees that you would like fired . 
Okay . 
N new ideas found ? 
Um  
Yes for the remote . 
Maybe no not f for 
technology . 
Alright . 
Closing . 
Costs are within the budget . 
Project is evaluated . 
Um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary . 
That's it . 
And I still have to do my minutes for the last meeting . <laugh> 
Actually . 
Um so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up . 
And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that . 
But that's the end of our meeting .
