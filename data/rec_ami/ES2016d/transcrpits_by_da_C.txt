The prototype discussion . 
No . <cough> 
There is our remo  the banana . 
Um <other> yeah 
basically we we st went with the colour yellow . 
Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana . 
Um but it would be held in such a fashion , 
where it is , 
obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . 
These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . 
So that's 
so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . 
Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . 
You have to use your imagination a little bit . 
And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through . 
And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod , 
where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . 
Volume up and down . 
And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . 
It's that that simple . 
That just represents the infrared uh beam . 
That's a simple on and off switch . 
Um I don't know , 
we could use the voice . 
T that blue bits should be yellow , 
that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose . 
And um <other> 
that's about it . 
It's as simple as you , we could make it really . 
Is there anything you want to add ? 
Yeah . 
Doesn't make much make much difference . 
You could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose . 
T the actual thing might be smaller . 
<other> Yeah . 
Just the on and off . 
Yeah . 
It's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy Play-Doh , 
but  
<laugh> 
And whether or not it would fall into the cost  everything I suppose . 
With the scroll and the L_C_D_ . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Yeah . 
I would  . 
It's bright . 
It's  
It's curved . 
It's not  
there's no sharp 
angles to it . 
Some people might say it . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had . 
Uh yeah . 
'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls  most common , which are channel and volume . 
And then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
It's bright yellow . 
Bright yellow's hard to lose . 
But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . 
That was what we'd we'd mentioned . 
Just just to use , to find it when it was lost . 
But like I said , like I don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily . 
And it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . 
That's gonna be a difficult shape to  
Yeah . 
Maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ? 
I mean you know  loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , I mean a million ways . 
You can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah true . 
But I mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . They're cheap . 
So it can't be that 
expensive . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
 stick it on the T_V_  . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Two . 
<other> I'd say so . 
Uh don't get many mo remote controls with 
screens on . 
Yeah it's stolen technology . 
But we have  . 
Fa 
 'cause it's stolen . 
No maybe not . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah as much as as needed , I think . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
On the  
Yeah . 
Be what we were told , and they'd say yeah , definitely . 
 . 
Is that some long division ? 
No . 
<laugh> 
Just , I'm sure there's a  . 
No I can't do long  
very impressive . 
Yeah . Yeah so . 
You'd been going a long time dividing that . 
It's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on . 
Two point four two basically . 
<laugh> Charge about three hundred quid for it . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
We're advanced chip are we ? 
Yeah  yeah . 
<laugh> 
S 
That's  
Yeah . 
And then  
I'd say the integrated . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
 remote control  . 
No 
that's getting a bit 
tiny . 
Yeah . 
I'd ignore that . 
<laugh> 
If it w 
What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on . 
And just had a scroll wheel interface . 
And the L_C_D_ display . 
I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even , 
if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T_V_ itself . 
Uh that is possible yeah . 
There we go . 
Screen . 
Make it a bigger dial . 
Easier to use . 
Even easier to use then . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
That was just  
we ran out of yellow . <laugh> 
There you go . 
Even simpler . 
Yeah . 
For all those fruit lovers out there . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
I think we did  
yeah I think we did quite well . Um  
Yeah . 
Right from the start of the day . 
We sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought . 
Yeah . 
We've used the whiteboard . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Technology used . 
Excellent .
