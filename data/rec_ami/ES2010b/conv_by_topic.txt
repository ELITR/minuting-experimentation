A:  Okay . Um welcome to our second meeting . This is the functional design meeting . And I hope you all had a good individual working time . Okay , let's get started . Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting . After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . And we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . Um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control . And then we're gonna close up the meeting . And we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes .  


A:  Okay . First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting . First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of  'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . 
C:  <other> 
A:  'Kay . 
C:  <other> <laugh> <other> 
A:  Oh , well let's go ahead and ,  back , previous .

C:  Sure . <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  Okay . Great . 
C:  Okay . 
C:  And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? And what functions it needs to complete . Uh , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place . 
A:   
C:  So that's it . Mm 
A:  Alright . Very good presentation . Thank you . You speak with such authority on the matter . <laugh>

B:  Yeah , I'm just trying to move it . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  'Kay . I think it should be there , working design . 
C:  Working design . 
A:  There we go . 
C:  <cough> 
A:  'Kay . Oh my bad . <other> 
D:  Oh that's fine . 
B:  'Kay . Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating . 


A:  Okay , let's talk about all of our  We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's um wrap up this one , and <other> I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . <laugh> Wait , come back . Alright . Sorry , let's go through this . Alright . Here we go . New product requirements . First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . We're trying not to over-complicate things . So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo . It's not gonna be multi-functional . 
B:  <other> Okay . 
C:   
A:  Hey . And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . We're trying to get our name out there in the world . Okay . And you know what teletext is ? 
C:   Yeah . 
A:   in States we don't have it , but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports , it's very um bland looking , it's just text on the screen , not even  Yeah , just black with just text . 
C:  I know . 
D:  What is it ? 
C:  <cough> Yeah , it's like black , black and white kind of  
D:  Like running along the bottom ? 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so  
C:  It'll give you the sports . 
D:  Wait , is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ? 
A:  Kind of . 
C:  Except the entire screen . 
B:  It's the entire screen is just running information at random . Seemingly . 
A:  Yeah it's the whole screen . 
C:  You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , you know it's like  
A:  So anyway  
D:  So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ? 
A:  Right . Right . But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet . Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , <other> and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so  Those are our new product requirements . Alright . Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  Okay . So , do we have to include the company colour within that ? 
A:  Yes . It's part of the logo . Okay . 
C:  Company colour being yellow . <laugh> 


A:  What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting . So . Alright .  Whatever . Okay . 
A:  Okay . And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes . 
C:  Well it's channel , on-off button , volume , mute . 
A:  Mm-hmm , volume . 
D:  And channel . Yeah . Those are the most important ones . 
A:  Right . And we wanna keep um  I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . Correct , because people only use ten percent . 'Kay . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Hey , what else ? 
C:  Um . 
A:  Um . 
C:  <other> 


A:  Okay .  get out of here . Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next . Mm . Alright . After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail . And then we're gonna have lunch break . And after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time . Um I'm gonna put the minutes  I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder , if you'd like to review them . And I'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well . Um here's what we're each going to do . The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept , um U_I_D_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching . 'Kay . Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . And if anybody has anything they would like to add ? No ? Okay , well , this meeting is officially over . Thank you all .
