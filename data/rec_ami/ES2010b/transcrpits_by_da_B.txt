Did you send it ? 
Okay . Great . 
<other> 
We only use ten per cent of our brains . <laugh> 
<other> yeah . 
Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ? 
Yeah , 
I'm just trying to move it . 
'Kay . I think it should be there , working design . 
'Kay . Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating . 
Uh okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . 
We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . 
Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . 
Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart . 
Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions . 
I wouldn't think so , 
'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . 
And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap . 
Um yep , 
nothing here . 
Um power source , I figured , batteries , 
'cause they're easily available . 
Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three . 
Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself . 
Um a large on-off button , 
<other> demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , 
so a large on-off button would probably be good . 
Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system . 
Um smart chip that perverts  uh that permits , sorry , universal application 
again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , 
and that's kinda it . 
Uh this is my fifty second design . 
Power source over here . 
We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . 
Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , 
um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . 
Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to . 
This is just like a rough schematic . 
So this is the internal workings . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , 
'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ? 
We can skip that whole thing . 
Yep . 
So you can put it in the dark . <laugh> 
Yeah , that's it . 
I think that that's a good idea , 
because you know that's one of the most important buttons . 
<other> Okay . 
You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so  
It's the entire screen is just running information at random . 
Seemingly . 
Okay . 
So , do we have to include the company colour within that ? 
Mm well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra , 
'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them , 
then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons . 
Most of them will intuitively pick it up though . 
 
 how 'bout little to no , 
because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no . 
Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ? 
And 
like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? 
What if we gave it a charger ? 
And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , 
and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you . 
It's useful for the remote phone . 
Yeah . 
Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
I think people would find that too foreign . 
It's when we get satellite . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so  
R_ the double R_ . 
Or is the l 
Yeah , 
<other> yellow could be and it could 
 doesn't have to be huge . 
Mm-hmm . 
I had something , but I forgot .
