Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or  
I can go . 
Yeah , you should run it . 
<other> Mm yes . 
Yes , 
okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , 
and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , 
and we found that the <laugh> users are not typically happy with current remote controls . 
Seventy five percent think they're ugly . 
Eighty percent want  they've  are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier , 
and basically w we just need something that really 
I mean there's some other points up there , 
but they  it needs to be snazzy and it  but yet simple . 
So that's really what we need to do . 
And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . So  
Like  
They like I guess use the buttons a lot . 
Yeah . 
I don't know . 
It's from my uh research . 
My team wasn't very clear . 
<laugh> That's okay . 
I I think it's like the engineering versus user , 
whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex 
and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really . 
Good point . 
It's a necessary evil . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> And so people say that they typically lose it , 
as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , 
much like any small appliance like a cellphone , 
and they  
we need something simple , 
because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , 
and we don't want to go  
we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , 
but I mean they do need to be able to identify it , 
and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is . 
Yes , it is important for the remote control world . 
Sh 
Uh possibly . 
Uh yeah , that's what my web site said , 
I 
don't know . 
Yeah , I would assume so . 
I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts . 
<laugh> But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important 
on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , 
but those are the definitely the top ones . 
Yes . 
And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , 
but it it really needs to be simple . 
So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , 
I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . 
Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . 
Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . 
And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , 
so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in  like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , 
as well as the age range . 
So we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product . 
And also we found  our team found that speech recognition is  it's like an up-and-coming thing 
they really  
consumers are really interested in it , 
and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it . 
I guess so , yeah . 
Yeah , 
I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . 
Oh that's fine . 
What exactly is a smart chip ? 
So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ? 
Oh okay . 
Like that we know the battery's working . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , and that's good . 
We should make it glow in the dark . <laugh> 
Mm 'kay . 
I think we should . 
Like I think that would be in a as in  like in  for the design , 
sorry , um . 
I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 
'cause most remotes have small square buttons , 
I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles . 
What is it ? 
Like running along the bottom ? 
Wait , 
is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ? 
So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ? 
Okay . 
No , 
kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think . 
They gotta change between Disney Channel , Cartoon Network . 
Yeah , I think we need it all . 
Um I would say we should say dumber than the average person . 
Yeah . 
And channel . 
Yeah . 
Those are the most important ones . 
Yeah . 
Sure , yeah . 
I need  
we we need a like homing device . 
Because people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech . 
Do you think people'll really go for that though ? 
Because  
Yeah . 
I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base . 
Hmm . 
Right . 
Do w 
Well , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , 
I don't know if you guys ge 
It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black , 
but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . 
So <other> basically older people don't really care . 
It's really the people twenty five to thirty five . 
I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though . 
They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and 
just sitcoms and stuff . 
Right . 
So  
Right . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Wait , 
on the remote itself ? 
Well , we definitely need those . 
Yeah . 
You definitely need  
Wait . 
I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish . 
Or put like stripes , 
oh yeah , yellow lights . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those 
like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , 
or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ? 
Yeah , 'cause we need to  we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . 
It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , 
and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television 
if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful . 
So we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons . 
Yeah , okay . 
Okay , yeah . 
Such as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one . 
Ooh , 
I just got an idea for a design .
