Okay . 
Um welcome to our second meeting . 
This is the functional design meeting . 
And I hope you all had a good individual working time . 
Okay , let's get started . 
Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting . 
After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . 
And we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . 
Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . 
Um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control . 
And then we're gonna close up the meeting . 
And we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes .  
Okay . 
First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting . 
First we need to determine the user requirements 
and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . 
And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , 
what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . 
And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , 
that's the whole technical side of  
'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . 
'Kay . 
Oh , 
well let's go ahead and , 
 back , previous . 
So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did . 
Who would like to start us off ? 
'Kay . 
Okay . 
Um do you have a PowerPoint or no ? 
Okay . 
Oh . 
Save it in the project documents . 
Okay . 
Mm-mm-mm . 
This one ? 
Okay . 
 
Okay . 
Okay . 
<cough> 
Right . 
Ready . 
 
Alright . 
Very good presentation . 
Thank you . 
You speak with such authority on the matter . 
<laugh> Okay . 
Who would like to um follow that one up ? 
Now , that we've discussed  
Okay . 
Do you want me to run it or you wanna  
Okay . 
<do d- do sounds imitating whistling> 
Functional requirements . 
'Kay . 
Alright . 
Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements . 
Okay , what do you m 
Oh , I'm sorry . 
What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons . 
Okay . 
Oh , right . 
The buttons . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
It works . 
<laugh> Ready for the next slide ? 
Hmm . 
It's okay . 
It's very important . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Could be , yeah . 
Oh . 
I think that's a pretty good guess though . 
Yeah . It's okay . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Next slide ? 
User-friendly . 
And so just to  
just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> Oh , that'd be lovely . 
<other> Didn't they  um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would  the remote would beep so if you have lost it  
Mm . Oh , yeah , that's true . 
We could definitely include that if we wanted to . 
If it's within our price . 
Okay . 
Are we ready for our last presentation , Amber ? 
Okay . 
There we go . 
'Kay . 
Oh my bad . 
<other> 
Okay . 
Ready ? 
That's okay . 
Hmm . 
 
So this would be the front ? 
So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ? 
Okay . 
The l <other> the light up kind of  
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
It'd probably be lighting up the key too , 
right ? 
'Kay . 
The buttons . 
Okay . 
Yeah , definitely . 
'Kay nex R Ready ? 
'Kay , any p 'Kay ? 
Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , 
you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . 
Anything else ? 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
Okay , let's talk about all of our  
We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , 
let's um wrap up this one , 
and <other> I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 
'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements 
which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . 
<laugh> Wait , come back . 
Alright . 
Sorry , 
let's go through this . 
Alright . 
Here we go . 
New product requirements . 
First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . 
We're trying not to over-complicate things . 
So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo . 
It's not gonna be multi-functional . 
Hey . 
And we th need to promote our company more , 
so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . 
We're trying to get our name out there in the world . 
Okay . 
And you know what teletext is ? 
 in States we don't have it , 
but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports , 
it's very um bland looking , 
it's just text on the screen , 
not even  
Yeah , 
just black with just text . 
Yeah . 
Kind of . 
Yeah it's the whole screen . 
So anyway  
Right . 
Right . 
But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet . 
Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , 
<other> and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so  
Those are our new product requirements . 
Alright . Mm-hmm . 
Yes . 
It's part of the logo . 
Okay . 
What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions 
and just definite things that we need to do 
and then we'll close up the meeting . 
So . Alright . 
 Whatever . 
Okay . 
So our target group is  
You mentioned um older people ? 
Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ? 
Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically  
non-technically challenged people are gonna use it . 
I mean they want something user-friendly , so  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay , so we want um for our target group would we say , I mean , young and old , all age ranges , 
all um , 
not kids obviously , 
right ? 
Or kids ? 
 
Okay , 
so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range  
Um what about 
technic technical um specifications , 
like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ? 
Okay . 
Right , okay . 
So so they need no technical experience to operate  
Okay . 
And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , 
just to get it all out on paper . 
So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . 
So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes . 
Mm-hmm , volume . 
Right . 
And we wanna keep um  
I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . 
Correct , 
because people only use ten percent . 
'Kay . 
Hey , what else ? 
Um . 
I think so . 
What do you  
A finding kind of device or  
Yeah , ho homing device . <laugh> 
Mm 'kay . 
Okay . 
Right . 
Hmm . 
Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ? 
Right . 
Okay . 
I I think we can make a decision about that later . 
Uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss . 
So that would include battery source  
Power source rather . 
Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? 
And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that . 
Mm . 
You could um 
 we could hook it up . 
Oh . 
Mm-hmm . 
And if and if we introduced it when they're this age , they're going to probably always buy a remote that has  
Right . 
Yeah . 
 and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . 
If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something . 
A certain phrase then it could beep . 
I dunno . 
Just throwing it out there . 
Well  <laugh> 
Okay , anything else we wanna discuss ? 
Um . 
 
How how , 
yeah , 
how would you leave those out ? 
Unless you could say the channel . 
Yeah , that's true . 
And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . 
I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . 
<laugh> So I couldn't  whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ . 
Mm . 
 get your own remote , or digital cable . 
'Kay . Um . 
I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , 
making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . Um . 
'Kay . 
And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo . 
I'm guessing . 
And the R_R_ . 
We could just have the logo in yellow , 
or maybe a yellow light for the keys . 
Right . 
So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind , 
or no menu buttons . 
So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers  
Yeah . <laugh> 
<other> Um can we go back to  
I'm gonna look really quickly back at those 
examples 
and see if there is anything . 
Which one is yours , technical functions 
or functional requirement ? 
Okay . 
The T_V_ . 
I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ . 
I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ? 
Hmm . 
Couldn't we do that all through one button , 
something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language , 
you know ? 
For the menus . 
That's true . 
Something that looks mayb you know . 
Y right , right right right . 
That one ? 
Right . 
In the middle perhaps . 
Yep . 
 good . 
Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting ? 
<laugh> Okay . 
 get out of here . 
Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next . Mm . 
Alright . 
After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail . 
And then we're gonna have lunch break . 
And after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time . 
Um I'm gonna put the minutes  
I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder , 
if you'd like to review them . 
And I'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well . 
Um here's what we're each going to do . 
The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept , 
um U_I_D_ the user interface concept , 
and you're going to do some trend watching . 
'Kay . 
Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . 
And if anybody has anything they would like to add ? 
No ? 
Okay , well , this meeting is officially over . 
Thank you all .
