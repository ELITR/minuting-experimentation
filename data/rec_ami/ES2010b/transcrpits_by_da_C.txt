<other> 
<other> <laugh> 
<other> 
I don't mind going first . 
Yeah , 
it's in the  should be in the m Project . 
You know you could you could do it yourself actually . 
Put it in Project Documents , 
yeah . 
Sure . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Um well , 
the function <other> of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , 
for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . 
Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include 
it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , 
the channel going up and down , 
volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . 
And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , 
for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . 
And enter would be for like , you know , the menus . 
<cough> And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , 
whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus . 
And we can decide if that's what we want ,  , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example . 
These are two examples . 
Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , 
and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , 
and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . 
And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , 
it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is  fast-forward is also like next on a menu . 
So you have functions that are d uh duplicating . 
And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . 
So that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version . 
Okay . 
And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider 
like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? 
And what functions it needs to complete . 
Uh , what are needed to complete insulation process , 
'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered 
and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , 
but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place . 
So that's it . 
Mm . Left . 
 Wait . 
And that meaning what ? 
Okay . 
 
Right . 
Only use ten percent of the buttons . 
<laugh> <cough> 
Lost . 
S 
Wait , 
is that like your  
ergonomics like your hand movements or something ? 
Like  <laugh> 
Channel , volume , power . 
<cough> 
It's like if you're holding it  
 
<cough> 
 to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . 
You know like go to the base . 
Yeah . 
Working design . 
<cough> 
Help me . 
<laugh> 
Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? 
Is that gonna push us over our production costs ? 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
 
<laugh> 
 
<laugh> 
Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , 
but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Just  
Well , should it be larger buttons in general , 
you know like uh the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . 
So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ? 
Ovals . 
Yeah , yeah . 
 
 
Yeah . 
I know . 
<cough> 
Yeah , 
it's like black , black and white kind of  
It'll give you the sports . 
Except the entire screen . 
You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , 
you know it's like  
Yeah . 
Company colour being yellow . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
It's gonna make it nicer . 
Yeah . 
We should go for the lowest denominator . 
High school educated . 
Well it's channel , on-off button , volume , mute . 
Um . 
<other> 
 
Oh right 
yeah okay . 
Tracking . 
But you got a base . 
Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery . 
Yeah . 
Well , then we could  
If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic . 
 
Well  
Well , then then do you put the voice recognition  do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , 
'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , 
whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . 
Still  fifteen minutes . 
Um . 
Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? 
Can we conceive of leaving them out ? 
Yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero . 
Well , I don't know , 
I mean , if you can  like well  
I don't know , 
if there's just a way of leaving them out ? 
The colour being yellow ? 
And how do we  
Can't make it entirely  
Well if you have like a <other>  
Hang on . 
If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom  the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ . 
Right , yeah . 
<laugh> 
Two examples . 
Yeah . 
Oh , it's a  
Yeah . 
Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , 
you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use . 
and so it's like  
I don't  well , I don't know . 
Right . 
Well , that could be  
No 
you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons . 
Channel is just up and down . 
And then add a  
Yeah . 
So we just have it like  add a menu button then for the various things needed , 
including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now 
included in the menu .
