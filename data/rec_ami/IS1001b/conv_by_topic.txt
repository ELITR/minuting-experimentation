A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> <cough> 
A:  <cough> 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Okay everyone's ready . 
B:  Hello . 
A:  So we are here for uh for uh functional design . 
B:   
A:  Okay ? So we are here for the functional design meeting mm <other> so first I will show the agenda so we will uh I will take notes during this meeting so 
B:  <other> 
A:  I will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . Then I will uh present you some new project requirements I received from uh the management board . Then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions and then I will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . Of the  of the process . 


A:  So uh who want to start the the presentation of what they did ? 
D:  Mm . 
C:  F do you want to start ? 
B:  Make a start yeah . So . <cough> Cable , camera . Should be in my  in their folder no ? Up . 
A:  You can start . <other> You have uh PowerPoint ? Ah yeah maybe there . Okay . Who are you ? <laugh> 
B:  Um at three I think . 
A:  <other> 
B:  No ? <other> Mm . 
A:  Ouch . 
B:  <other> 
A:  And  
C:  Okay . <laugh> 
A:  We have a technical problem uh . 
B:  Do we think w s in the  in the wrong folder maybe ? <other> It is possible . 
A:  You put it on  
C:  No . 
B:  It was somewhere in something like this . I don't remember the name actually must be something like messenger AMI or something . 
C:  What do you have in short cut ? 
B:  Go up . 
C:  Participant two . 
B:  Yeah go up . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Again . No . Go back . 
A:  You have no  
B:  Uh maybe messenger AMI . Messenger . 
A:  Over . Okay . 
B:  No . There is nothing . 
A:  There's no  We have a technical problem . 
B:  Let's go and check . I'll go and check . 
C:  Yeah . Otherwise , could you just describe by hand ? With the the whiteboard ? 
B:  Okay . Yeah . 
A:  If you remember yeah but that's  


B:  Yeah . So uh . Basically <other> what we want here is a remote control right . <other> So um the question well first of all what to control . So <other> most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and T_V_ and stuff like that . And  but other people want th also remotes for <other> controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , so there's a project I think called X_ house or something like that that does that , uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff . So <other> there is one  that is one thing . The other is the 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever . Uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have 
C:  Okay . 
B:  uh at the same time as  and general voice commands if you want yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  <other> So I think it should be a package in that case . Uh so the user interface will consist of two parts . <other> One is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part . <other> Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space , 
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
B:  a set of buttons for <other> linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah ? 
C:  What do you mean by linear access then ? 
B:  Like a video tape goes forward , backwards , uh fast and stuff yeah . 
C:  Ah . 
B:  Um . 
A:  Okay so special navigation , linear access , random access and there's a fourth one no ? 
B:  Mm ? 
A:  So the better now for special navigation ? 
B:  Yeah . For special navigation for example you might have a T_V_ in the menu and you going to change yeah ? Uh . 
A:  Okay . Then linear access then random access . 
B:  Mm . Yeah and also parameter changing . <other> So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and <other> basically this is most of the  almost everybody has this stuff . 
A:  Ah yeah parameter okay . Okay . Okay . Okay and and voice command did you uh  
B:  Voice command w we could specify anything . We could assign any button  a command to any button , if we have enough processing power , I guess so . <other> Yeah . 
A:  Okay . Okay . Okay . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  So that's uh that close your investigations ? 
B:  Yeah . Uh yeah I think so . Not so far . 
A:  Okay . 


A:  Okay . Maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with  
D:  Yeah . <cough> Um I dunno if you can open the  uh m is not here . 
A:  I dunno if I can open it . Maybe you can s It's  
D:  Uh in  yeah okay . No . 
A:  Messenger no ? 
D:  In document  . Mm computer yeah . 
A:  In which folder ? 
B:  Where did you put it ? 
D:  Here . Here . 
A:  <other> Short-cut to AMI shared folder ? 
B:   mm . 
D:  But it's not  Um . 
A:  Maybe you can send it to me by email . Just to participant one . At AMI . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Yeah , I can do that . 
A:  I will try to show it to everyone , that would be more comfortable . 
D:  Okay . Um . 
A:  You send it ? 
D:  <other> It's participant one ? 
A:  Yeah . Uh this is this email . 
B:  I'm designing the user interface . <laugh> 
D:  Okay . You can uh . 
A:  Okay . So maybe I can switch slides when you  whenever you ask , that will be more convenient . So okay , functional requirements . 
D:  Yeah . Okay so you can  you can go . Okay so <cough> in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled a questionnaire okay ? 
A:  Mm . Yeah . 
D:  And here I have the results so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more <other> more nice , more kind . Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy . <other> Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look  oh  to  it's not good . <laugh> So okay . So it's not in theory  but I I can I can say yeah . <other> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  We can just keep doing that ? Yeah . 
D:  Fifty f uh seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot . So mm <other> we have to have a remote control uh very um <other> out for that . <laugh> Uh the buttons have  are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks . <laugh> Um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh <other> ten per cents of but of the buttons in the  in the remote control . So all the buttons we we have to put are  have to to have um a use a real use and not only or  
A:  Okay . 
C:  <other> 
A:  Okay . Okay . Okay , so fewer buttons maybe would be good ? 
D:  Yeah . F not many buttons , and uh and uh uh u useable buttons <laugh> . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  But what kind of remote controls did you look at ? 
D:  Sorry ? 
B:  What kind of task was it ? It was a T_V_ ? 
D:  Yeah . Uh <other> most for most is T_V_ . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah but in fact we  it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management bo I will present them in the following . Okay . 
B:  Huh . Uh-huh . Ah ! Good . 
D:  <laugh> 'Kay you can go so . So there are other frustrations expressed by users , so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to <other> to 
A:  Yeah . To find it . Yeah . 
D:  to find it . Um and um lot of the time they  it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . So they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  And uh remote controls are bad for 
A:  What is her other side ? 
D:  R_S_I_ <laugh> um  I dunno . 
B:  Other side yeah , yo wa your wrist . 
A:  <other> 
B:  It i can become painful you can have tendonditis . 
A:  Oh yeah ? I did not knew that . 
B:  Yeah . If you also  up on a computer in a strange position . 
A:  Okay so you  we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah . 
B:  Ergonomic . But uh <laugh> . Have to say ha ha . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> It's your job <laugh> Oh . <other> 
D:  <laugh> <other> Uh . 
A:  Uh sorry <laugh> got a message from Microsoft . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Okay um before that I I have some some <other> some thing <other> uh to say before um  
A:  Yeah . Yeah yeah . 
D:  <other> We know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel . <other> Um and um to to change uh volume selection of the  and uh and not uh a lot for setting  for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that . So it's better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set and uh and  
A:  Yeah . Okay . Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Okay . Yeah . This function should be very uh accessible . Yeah , okay . This is the main function okay . 
D:  Very accessible yes . That's right . <cough> So then we asked some questions to them and um we asked this question if they prefer an L_C_D_ screen or on their remultific function remotes control and if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control and you can go <other> we have here the results of 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  The first question . 
D:  of the questions . So you know that um 
A:  <other> 
D:  <other> for the younger it's very important 
A:  To have L_C_D_ and voice . 
D:  to have the s yes and speech recognition . And uh and the others is not so important but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot T_V_ and uh who who wh can use a lot this uh . So maybe we we can have a speech recognition in . Yeah . 
A:  Okay . Yeah maybe this this is important . Moreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can  we have to take care of that point of view I think or so . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Mm . Okay and if there is th the conclusion now . So as we say before , I think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing . Uh not to many mud buttons like we we said before , e easy to use uh a way to find it easily in the room and uh uh resistant to to shock and to to  
A:  Yeah . Okay . Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  <other> An I s no , yeah . <other> I dunno if you see something else important or  
A:  <other> Okay these are the user requi 
C:  <other> 
A:  <other> 


C:  I'm just thinking of some thing . Um  
D:  Mm . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  We want to have a  no , I don't know if this is a good idea . We want to have a a general remote control for everything . 
A:  No no no . We  w it seems that we no want to have a T_V_ remote control . From the management board I receive an email . Cos it would be costly 
C:  Okay . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Mm  I  it's not true I think . The the second claim that you put . 
C:  No no . <other> 
A:  That it would be too long to develop . 
B:  Yeah . I think that should be the same . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  Oh yeah . Because I received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important . So maybe it's a good decision . I dunno . What's your opinion ? 
B:  I have uh I've no idea I mean I should know a bit more about how fast we can uh design it . I don't think  
D:  <cough> 
A:  <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . Okay 
C:  Finish tonight . <laugh> 


C:  But basically yeah maybe I can continue with my presentation , it would be al you  you  but I think we have some technical problem or so . So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control . If fact  
B:  . Yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do I don't know . 
C:  Yeah but  
D:  Mm . 
C:  Do I have  oh yeah . Now I have enough cables . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Like a  you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <other> Okay so I'm just going to describe  in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy . We just have  sorry , I'm going <other> 
B:  <other> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> 
A:  Okay . Are you okay ? <laugh> 
C:  Like that . I'm just going to describe . Basically we have a a battery a power supply here . After that we just have um user interface . Let's say that um something like that , which could be um a L_C_D_ let's say or um an array of push button , something like that . Push button or a L_C_D_ . After that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip . So I say U_C_ and I feed that to uh L_E_D_ which is uh infrared  um which is a an infrared um component . And so what we  for for myself this  for for us this is quite easy . 
A:  U_C_ is the central unit ? 
C:  Yeah . Y it's a  it's  this just a chip which does all the um numerical 
A:  Okay yeah . Computation . 
C:  numerical computation according to your display . And so for us uh this is quite easy . We just need to take  to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the  not the  to the television . So for us this is quite easy . 
A:  Okay . Okay . Okay so this is quite easy . There is not that much constraints . 
C:  Yeah . Um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition , in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple  
B:  <other> This will  think this will take more time to develop also . Yeah . <other> 
C:  Yeah of course of course . And um but for a standard one this is really easy . It's a question of one month and so on s 
B:  Soon . 
A:  To have a  you s you speak about with voi voice control ? 
C:  No no no no , I say  yeah  standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that . 
A:  Standard button one . 
B:  Yeah . So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition . Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  <cough> 
C:  Yeah . Definitely . 


A:  Okay . Maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement I receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  Um I just had a question uh do you want to continue with your presenta ? Is it  
D:  <cough> 
A:  Yeah I I will continue . Well ask your question if you want . 
C:  <other> Um you say that I don't remember by heart but thirty per cent 
D:  Mm ? 
C:  of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ? 
D:  Oh . Would j 
C:  To to  maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that . 
D:  Uh <other> yeah w I I think they they say that it's uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it , it's it's okay . But  
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . And  
A:  Okay . It's not intuitive first . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  But yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ? You say that I want , I have six button  
B:  Mh-hmm . A a lot of people are uh  if you have the L_C_D_ screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them but it will be hard to configure I mean imagine i uh  so it's really something for the expert user . So  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  But , but also it seems that  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  I mean there are markets and markets . I think the young people are th uh are uh  Christine here said uh you have a  <other> uh it is yeah . <other> So for our young people uh it will be cool , they can be able to use it . Th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it . I guess . I don't know if there is study about that . 
D:  <cough> 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . Maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple <laugh> than creating a simple product . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Mm . 
B:  And there are  another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else . All right ? 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Otherwise , if it's different then of course everybody has  somebody has to learn to use it first . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . But also we we see that that most people find it  find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons . So we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and maybe also um 
D:  Mm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
A:  some lightning stuff too because most people find also hard to to find the remote control . Losed lose it etcetera . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  These  these are  these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop . 
D:  Mm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 


A:  So but le let us see first the new requirement . So we don't have to  so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that  
B:  But teletext is just one button . 
A:  Yeah but then you have to  you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff . 
B:  You you just write the  write the numbers . 
A:  Yeah . So well  
B:  So will you add with the channel keys , right ? 
A:  Yeah . So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users , they prefer to s 
B:  So . <other> I am . I'm sure that uh it don't like but uh I don't see just one button . 
A:  Yeah . I dunno . If i one button is still one more button . If  if  if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors . 
B:  So . Mm-hmm . 
A:  Well anyway I have this point . We can discuss . Also um  so as as I told before uh it would be better if it's only for the T_V_ um because we want to be quick on on the market . And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the  on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product . So this is the the key point . 
D:  <cough> 


A:  So before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the  o th of the control  of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera . 
B:  Capital . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  <laugh> 


A:  Okay . So um I I will uh  I will  so I we will move to next meeting so in  after the lunch break uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required to do but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh email I think but you can take notes if you  if you want but well the instruction will be sent . So 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  thank you for uh your suggestion and I I will make a summary of that meeting that I will put in the shared folder you can't see <laugh> and uh and then you will um you will be able to to see what has been uh has been said on on this meeting and and what has been decided . Uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether . That would be easier . 
C:  Okay . Okay . Okay . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . What is the folder that you put yours in ? And did it it did work ? 
D:  Mm . <other> No . 
A:  No it did not work . She send it to me by email . 
D:  No no . I dunno , I dunno it . 
B:  Ah yeah . Mm . Okay . 
A:  So maybe this is better , to send it by email . Okay ? So yeah I I'm  it's in the first uh email so I'm participant one at AMI uh where is that , it's here . 
B:  Okay what is your email ? At participant one . Okay . 
A:  Participant one at AMI . <other> Okay . So see you after lunch break . 
D:  'Kay thank you . 
B:  Well during lunch break actually . <laugh> So next time we should have a fight . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  How about uh  management or something . Who happens to be your friend . 
A:  <cough> 
B:
