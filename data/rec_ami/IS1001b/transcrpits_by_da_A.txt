<laugh> 
<cough> 
Okay everyone's ready . 
So we are here for uh for uh functional design . 
Okay ? 
So we are here for the functional design meeting mm 
<other> so first I will show the agenda so 
we will uh 
I will take notes during this meeting so 
I will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards 
so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time 
so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . 
Then I will uh present you some new project requirements I received from uh the management board . 
Then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions 
and then I will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . 
Of the  of the process . 
So uh who want to start the the presentation of what they did ? 
You can start . 
<other> 
You have uh PowerPoint ? 
Ah yeah maybe there . 
Okay . 
Who are you ? <laugh> 
<other> 
Ouch . 
And  
We have a technical problem uh . 
You put it on  
Yeah . 
You have no  
Over . 
Okay . 
There's no  
We have a technical problem . 
If you remember yeah 
but that's  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay so special navigation , linear access , random access 
and there's a fourth one no ? 
So the better now for special navigation ? 
Okay . 
Then linear access 
then random access . 
Ah yeah parameter okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay 
and and voice command did you uh  
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
So that's uh that close your investigations ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with  
I dunno if I can open it . 
Maybe you can s 
It's  
Messenger no ? 
In which folder ? 
<other> Short-cut to AMI shared folder ? 
Maybe you can send it to me by email . 
Just to participant one . 
At AMI . 
I will try to show it to everyone , 
that would be more comfortable . 
You send it ? 
Yeah . 
Uh this is this email . 
Okay . 
So maybe I can switch slides when you  whenever you ask , 
that will be more convenient . 
So okay , 
functional requirements . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
We can just keep doing that ? 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay , 
so fewer buttons maybe would be good ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
but in fact we  it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management 
bo I will present them in the following . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
To find it . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
What is her other side ? 
<other> 
Oh yeah ? 
I did not knew that . 
Okay 
so you  we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah . 
<laugh> 
It's your job <laugh> 
Oh . <other> 
Uh sorry <laugh> 
got a message from Microsoft . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
This function should be very uh accessible . 
Yeah , okay . 
This is the main function okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
To have L_C_D_ and voice . 
Okay . 
Yeah maybe this this is important . 
Moreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment 
and so we can  
we have to take care of that point of view I think 
or so . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
<other> Okay these are the user requi 
<other> 
Yeah . 
No no no . 
We  w it seems that we no want to have a T_V_ remote control . 
From the management board I receive an email . 
Cos it would be costly 
uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control . 
That it would be too long to develop . 
Oh yeah . 
Because I received that email from management board 
and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important . 
So maybe it's a good decision . 
I dunno . 
What's your opinion ? 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do 
I don't know . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Are you okay ? <laugh> 
U_C_ is the central unit ? 
Okay yeah . 
Computation . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay so this is quite easy . 
There is not that much constraints . 
To have a  
you s you speak about with voi voice control ? 
Standard button one . 
So do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now ? 
<laugh> <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay so i it's a bit long yeah . 
One month for the standard one with button . 
Even if we have a L_C_D_ display ? 
Okay yeah . 
Okay 
so we can take this into account . 
So who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition ? 
<other> Yeah it will . 
Euros . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Well each unit is is sell uh twenty five Euros . 
Because we are  
It seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting . 
Okay . 
Maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement I receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have . 
Yeah I I will continue . 
Well ask your question if you want . 
Okay . 
It's not intuitive first . 
Yeah . 
But , but also it seems that  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple <laugh> than creating a simple product . 
Yeah . 
But also we we see that that most people find it  find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons . 
So we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons 
and maybe also um 
some lightning stuff too 
because most people find also hard to to find the remote control . 
Losed lose it etcetera . 
These  these are  
these two points are the main frustrations 
so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage 
without making something too complex and too long to develop . 
So but le let us see first the new requirement . 
So we don't have to  
so this this uh is uh is um in the 
this is in the same direction as we were speaking 
so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that  
Yeah but then you have to  you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff . 
Yeah . 
So well  
Yeah . 
So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users , 
they prefer to s 
Yeah . 
I dunno . 
If i one button is still one more button . 
If  if  
if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors . 
Well anyway I have this point . 
We can discuss . 
Also um  so 
as as I told before uh it would be better if it's only for the T_V_ um 
because we want to be quick on on the market . 
And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the  on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product . 
So this is the the key point . 
So before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the  o th of the control  of the remote control 
and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera . 
<laugh> 
So 
do you um so 
so from from the the Marketing Expert I think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect , 
it should be very simple and most button are never used 
only ten per cent of the button are are used often 
so I think we have to do something very simple 
and I think we all agree on that point , 
no ? 
Yeah okay . 
So yeah the key point here is simple . 
Maybe . <other> 
So few buttons , channel , volume control 
and what el what function do you see 
in addition to that ? 
Yeah . 
Maybe switch T_V_ on and off <laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> Yeah . Yeah . 
Volume , maybe a mute button , and then on off button . 
And that's all ? 
Mm . 
Okay . 
Yeah this is cool . 
Maybe we can include that also . Previous previous channel button . 
So we have like channel button , the previous channel button , the volume button , plus a mute button , and uh just the the traditional on off button . 
Yeah . 
I I talk about that , yeah ? 
Yeah . 
Incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them . 
We go faster ? 
Mm . 
Maybe we should have also a digit button  
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental . 
I dunno bec because if you have the  
Uh . 
Yeah . 
Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one . 
<laugh> So I think we need also digits . 
Maybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Maybe we can have a wheel for incremental . 
Okay . 
So have a wheel for incremental , have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed 
so as you say protected , 
<other> and uh yeah I think this is the basi 
And do we  do we have a  
No , a wheel is better . 
I would say the wheel is better . 
What is the expert of uh  
Okay . 
Yeah . 
That's a good idea . 
Well also we have to decide uh 
so it should be lightening in the dark I think because most people lost their remote control . 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
and do we put an L_C_D_ display ? 
Because it was important for young customers if you remember . 
Okay . 
So no L_C_D_ ? 
And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process 
Yeah . That would be cool . 
But eight months is really long 
and  
Maybe we can just uh  
<laugh> 
Okay . 
So um I I will uh  I will  
so I we will move to next meeting so in  after the lunch break 
uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required to do 
but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh email I think 
but you can take notes if you  if you want but well the instruction will be sent . 
So 
thank you for uh your suggestion 
and I I will make a summary of that meeting that I will put in the shared folder you can't see <laugh> 
and uh and then you will um you will be able to to see what has been uh has been said on on this meeting and and what has been decided . 
Uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether . 
That would be easier . 
No it did not work . 
She send it to me by email . 
So maybe this is better , to send it by email . 
Okay ? 
So yeah I I'm  
it's in the first uh email so I'm participant one at AMI 
uh where is that , 
it's here . 
Participant one at AMI . 
<other> Okay . 
So see you after lunch break . 
<laugh> 
<cough>
