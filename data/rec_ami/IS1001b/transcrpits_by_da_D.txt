Yeah . 
<cough> Um I dunno if you can open the  
uh m is not here . 
Uh in  
yeah okay . 
No . 
In document  . 
Mm 
computer yeah . 
Here . 
Here . 
But it's not  
Um . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , I can do that . 
Okay . 
Um . 
<other> It's participant one ? 
Okay . 
You can uh . 
Yeah . 
Okay so you can  you can go . 
Okay so <cough> 
in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects 
and the subjects also filled a questionnaire 
okay ? 
And here I have the results 
so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly 
so we have to find something to make them more <other> more nice , more kind . 
Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy . 
<other> Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look  
oh  
to  
it's not good . <laugh> 
So okay . 
So it's not in theory  
but I I can I can say yeah . <other> 
Fifty f uh 
seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot . 
So mm <other> we have to have a remote control uh very um <other> out for that . 
<laugh> Uh the buttons have  are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks . 
<laugh> Um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh <other> ten per cents of but of the buttons in the  in the remote control . 
So all the buttons we we have to put are  have to to have um a use a real use 
and not only or  
Yeah . 
F not many buttons , and uh and uh uh u useable buttons <laugh> . 
Sorry ? 
Yeah . 
Uh <other> most for most is T_V_ . 
<laugh> 'Kay you can go so . 
So there are other frustrations expressed by users , 
so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to <other> to 
to find it . 
Um and um 
lot of the time they  it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . 
So they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use . 
And uh remote controls are bad for 
R_S_I_ 
<laugh> um  
I dunno . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Uh . 
<laugh> Okay um before that I I have some some <other> some thing <other> uh to say before um  
<other> 
We know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel . 
<other> Um and um to to change uh volume selection of the  
and uh and not uh a lot for setting  for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that . 
So it's better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set 
and uh and  
Very accessible yes . 
That's right . 
<cough> So then we asked some questions to them 
and um we asked this question if they prefer an L_C_D_ screen or on their remultific function remotes control 
and if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control 
and you can go <other> 
we have here the results of 
of the questions . 
So you know that um 
<other> for the younger it's very important 
to have the 
s yes 
and speech recognition . 
And uh and the others is not so important 
but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot T_V_ and uh who who wh can use a lot this uh . 
So maybe we we can have a speech recognition in . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Okay and if there is th the conclusion now . 
So as we say before , I think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing . 
Uh not to many mud buttons like we we said before , 
e easy to use uh a way to find it easily in the room and uh uh resistant to to shock 
and to to  
<other> An I s no , yeah . 
<other> I dunno if you see something else important or  
Mm . 
<cough> 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
<cough> 
<cough> 
<cough> 
Mm . 
<cough> 
Mm ? 
Yeah . 
Oh . 
Would j 
Uh <other> 
yeah 
w I I think they they say that it's uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it , it's it's okay . 
But  
Yeah . 
<cough> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<cough> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
<cough> 
<cough> 
<other> 
<other>
