<laugh> 
<cough> 
Okay . 
F do you want to start ? 
Okay . <laugh> 
No . 
What do you have in short cut ? 
Participant two . 
Yeah . 
Otherwise , could you just describe 
by hand ? 
With the the whiteboard ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
What do you mean by linear access then ? 
Ah . 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
I'm just thinking of some thing . 
Um  
We want to have a  
no , I don't know if this is a good idea . 
We want to have a a general remote control for everything . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah . 
Yeah . 
No no . <other> 
<laugh> 
Finish tonight . 
<laugh> But basically yeah maybe I can continue with my presentation , 
it would be al you  you  
but I think we have some technical problem or so . 
So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control . 
If fact  
Yeah 
but  
Do I have  
oh yeah . 
Now I have enough cables . 
<other> Okay so I'm just going to describe  
in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy . 
We just have  
sorry , 
I'm going <other> 
Like that . 
I'm just going to describe . 
Basically we have a a battery a power supply here . 
After that we just have um user interface . 
Let's say that 
um 
something like that , 
which could be um a L_C_D_ let's say or um an array of push button , something like that . 
Push button or a L_C_D_ . 
After that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip . 
So I say U_C_ and I feed that to uh L_E_D_ which is uh infrared  um which is a an infrared um component . 
And so what we  
for for myself this  
for for us this is quite easy . 
Yeah . 
Y it's a  it's  this just a chip which does all the um numerical 
numerical computation according to your display . 
And so for us uh this is quite easy . 
We just need to take  
to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something 
and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the  not the  to the television . 
So for us this is quite easy . 
Yeah . 
Um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh 
especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition , 
in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple  
Yeah of course of course . 
And um 
but for a standard one this is really easy . 
It's a question of one month and so on s 
No no no no , 
I say  
yeah  
standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that . 
Yeah . 
Definitely . 
I would say <laugh> . 
I would say uh about eight months to have the first results . 
Yeah . 
I can  
Um . 
Yeah . 
Yeah even . 
I mean that this is really standard devices now . 
Um eight . 
For uh speech recognition . 
And also  how much 
uh 
I think 
during the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldn't  we shouldn't go up to twelve point five Euro per unit 
so how many units should we sell to have a  
Yeah 
but how many  yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> Usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip . 
Yeah , 
we can  
Mm-hmm . 
Um 
I just had a question uh 
do you want to continue with your presenta ? 
Is it  
<other> 
Um you say that I don't remember by heart but thirty per cent 
of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control . 
Do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ? 
To to  
maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
And  
But yeah maybe 
and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ? 
You say that I want , I have six button  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Uh I know that som 
you say that many people are doing plenty of  a lot of zapping . 
I know tha 
I discovered that when I did a quick look , uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now , 
you have a button , you you press it , and this is uh the previous channel which has come back . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . <other> 
<other> 
Let's say that we can do something like that . 
This is uh incremental , but once you press it for a long time , you go five by five . 
To go fa to go faster . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
<other> Or we can do something like that . 
We can design the remote control to have access . 
You know some remote control have uh protection 
and so you you y 
You  
Yeah , 
a kind of joystick . 
Mm-hmm . 
Or a  or a ball , 
yeah , 
not a a wheel but a ball , 
and you say uh to  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
the  
yeah . 
'S quite  it's quite easy we do that w with back light on the  on the wheel . 
A blue  a blue L_E_D_ and we sell that um . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Ten years <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay .
