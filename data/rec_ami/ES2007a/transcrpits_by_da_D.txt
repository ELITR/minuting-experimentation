Is that alright ? <laugh> 
 or  
Okay . 
Keeps coming off . 
'S fiddly . 
<other> 
Right . 
Oh , another one . 
<cough> Ah . 
Very nice . 
'Kay . 
Okay . 
<cough> 
Clip  . 
Ah . 
It's an elephant . <laugh> 
Oh my gosh , 
I'm never gonna be able to draw that well . <laugh> 
Does it ? Oh . 
Mm . 
I have no idea what my favourite animal is . 
<laugh> 
Oh . 
It's  
A what ? 
Alright . 
How  . 
No . 
Great . 
Me ? 
Okay . 
Not quite sure how this is gonna work . 
<laugh> Cool . 
<other> Uh <other> 
well I'll try my best <laugh> to draw . 
Can I just draw the face ? 
Ooh . 
It's a cat . 
<laugh> Which also has what ? A big fat body and 
big  and a long tail . 
<laugh> Why ? 
Because um cuddly . 
And usually cats are very friendly . 
Usually . 
And they're healing as well . 
They heal . 
And they can feel when a human's got problems so  
So , that's why I like cats . 
There we are , that's me . 
<Imitates background typing sound> 
<other> 
Mm . 
<cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Ah . 
<cough> 
Market range internationally sold . 
Ah right okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh . <other> 
Yeah . Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control . 
Well . <other> 
A new remote control for T_V_ . 
What would I like ? <other> Um . 
Medium . 
<other> 
Mm . 
Twelve fifty . 
Each . 
Guess  
Couldn't we have like one that comes out ? 
<laugh> Like so you have one in like  mm 
it doesn't have to be really thick . 
I mean remote controls can be thin bits . 
And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out , 
and then you have another one , you slide it out . 
 have slides . 
And then it all comes compact 
into one . 
So it's not  
you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically . 
So you just flip them out . 
That would be cool . 
I was thinking that like a flip . 
Okay . Um . 
 . 
But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? 
I mean if it's if it's just like  
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> I think a flip up thing , 
'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this  
well I did anyway , 
like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , 
and you'd come and sit down and  ooh , the telephone's  the television switched on or something . 
So maybe something that like 
does have a lid or closes , 
so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something . 
Yeah . 
But make it like really snazzy and cool  people will want it . 
So make it  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
And even for kids as well . 
It's um it's safer for them , I guess . 
Like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto . <other> <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ? 
Ah ri okay . 
 these are requirement specification . 
And I'm marketing . 
<other> These are requirement specification . 
So what the user requires 
in a remote . 
I guess that's what it says . 
Mm . 
So <other> , do we take these off ?
