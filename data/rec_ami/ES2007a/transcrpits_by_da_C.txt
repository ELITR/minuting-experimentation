 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
The back end of an elephant . 
<laugh> Aesthetic yep , sure . 
'Kay , my favourite animal , 
uh let's see . 
Dunno if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before . 
It's a liger <laugh> , 
a combination of a lion and tiger <laugh> . 
Have you not seen Napoleon Dynamite ? 
Oh it's a hilarious movie . 
You have to see it . 
And 
and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much the awesomest animal . 
But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it . <laugh> 
There  go . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
A prairie dog ? 
<laugh> Oh a squirrel ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah , that's pretty good . 
<laugh> 
Alright . 
So I think before we close uh , we are expected  
I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where . 
I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide . Uh  
S 
Yeah , I think we're  I mean before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , 
get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been 
and and what we would  roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe . 
Yeah , I think we've all got  
Mm . 
Yeah it seems like there's like  there's sort of a tension between two ideas , 
I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ 
and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that , 
but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit . 
Cost . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> I'm not sure if that's like  
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 
'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . 
Oh . 
Oh okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , 
we should uh  
I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception  
you know  stage one was technical functions design , 
what effect the apparatus should have . 
Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , 
but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , 
but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate 
D_V_D_ players , things like that . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Right . 
Yeah , 
I mean  . 
Yeah , that's true , 
maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , 
and have it be um 
have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , 
uh simple to use , and looks decent and  
Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people , 
certain certain demographic  
<laugh> 
Yeah , no I think you're right . 
Yeah , 
rathe rather than focus on  
Y <other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside . <laugh> 
Yeah , that's true what you were saying , 
I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , 
so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable . 
<laugh> 
I guess that's good good for now . 
That's me . 
Okay . 
Right . Right . 
Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Alright , 
see you in thirty minutes . 
<laugh>
