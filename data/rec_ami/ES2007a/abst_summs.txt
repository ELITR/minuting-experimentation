A:  So  is the agenda ? 
A:  Opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing . 
A:  Project aim is a new remote control . 
A:  It's original , uh trendy and it's user-friendly . 
A:  Try out the whiteboard , 
A:  every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal . 
A:  so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working . 
abst_sum - abstract: The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animals and discussed why they liked those particular animals.

A:  Okay , project finance , 
A:  selling price twenty five Euros , 
A:  profit aim fifty million Euros . 
D:  Market range internationally sold . 
A:  it's gotta be  can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . 
A:  Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ? 
B:  Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ? 
D:  Yeah . Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control . 
A:  Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and  
C:  I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ 
C:  and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that , 
C:  but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . 
A:  'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices , 
A:  but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . 
A:  and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these  any of these ideas are feasible or not . 
A:  So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . 
D:  Couldn't we have like one that comes out ? 
D:  you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically . 
B:  Um  have uh one very complicated one on one side with <other> all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , 
B:  and then on the other side o <other> one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and <other> minus , and the just the mute button , for example . 
C:  I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 
C:  'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . 
B:  No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold 
A:  or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . <other> 
C:  D_V_D_ players , things like that . 
C:  but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate 
A:  I think we should also have a back-up plan of  I  
A:  'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that  
C:  but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , 
A:  We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just  that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . 
D:  But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? 
C:  have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , 
A:  Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people 
A:  or  big buttons for  touchy buttons for  
D:  <laugh> I think a flip up thing , 
A:  like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , 
abst_sum - abstract: The project manager discussed the project finances and the team engaged in a brainstorming session about various features to consider in designing a remote.

A:  User Interface Designer , that's that's 
A:  so you gotta  you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . Um . 
A:  Industrial Designer , you are the one  , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um 
B:  Mm . Har how it works an 
A:  And in marketing  
A:  User requirements specifications . 
B:  Do you think our two kind of overlap , because  
C:  Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap . 
A:  You two <other> you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you  working together . 
A:  You're the one that's gotta go and find out  do th do the research , 
abst_sum - abstract: The project manager then further discussed the roles of the team members.

None
abst_sum - action: *NA*

A:  selling price twenty five Euros , 
abst_sum - decisions: The selling price of the remote will be 25 Euro.

A:  profit aim fifty million Euros . 
abst_sum - decisions: The profit aim will be 50 million Euro.

D:  Market range internationally sold . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will be sold internationally.

A:  it's gotta be  can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . 
abst_sum - decisions: The production cost cannot exceed 12.50 Euro.

A:  like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will have a lock function.

C:  but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , 
C:  but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will control televisions and devices connected to televisions.

A:  I think we should also have a back-up plan of  I  
A:  'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that  
A:  We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just  that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . 
abst_sum - decisions: The team will create a back-up plan for a remote that only controls televisions

A:  So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . 
A:  but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . 
A:  I think we should also have a back-up plan of  I  
C:  but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate 
C:  D_V_D_ players , things like that . 
A:  'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that  
A:  We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just  that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . 
abst_sum - problems: If the remote should be used only for televisions or if it should be capable of controlling other devices also.

B:  Um  have uh one very complicated one on one side with <other> all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , 
B:  and then on the other side o <other> one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and <other> minus , and the just the mute button , for example . 
C:  I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 
C:  'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . 
B:  No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold 
A:  or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . <other> 
abst_sum - problems: Having a two sided remote with basic functions on one side and advanced functions on the other.
