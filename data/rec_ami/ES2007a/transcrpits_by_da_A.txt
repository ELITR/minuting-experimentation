Uh . 
I honestly can't draw for toffee . Uh . 
Yeah . 
 no 
 no 
<laugh> uh  
That's exactly what it is . 
Uh not a very good one  
<laugh> 
Okay , well , you got it's a s It's a squirrel , 
and I like them , because they're cute and stupid . 
Right . Okay , 
so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working . 
Mm . Let's move on to the next page . 
Okay , project finance , 
selling price twenty five Euros , 
profit aim fifty million Euros . 
Yeah . 
Production cost , 
ah right 
it's gotta be  can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . 
 experience with with remote control , 
so talk about who who's used what . Any ideas ? 
Stuff like that . 
Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . 
<other> At quarter to twelve . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or  
oh okay . 
I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but  
Okay . 
Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ? 
Pretty much everybody . 
Um . 
'Kay um . 
W what  
You want it big do you want it small . 
Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and  
<other> Video and ts hi-fi and stuff . 
Maybe you  
yeah 
now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap . 
'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices , 
but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . 
Per unit , yeah . 
Well at the moment we could , wa I mean we  
'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , 
and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these  any of these ideas are feasible or not . 
So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . 
Um . 
<other> 'Kay . 
Okay , 
that's  . 
Th that's an idea . 
Okay . 
One side for kids , one side for adults . 
Like it  
or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . <other> 
F flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe . 
Um , oh we've got five minutes left . 
But  okay . 
Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there . 
Yeah . 
I have got  
I think we should also have a back-up plan of  I  
'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that  
I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . 
We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just  that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . 
What do you reckon ? 
See 'cause ,  I'm just thinking  bearing in mind th we've gotta  we have to have something that's cheap to make . 
<other> I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker . 
Yeah . 
May w you know , maybe even  
Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people 
or so people that uh b don't see very well 
or  big buttons for  touchy buttons for  
Yeah . 
Or just one that looks really fucking cool . 
<laugh> 
Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about  do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should  
Yeah . 
I mean obviously everyone  
we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads 
and we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that's  
Yeah . 
Yeah , that's right . Yeah . 
I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but <other> that's not gonna happen . 
Okay , 
like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , 
yeah . 
Yeah , it's gotta be sellable . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Okay . 
<laugh> No porn channel for children . 
Okay . Um alright , 
so we've got some ideas , 
we've got um  
Let's move on . 
Oops , let's close that .
