B:  Very good . 
D:  Ah . 
C:  Alright . 
A:  Right . 


A:  Okay , so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  Mm . Let's move on to the next page . 


A:  Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros . 
D:  Market range internationally sold . 
A:  Yeah . Production cost , ah right it's gotta be  can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . 
D:  Ah right okay . 


A:   experience with with remote control , so talk about who who's used what . Any ideas ? Stuff like that . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . <other> At quarter to twelve . <other> 
C:  So I think before we close uh , we are expected  I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where . I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide . Uh  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  S Yeah , I think we're  I mean before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for  
A:  Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or  oh okay . I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would  roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe . 


A:  Okay . Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ? Pretty much everybody . 
B:  <other> Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , I think we've all got  
D:  Uh . <other> 
A:  Um . 
A:  Well at the moment we could , wa I mean we  'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these  any of these ideas are feasible or not . So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . 
D:  Guess  
B:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Um . 
A:  Um , oh we've got five minutes left . 
B:  Start breaking up . 
D:  Okay . Um . 
A:  But  okay . Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there . 
D:   . 
C:  Yeah , we should uh  I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception  you know  stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have . Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  D_V_D_ players , things like that . 
A:  I have got  I think we should also have a back-up plan of  I  'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that  I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just  that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Okay . Right . 
A:  What do you reckon ? 
C:  Yeah , I mean  . 
A:  See 'cause ,  I'm just thinking  bearing in mind th we've gotta  we have to have something that's cheap to make . 
C:  Yeah , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , and have it be um 
A:  <other> I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker . 
C:  have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , uh simple to use , and looks decent and  
A:  Yeah . May w you know , maybe even  
D:  But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? I mean if it's if it's just like  
A:  Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people or so people that uh b don't see very well or  big buttons for  touchy buttons for  
C:  Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people , 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  certain certain demographic  
A:  Or just one that looks really fucking cool . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , no I think you're right . 
B:  <other> Could be really light or , I dunno , something special . 
C:  Yeah , rathe rather than focus on  
A:  Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about  do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should  
C:  Y <other> Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , 'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote , doesn't say com combination with all all the r <other> 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . I mean obviously everyone  we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that's  
C:  <laugh> Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  Yeah , that's right . Yeah . I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but <other> that's not gonna happen . 
A:  Okay . Um alright , so we've got some ideas , we've got um  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Okay . 
C:  I guess that's good good for now . 


A:  Let's move on . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  Oops , let's close that . Next meeting , uh okay . 
D:  W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ? 
A:  Industrial Designer um which is  
D:  Ah ri okay .  these are requirement specification . 
B:  That's  
A:  Um . 
D:  And I'm marketing . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  Yeah , there you go . <other> So   User Interface Designer , that's that's that's you , so you gotta  you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . Um . 
C:  That's me . Okay . Right . Right . 
A:  Industrial Designer , you are the one  , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um whether it's  what goes into the box , somehow . 
B:  Mm . Har how it works an 
A:  And in marketing  
D:  <other> These are requirement specification . 
B:  Bu 
A:  User requirements specifications . 
D:  So what the user requires 
A:  Yeah , what  
B:  Do you think our two kind of overlap , because  
D:  in a remote . 
A:  Right , okay , yeah . 
C:  Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap . 
D:  I guess that's what it says . 
A:  You two <other> you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you  working together . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  You're the one that's gotta go and find out  do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that . 
D:  Mm . 


A:  <other> Oh , we've been warned to finish the meeting now . Okay . 
C:  <other> 
A:  Okay everyone , well done . Good meeting . 
C:  Alright , see you in thirty minutes . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . 


C:  <laugh>
