<other> 
Cool . 
Do you wanna give me the little cable thing ? 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Cool . 
Ah , 
that's why it won't meet . <laugh> 
Okay , cool . 
Yep , cool . 
Okay , 
functional requirements . 
Alright , yeah . 
It's working . 
Cool , okay . 
So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects 
and then they gave them a questionnaire . 
Um so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . 
What's the most annoying things about remote controls 
and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . 
Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , 
so I should have taken that bit out , 
but anyway . 
Um okay , so . 
What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , 
so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . 
Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . 
<other> Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . 
Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control . 
Um current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , 
as you'll see on the next slide . 
Um I dunno what zapping is , 
but  
Oh , right . 
But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on . 
Um okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , 
so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , 
they just make it look ugly . 
Okay ? Cool . 
Um so this is my little graph thing . 
Mm k 
Okay , well , I can send it to all of you . 
What it is is um it's cones , 
'cause I thought they'd be more exciting . 
Um but  
ooh where's it go ? 
Back . 
Oh . 
Oh yes , cool . 
Okay , I'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing . 
Um okay , so like 
what it shows is how much things are used relatively 
and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . 
What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others . 
Yeah , 
so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , 
and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses 
and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance , you know , 
so on a scale of one to ten , how important is that 
and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , 
and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , 
although I don't understand how it couldn't be , 
<laugh> um and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 
'cause they're just not needed , 
and they're not used . 
Okay . 
This is the bit that the email messed up for me 
and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing . <laugh> 
Okay , cool . 
So um okay , 
so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . 
Uh that they get lost , 
that the uh you know , they're not intuitive 
and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . 
I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know , watching T_V_ , then <laugh> that's the least of your problems , 
but you know , <laugh> it's up there . 
Um that  yeah . 
Okay , so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages  
you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control 
and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ <laugh> . 
<laugh> Yes . Okay , cool . Right , um 
sorry 
this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , 
and I didn't have time to white it out again . 
Um okay , 
but that shows how people  whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . 
So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite  are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , 
whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it 
and they're less willing to to try it . 
Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , 
but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking 
and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . 
Um okay ? 
Cool . Um okay , 
so these are my personal preferences . 
<other> So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , 
so something that's , you know , a bit cool . 
Um you know , functional , so it's useful , but minimalist . 
Um there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , 
and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? You know , 
so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , 
so I think we need to aim for both . 
Um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier 
and um , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool 
because , you know , your remote control just sits there , 
and you could just sit it in the sunshine 
and save the environment a bit . 
Um and then like a locator , 
so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or  
not a mobile phone  
Yeah , that's it , you know . 
I know , it's weird . 
My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning 
and I was like I need to get one for everything . 
<laugh> So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , 
something <other>  
a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_ , you know , 
'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , 
'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . 
So okay ? 
Cool . 
That's me . <laugh> 
Cat's . Ca <other> . 
Yeah , 
I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , 
but I'm assuming , you know , yes . 
Well , that's when you go to uni , isn't it ? 
So , you know  
Yeah . 
Oh , I've unplugged it . 
Do you want me to  
Yeah . 
Seventy six point three percent . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , I kn I mean I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , 
but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income 
because they don't have like  I mean , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , 
but you don't have a mortgage , 
you don't have a life insurance policy , 
you don't normally have a car , 
yeah , so . 
You're still learning to drive actually , 
so that just costs more than a car , 
<laugh> but yeah . Um so 
I mean like it is an age group to target , really , I think . 
No , 
I mean that's what , that's like fifteen Pounds ? 
You know , I think  
Yeah , 
I d I don't know many people without a T_V_ . 
We didn't have a T_V_ last year , 
and everyone thought we were off our heads , you know . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_ . 
Yeah . 
I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . 
You know , so I mean that and the disposable income and  I don't think it's something to ignore , you know . 
Is not a massive difference , you know . 
No , do totally . 
You do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? 
Because you have like  
I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . 
I don't know . 
Yeah . 
S so  
y you'd maybe need a code word . 
Do you know what I mean ? 
So like when you say change , except that's <other> being said quite a lot on T_V_ , 
so maybe like , you know , remote . 
I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_ ? 
Although I only watch Charmed , so really <laugh> I wouldn't know 
but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . 
I don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls . 
Yeah , 
that would be another way to do it . 
Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , 
because  I mean Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know , 
so then it would be  you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky . 
Yeah , yeah , 
and that would be really annoying . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ? 
Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . 
It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it <laugh> and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . 
Yeah , yeah , 
I suppose nearer to you 
but a b like if you have surround sound then  
Yeah . 
<other> Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . 
Yeah , definitely , yeah . 
Oh , so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ? 
Okay . 
There you go . 
But is everyone's called functional requirements ? 
Okay , so that's good . 
That's me done . 
Okay , cool . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other>
