Mm . 
You said uh targ target groups , 
what does that mean ? 
Uh okay , 'kay . 
So are  
Okay . 
Alright . 
<other> I can go first , 
yeah . 
<other> 
<other> 
<other> Right . Um <other> 
so f from the  
Right sure . 
Uh okay . <other> 
<other> So n uh with uh with regard to the <other> uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um <other> a few basic uh components of the remote 
and uh <other> se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are 
and how how they work together with each other . 
<other> <other> So <other> <other> 
this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um <other> in my uh role . 
Um the identification of the components , 
uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and <laugh> uh from the user interface person . 
Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level 
and uh basically update and come up with a new design , 
so it's a cyclical process . 
<other> Okay , so <other> 
these were the basic findings from today . 
The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . 
Uh I just quickly jotted them down . 
Um <other> so 
basically uh the  
as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um <other> and how the parts uh communicate with each other . 
Um <other> okay , 
so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , 
so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . 
Um 
also uh the remote control should be used only for television , 
because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . 
And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . 
How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the <other> the use for television , <other> in order to keep things simple . 
Um <other> 
also the management wants that um our design should be unique 
uh it  
so <other> it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . 
<other> Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . 
Um <other> 
there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . 
The user interf interface communicates with the chip , 
so <other> I'll basic go over to the  
Okay . 
<other> So <other> 
if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates  uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . 
There is a user interface here . 
<other> So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip 
and the chip then generates a response 
and takes the response to an infrared terminal , 
um which then  
so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , 
which is then communicated <other> to the remote site , 
which h has an infrared receiver . 
Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . 
Um 
so these are the essent 
so a all the functionality of the remote control , 
whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically . 
<other> Okay . 
<other> Um so <other> 
i in my personal preferences um <other> I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . 
This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . 
And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um <other> uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions . 
<other> That's about it . <other> 
So anything that you would like to know or <other>  
<other> No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs . 
Um yeah . 
Yeah . 
Certainly , yeah . 
So so tha 
yeah , <other> 
we definitely need to operate within our constraints , 
but um <other> unfortunately I I do not have any data , 
so uh I just identified the functional components for that . 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah . 
Mm 'kay . 
I it'll take some time . 
Oh , there it is , yeah . 
<other> It'll come up , 
it  
um uh no signal . 
Yeah yeah , it says something now , 
adjusting  
Okay . 
Oh , that's strange . 
Okay . 
And one more time . 
Mm . 
<other> Sorry , 
cou could you go back for a second ? 
Uh switching on off channel , uh volume , <other> 
okay , that's great . 
<other> 
 
<other> So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . 
Um but um <other> 
so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify 
or  I mean in  we can completely do away with buttons 
and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . 
But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that ? 
Right . 
Yeah , 
and it'll make the costs 
 yeah . 
Right . 
Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . 
So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that . 
Uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display 
and uh with um  
because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . 
So yeah ? Cool . 
 try to press  
oh , okay , 
yep . 
<other> 
Mm . 
Right . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Right . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
Right . 
Mm . Mm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Some kind of a ring , 
some  
<laugh> 
Right . 
Hmm . 
Okay , that's great , 
thanks . 
Mm . 
<other> I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um <other> uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um <other> uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people . 
So if we need to have a target group um then uh <other> I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and uh you know , good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know , people who are comparatively elderly . 
Um . 
Right . 
Right . 
Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , 
so if you want to put in something stylish , then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , 
yeah . 
Right , 
and  
<other> Right . 
Mm . 
Right . 
But uh still , if if you can go back to that slide 
and uh , how popular was it ? 
Oh , oh , okay . <other> 
That's alright , 
if you can just look it up on your computer , 
wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was  
so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them . 
So even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ? 
Alright . 
Yeah . 
So you're more likely to b 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm 
<laugh> <other> Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , right ? 
So mm uh are are are  
Mm . 
Mm . 
Um <other> 
I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features , 
but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , 
because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it ? 
Uh and uh  
Yeah . 
But how frequently do we use it anyway 
and um uh h ho how good is it , 
you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh  
Yeah . 
Right . 
Right . Okay . 
O <other> 
Right . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Right . 
Yeah . 
Okay , 
so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited 
 yeah . 
Mm . W 
What uh  
Mm . 
What wh uh <other> what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . 
If we can do with  away with that , our product can be really popular 
uh in the sense that uh a person can say , I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . 
Yeah , so if uh if something like that can be incorporated , <other> 
some kind of <other>  
Mm-hmm . 
Alright . 
Yeah , that's  
Right . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm 
yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control 
being cl I mean it'll it'll  mm . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
So uh <other> wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , 
so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , 
so we we can probably come to know where it is . 
Right , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
Alright , yeah . 
Right . 
Okay . 
 
So where exactly is this i 
Ah , okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah in that one , 
right yeah . 
No . 
Right . 
<other> I guess I'll find out . <laugh> 
Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? 
Con components , oh .
