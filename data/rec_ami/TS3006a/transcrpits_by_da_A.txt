Mm . 
So you found your spots . 
Okay . 
It's called black . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
You see this beautiful presentation . 
Okay 
let's get started . 
Uh I sort of prepared this . 
Uh opening acquaintance , tool training , uh how to use the things here . Uh project plan discussion , and yeah then the rest of the meeting . 
Um we're supposed to develop a new remote control , 
that's both original , trendy and user-friendly . 
So , 
hope you have good ideas . 
I don't . <laugh> 
Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom . Uh functional design , 
then we do some in individual work , 
then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera . 
And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up . 
Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard . Um 
uh we should take some practice . 
I have some instructions now to do that . 
Uh well 
you know how to  the documents work . 
So  
Uh this for toolbar . You see it next . Um 
we have a pen . 
And we can use this pen to perform . <laugh> 
Yes . 
So  
It doesn't always work . 
Yes . 
Okay so 
you can draw . 
Okay 
and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera etcetera . 
Okay ? 
Uh  Okay . 
Each of you can uh take some practice 
and you should draw an animal . Uh you should explain  Uh with different colours and with different pen widths . 
And you should explain why you draw that particular animal . 
So , 
Julian . 
Uh with the format menu . 
And use different colours etcetera . 
And <laugh> what's that supposed to be ? <laugh> 
Oh yeah . <laugh> Oh yeah

Yeah . <laugh> Alright . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
 I think it's okay . 
You get idea 
right ? 
Okay um 
we have a financial aspect to this project . <other> 
Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros . Uh 
the aim is to reach  uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros . 
Uh that's quite a big amount of money . 
And the production cost should be the half of the selling price . 
Okay 
now it's time for some discussion . 
<other> <cough>  
Uh  
<laugh> Yeah . 
We should get started . 
Uh I'm taking notes . Um 
we each have a specific task , 
as I saw in my mail . 
I didn't know if you received the same mail . 
Yeah ? 
Okay so the um <other> uh  
this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design . 
Am I correct ? 
Okay . 
Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions . 
Right ? Yeah ? 
<laugh> And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements . 
Uh did any of you already do some work on this part 
or  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . <other> Okay . 
Yeah 
I got another point . 
It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo . 
Same I believe  . 
Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yep . 
Yes . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
And you can get that information ? 
Okay . 
That would be very handy . 
Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ? 
No ? 
No okay . 
Yeah ? 
<laugh> Of course . 
Big , 
mm-hmm . 
<laugh> Uh what do you mean by that ? 
Okay um  Well 
I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment . 
Um I think the best is to go to work . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
I think we can go ahead with what we have . 
I will summarise the things we discussed 
and put it in the project folder . 
Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . 
And it seems you get more information by email . 
So <laugh> 
that was it for me . 
Uh  
Yeah , in the project folder . Yeah . 
I'm writing very fast . <laugh> 
Hope it's readable . 
Okay <other> 
um anything more you want to add to the discussion ? 
Yeah . 
Because then we have a  
Yeah . <other> 
Y you do some individual work , 
we have meeting , 
individual work , meeting . 
And at the end of the day we have a final meeting . 
And then I have to prepare  uh I have to defend our design , 
so make it good . <laugh> 
I depend on you . 
Yeah ? If you can mix it it's okay . 
Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well 
I think that is the user requirements part . 
As to what they want . Uh do they want all those functions on that small  
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah I understand . 
You can always add a few  
Yeah . 
Hmm , 
the C_D_ player . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
You need additional  
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . 
And um reserve the possibility to add other features . 
So we have a basic starting point 
and you can always extend that 
so make sure it's extendible . Yeah . 
<other> Th the least amount of functions possible 
so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera . 
Yeah ? 
Okay 
and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to . 
<laugh> Yeah , you're di dismissed . 
<laugh> Not yet . 
<laugh> Okay . 
Let's see what we got to do . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Thank you .
