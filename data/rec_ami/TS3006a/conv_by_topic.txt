D:  Mm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  So , hope you have good ideas . I don't . <laugh> Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom . Uh functional design , then we do some in individual work , then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera . 
D:  <laugh> <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> I did my best . 
C:  Not yet . 
A:  And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up . Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard . Um

B:  <laugh> Okay . 
D:  <laugh> Don't take up too much space . <laugh> 
B:  Um yeah . 
C:  Different pen widths , how do you do that ? 
B:  <laugh>

C:  Oh okay . 
A:  And use different colours etcetera . 
B:  <laugh> It's a giraffe . Yeah .

A:  Okay um we have a financial aspect to this project . <other> Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros . Uh 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  the aim is to reach  uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros . Uh that's quite a big amount of money . And the production cost should be the half of the selling price .

topic_description:	discussion_None


A:  Okay now it's time for some discussion . <other> <cough>  
B:  Okay . What uh what uh do you want to discuss ? <laugh> 
A:  Uh  
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . We should get started . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yep . 
A:  Uh I'm taking notes . Um 
D:  Okay . Great . 
A:  we each have a specific task , as I saw in my mail . I didn't know if you received the same mail . Yeah ? Okay so the um <other> uh  this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design . Am I correct ? 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  I guess so . Yeah . True . 
A:  Okay . Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions . Right ? Yeah ? <laugh> And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements . Uh did any of you already do some work on this part or  
B:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <other> Well I started making an overview for myself , um what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever . So I had to uh , <other> I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do , and kind of let it work in to get ideas about 
A:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ? 
C:  well how I have to fill it . Well I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional . And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said . How does the apparatus work ? And well I basically had two points . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
C:  Uh <other> according to the coffee uh machine example , I have batteries to supply energy , and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ . And that's basically all I have so far . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . <other> Okay . Yeah I got another point . It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo . 
B:  Yeah . Wireless uh  huh . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Alright . Yeah . 
D:  So that's very common . 
B:  Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function . You d you already told that . And for the changing up to the  to all the channels and changing the volume . That are the the basic options for a remote control . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah I kept it global 'cause <other>  that it activates or deactivates specific functions , 'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that . I mean , you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also . I dunno what the word is in English . Uh   
B:  Okay , yeah . Yeah . Yep . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Same I believe  . 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do ? 
D:  Uh well from a marketing uh <other> perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements . Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? So there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research <other> uh to see what existing products are there out in the market . I mean , what functions do they have . Um especially what are their shortcomings ? Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ? 
A:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Um therefore we have to to do some internet search . For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ? So we can see uh what needs to be supported . 
A:  Yep . Yes . 
D:  Um <other> and we can interview current users and future users . What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? Um especially for future users , uh I'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first , and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add . 
A:  Okay . Okay . Mm-hmm . Okay . And you can get that information ? 
D:  I think I can get that information , yeah . 
A:  Okay . That would be very handy . Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ? 
D:  So  yeah . No n not specifically . More to how to get them and  
A:  No ? 
topic_description:	project specs and roles of participants_None


B:  <cough> I got some uh requirements it has uh  it has to be user-friendly . <laugh> <other> Uh really easy to use buttons , not not uh very small buttons , but not the the also the big big buttons , but just normal buttons . It has to be a small unit . It has to be uh  yeah , you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house . So it has n has not to be l yeah , gigantic uh machine . 
A:  No okay . Yeah ? 
D:  Yeah ? 
A:  <laugh> Of course . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Obviously . 
A:  Big , mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Uh and a and a good uh zapping range . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Uh what do you mean by that ? 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be , uh yeah um yeah , quite a big distance . It has to be capable for zapping uh  
D:  Yeah . From the other end of the room or something ? Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay um  Well I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment . Um I think the best is to go to work . 
C:  Whoa . Is that you or  alright . 
A:  Yeah . Okay . 
D:  Any more points to discuss ? 
A:  Yeah . I think we can go ahead with what we have . I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . And it seems you get more information by email . 
D:  Alright . 
A:  So <laugh> that was it for me . 
C:  Alright . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  'Kay . Thanks . 
A:  Uh  
B:  Are you going to put the the notes on the  
A:  Yeah , in the project folder . Yeah . I'm writing very fast . <laugh> Hope it's readable . Okay <other> um anything more you want to add to the discussion ? 
D:  Yeah . The pro okay . 
B:  Okay . <laugh> 
C:  Alright . 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . Okay . Uh . 
B:  Yep . 
D:  I guess so . 
C:  Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh 
B:  Yeah . Do we only have to to do uh phase one , the functional design uh ? 
C:  session ? 
A:  Yeah . Because then we have a  
B:  After that we are going to the conceptual uh  
A:  Yeah . <other> Y you do some individual work , we have meeting , individual work , meeting . And at the end of the day we have a final meeting . And then I have to prepare  uh I have to defend our design , so make it good . <laugh> I depend on you . 
D:  Yeah . We're just working the three phases . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah okay . We'll do our best . 
D:  Okay . <laugh> Better make it  <laugh> 
B:  Okay . 
C:  I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in . Do we  I mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? <other> 
A:  Yeah ? If you can mix it it's okay . Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . <other> That is my question also because like new new functions  
A:  Yeah . Well I think that is the user 
D:  Requirements . Yeah . 
A:  requirements part . As to what they want . Uh do they want all those functions on that small  
C:  Yeah . True . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  But but we need good communication about this stuff , 'cause I have to f put the components into the design . So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard . 
D:  Unit . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  I would first m 
D:  Yeah well I I was  
A:  Yeah I understand . 
B:  Yeah . I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . So you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video . And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular . And then use your Windows media centre <other> under your T_V_ with the same remote control . So with the switch , one single switch   
A:  You can always add a few  Yeah . Hmm , the C_D_ player . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah so  
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Okay . Yeah I I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function . And you you don't need that for a T_V_ . And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well , so I kind of need to know what we uh need . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  S 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah records and stuff like that . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  No . 
A:  You need additional  yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Uh  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Whatever , I'll just put my ideas in uh 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh 
D:  In the project uh  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . And um reserve the possibility to add other features . So we have a basic starting point and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible . Yeah . 
C:  meeting . Okay . Okay . 
B:  Yeah it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly . So it's hasn't   it's  yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Alright . 
A:  <other> Th the least amount of functions possible so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera . 
B:  Yeah . Okay . 
C:  Yeah . I understand . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah ? Okay and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to . 
C:  Alright . 
D:  Yes . 
C:  Yeah .
