Giraffe's yellow . <laugh> 
Can you use one blank sheet per drawing ? Or 
so y you must save it at the end

Okay ,

It's more like a dinosaur . <laugh> 
<other> Uh . 
Some leaf to eat . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Thanks . 
Yeah . 
<other> Uh  
<laugh> Yeah . Alright . 
It's not that fast . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> I see . 
It misses the spot . 
<laugh> I say good guess . 
Uh  
Because it's slow . <laugh> 
Yeah I was a bit slow too . 
So  
<laugh> Uh some other line uh width uh  
<laugh> No . <laugh> 
I dunno . <laugh> 
Does it have legs ? <laugh> 
Yeah ? 
<laugh> 
It's more like a tank . 
Yeah 
that's fins 
but I don't know where . 
<laugh> 
Some spots . 
Ah some eye . 
<laugh> 
Yeah that's a fr <laugh> friendly turtle I guess . 
Yeah well 
I think it's uh fair enough . 
Right . <laugh> 
I don't know what the position is . <laugh> 
Does it have ears ? 
No . Oh okay . 
Can you erase ears 
or  
Yeah ? 
Alright . 
Eraser . 
So  
I dunno . 
I it just came into my mind . 
So there's no particular reason 
I  pen . 
Yeah . 
Well 
I'm  guess I'm done . 
That's my turtle . 
How to select the next or  
here . 
<other> Yeah . 
Here you go . 
A fox yeah . 
Firefox . 
A cat who had an accident or  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Great . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So 
that's very common . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Uh well 
from a marketing uh <other> perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements . 
Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? 
So 
there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research <other> uh to see what existing products are there out in the market . 
I mean , what functions do they have . 
Um especially what are their shortcomings ? 
Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ? 
Um therefore we have to to do some internet search . For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ? 
So we can see uh what needs to be supported . 
Um <other> and we can interview current users and future users . What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? Um especially for future users , 
uh I'm thinking of early adopters , 
because they they use new technology first , 
and they play with a lot of tools and stuff 
so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add . 
I think I can get that information , yeah . 
So  
yeah . 
No n not specifically . 
More to how to get them 
and  
Yeah ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
From the other end of the room or something ? 
Yeah . 
Any more points to discuss ? 
Alright . 
'Kay . 
Thanks . 
Yeah . 
The pro okay . 
Yeah . Okay . 
Uh . 
I guess so . 
Yeah . 
We're just working the three phases . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Better make it  <laugh> 
Yeah . <other> That is my question also 
because like new new functions  
Requirements . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Unit . 
Yeah . 
Yeah well 
I I was  
Yeah 
well 
like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . 
So you can switch to your video 
and then the same buttons control your video . 
And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , 
because that's getting very popular . 
And then use your Windows media centre <other> under your T_V_ with the same remote control . So with the switch , one single switch  
S 
Yeah 
records and stuff like that . 
No . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
In the project uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yes . 
Half an hour . 
<laugh> You're fired . <laugh> 
No . 
Alright 
let's move on . 
Yeah . 
Yeah see you later . 
Well 
good luck . <laugh>
