Hi . 
Oh yeah , 
we have to talk in English , 
huh . 
I'm afraid I'm a bit slow for this stuff uh . 
I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow . 
<laugh> I don't know how much preparation you guys did , 
but not a lot . 
Mm-hmm . 
Not yet . 
Operations . 
<laugh> 
Different pen widths , how do you do that ? 
Oh okay . 
Are you serious ? 
I in the file option menu . 
How much time do we have to draw anyway ? <laugh> 
'Cause I can take forever on this . 
<laugh> 
Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other ? 
Alright . 
Uh . Your line broke . 
I'm guessing a turtle . 
No . 
<laugh> I'm kidding . 
Because of its shell . 
Dude you're a good drawer . 
Do you have a turtle pet ? 
Uh okay . 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
Stumpy stuff . 
They kind of l look like mole legs . With sharp nails on . 
<laugh> 
A little tail maybe . 
<laugh> 
Uh no . 
The little holes maybe . 
And why did you choose this animal ? 
Alright . 
Alright . 
 Colours were under format 
right ? 
Let's see . 
How am I gonna do this ? Um  
Mm uh . 
<laugh> Not quite actually . 
No . 
Aye . 
<laugh> It's a cat . 
Not quite yet through . 
Uh yeah 
I dunno . 
They're my favourite pets . 
Uh I have colour already . 
Yeah 
I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of 
st 
Oh shit . Um  
Excuse my language . 
I don't know how to draw its face . 
But you get the idea . 
It's a cat . 
It's my favourite uh pet animal , 
'cause they're cute , they're independent and cuddly , 
I dunno . <laugh> 
That's it . 
Or do I need to use more colours 
and  
Alright . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
So we have to s 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
I guess so . Yeah . 
True . 
<other> Well 
I started making an overview for myself , um what I had to do , 
'cause we have three design steps 
and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever . 
So I had to uh , <other> I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do , 
and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it . 
Well 
I started I started with the first phase , 
I think was the functional . 
And uh let's see 
I had to focus on the working design , which you said . 
How does the apparatus work ? 
And well 
I basically had two points . 
Uh <other> according to the coffee uh machine example , I have batteries to supply energy , 
and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ . 
And that's basically all I have so far . 
Alright . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
I kept it global 
'cause <other>  
that it activates or deactivates specific functions , 
'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that . 
I mean , you wanna ch ch flip the channel 
but you might wanna use teletext also . 
I dunno what the word is in English . Uh   
Yeah . Obviously . 
Whoa . 
Is that you 
or  
alright . 
Alright . 
Alright . 
Well 
no 
I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh session ? 
Yeah okay . We'll do our best . 
I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 
'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in . 
Do we  
I mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? 
Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? <other> 
Yeah . True . 
But but we need good communication about this stuff , 
'cause I have to f put the components into the design . 
So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard . 
Yeah so  
Okay . 
Yeah I I know what you mean , 
but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . 
You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function . 
And you you don't need that for a T_V_ . 
And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well , 
so I kind of need to know what we uh need . 
Whatever , I'll just put my ideas in uh in here 
and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Alright . 
Yeah . 
I understand . Yeah . 
Alright . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Thanks . <laugh> 
Alright . 
<other> See you later . 
What the
