Put on your mic . 
Boss . 
Yep . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Alright . 
Three , three . 
Pedro can have it . 
I like  
I'll help talk . 
<laugh> 
Unit price . 
Scrolling through your favourites list . 
It's very prominent <laugh> . 
So <other> 
here I'll give you the  
so this is the cradle unit , 
and this is the actual remote itself . 
Um so the scroll bar is  or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , 
um and then the volume controls are here and here . 
Uh you've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten . 
This is the power button . 
Uh we have our um <other> 
we have the enter button 
and uh what was the other button here ? 
This is the teletext . 
The programme button , 
yeah the programme button . 
So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming <other> your uh the um the type of television you wanna use . 
So um the plastic is the white area of this  of the model here , 
and the red area is like a rubber covering . 
So you can see that when it lays like this or like this  
and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um  
Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it  
yeah <laugh> . 
Yeah 
and it depends on if it's sliding , 
but I think it's pretty ergonomic . 
You can feel it . 
Yeah of course . 
Well this is clay <laugh> . 
Yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach , 
but I think we might scale down the final model a bit . 
<other> These  this is a bit larger than it would be , but  
<laugh> 
Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability . 
Beep beep beep . 
<laugh> 
Um beep beep beep <laugh> 
so <laugh> 
beep beep beep <laugh> 
beep beep beep <laugh> 
be shut up . <laugh> 
Beep beep beep <laugh> 
okay . Um no no no tha that's alri 
Exactly that's exactly what those are for . 
And um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , 
is um  you could 
beep beep beep <laugh>  
we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger  
it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there , 
but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . 
And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so  
Mm . 
Right . 
So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , 
but  
Mm-hmm . 
Oh no this is <other> just what we had to work with at the time . 
So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people . 
<laugh> 
Careful . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Beep beep beep . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
No way . 
Beep beep beep . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well , that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units . 
Oh . 
<laugh> 
Uh-huh . 
Uh-huh . 
Yeah . 
Oh , sorry . <laugh> 
Yeah 
um I do think we that we we <other> uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print , 
so there may have been a m miscalculation in there . 
And we and we have a single-curved uh  
Uh I think that  
It's single-curved , 
yeah . 
See it's a little bit more than f single-curved . 
So yeah it's fifteen point eight , 
that's where we came up with it <laugh> . 
Okay . 
Yeah we do . 
Ah . What do you know <laugh> . 
<other> Oh it's <other> a that's not very special , it's pretty  
<laugh> If th <laugh> . 
That's a scroll . 
Uh no we just use it as a scroll . 
It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say . 
<laugh> Yeah <laugh> . 
S 's kind of s frighteningly accurate <laugh> . 
What ? 
I think we did pretty well . 
Sh I think there was plenty of room . 
We got a couple innovative i 
Couple innovative ideas . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Yep . 
<laugh> There was a lot of synergy . 
These cables suck <laugh> . 
Yep . 
Yeah . 
Lapel . 
<laugh> That's our boss <laugh> . 
Pedro's right . 
Pedro's right . 
Oh wel 
Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r uh remote call feature . 
<laugh> 
All right . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Good job guys .
