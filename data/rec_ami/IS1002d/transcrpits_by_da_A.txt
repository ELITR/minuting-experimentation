Uh 'kay . 
So  
Yep . 
Okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , 
'kay ? 
And here's the agenda for this meeting . 
Uh I'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . 
You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product 
that I can see some demonstrations of over there . 
Looks cool . 
And then we're gonna evaluate it . 
Then we're gonna talk about finance , 
and I've got a lovely Excel spreadsheet that I knocked up in the last five minutes for this . 
And uh 
yep . 
And <other> we're gonna evaluate the product and close . 
Got forty minutes to do this in . 
We should be fine . 
Let's try and keep this one on schedule . 
So  
<other> 
Your thing is in  where is it ? 
Is it in  
Who wants it ? 
Zapping your favourite channels , eh ? 
Oh okay okay . 
Ah 'kay okay , that's favourites . 
Ah 'kay . 
I like the the the the logo on there as well . 
It is very prominent . 
So this is the  
Okay . 
Ah , okay I see . 
It's pretty cool . 
Is that  
could that be easy to  for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ? 
<laugh> 
Oh well I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it . 
Mm . Feels good . 
I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well . 
<other> Yeah it's kinda cool . 
You have to reach a little bit don't you . 
Ah yeah that wouldn't make sense . 
It's cool . I'm impressed . 
And hold it so <other>  
wh what's the marketing perspective ? 
<laugh> Okay . 
Mm it's impressing . 
<laugh> So let me get it , 
if I press this button  
I see . That's pretty cool . 
Hang on . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> I plan to do that as well . 
<laugh> So the the two blue  are are those for the the it to charge off of  in ? 
Ah okay okay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah <other> it's the right shape isn't it ? 
But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , 
'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides  . 
Okay . 
But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , 
hasn't it ? 
So is that the the final colour scheme as well or ? 
Okay . 
The  hmm . 
It came off . 
The scroll wheels ,  a problem with them not being sort of  
I don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore . 
Mm . 
<other> Okay enough of that . 
Well i it's cool guys . 
'Kay so are we done with the this presentation ? 
Okay . <other> 
Now now . 
Have you ? Okay . 
Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ? 
Oh I see I see . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Do you  
would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm 'kay . 
And we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ? 
Th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that . 
Hmm . 
Yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less  
b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , 
you know what they do , it's very simple , and it just works . 
Mm there's a risk of that . 
Okay so we can talk about finance now . 
So I have a little spreadsheet for us 
where  
I I was wondering , you  
when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros , I was wondering how you came up with that figure ? 
Okay 
so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this . 
<other> Now 
I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros , 
equivalent to solar cells , 
which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already . 
Uh <other> and I'm assuming that the locator beacon , 
the you know the  
<other> Can be made for  
it sounded different that time  
uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display , 
uh an uh   
<other> Uh do you think that's fair coming from a  m the manufacturing ? 
 . 
Okay . 
Yep . 
Okay . 
So we're down to sixteen point four , yeah . 
Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ? 
We're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur 
You think ? 
Okay 
I'm  convinced . 
But we save one Euro that way , yeah ? 
So we come  bring it down to  <other> Fifteen point four . 
<laugh> Well hang on . 
Do don't speak so  
it's in here , in that <other> 
w do we have any  
we have special form don't we ? 
So that's  yeah . 
But the the the  
we haven't talked about any special colour though 
uh I don't th 
if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're  
<other> O okay so we're  
Push-button , scroll wheel , we're  basically we have uh th 
is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ? 
Just a scroll ? 
It's not one of the scrolls where , for example , with this one you could push it down to be a button ? 
Okay 
then we have fifteen point eight Euros . 
<other> It wasn't bad . 
Okay so 
we're on to the  
We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , 
where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul <other> the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us <other> , and we can use that to tell  How's it going ? 
<other> Anyone got any thoughts ? 
How how have we done today ? 
I think we did pretty well too . 
That looks pretty spectacular . 
Any other chang uh thoughts ? 
Okay so th th what about um room for creativity ? 
Is it the  . 
I <other> 
I think we we ended up being quite creative there . 
Mm . 
Not every idea necessarily , 
it's still a remote control <laugh> . 
Uh no 
yeah but  we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess , 
but the uh  
'Kay leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ? 
No th th I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing . 
I agree . 
Synergy . 
<laugh> Teamwork , 
yeah he is uh . 
What did we think of the meeting room , 
I guess is an important thing here . 
Mm . 
Yeah , this falls off 
and uh the white board worked really well without any pro 
Mm-mm , lapel . 
Wha okay , oh , alright <laugh> . 
That's it's down , it's quite close . 
Keep it , keep it calm . 
<laugh> Oh dear <laugh> . No more pizza for me <laugh> . 
So yeah the the pen came in alright 
and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works . 
<laugh> Nah , I'm I'm not convinced of that at all . 
I've been wor I've been wondering about that all day , 
but see these look like they're  
that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , 
but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down . 
I don't care . 
Uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid . 
What new ideas have we found ? 
Well let's do both then . 
Uh for the product ? 
Yeah we came up with quite a bit . 
And for the meeting room , Has anyone got any more  
Yeah less sore on the ears . 
Okay <other> so  
Are the costs within the budget ? <other> 
Nope . 
Oh hang on it really  
that's something we  that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros . 
No requirements are changed . 
We're still under twenty Euros to build , so we're good . 
And the costs within the budget ? 
Not the original budget , but they are now . 
Is the project evaluated ? 
Mm I think so yeah , 
then celebration as it says . 
Oh I don't know how that got there . 
Uh anyway . 
<other> Thank 
Thanks guys . 
Yeah , I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too . 
Oh .
