B:  Boss . 
A:  Yep . 
C:   Boss . 
D:  Maybe . Maybe maybe maybe . 
A:  Okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , 'kay ? 
B:  Yep . 
A:  And here's the agenda for this meeting . Uh I'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product that I can see some demonstrations of over there . Looks cool . And then we're gonna evaluate it . Then we're gonna talk about finance , and I've got a lovely Excel spreadsheet that I knocked up in the last five minutes for this . And uh yep . And <other> we're gonna evaluate the product and close . Got forty minutes to do this in . We should be fine . Let's try and keep this one on schedule . So

A:  Your thing is in  where is it ? Is it in  
C:  Thi third third third . 
B:  Three , three . 
C:  The end product thingy . Yeah . 
A:  Who wants it ? 
B:  Pedro can have it . 
C:  <other>  . 
B:  I like  I'll help talk . 
C:  <other> Um yeah so what we ended up with . Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight Euros , someone forgot the <cough> units there yeah , uh unit price  unit production price cost thing . Um 
B:  <laugh> Unit price . 
A:  But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , hasn't it ? 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yep I like . Good job . 
A:  So is that the the final colour scheme as well or ? 
D:  <laugh> No no . 
B:  Oh no this is <other> just what we had to work with at the time . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people . 
A:  The  hmm . 
B:  <laugh> Careful . 
A:  It came off . The scroll wheels ,  a problem with them not being sort of  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <other> 
D:  Well I mean of course , I mean  
A:  I don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm . 
D:  You know some blend of silvers and blacks . 
B:  <laugh> Beep beep beep . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> Okay enough of that . Well i it's cool guys . 'Kay so are we done with the this presentation ? 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Ja . 
A:  Okay . <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Now now . 
B:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	presentation of prototype(s)_None


C:  we implemented the basic functions , which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for uh the <other> the channels , and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll . 
A:  Zapping your favourite channels , eh ? 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Scrolling through your favourites list . 
A:  Oh okay okay . 
C:  Zapping you know zapping . 
A:  Ah 'kay okay , that's favourites . 
C:  Maybe it's just a Portuguese thing <other> . And um yeah that was the result . 
A:  Ah 'kay . I like the the the the logo on there as well . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  It's very prominent <laugh> . 
A:  It is very prominent . So this is the  
B:  So <other> here I'll give you the  so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself . Um so the scroll bar is  or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , um and then the volume controls are here and here . Uh you've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten . This is the power button . Uh we have our um <other> we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here ? 
A:  Okay . 
B:  This is the teletext . 
C:  Start s the the start uh to to to programme yeah . 
B:  The programme button , yeah the programme button . So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming <other> your uh the um the type of television you wanna use . So um the plastic is the white area of this  of the model here , and the red area is like a rubber covering . So you can see that when it lays like this or like this  and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um  
A:  Ah , okay I see . It's pretty cool . Is that  could that be easy to  for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ? 
B:  Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it  yeah <laugh> . 
C:  Not helping <laugh> . 
A:  <laugh> Oh well I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it . 
B:  Yeah and it depends on if it's sliding , but I think it's pretty ergonomic . You can feel it . 
A:  Mm . Feels good . I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well . 
C:  <other> 
B:  Yeah of course . Well this is clay <laugh> . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> Yeah it's kinda cool . You have to reach a little bit don't you . 
B:  Yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach , but I think we might scale down the final model a bit . <other> These  this is a bit larger than it would be , but  
A:  Ah yeah that wouldn't make sense . It's cool . I'm impressed . 
C:  Don't have no one to handle that . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm that's  oh that's  oh I like it . I mean you guys gave me more than I was asking for , so I'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this . 
A:  And hold it so <other>  wh what's the marketing perspective ? 
D:  Yeah I think it's good . Good good good job . 
B:  Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability . 
C:  Yeah . So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote . 
B:  Beep beep beep . 
D:  <other> Uh pla 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  The locator function . 
D:  I'm ha 
A:  <laugh> Okay . 
D:  It's great . That's great . It's a great feature . 
B:  Um beep beep beep <laugh> so <laugh> beep beep beep <laugh> beep beep beep <laugh> be shut up . <laugh> Beep beep beep <laugh> okay . Um no no no tha that's alri 
A:  Mm it's impressing . <laugh> So let me get it , if I press this button  
C:  <laugh> Wicked isn't it ? <laugh> 
A:  I see . That's pretty cool . Hang on . <laugh> 
D:  So you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town  
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> <laugh> I plan to do that as well . <laugh> So the the two blue  are are those for the the it to charge off of  in ? Ah okay okay . 
B:  Exactly that's exactly what those are for . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


B:  And um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , is um  you could beep beep beep <laugh>  we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger  it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so  
C:  <other> <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Yeah <other> it's the right shape isn't it ? But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides  . 
B:  Mm . Right . So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , but  
A:  Okay . 
D:  Uh , I can see that . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


D:  So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there I gotta do mine up at the board . 
A:  Have you ? Okay . 
D:  Yeah yeah . So <other>  
A:  Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ? 
D:  No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it . I couldn't create it in the PowerPoint , and I think I've got this really strange cable . So what I had , basically going from the PowerPoint format , is that uh yeah yeah I like this a lot . 
A:  Oh I see I see . <other> 
D:  Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ? 
C:  <laugh> Nah . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  So what we had is we had the method . That's not how you spell method , is it ? 
B:  No way . 
D:  No A_ <other> . 
A:  <other> 
D:   . <other> So this doesn't go so fast this way . And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh . And uh to me with this product we got uh  we got <other> basically three things to market . We've got the features , we have the uh characteristics , and we have the <other> I I don't know what we would call the other part  what we call you know the the <other> the corp corporate  Help me . The the corporation stands behind the product , okay . So the features I think <other> we got the scroll , we've got the uh the locator , we've got the durability , we've got the dependability , we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um 
C:  It fell off . 
B:  Beep beep beep . 
D:  <other> the characteristics I talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . Uh and the corporation , we're talking about  we're we're a new we're a new company . We're wanting to make a name for ourself . We're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price . One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of of  the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? That was something I would be interested in . Um so <other> yeah without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros . We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche . Um w 
A:  Do you  would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ? 
D:  That that would be uh that would be I think a decision best made by corporate um I I m for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay . 
D:  But I'm sh I'm sure open to to market this in either direction . But you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost I think it uh  there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only . Uh that's the only that's the only drawback I see to this . But with all of these other features I think people c <other> one thing I'm I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my  but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back . 
A:  And we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ? Th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that . 
D:  <other> Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? You know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after <other>  
A:  Hmm . 
C:  W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but  
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Mm-hmm , but you follow what I'm s I'm s 
C:  We we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works . But uh  
D:  Yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we're  <other> yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , but that's that was just an idea I had . Uh to me the only additions  
A:  Yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less  b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it's very simple , and it just works . 
D:  Yeah . Yep . 
A:  Mm there's a risk of that . 
D:  But anyway that's uh  
topic_description:	evaluation of prototype(s)_None


A:  Okay so we can talk about finance now . So I have a little spreadsheet for us where  I I was wondering , you  when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros , I was wondering how you came up with that figure ? 
B:  Well , that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this . 
C:  Very co very colf colourful . 
A:  <other> Now 
B:  Oh . 
A:  I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros , equivalent to solar cells , which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already . Uh <other> and I'm assuming that the locator beacon , the you know the  
B:  <laugh> Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  beep beep beep . 
A:  <other> Can be made for  it sounded different that time  uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display , uh an uh   
B:  Oh , sorry . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> Uh do you think that's fair coming from a  m the manufacturing ? 
B:  Yeah um I do think we that we we <other> uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print , so there may have been a m miscalculation in there . 
A:   . Okay . Yep . Okay . So we're down to sixteen point four , yeah . 
B:  And we and we have a single-curved uh  
A:  Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ? 
B:  Uh I think that  
D:  <laugh> We've got a we've got a curve and a droop . I don't know whether that <laugh> . 
A:  We're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur 
B:  It's single-curved , yeah . 
A:  You think ? Okay I'm  convinced . But we save one Euro that way , yeah ? So we come  bring it down to  <other> Fifteen point four . 
B:  See it's a little bit more than f single-curved . So yeah it's fifteen point eight , that's where we came up with it <laugh> . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Well hang on . Do don't speak so  it's in here , in that <other> w do we have any  we have special form don't we ? So that's  yeah . But the the the  we haven't talked about any special colour though uh I don't th if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're  
B:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah we do . Ah . What do you know <laugh> . <other> Oh it's <other> a that's not very special , it's pretty  
A:  <other> O okay so we're  
B:  <laugh> If th <laugh> . 
A:  Push-button , scroll wheel , we're  basically we have uh th is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ? Just a scroll ? It's not one of the scrolls where , for example , with this one you could push it down to be a button ? 
C:  We don't  It's a scroll . 
B:  That's a scroll . Uh no we just use it as a scroll . 
D:  Ooh . 
A:  Okay then we have fifteen point eight Euros . 
B:  It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say . 
A:  <other> It wasn't bad . 
C:  Yes . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah <laugh> . 
C:  We're wicked . Awesome . 
A:  Okay so we're on to the  
B:  S 's kind of s frighteningly accurate <laugh> . 
C:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	costing_None


A:  We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul <other> the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us <other> , and we can use that to tell  How's it going ? <other> Anyone got any thoughts ? How how have we done today ? 
B:  What ? I think we did pretty well . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  I think we did pretty well too . That looks pretty spectacular . 
D:  No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept . 
A:  Any other chang uh thoughts ? Okay so th th what about um room for creativity ? 
D:  <other> 
C:  That was mm-hmm  
A:  Is it the  . 
B:  Sh I think there was plenty of room . We got a couple innovative i 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  I <other> I think we we ended up being quite creative there . 
D:  Yeah well we we we kinda broke <other>  we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right , we raised the price of it , we've added two t new technology to it . So you know you know if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us . 
B:  Couple innovative ideas . 
A:  Mm . 
C:  No . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Not every idea necessarily , it's still a remote control <laugh> . Uh no yeah but  we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess , but the uh  
C:  Basically . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
C:  <other> 
D:  But I like  I mean when I say we have we had  I believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is  we did it . 
A:  'Kay leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ? No th th I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing . 
C:  It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was 
B:  Yep . 
A:  I agree . 
C:  Teamwork . 
D:  Cohesive yeah . Yes synergistic yeah . 
A:  Synergy . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> There was a lot of synergy . 
A:  <laugh> Teamwork , yeah he is uh . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  What did we think of the meeting room , I guess is an important thing here . 
B:  These cables suck <laugh> . 
A:  Mm . Yeah , this falls off and uh the white board worked really well without any pro 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yep . 
C:  And that's  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  D you must have very long shirts . That's way far down lapel mic . 
A:  Mm-mm , lapel . Wha okay , oh , alright <laugh> . 
C:  <laugh> Lapel lapel lapel <laugh> . That's almost a crotch <laugh> mi cr <laugh> 
B:  Lapel . 
A:  That's it's down , it's quite close . 
D:  <laugh> You know you know what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th <laugh> 
A:  Keep it , keep it calm . 
C:  <laugh> Oh dear oh dear <laugh> . 
A:  <laugh> Oh dear <laugh> . No more pizza for me <laugh> . So yeah the the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  'Cause this is  you were using it o upside down . Still that  
B:  <laugh> That's our boss <laugh> . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Nah , I'm I'm not convinced of that at all . I've been wor I've been wondering about that all day , but see these look like they're  that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down . I don't care . Uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid . What new ideas have we found ? 
C:  <laugh> Use them like that . 
B:  Pedro's right . Pedro's right . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh wel 
D:  New ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or  what are we ta 
A:  Well let's do both then . Uh for the product ? 
B:  Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r uh remote call feature . 
D:  Oh . 
A:  Yeah we came up with quite a bit . 
C:  Bunch of new ideas . 
A:  And for the meeting room , Has anyone got any more  
C:  Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice . 
A:  Yeah less sore on the ears . 
D:  Well I I mean  clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables , but I'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that I don't know about . And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon . It's not been uh it's not been cooperating so well , but <other> I don't think that's the 
C:  Mm . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  that's avoidable . 
C:  Coulda been worse . 
A:  Okay <other> so  Are the costs within the budget ? <other> 
C:  Mm n <other> no . 
D:  No . 
A:  Nope . Oh hang on it really  that's something we  that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros . No requirements are changed . We're still under twenty Euros to build , so we're good . 
C:  <other> 
A:  And the costs within the budget ? Not the original budget , but they are now . Is the project evaluated ? Mm I think so yeah ,
