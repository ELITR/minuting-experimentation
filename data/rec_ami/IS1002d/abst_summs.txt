C:  Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight Euros , 
C:  we implemented the basic functions , 
C:  which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator , 
C:  cradle , 
C:  scroll wheel for uh the <other> the channels , 
C:  and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll . 
B:  Scrolling through your favourites list . 
A:  I like the the the the logo on there as well . 
B:  Um so the scroll bar is  or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , 
B:  so this is the cradle unit , 
B:  This is the teletext . 
B:  So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming <other> your uh the um the type of television you wanna use . 
B:  So um the plastic is the white area of this  of the model here , 
B:  and the red area is like a rubber covering . 
B:  and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um  
A:  could that be easy to  for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ? 
B:  Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it  
A:  I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well . 
B:  but I think we might scale down the final model a bit . 
C:  So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote . 
B:  Beep beep beep . 
B:  And um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , 
B:  we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger  
B:  but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . 
B:  And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so  
A:  But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , 
B:  So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , 
A:  But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , 
B:  So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people . 
D:  My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions . 
abst_sum - abstract: The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype to the group and displayed all of its components.

C:  So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote . 
B:  Beep beep beep . 
B:  but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . 
abst_sum - abstract: They demonstrated how the locator function operates.

B:  And um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , 
B:  we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger  
B:  And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so  
A:  But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , 
abst_sum - abstract: They suggested that a trigger button should be included in a later designing phase to improve the feel of the product.

D:  I gotta do mine up at the board . 
D:  So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there 
D:  No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it . 
D:  And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh . 
D:  And uh to me with this product we got uh  we got <other> basically three things to market . 
D:  We've got the features , 
D:  we have the uh characteristics , 
D:  The the corporation stands behind the product , okay . 
D:  we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um 
D:  we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . 
D:  One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , 
D:  it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros . 
D:  We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche . 
A:  would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ? 
D:  for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that that we can go after this 
D:  and at that cost I think it uh  there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . 
D:  The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only . 
D:  There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my  but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back . 
D:  <other> Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? 
C:  W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but  
A:  Yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less  
A:  b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , 
abst_sum - abstract: The Marketing Expert gave an evaluation of the product and felt that it satisfied his criteria.

abst_sum - abstract: He suggested including a lifetime guarantee and expressed concern that the remote would only be used for televisions.

A:  Okay so we can talk about finance now . 
A:  So I have a little spreadsheet for us 
A:  I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros , 
A:  which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already . 
A:  Uh <other> and I'm assuming that the locator beacon , 
A:  uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display , 
B:  um I do think we that we we <other> uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print , 
A:  Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ? 
A:  So we come  bring it down to  <other> Fifteen point four . 
B:  See it's a little bit more than f single-curved . 
B:  So yeah it's fifteen point eight , 
A:  we haven't talked about any special colour though 
A:  if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're  
A:  is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ? 
B:  That's a scroll . 
A:  then we have fifteen point eight Euros . 
A:  I think we we ended up being quite creative there . 
abst_sum - abstract: The Project Manager discussed the final production cost with the group; after an analysis of all of the components the final cost was 15.8 Euros.

B:  It's single-curved , 
A:  We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , 
A:  How how have we done today ? 
B:  I think we did pretty well . 
D:  No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept . 
A:  Okay so th th what about um room for creativity ? 
B:  Sh I think there was plenty of room . 
A:  I think we we ended up being quite creative there . 
D:  we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us 
A:  yeah but  we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess , 
C:  It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was 
B:  These cables suck <laugh> . 
A:  So yeah the the pen came in alright 
A:  and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works . 
A:  What new ideas have we found ? 
B:  Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r uh remote call feature . 
C:  Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice . 
D:  And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon . 
A:  Are the costs within the budget ? <other> 
A:  Not the original budget , but they are now . 
abst_sum - abstract: The Project Manager then led a discussion about the group's experience on the project.

B:  Sh I think there was plenty of room . 
D:  we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us 
A:  yeah but  we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess , 
C:  It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was 
abst_sum - abstract: The group felt that they worked well together and that they had room to be creative, but only after they changed many of the initial specifications.

B:  These cables suck <laugh> . 
A:  and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works . 
C:  Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice . 
D:  And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon . 
abst_sum - abstract: They also had difficulties using the meeting-room equipment.

A:  Are the costs within the budget ? <other> 
A:  Not the original budget , but they are now . 
abst_sum - abstract: They were satisfied with the increased final cost and budget.

A:  Not the original budget , but they are now . 
abst_sum - decisions: The group was satisfied enough with the prototype and the final production cost to continue with the current prototype.

D:  The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only . 
D:  There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my  but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back . 
D:  <other> Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? 
abst_sum - problems: The Marketing Expert was still concerned that the remote would only be used for televisions.

D:  we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us 
A:  yeah but  we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess , 
abst_sum - problems: The group felt that they had room to be creative, but only after they changed the initial specifications.

D:  No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it .
