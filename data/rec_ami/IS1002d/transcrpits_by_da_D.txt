So so so . 
Maybe . Maybe maybe maybe . 
<other> Bra 
Mm that's  
oh that's  
oh I like it . 
I mean you guys gave me more than I was asking for , so I'm happy 
because we've got some really marketable features in this . 
Yeah I think it's good . 
Good good good job . 
<other> Uh pla 
I'm ha 
It's great . That's great . It's a great feature . 
So you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town  
Uh , I can see that . 
Yep I like . 
Good job . 
<laugh> No no . 
Well I mean of course , I mean  
My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions . 
You know some blend of silvers and blacks . 
So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there 
I gotta do mine up at the board . 
Yeah yeah . 
So <other>  
No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it . 
I couldn't create it in the PowerPoint , 
and I think I've got this really strange cable . 
So what I had , basically going from the PowerPoint format , is that 
uh yeah yeah I like this a lot . 
Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ? 
So what we had is we had the method . 
That's not how you spell method , is it ? 
No A_ <other> . 
 . 
<other> So this doesn't go so fast this way . 
And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh . 
And uh to me with this product we got uh  we got <other> basically three things to market . 
We've got the features , 
we have the uh characteristics , 
and we have the <other> 
I I don't know what we would call the other part  
what we call you know the the <other> the corp corporate  
Help me . 
The the corporation stands behind the product , okay . 
So the features I think <other> 
we got the scroll , we've got the uh the locator , we've got the durability , we've got the dependability , 
we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um 
<other> the characteristics I talk about , 
we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . 
Uh and the corporation , we're talking about  we're we're a new we're a new company . 
We're wanting to make a name for ourself . 
We're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price . 
One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , 
which means that this product , for the for the life of of  the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? 
That was something I would be interested in . 
Um so <other> yeah 
without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , 
it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros . 
We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche . 
Um w 
That that would be uh that would be I think a decision best made by corporate 
um I I m 
for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that that we can go after this 
and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense . 
But I'm sh I'm sure open to to market this in either direction . 
But you guys came up with a great product , 
and at that cost I think it uh  there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . 
The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only . 
Uh that's the only that's the only drawback I see to this . 
But with all of these other features I think people c <other> one thing I'm I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . 
There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my  but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back . 
<other> Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? 
You know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . 
You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after <other>  
Mm-hmm , 
but you follow what I'm s I'm s 
Yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we're  <other> 
yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , 
but that's that was just an idea I had . 
Uh to me the only additions  
Yeah . 
Yep . 
But anyway that's uh  
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> We've got a we've got a curve and a droop . 
I don't know whether that <laugh> . 
<laugh> 
Ooh . 
No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept . 
<other> 
Yeah 
well we we we kinda broke <other>  
we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us 
because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right , 
we raised the price of it , we've added two t new technology to it . 
So you know you know if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us . 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
But I like  
I mean when I say we have we had  I believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is  we did it . 
Cohesive yeah . 
Yes synergistic yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> You know you know what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
New ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or  
what are we ta 
Oh . 
Well I I mean  
clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables , 
but I'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that I don't know about . 
And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon . 
It's not been uh it's not been cooperating so well , 
but <other> I don't think that's the 
that's avoidable . 
No . 
<other> Okay . 
So we need to close this meeting , 
yeah bravo . Congratulations . 
S I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on 
so let's close this and come back and  'kay .
