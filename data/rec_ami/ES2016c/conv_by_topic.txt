D:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay . 
D:   . 
A:  Right . Okay . Alright . Is everyone here ? <laugh> Okay . This is our conceptual design meeting . 
D:  <laugh> Yep . <laugh> 
C:  Yep . 
A:  And  <other> I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes . Um then each of you will have your presentation , um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . And then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up . Um  <other> I'll go through the mee through the minutes first . Um , we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available . <laugh> Um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . Um <other> and 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . People thought their remotes were ugly , um um that remotes zap a lot . Um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Um and that they often lose the  it's easy to lose a remote . Um which were all things we were thinking we would  wanna make it simple . Um  <other> And uh some sort of locator . Either a button or tracking device . Um  And that it should look different than what's out there . Um  Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . The younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably a gimmick , that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves . Um <other>  Then the User Interface Designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote . Um the simple versus the um the complex . The simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . Um  Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . Um we would just have a T_V_ remote . Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . Have it s be something that looks different . And finally our um Industrial Designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . Um from energy source , um uh what we would use . Batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable . Um  <other> How that would power the remote and the lamp . If we were to to have one . Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , <cough> which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the T_V_ . Um  I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . Um  <other> Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand . <other> And with a , just a few buttons . Just the basics . And with a scrolling um function also . Okay and I will leave that , leave it at that . So  Marketing ? We're watching trends . I suppose that you can have this . 
D:  Okay . Yep . Can I have your cable please ? Thanks . 


B:  <other> 
D:  Okay so I was looking at trend-watching . Um unfortunately I wasn't given too much information . I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that . 


C:  Okay . Why can't I see the  crazy . Um yeah I  talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . 
C:  And that is it . 
C:  Just to sort of show you . 
C:  Why's my screen crazy ? 


B:  Uh  Well let's see . I'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . I've more information on possible materials um as well . What we can and cannot do . Um but let's just wait for this to load up and I'll show you what we're talking about here . Okay . 
A:  Do you have more to your presentation ? 
B:  <other> That's pretty much it . I informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on  there you go . 
A:  Oh . 


A:  Okay . I'm gonna plug in here real quick . If I could . 
B:  Sure . Hang on . There you go . 
A:  Like I said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here . Um  ow . Ow . 


D:  So is the two piece idea out ? Or have we not decided ? 


A:  Okay . Uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . Um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , um the chip-on-print , and the case . Probably case um material . And probably a shape also . Um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is . And what kind of supplements we'll have . 


A:  Um  <other> Energy source I think we've , I think we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet . 
B:  Right . 
A:  And we have five minutes . 
B:  Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as I said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . Uh if you want just a normal button version , the chip-on-print is gonna be 
D:  Mm . 
B:  a cheap one . Right ? 
A:  'Kay . So  Um I guess we should pick the case then . If we go with the plasticky case , or the the plastic case , um then the chip-on-print is still kind of , we could have either or . We could have a complex one or a a non-complex . But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ? 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Well what about what you said , like putting the 
C:  Just  just maybe  yeah . Just a little bit of  . 
A:   . 
D:  finger grips just on top of the plastic ? 
A:  Okay . So we would , we would have the L_C_D_ screen ? 
B:   as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes . 
A:  'Kay . So I guess the case would be plastic , with  Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:   . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  M more of a l lamination perhaps . <other> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  So then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ? 
C:  Yeah I think so . I think  
D:  Yeah ? Okay . 
A:  <other> Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ? 
B:  Yes . It does . 
A:  'Kay . So  


A:  I guess that , is that , is that about it ? So we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this ? 
B:  Right . 
A:  Um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . Um <other>  Here's what's gonna be going on . Um  Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . Um  Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design . 
B:  Right . 
A:  Corrine we'll want a product evaluation . And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  maybe and and get us a prototype . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface . So that <other> basically  just be working on the prototype , <other> uh we'll accomplish your other two actions . 
B:  <other> 
A:  Alright . <other> Okay . Let's do it . <other> 
B:  <other>
