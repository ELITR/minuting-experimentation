D:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay . 
D:   . 
A:  Right . Okay . Alright . Is everyone here ? <laugh> Okay . This is our conceptual design meeting . 
D:  <laugh> Yep . <laugh> 
C:  Yep . 
A:  And  <other> I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes . Um then each of you will have your presentation , um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . And then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up . Um  <other> I'll go through the mee through the minutes first . Um , we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available . <laugh> Um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . Um <other> and 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . People thought their remotes were ugly , um um that remotes zap a lot . Um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Um and that they often lose the  it's easy to lose a remote . Um which were all things we were thinking we would  wanna make it simple . Um  <other> And uh some sort of locator . Either a button or tracking device . Um  And that it should look different than what's out there . Um  Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . The younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably a gimmick , that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves . Um <other>  Then the User Interface Designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote . Um the simple versus the um the complex . The simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . Um  Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . Um we would just have a T_V_ remote . Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . Have it s be something that looks different . And finally our um Industrial Designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . Um from energy source , um uh what we would use . Batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable . Um  <other> How that would power the remote and the lamp . If we were to to have one . Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , <cough> which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the T_V_ . Um  I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . Um  <other> Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand . <other> And with a , just a few buttons . Just the basics . And with a scrolling um function also . Okay and I will leave that , leave it at that . So  Marketing ? We're watching trends . I suppose that you can have this . 
D:  Okay . Yep . Can I have your cable please ? Thanks . 
topic_description:	opening_None


B:  <other> 
D:  Okay so I was looking at trend-watching . Um unfortunately I wasn't given too much information . I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that . 
topic_description:	marketing expert presentation_None


D:  Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which I think we've kind of already discussed before . Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . And thirdly the remote would be easy to use . As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . 
topic_description:	trendwatching_None


D:  <other> Okay so from that um , as we've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . But I think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and  Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . Um for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device . We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . And Manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . <other> Um <laugh> we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . I don't know , I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable . <laugh> Yeah . Yeah . Right . Or with exterior designs . But my question is , I mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside . So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , or I don't know , different options for female , male target groups . 
A:  <laugh> A banana shape ? 
C:  Oh it was sort of banana shaped .  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  And then the spongy feel . I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there . C and look at different types of material that <other> might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls . So that's that . 
A:  So possibly like a uh , sorry , just to butt in for a second . Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ? 
B:  Alright . 
D:  <laugh> That's what I was thinking yeah . 
C:  Those like , yeah , sort of spongy ones . 
A:  You have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that's a spongy 
D:  <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . So when you buy your remote you can buy 
A:  feel to it . <laugh> You can  
D:  various coverings . 
A:  Mm various covers . 
C:  What's it called ? Cust you  <other> personalised , yeah . 
D:  Personalise your remote . <cough> 
A:  We could leave that to the cover department . <other> 
D:  <laugh> Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> <other> We all know they've got nothing to do all day . 
B:  <cough> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


C:  Okay . Why can't I see the  crazy . Um yeah I  talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . 
C:  And that is it . 
C:  Just to sort of show you . 
C:  Why's my screen crazy ? 
topic_description:	interface specialist presentation_None


C:  Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . 
topic_description:	existing products_None


C:  Um okay . There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . Um there's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen . A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . You can't really see that picture well , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


B:  <cough> 
C:  So , then I had a look at new products that are on the market . Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise . Um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . I have a  there is a picture  . You surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . Store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ and audio . And you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . So the technology is there . Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there  has scroll down functions on the side . You can sort of just make those out . And then on the right is obviously an iPod , which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , and really is , and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . That is a <other> possibility . And nothing's simpler really . Um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . And um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . So I don't know  if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes . 
topic_description:	existing products_None


C:  Um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be  need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . Sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a V_ for volume . Just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . Um I think , d carrying on from what I've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the  do it  or program all that on the control bit . And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . Um I don't  it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus . Stuff like  gets more and more compli complicated . And then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


C:  Why am I  Oh yeah . Just  .  Where are we ? Uh . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


C:  M  they've even got things like that . Huge things . Which is just  for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah ? 
A:  <laugh> <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  That's industrial design for cranes , stuff like that . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> Notice the giant dog bone shape ? Also good for animals . 
D:  <laugh> Dunno . 
C:  And that  yeah . 
B:  Makes sense , makes sense . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . See .  things  .  . 
topic_description:	discussion_None


B:  Uh  Well let's see . I'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . I've more information on possible materials um as well . What we can and cannot do . Um but let's just wait for this to load up and I'll show you what we're talking about here . Okay . 
A:  Do you have more to your presentation ? 
B:  <other> That's pretty much it . I informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on  there you go . 
A:  Oh . 
topic_description:	industrial designer presentation_None


B:  The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . <cough> The underside , that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really  top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it . Um  So much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself . <cough> Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . When you press a key um you complete a specific connection . The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . Right . Pretty clear . Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . The sensor in the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . This is the circuit board from the other side . Um the lower part of it , I don't know if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over . Um you can see the circuit board itself . That's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . Um what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . These are the actual keys that are being pressed . They close the electric circuit . That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . That would be behind here . Um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that 
D:  <cough> 
B:  amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . Now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . <other> Um the way it works is that you have the keys here . The rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . And thus gives on the signal . Now this is the simple version . <cough> Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . We are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well . And not only that . Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . Um <other> I've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , rubber , as well . Um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . So it's pretty squishy . That would that would serve that purpose . Um <other> we could also use wood , or titanium . 
D:  <laugh> Spongy ? 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> What's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ? <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh fya I don't have an information on that . However our company <other> obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium , so I assume , I'm , I was given an okay to use it . <other> It certainly is an expensive material , I'm aware of that , but I was given an okay . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  But there are certain restrictions to certain materials . Now let's first go through the list with the materials . So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . Can also mix these . Um as for the energy source , um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . Um what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . Right ? Uh a dynamo . Interestingly enough . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Um we could use solar cells . Or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . Such as like watches you know . Where you just move them m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy . So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . You don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right ? Um solar cell is interesting . <other> May fail though , every here and there . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Mm . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Would you have to leave it by the window ?  yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Mm . Yeah . Or you know you lose it , it lies behind the couch for a week and  yeah mm . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Always the  you  
A:  Works well in Arizona but in Edinburgh not so  
B:  But  exactly . Um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem . You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery . 
D:  Y probably not yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Which also makes a base station basically obsolete . We don't need that then . Um  However our interface options are push-buttons . In which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert . Um  However we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . And they are possible . We have an okay for scroll wheels . Okay . Um however <other> when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well . This however may exclude certain um materials . If you have a squishy uh kind of remote control , then an L_C_D_ screen may be affected by the movement . Hence we might not be able to put it in there . So um  There's also restrictions <other> to , when it comes to the chip . If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . I don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference . I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip , but that's not up to me to decide really . <other> So that's for the for the scroll wheel . Um it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so I'd say rather not go for for that . Let's see now . Um um solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . But obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells , I assume right ? Or is anybody still  alright . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> No I think I think batteries are probably the way to go . 
D:  No . Hmm . 
B:  <other> Alright . Uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional I assume . Um  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Um  With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design . We would just be able to make it flat and and um yeah a straight design pretty much . Which I assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions . <laugh> <other> 
C:  Would the sort of <other> spongy and the the plasticky thing  y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a  it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff . So I don't know if that would still be possible to have you know  in plastic . But then where do people hold it ? Just all be sort of spongy . 
D:  Mm . Like a covering . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it . 
C:  <laugh> <other> So you <other> as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it , like a screen ? Like the iPod ? 
B:  You can have an L_C_D_ screen . Um but therefore no rubber will be used . Alright ? So plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form . With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form . Um latex 
C:  Right . 
B:  is tricky . Or rubber and um and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , uh add an L_C_D_ screen , and um then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium . Or wood even . Um if you wanna make it a particular shape , use plastic . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Add an L_C_D_ screen , add a scroll wheel , that'll be fine . Or make it just push-buttons . Basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options . Maybe not the nicest feel . Or not much originality really . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  So the ru wait the rubbery  we can shape it however we want ? Or the rubbery we cannot ? 
B:  <other> With rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it , but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen . 
A:  'Kay . Mm . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  Mm . <other> 
B:  <other> That's the tricky thing . 
C:  Could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen , and then j just sort of that initial shape we had , just which is uh sort of banana-esque . So that's  thing if we did it yellow . And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . They wouldn't have any  they're just on the exterior . They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing . 
A:  Yeah . Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? 
B:  S Certainly can be done yes . Um yeah . if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all . Like say just the underside or so then it can be done . I assume . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


B:  So  <other> The fruit design um  How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ? Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , but uh give it like the surface of 
D:  Mm . 
B:  an orange , banana , whatever . You name it . 
C:  Mm . 
A:  What about a smell ? T <laugh> to the remote ? <laugh> 
B:  Just design-wise . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm . Nice one . 
C:  You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose . In different ye yellows . I don't suppose we have to stick to co 
D:  Bright citrus colours yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Mm . Well we we're supposed to stick to the company colours though , that's yellow and grey . So what have we , lemon , banana , is  
C:  Stick to the colours yeah . 
D:  Oh yeah . Yellow and grey . 
A:  Yellow and grey . 
C:  Mm grapefruit . <laugh> 
A:  Grapefruit . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Grapefruit is what we'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps . But  mm . 
A:  I would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah .  . 
A:  Um  
D:  I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous , <laugh> like  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Well we have it banana-shaped already , kind of . So  
D:  <laugh> Well we kinda do yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> And if it's yellow ? <laugh> 
C:   <laugh> and if it if it was done yellow , which is a company colour . 
B:  Right . 
A:  It's it's yellow . It's curved . 
B:  I it's yellow . 
D:  Grey buttons yeah . 
B:  Well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana ? <laugh> 
A:  It's sort of <laugh> couple of couple of grey stripes .  We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over . It would look like a banana just sitting on their table . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> On the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  There you go . 
A:  Rather than  <laugh> rather th <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  It could  and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , and then people would always know where it was . 
D:  Oh . 
A:  Maybe the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit . <laugh> Could be , it could be an ape or a fruit bowl . Hey we could have a variety of options here . 
D:  Nice . Could look like a fruit bowl . 
B:  It could be an ape . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> 
D:  'Kay . 
B:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  Okay . I'm gonna plug in here real quick . If I could . 
B:  Sure . Hang on . There you go . 
A:  Like I said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here . Um  ow . Ow . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


D:  So is the two piece idea out ? Or have we not decided ? 
topic_description:	discussion_None


C:  Well we sort of   rid of that because  gonna use a battery . And the base station might not be necessary . 
D:  Oh right okay . 
B:  Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station , but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece . We can still do that . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <cough> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm . 
B:  However <other> of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much . So um which then , as I understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . Say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them , or have an L_C_D_ screen and so on so on . You'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Mm . 
B:  design which we saw there . 
D:  Mm . <cough> 
B:  But could be done , of course . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


A:  Okay . Uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . Um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , um the chip-on-print , and the case . Probably case um material . And probably a shape also . Um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is . And what kind of supplements we'll have . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  Um  <other> Energy source I think we've , I think we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet . 
B:  Right . 
A:  And we have five minutes . 
B:  Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as I said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . Uh if you want just a normal button version , the chip-on-print is gonna be 
D:  Mm . 
B:  a cheap one . Right ? 
A:  'Kay . So  Um I guess we should pick the case then . If we go with the plasticky case , or the the plastic case , um then the chip-on-print is still kind of , we could have either or . We could have a complex one or a a non-complex . But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ? 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Well what about what you said , like putting the 
C:  Just  just maybe  yeah . Just a little bit of  . 
A:   . 
D:  finger grips just on top of the plastic ? 
A:  Okay . So we would , we would have the L_C_D_ screen ? 
B:   as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes . 
A:  'Kay . So I guess the case would be plastic , with  Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:   . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  M more of a l lamination perhaps . <other> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  So then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ? 
C:  Yeah I think so . I think  
D:  Yeah ? Okay . 
A:  <other> Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ? 
B:  Yes . It does . 
A:  'Kay . So  
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


A:  I guess that , is that , is that about it ? So we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this ? 
B:  Right . 
A:  Um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . Um <other>  Here's what's gonna be going on . Um  Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . Um  Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design . 
B:  Right . 
A:  Corrine we'll want a product evaluation . And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh>
