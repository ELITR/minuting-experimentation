<other> 
<laugh> 
Alright . 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
That's industrial design for cranes , stuff like that . 
Makes sense , makes sense . 
<laugh> 
Uh  
Well let's see . 
I'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior . 
Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . 
I've more information on possible materials um as well . 
What we can and cannot do . 
Um but let's just wait for this to load up 
and I'll show you what we're talking about here . 
Okay . 
The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . 
<cough> The underside , that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really  
top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , 
and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , 
which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp 
which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television 
which then will recognise what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it . Um  
So much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself . 
<cough> Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . 
When you press a key um you complete a specific connection . 
The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . 
It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . 
Right . Pretty clear . 
Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . 
The sensor in the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . 
This is the circuit board from the other side . 
Um the lower part of it , 
I don't know if you can see that properly , 
with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over . 
Um you can see the circuit board itself . 
That's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . 
Um what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . 
These are the actual keys that are being pressed . 
They close the electric circuit . 
That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . 
That would be behind here . 
Um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that 
amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . 
Now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . 
<other> Um the way it works is that you have the keys here . 
The rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . 
And thus gives on the signal . 
Now this is the simple version . 
<cough> Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . 
We are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well . 
And not only that . 
Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . 
Um <other> I've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , 
rubber , as well . 
Um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . 
So it's pretty squishy . 
That would that would serve that purpose . 
Um <other> we could also use wood , or titanium . 
Oh fya 
I don't have an information on that . 
However our company <other> obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium , so I assume , I'm , I was given an okay to use it . 
<other> It certainly is an expensive material , 
I'm aware of that , 
but I was given an okay . 
But there are certain restrictions to certain materials . 
Now let's first go through the list with the materials . 
So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . 
Can also mix these . 
Um as for the energy source , um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . 
Um what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . 
Right ? 
Uh a dynamo . 
Interestingly enough . 
Um we could use solar cells . 
Or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . 
Such as like watches you know . Where you just move them 
m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy . 
So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . 
You don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it 
right ? 
Um solar cell is interesting . 
<other> May fail though , every here and there . 
Mm . Yeah 
. Or you know you lose it , it lies behind the couch for a week 
and  yeah mm . 
Always the  you  
But  
exactly . 
Um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem . 
You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . 
So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery . 
Which also makes a base station basically obsolete . 
We don't need that then . 
Um  
However 
our interface options are push-buttons . 
In which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert . 
Um  
However we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . 
And they are possible . 
We have an okay for scroll wheels . 
Okay . Um 
however <other> when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well . 
This however may exclude certain um materials . 
If you have a squishy uh kind of remote control , then an L_C_D_ screen may be affected by the movement . 
Hence we might not be able to put it in there . 
So um  
There's also restrictions <other> to , when it comes to the chip . 
If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . 
I don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference . 
I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip , 
but that's not up to me to decide really . 
<other> So that's for the for the scroll wheel . 
Um it limits our choice 
and squishy is hip , so I'd say rather not go for for that . 
Let's see now . 
Um um 
solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . 
But obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells , I assume 
right ? 
Or is anybody still  
alright . 
<other> Alright . 
Uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional I assume . 
Um  
Um  
With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design . 
We would just be able to make it flat and 
and um yeah 
a straight design pretty much . 
Which I assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions . <laugh> 
<other> 
You can have an L_C_D_ screen . 
Um but therefore no rubber will be used . 
Alright ? 
So plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form . 
With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form . 
Um latex 
is tricky . 
Or rubber 
and um and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . 
So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , uh add an L_C_D_ screen , and um then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium . 
Or wood even . 
Um if you wanna make it a particular shape , use plastic . 
Add an L_C_D_ screen , add a scroll wheel , that'll be fine . 
Or make it just push-buttons . 
Basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options . 
Maybe not the nicest feel . 
Or not much originality really . 
<other> With rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it , 
but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen . 
<other> That's the tricky thing . 
S Certainly can be done yes . 
Um yeah . 
if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all . 
Like say just the underside or so then it can be done . 
I assume . 
Yeah . 
So  <other> 
The fruit design um  
How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ? 
Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , 
but uh give it like the surface of 
an orange , banana , whatever . 
You name it . 
Just design-wise . 
Mm . Nice one . 
Mm . 
Well we we're supposed to stick to the company colours though , 
that's yellow and grey . 
So what have we , 
lemon , banana , is  
Grapefruit 
is what we'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps . 
But  mm . 
Well we have it banana-shaped already , kind of . 
So  
Right . 
I it's yellow . 
Well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana ? <laugh> 
There you go . 
<laugh> 
It could be an ape . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<other> That's pretty much it . 
I informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on 
 there you go . 
Sure . 
Hang on . 
There you go . 
Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station , 
but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece . 
We can still do that . 
However <other> of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much . 
So um which then , as I understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . 
Say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them , or have an L_C_D_ screen and so on so on . 
You'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button 
design which we saw there . 
But could be done , of course . 
Right . 
Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as I said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . 
Uh if you want just a normal button version , the chip-on-print is gonna be 
a cheap one . 
Right ? 
Yeah . 
 as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes . 
 . 
M more of a l lamination perhaps . <other> 
Yes . It does . 
Right . 
Right . 
<other>
