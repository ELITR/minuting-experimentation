Okay . 
Right . 
Okay . 
Alright . 
Is everyone here ? <laugh> 
Okay . 
This is our conceptual design meeting . 
And  
<other> I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes . 
Um then each of you will have your presentation , 
um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . 
And then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up . 
Um  
<other> I'll go through the mee through the minutes first . 
Um , we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available . 
<laugh> Um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . 
Um <other> and 
our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . 
Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . 
People thought their remotes were ugly , um 
um 
that remotes zap a lot . 
Um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons . 
Um and that they often lose the  
it's easy to lose a remote . 
Um which were all things we were thinking we would  wanna make it simple . Um  
<other> And uh some sort of locator . 
Either a button or tracking device . Um  
And that it should look different than what's out there . 
Um  
Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . 
The younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . 
Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it , 
and that it was probably a gimmick , that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves . Um <other>  
Then the User Interface Designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote . 
Um the simple versus the um the complex . 
The simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . Um  
Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . 
Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . 
Um we would just have a T_V_ remote . 
Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . 
Have it s be something that looks different . 
And finally our um Industrial Designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . 
Um from energy source , um uh what we would use . 
Batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable . Um  
<other> How that would power the remote and the lamp . 
If we were to to have one . 
Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , <cough> which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the T_V_ . Um  
I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . Um  
<other> Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand . <other> 
And with a , just a few buttons . 
Just the basics . 
And with a scrolling um function also . 
Okay 
and I will leave that , leave it at that . 
So  
Marketing ? 
We're watching trends . 
I suppose that you can have this . 
<laugh> A banana shape ? 
<laugh> 
So possibly like a uh , 
sorry , 
just to butt in for a second . 
Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ? 
You have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that's a spongy 
feel to it . 
<laugh> You can  
Mm various covers . 
We could leave that to the cover department . <other> 
<laugh> 
<other> We all know they've got nothing to do all day . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Notice the giant dog bone shape ? 
Also good for animals . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> What's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ? <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Works well in Arizona but in Edinburgh not so  
<other> No I think I think batteries are probably the way to go . 
Yeah . 
So the ru wait the rubbery  we can shape it however we want ? 
Or the rubbery we cannot ? 
'Kay . 
Mm . 
Mm . <other> 
Yeah . 
Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? 
What about a smell ? 
T <laugh> to the remote ? <laugh> 
Yellow and grey . 
Grapefruit . 
I would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance . 
Um  
<laugh> 
Well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer . 
It's it's yellow . It's curved . 
It's sort of <laugh> 
couple of couple of grey stripes . 
 We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over . 
It would look like a banana just sitting on their table . 
Rather than  <laugh> rather th <laugh> 
Maybe the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit . 
<laugh> Could be , 
it could be an ape or a fruit bowl . 
we could have a variety of options here . 
<other> 
Do you have more to your presentation ? 
Oh . 
Okay . 
I'm gonna plug in here real quick . 
If I could . 
Like I said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here . 
Um  
ow . Ow . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . 
Um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , um the chip-on-print , and the case . 
Probably case um material . 
And probably a shape also . 
Um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is . 
And what kind of supplements we'll have . 
Um  
<other> Energy source I think we've , I think we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet . 
And we have five minutes . 
'Kay . 
So  
Um I guess we should pick the case then . 
If we go with the plasticky case , or the the plastic case , um then the chip-on-print is still kind of , we could have either or . 
We could have a complex one or a a non-complex . 
But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ? 
 . 
Okay . 
So we would , 
we would have the L_C_D_ screen ? 
'Kay . 
So I guess the case would be plastic , 
with  Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . 
It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe . 
<other> Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ? 
'Kay . 
So  
I guess that , is that , is that about it ? 
So we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this ? 
Um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . Um <other>  
Here's what's gonna be going on . Um  
Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . Um  
Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design . 
Corrine we'll want a product evaluation . 
And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh 
maybe and and get us a prototype . 
Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface . 
So that <other> 
basically  just be working on the prototype , <other> uh we'll accomplish your other two actions . 
Alright . 
<other> Okay . 
Let's do it . <other>
