<laugh> 
 . 
<laugh> Yep . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Yep . 
Can I have your cable please ? 
Thanks . 
Okay so I was looking at trend-watching . 
Um unfortunately I wasn't given too much information . 
I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . 
And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that . 
Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , 
which I think we've kind of already discussed before . 
Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . 
And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . 
And thirdly the remote would be easy to use . 
As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . 
So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , 
but we can try . 
Um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . 
<other> Okay so from that um , as we've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . 
Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . 
But I think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , 
so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and  
Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . 
Um for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device . 
We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . 
And Manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . 
We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , 
which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . <other> 
Um <laugh> we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . 
I don't know , 
I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable . 
<laugh> Yeah . Yeah . Right . 
Or with exterior designs . 
But my question is , I mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , 
and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside . 
So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , 
or I don't know , different options for female , male target groups . 
And then the spongy feel . 
I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there . 
C and look at different types of material that <other> might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls . 
So that's that . 
<laugh> 
That's what I was thinking yeah . 
<other> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
So when you buy your remote you can buy 
various coverings . 
Personalise your remote . 
<cough> 
<laugh> Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Dunno . 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
<laugh> Spongy ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Y probably not yeah . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
No . Hmm . 
Mm . 
Like a covering . 
Yeah . 
The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Bright citrus colours yeah . <laugh> 
Oh yeah . 
Yellow and grey . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous , 
<laugh> like  
<laugh> Well we kinda do yeah . 
<laugh> And if it's yellow ? <laugh> 
Grey buttons yeah . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Oh . 
Nice . 
Could look like a fruit bowl . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
'Kay . 
So is the two piece idea out ? 
Or have we not decided ? 
Oh right okay . 
<cough> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . <cough> 
Mm . 
Well what about what you said , like putting the 
finger grips just on top of the plastic ? 
Yeah . 
So then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ? 
Yeah ? 
Okay . 
<laugh>
