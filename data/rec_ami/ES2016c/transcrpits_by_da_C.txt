Yep . 
Oh it was sort of banana shaped .  
Those like , yeah , sort of spongy ones . 
<laugh> 
What's it called ? 
Cust you  <other> 
personalised , yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Why can't I see the  
crazy . 
Um yeah I  talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . 
Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . 
But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . 
Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . 
They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . 
Um okay . 
There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . 
Um there's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen . 
A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . 
Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . 
You can't really see that picture well , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated . 
So , then I had a look at new products that are on the market . 
Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise . 
Um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . 
I have a  
there is a picture  . 
You surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . 
Store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ and audio . 
And you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . 
So the technology is there . 
Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there  has scroll down functions on the side . 
You can sort of just make those out . 
And then on the right is obviously an iPod , 
which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , 
and really is , 
and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . 
That is a <other> possibility . 
And nothing's simpler really . 
Um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote , 
where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . 
So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . 
And um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . 
So I don't know  if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , 
maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes . 
Um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be  need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . 
Sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a V_ for volume . 
Just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . 
Um I think , d carrying on from what I've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . 
Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , 
you could maybe control that on the  do it  or program all that on the control bit . 
And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . 
Um I don't  
it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus . 
Stuff like  gets more and more compli complicated . 
And then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . 
And that is it . 
Why am I  
Oh yeah . 
Just  . 
 Where are we ? Uh . 
Just to sort of show you . 
M  they've even got things like that . 
Huge things . 
Which is just  for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah ? 
Yeah . Yeah . 
And that  yeah . 
Yeah . 
See . 
 things  . 
 . 
Why's my screen crazy ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Would you have to leave it by the window ? 
 yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Would the sort of <other> spongy and the the plasticky thing  
y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a  it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff . 
So I don't know if that would still be possible to have you know  in plastic . 
But then where do people hold it ? 
Just all be sort of spongy . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
So you <other> 
as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it , like a screen ? 
Like the iPod ? 
Right . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen , 
and then j just sort of that initial shape we had , just which is uh sort of banana-esque . 
So that's  thing if we did it yellow . 
And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . 
They wouldn't have any  
they're just on the exterior . 
They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose . 
In different ye yellows . 
I don't suppose we have to stick to co 
Stick to the colours yeah . 
Mm grapefruit . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
 . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
 <laugh> and if it if it was done yellow , which is a company colour . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
On the the gr 
the rubbery grips could be grey . 
Yeah . 
It could  
and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , 
and then people would always know where it was . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well we sort of   rid of that because  gonna use a battery . 
And the base station might not be necessary . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Just  
just maybe  
yeah . Just a little bit of  . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah I think so . 
I think  
<laugh> 
<laugh>
