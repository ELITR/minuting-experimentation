<laugh> Um  
<laugh> This is what we came up with . 
It's a pretty simple design . 
It's um based on a mango ? 
Yeah . 
And <laugh> we  
Yeah . 
And we have the company logo here 
and this will be the infrared here 
and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind  
yeah . 
It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . 
And then the other one is the power . 
And uh we just have a simple design . 
We wanted it all to be 
accessible from your thumb 
 yeah palm-held 
and all the 
buttons are accessible from your thumb . 
So you don't have to  
Oh that was a mistake , 
wasn't it ? 
Right no , that's a zero . 
<laugh> Take that one off . 
<laugh> Sorry . 
I was in charge of the numbers . <laugh> 
And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus . 
<laugh> You can go one , three or something . 
You press that first and then you go one three 
yeah . 
Well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and  
So the plus and then  
yeah . 
No no , 
th all  
that's why we have all these numbers . 
These numbers um 
these numbers all work independently up to nine . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Oh no . 
Uh , the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine . 
You p 
Oh . 
No you press the plus first . 
I I  well it doesn't  
we haven't really s 
I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , 
but she says plus  <laugh> press  which  
what do you think is simpler ? 
It's a  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Oops . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So  
A channel . 
Just so we can flick  
It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
so it's all accessible . Without m taking your hand off the remote . 
And <laugh> it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . 
Okay . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Of Play Doh yeah . 
'Cause it'd be quite subtle and  
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
yeah , yeah . <laugh> 
The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of , 
and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated <laugh> customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Well  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah <laugh> so  
<laugh> not very sleek 
and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . 
So we want it to be stand out that way , anyway . 
Yeah . 
A metallic-y finish we were thinking . 
Polished . 
Okay  
Yeah . 
<laugh> We we were <laugh> we were thinking about  <laugh> 
yeah . 
I w I'd say two I think . 
Fanciness . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
I'll go for three as well . 
No . Wouldn't be simple , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah very . 
I think one for that . 
Yeah . 
No . 
Yeah that's the only thing yeah . 
<laugh> 
<other> It's definitely  
Yeah . 
But the  
Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
But you know what I've just thought of there now . 
What  
where's it gonna sit in your living room ? 
Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ? 
Yeah . 
But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand <other> . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Oh that would be nice . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Three . 
You would though , 'cause it's bit  it's more interesting than other remotes . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I think we have to market it in the right way , that um  to say that it is simplistic . 
So people don't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , I don't want to spend twenty five Euros . 
We have to market it . 
And the kinetic energy part . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Don't shake  <laugh> 
Oh no the plus . 
<laugh> You're 
 use the zero . 
<laugh> Make a new one . 
I think they're about ten po ten pound , 
aren't they ? 
About ten pounds . 
Fifteen ? 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
I think it does very well . 
The zap  
yeah . 
Uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah 
the bu 
when you press the alarm system , the <other> lights <laugh> behind the  and it'll vibra <laugh> 
It'll be again in the marketing . 
Yeah . 
The light  it will . 
But  
But both  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Oh , that would be brilliant . 
I'd be tempted to  
Yeah . 
It would have to be in the market 
Yeah 
but you still couldn't see it . 
It would just be a little speaker on the back or something . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
So the plu the plus  
w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple , 
won't it ? 
Yeah . 
That kind of annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press  
I don't know why . <laugh> 
Oh okay . Right . 
Alright , aye . 
Yeah . 
I'd say w yeah one . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> Hmm . 
But if you're zapping  
yeah . 
I don't think it will f 
Yeah , 
the biology . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I I'd say t 
two . Yeah 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<other> N We we can't really do that 
because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow . 
It won't stand out . 
So n it's not always gonna be the same colour . 
Gray , yeah . 
Yeah , could be grey . 
Yeah that's right , 
we didn't even rea 
Yeah . 
Perhaps a metallic 
or or  
like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . 
No ? 
That isn't rubber . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Following that briefing we did . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
I think 
w yeah , 
I think one . 
Well that was our brief and we followed the brief . 
Well we haven't got a big banana but  
Oh yeah . <laugh> 
No . 
<laugh> No . <laugh> 
<laugh> Oh that would be class . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . Two . 
It's  
Yeah . 
Close to two . 
Yeah . 
I got  
Yeah , 'cause we've a four to bring down . 
Uh , aye . 
Yeah . 
Uh , should've added five . 
<laugh> This is  . 
Yay . 
<laugh> 
Is that the project document ? 
Yeah . 
Oh right . 
What about a special colour ? 
Are we using that ? 
Yeah . 
And a special material . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
That's good . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
The ma 
Or materials . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Creativity . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah , it c it might've been bigger . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I'm actually not sure if I've saved my presentations . <laugh> 
<other> 
Yeah . Through discussion . 
Yeah . 
And we were a able to modify each other's ideas 
to fit in with our areas of expertise . <laugh> 
If if it if it  
If it can be afforded . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh>
