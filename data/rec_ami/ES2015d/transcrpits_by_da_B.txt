Okay . 
Um yeah . 
I just got a few slides , so show them . 
Thank you . 
Do you want to present it ? <laugh> 
Yeah , here we are . 
<laugh> Mango shape . 
The L_E_D_ . 
So it's palm-held . 
Yeah . 
You just need the nought . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
So one plus one would be eleven , 
or  
Yeah 
because if you  
on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to  um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . 
So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two . 
Oh . 
Well I don't mind , 
we can further define that . 
I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five . 
But I suppose it's not as snappy . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
If you don't put it  
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
that  
yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Um  
And channel , 
which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like  
It's the bigger R_ . 
So it's just like <makes machine noises> . 
We deci 
Yeah 
um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers 
because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . 
Uh e ergonomics are all considered . 
It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . 
But yeah 
, no I mean it's a different movement 
so  yeah . 
Um and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . 
Um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this  the  this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls 
so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , 
and it just feels feels different . 
Would you like to feel it yourselves ? 
How it fits in the palm of your hand ? 
<laugh> Thanks . 
And you ? <laugh> 
<laugh> 
O 
Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . 
But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , 
that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . 
Or the combination . 
Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , 
like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , 
or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in 
more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish . 
Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company  the yellow and black . 
So that  for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength . 
I mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the  
yeah , seasonal . 
Apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , you know , khaki  
Yeah . 
Okay . Um yeah 
we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , 
I mean you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb . 
Um , as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ 
and that's about it . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm go  
 
Feel I think . 
We've been quite successful with the rubber coating 
and  
Yeah . 
I think the colour has a lot to do with it . 
I mean <other> th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen . 
It's not the kind of  ooh uh at all sleek 
 red , black and yellow , and orange . 
<laugh> Um  
But if you can imagine that in like a s just a  maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something  
<other> Well I know know it's for rubber . 
I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy . <laugh> 
<laugh> Oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg . 
<laugh> Potato's fine . Potato's fine . 
Yeah . Totally . 
It's really adaptable . 
For the 
fancy  
I  uh two , 
three . <laugh> 
Yeah 
and the use of the rubber . 
For the anti-R_S_I_ . 
The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative 
and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , 
there's no L_C_D_ control , 
so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway . 
In some aspects it is , like we said . 
Yeah . Though it was our specification . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah and perhaps the turning on 
but  
Mm . 
Again I think the colour comes into this . 
Okay . 
Not in  
Don't worry . <laugh> 
I suppose I've got quite big hands . 
<laugh> 
Thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly . 
Yeah . 
Uh yeah , 
it's less um , what's th ha . 
H it's got higher centre of gravity like that . 
I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , 
but definitely in another colour , 
I'm not happy with those colours . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And <other> the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , 
ooh no . <laugh> 
<laugh> But you know , those'll be firmly on . 
<laugh> 
Mm , yeah , that's true . 
Yeah . Good point . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
<other> Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . 
Yeah . 
Because  
yeah , 
because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . 
And it's just  you won't have to think about it . 
You don't have to look down to find them . 
They're clearly there , 
easy to use . 
Simple . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
It  
Yeah 
l lights on and , or flash as well . 
But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm . 
Yeah . 
But when the alarm's not  
yeah 
. If you  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
You could s <laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Well the thing is , if it was  had an alarm system , 
I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . 
But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point . 
So you can't see the alarm , but it would light up . 
Yeah . Alarm , 
but you can't see an alarm inside uh  the alarm system itself . 
Yeah . Yeah . It w yeah . 
Sorry . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Sorry Heather . 
That wasn't very clear . 
Yeah 
I think  
just because it's  we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use . 
Mm . 
And  or sixty six enter , y 
Yeah I think that's probably more straightforward . 
Yeah . Good  <laugh> 
Ooh . Mm . 
Oh . 
Injury . 
Yeah , that's what I was thinking . 
We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
I think we're getting  
that's true . 
Mm . 
I think  
yeah , I think too . 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
I think this is the 
the factor that we've been least successful in confronting . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Four I think . 
Well I don't  
what do  what  
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Like um the colour scheme names and stuff . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
It is . 
The thing is , I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , I don't know if you'd instantly say mango . 
Oh yeah . There we go . 
That would be great . 
Um  
Okay . 
It's  
Between one and two . 
So that's pretty fantastic . 
Mm . 
It seems like it should be more around two . 
Do we have an online calculator ? 
Okay . 
Oh wow . Well done . 
Well that's excellent . 
Production costs . 
It says it  
I think it just means that we can't add any more to it now . 
Have you have you completed it ? 
Oh right . Okay . 
Okay . 
<cough> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . <other> 
Yeah . 
Double 
double-curved yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Oof . 
Congratulations guys . 
Of the actual project rather than the product ? 
A project ? 
Is is  
yeah . 
So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it . 
I think we were pushed . 
I mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task . 
So I think we could've done with a bit more time . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well we were just limited by resources really 
and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that . 
So that did limit 
creativity . 
<laugh> Just resources . 
But yeah . 
The fruit and veg idea . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah we did . 
We've , uh  
seeing as we've come out with what we intended . 
A pro um a product within the budget . 
I think that's a sign of good leadership 
and also our personal coach helped us along the way , 
so you know  
I think it's been fine . 
Yeah . Good timing . 
And project manager of course . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Um  
Yeah and more Play Doh , 
'cause that was all the red we had . 
So even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype , we wouldn't have been able to . 
Yeah . 
It could be really straightforward for the computer . 
I think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays 
but I think I was the only one who struggled with that . <laugh> 
Mm . 
Uh me too . 
Yeah . 
Well I think we've all learnt stuff from each other , 
like the n um  
yeah . 
Just about each different  . Got new ideas from each other . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Sorry ? 
Oh yeah . <laugh> 
Well mm , did it come into the into  
I dunno if we counted that in the costs . <laugh> 
Yes . 
Uh . 
Fantastic . 
Okay , brilliant . 
Thank you very much . <laugh>
