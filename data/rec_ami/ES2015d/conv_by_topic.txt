A:  Okay . Here we go . Alright , the agenda for thi oh . Alright . Um the agenda for this meeting <other> is um  we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave gave it . And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . And um evaluate the product , as a group . And um  
B:  Okay . 
A:  So first we'll have the prototype presentation . Do you need the um PowerPoint for this ? 


B:  Um yeah . I just got a few slides , so show them . 
A:  Alright . 
B:  Thank you . 
C:  <laugh> Um  
B:  Do you want to present it ? <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> This is what we came up with . It's a pretty simple design . It's um based on a mango ? Yeah . And <laugh> we  
B:  Yeah , here we are . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Mango shape . 
A:  On ? <laugh> A mango . Okay . 
C:  Yeah . And we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind  yeah . 
B:  The L_E_D_ . 
A:  Oh . Okay . 
D:  I'm sorry . What was the  where's the L_E_D_ ? 
A:  Oops . 
C:  It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . And then the other one is the power . And uh we just have a simple design . We wanted it all to be 
D:  Oh . Okay . 
B:  So it's palm-held . 
C:  accessible from your thumb  yeah palm-held and all the 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  buttons are accessible from your thumb . 
A:  Notice you have a number ten button . 
C:  So you don't have to  Oh that was a mistake , wasn't it ? Right no , that's a zero . <laugh> Take that one off . 
A:  <laugh> Okay . <laugh> 
B:  You just need the nought . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Sorry . I was in charge of the numbers . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> No problem . <laugh> Ah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus . <laugh> You can go one , three or something . You press that first and then you go one three yeah . 
B:  So one plus one would be eleven , or  
A:  Oh . You press a plus button ? Oh okay . I've never heard of that kind before . 
C:  Well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and  
B:  Yeah because if you  on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to  um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Oh , there's no e okay . 
C:  So the plus and then  yeah . 
A:  Oh . I 
D:  Okay . 
A:  But  Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ? 
C:  No no , th all  that's why we have all these numbers . These numbers um these numbers all work independently up to nine . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah but I mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away . 'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards . 
C:  Yeah . Oh no . Uh , the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine . 
A:  Yeah I know , but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ? 
D:  Sixty . 
C:  You p Oh . No you press the plus first . I I  well it doesn't  we haven't really s I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , but she says plus  <laugh> press  which  what do you think is simpler ? It's a  
B:  Oh . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Well I don't mind , we can further define that . 
A:  I th Um  
B:  I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah it wouldn't be a problem . But I was just wondering like as long as we realise that's what it'll do . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  But I suppose it's not as snappy . 
D:  Well the there is a  there's a delay on remotes I think . Where you can have it  it's like a five second input time . So as long as you hit them dada 
C:  Oops . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . If you don't put it  Yeah . Yeah , that  yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> it should be fine . As long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah . So  
B:  Um  
D:  Was there  so on the top there is volume and  
B:  And channel , which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like  
C:  A channel . 
D:  Channel up volume up . Okay cool . 
A:  C_ and V_ . 
C:  Just so we can flick  
A:  Right , where um where's the power button ? 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . <laugh> 
B:  It's the bigger R_ . 
D:  It's the R_ . 
A:  Oh okay . 
B:  So it's just like <makes machine noises> . We deci 
C:  Yeah , so it's all accessible . Without m taking your hand off the remote . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . Uh e ergonomics are all considered . <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Oh okay . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . Ergonomic , definitely ergonomic . 
C:  And <laugh> it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . Okay . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . But yeah , no I mean it's a different movement so  yeah . Um and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . Um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this  the  this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , and it just feels feels different . Would you like to feel it yourselves ? How it fits in the palm of your hand ? 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> The spon yeah . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Bit of a stress ball feel . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Yes . I would . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  My goodness . <laugh> There you go . Genevieve ? Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Thanks . And you ? <laugh> 
D:  Yes . Oh it's nice . Oh I think I killed the five . I did . I killed the four . Oh god . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  And something hmm . <laugh> 
B:  O Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . Or the combination . 
D:  Oh it smells good . <laugh> 
C:  Of Play Doh yeah . 
B:  Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish . 
A:  Oh right . 
C:  'Cause it'd be quite subtle and  
A:  Yeah . It looks more  Think like vanilla and banana would . 
B:  Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company  the yellow and black . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay yeah . 
B:  So that  for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength . I mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the  yeah , seasonal . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Kinda Christmas , you know . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , you know , khaki  
A:  Yeah . 
C:  The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of , and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated <laugh> customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor . 
A:  Cool . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . Okay . Um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , I mean you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Um , as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ and that's about it . 
A:  Alright , thank you very much . Good work everyone . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Bravo <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 


A:  Alright . And so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle . So , I have 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  something I'm going to  
D:  You want the  
A:  Oh wait a minute . Do you need to do a presentation first ? 
D:  <other> I don't know what order it goes in . I have one . 
A:  Yeah . I'm gonna check that out for a second . 
B:  Mm go   
A:  What time is it anyw Oh yeah sorry you're right . Evaluation criteria is next in line . Yeah . 
D:  Evaluation cri Okay . That's me . Hello . Oh there we go . Okay . Come on my computer . Come on . <other> Sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties . Should I press it again ? 
A:  Just press um function eight again . 
D:  Last time I did that it sh Okay . You're right . 
A:  And then again I think . One more time . 
D:  Oh . Still not there . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Okay now I think for this one I could  Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on  right on the screen where you can see it . Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen . Um and looking looking back at my notes from our  both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . Um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do . Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . So basically the lower p the lower the points the better . <cough> Okay so question number one . Does the remote  whoops . Sorry . Oh I'm not gonna be able  um , I'll do it on the whiteboard . I can't change it so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  I'll write down our scores up on the  
A:  Ooh . 
D:  Okay so number one . Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ? 
C:  Mm . 
B:  Feel I think . We've been quite successful with the rubber coating and  
A:  Yeah . The look is a little bit more playful . 
C:  Well  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it's definitely different . It's not your traditional  yeah . 
A:  Oh definitely different yeah . 
B:  I think the colour has a lot to do with it . I mean <other> th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen . It's not the kind of  ooh uh at all sleek  red , black and yellow , and orange . <laugh> Um  
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh you were only given red and black ? Oh okay . 
C:  Yeah <laugh> so  <laugh> not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . So we want it to be stand out that way , anyway . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  But if you can imagine that in like a s just a  maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something  
A:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah . A metallic-y finish we were thinking . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  <other> Well I know know it's for rubber . I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Polished . Okay  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . I kinda  I like the potato look . It's very different . It's what ? Oh sorry the mango the mango look . <laugh> Yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> Oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg . 
C:  <laugh> We we were <laugh> we were thinking about  <laugh> yeah . 
A:  It's mango . <laugh> It's mango . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Potato's fine . Potato's fine . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . Totally . It's really adaptable . 
D:  So I myself would say a one or a two . 
A:  Yeah . I would say two . Personally . 
C:  I w I'd say two I think . 
D:  It's a two ? Okay , and p 
B:  For the 
C:  Fanciness . 
B:  fancy  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  One being true . So  
B:  I  uh two , three . <laugh> 
D:  Two . Okay , actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that . Okay so question number two was <other> is it techn technologically innovative ? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah and the use of the rubber . 
D:  <other> Use of the rubber , the use of the L_E_D_ . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  For the anti-R_S_I_ . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , there's no L_C_D_ control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway . In some aspects it is , like we said . 
D:  Isn't  
C:  Mm . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . I'd say maybe three . 
C:  I'll go for three as well . 
D:  Yeah . And I think  I mean it it's tough to say because we were  we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose . So I mean I  we'll put three , but I think we actually reached our goal . 
B:  Yeah . Though it was our specification . 
C:  No . Wouldn't be simple , yeah . 
A:  Yeah we want it simple . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> We didn't want it any more than that . Okay question number three . Uh , will it be easy to use ? 
A:  I think so . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah very . I think one for that . Yeah . No . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . S Yeah I think it's  you can't really get confused with that . I mean , there'll be s we have to work out the uh number  the plus system . But once that's figured out , it should be fine . 
A:  Yeah . One . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Th The plus number thing . 
C:  Yeah that's the only thing yeah . 
B:  Yeah and perhaps the turning on but  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Number four . Is this a good-looking remote ? Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  <other> It's definitely  
B:  Again I think the colour comes into this . 
A:  Yeah colour will definitely be a factor . 
D:  Mm-hmm <other> . 
A:  I think that the logo could be smaller . 
B:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  And maybe not such a prominent way . Maybe like at the bottom , kind of . 
C:  But the  Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent . 
B:  Not in  
D:  Whoops . 
A:  Oh it just had to be on there I guess . 
D:  Should just not touch it . <laugh> This time it's the three I killed . <laugh> I was just wondering if it should be like flatter . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Don't worry . <laugh> 
D:  Or  
B:  I suppose I've got quite big hands . 
A:  I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand . 
D:  Well  
C:  Yeah . But you know what I've just thought of there now . What  where's it gonna sit in your living room ? Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ? 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , and then the rest is like 
D:  Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit . 
C:  Yeah . But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand <other> . 
A:  round . 
D:  Oh . That's true . 
A:  It would still be comfortable I think . We c we could handle it I think . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  Thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly . 
D:  Maybe , it could  it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up . Like that . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh that would be nice . <laugh> 
A:  Ah it'd fall over all the time though . It'd be annoying . 
B:  Uh yeah , it's less um , what's th ha . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  I g If it's weighted maybe . <laugh> Details , details . <other> Okay . So , is this a good-looking remote ? <other> Would we wanna show it off to our friends ? <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  H it's got higher centre of gravity like that . 
A:  <laugh> 'Kay we're done designing . <laugh> Come on . 
C:  Three . You would though , 'cause it's bit  it's more interesting than other remotes . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  I think , it was another colour and it was like  I think it'd look okay . I think maybe a two . 
D:  Yeah ? I mean I gue yeah , it's personal taste , but  
B:  I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , but definitely in another colour , I'm not happy with those colours . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Okay , so should we say two for that ? Yeah ? 
A:  Sure . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Okay . Uh , question number five . What's um  will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy . 
C:  I think we have to market it in the right way , that um  to say that it is simplistic . So people don't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , I don't want to spend twenty five Euros . We have to market it . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah it  the marketing will have a lot to do with it . 
B:  Yeah . And <other> the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , ooh no . <laugh> 
C:  And the kinetic energy part . Yeah . <laugh> Don't shake  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> Shake it and the buttons fall off . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Durable . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> But you know , those'll be firmly on . 
C:  Oh no the plus . <laugh> You're  use the zero . <laugh> Make a new one . 
D:  No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , but  I know I am , aren't I ? 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  But you're our Marketing Expert . <laugh> 
C:  I think they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ? About ten pounds . Fifteen ? 
D:  But you don't have to buy batteries . So in the long term this can actually save you money . So we'll market it that way too . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm , yeah , that's true . 
A:  Oh . Exactly . Exactly . 
B:  Yeah . Good point . 
D:  So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it'll  
C:  <other> 
A:  Yeah . I would give it a two still though . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Okay number six . Can someone read it out ? Or  
C:  Mm . 
B:  <other> Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . 
A:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Um yeah . So that was mainly that the statistics  we said  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  I think it does very well . 
A:  Oh yeah . 
B:  Because  yeah , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . And it's just  you won't have to think about it . You don't have to look down to find them . They're clearly there , easy to use . Simple . 
C:  The zap  yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah I guess the  I think the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . But they're not you and I really . So . Okay so one ? Okay . Number seven . C Heather could you push it down ? Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . Now is there the  is the alarm system still  was it implemented ? 
C:  Uh  
B:  Yeah . Mm . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  We have the alarm system . 
C:  Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system , the <other> lights <laugh> behind the  and it'll vibra <laugh> 
B:  It  
D:  <other> 
B:  Yeah l lights on and , or flash as well . But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm . 
C:  It'll be again in the marketing . 
A:  I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up . 
C:  Yeah . The light  it will . 
A:  Or or was it gonna make a noise ? 
C:  But  
B:  Yeah . But when the alarm's not  yeah . If you  <laugh> 
D:  <cough> 
C:  But both  <laugh> 
A:  You press the button it makes a noise right ? 
D:  <laugh> It turns into a duck and starts quacking . Here I am . <laugh> Um  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  You could s <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Oh , that would be brilliant . I'd be tempted to  
A:  Yeah . Awesome . Awesome . 
B:  Well the thing is , if it was  had an alarm system , I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point . So you can't see the alarm , but it would light up . 
C:  Yeah . It would have to be in the market 
A:  I though w it was gonna make a noise . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah . Alarm , but you can't see an alarm inside uh  the alarm system itself . 
C:  Yeah but you still couldn't see it . It would just be a little speaker on the back or something . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  We  oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype . But yeah , it'll be there . So we can  we could say that  
B:  Yeah . Yeah . It w yeah . Sorry . 
A:  Oh okay . Whoo . Okay . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  We can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . Okay . Um  
A:  Yeah , totally . 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> Sorry Heather . That wasn't very clear . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  No problem , mm . 
D:  Question number eight . Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . So it has to be  yeah , it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . The plus thing needs to be worked on . 
A:  Totally . 
C:  So the plu the plus  w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple , won't it ? 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah I think  just because it's  we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use . 
D:  Yeah . Well  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Do  Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an  just an enter button ? So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least . 
A:  Yeah , so it's just like channel six , six , enter . 
C:  That kind of annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press  I don't know why . <laugh> 
D:   
B:  Mm . 
A:  Yeah but you don't have to press zeros . 
D:  You could just press six enter , or one two enter . Yeah . 
C:  Oh okay . Right . 
B:  And  or sixty six enter , y 
A:  And then like twelve , enter . 
C:  Alright , aye . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah I think that's probably more straightforward . Yeah . Good  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Um , okay so we can <other>  we'll say yes it's uh one ? Okay . 
C:  I'd say w yeah one . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Ooh . Mm . 
D:  Question number nine . Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , which was repeated strain injury ? Um , which affected over a quarter of users . 
B:  Oh . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Injury . 
C:  <other> Hmm . 
D:  S 
A:  I think so . It's like right in the  
C:  But if you're zapping  yeah . I don't think it will f 
A:  Your thumb might get a little bit uh  
B:  Yeah , that's what I was thinking . We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about . 
C:  Yeah , the biology . 
A:  Yeah . But it is soft . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  It's soft , and  
A:  And that's kind of what the um 
C:  Mm . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  And people could  
A:  the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_ , so  maybe it is but  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . I don't know what other options there are . 
B:  I think we're getting  that's true . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Could  I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard . So , I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  So , one or two do you think ? 
C:  I I'd say t two . Yeah . 
B:  I think  yeah , I think too . 
D:  Two okay . Okay number ten . Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ? Is the yellow  
A:  Yeah . Yes we did . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <other> N We we can't really do that because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow . It won't stand out . So n it's not always gonna be the same colour . 
B:  <cough> 
D:  Mm-hmm . It sounds like the colour's something that we  
A:  Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . So it could be grey on the banana one . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Gray , yeah . Yeah , could be grey . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  But I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though , depending on the  
C:  Yeah that's right , we didn't even rea 
D:  So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the R_R_ . 
B:  Mm . Yeah . I think this is the 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  the factor that we've been least successful in confronting . 
D:  Okay . 
C:  Perhaps a metallic or or  like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . No ? 
A:  Mm , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . And the buttons in the middle . 
C:  That isn't rubber . <laugh> 
D:  Okay . So , do you think that's more of a three then ? Three , four ? 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> Four I think . Well I don't  what do  what  
D:  Four ? Well we have good reasons for it , so we  but we can still put a 
A:  Hum . 
D:  a four ? 
B:  Okay . 
C:  Okay . 
D:  Okay , and final question . <other> Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? Current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  I would say so . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Following that briefing we did . 
A:  But maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just sort of naming it by a fruit . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Like um the colour scheme names and stuff . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  With the with the colours . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  No , uh , are the plates interchangeable ? I think I missed a few  they are ? So you can have banana and kiwi and  okay . Okay , so that's something that's kind of in the making too , like maybe it'll become more  
B:  <other> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . That's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  It is . 
C:  I think w yeah , I think one . Well that was our brief and we followed the brief . Well we haven't got a big banana but  
B:  The thing is , I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , I don't know if you'd instantly say mango . 
C:  Oh yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Be like  
C:  No . <laugh> No . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Maybe if it was scented . <laugh> Yeah we have money for that . Um  
C:  <laugh> Oh that would be class . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh yeah . There we go . That would be great . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Um  
A:  <other> Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ? 
D:  Yes we do . So I  wh what was I gonna put for that ? A two for fashion ? 
A:  Oh . I would say two . 
C:  Yeah . Two . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  Okay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven 
C:  It's  
D:  is  
A:  One point nine or something ? <laugh> I don't know these things . Um , between one and two . 
B:  It's  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Between one and two . 
D:  Between  okay . <laugh> Um . 
B:  So that's pretty fantastic . 
C:  Close to two . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one . 
C:  I got  
A:  Alright . 
D:  Does that seem right then ? 
C:  Yeah , 'cause we've a four to bring down . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Uh , aye . 
B:  It seems like it should be more around two . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Uh , should've added five . 
B:  Do we have an online calculator ? 
A:  I'm attempting to do that <laugh> right now . 
C:  <laugh> This is  . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  Yeah it is one point nine . Ooh . 
C:  Yay . 
B:  Oh wow . Well done . Well that's excellent . 
A:  Go Heather Pauls . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 


A:  <other> Alright , now with that over and done with , our next step is to see if we are under budget 
B:  <cough> 
A:  Okay here we go . So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing . So um if you can look up at the screen , um the large screen , oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think . Okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . <other> 
C:  Oh right . 
A:  Um we're using a regular chip . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Um , it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around . That's another three . We're already at five . Um , we're using plastic and rubber , so  
B:  Double double-curved yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Good thing plastic is free , we're at eight . Um  
C:  What about a special colour ? Are we using that ? 
A:  S Yeah . I guess we should do it just for one kind . So it's like special colour  well we'll have two colours right ? Well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons . So we can  
B:  Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Um , we have push button interface , so that's inexpensive . And um we have a special colour for the button , and we also have a special form . And a special material . 
C:  And a special material . Yeah . 
B:  Oof . 
A:  Which puts us just barely under budget . Hurray . 
B:  Congratulations guys . 
D:  Mm . 'S good . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Good work guys . So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros . 
C:  That's good . 
A:  Awesome . 


A:  And back to our PowerPoint . So we've  'Kay . Yes we are . So we need to do a product evaluation , again , which is probably um  
C:  <laugh> 
A:  I dunno . A different extension of a  
B:  Of the actual project rather than the product ? 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Hmm . 
B:  A project ? Is is  yeah . 
A:  Yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership , teamwork . 
B:  So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it . 
A:  Yeah . Alright so um  Do you guys feel like there was room for creativity ? 
B:  I think we were pushed . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Pushed for creativity ? 
B:  I mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task . So I think we could've done with a bit more time . 
C:  The ma Or materials . <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Ye Okay . So it'd be like need more time and materials . But you were allowed m creativity ? I think so as like  but you were supposed to have creativ 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah and the conceptual and functional . Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess , but m 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that . So that did limit 
D:  When we can down to it . Okay . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
C:  Creativity . 
B:  creativity . <laugh> Just resources . But yeah . 
A:  Right 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Okay 
B:  The fruit and veg idea . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Great . 
D:  <laugh>

B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Good leadership , I think we stayed on task . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah we did . We've , uh  seeing as we've come out with what we intended . A pro um a product within the budget . I think that's a sign of good leadership and also our personal coach helped us along the way , so you know  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  And the timing was good . We never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so  
B:  I think it's been fine . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Good timing . 
A:  Oop  Okay . Teamwork ? I think we worked great as a team . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  And project manager of course . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah ? 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> Was good teamwork . I think we are well-suited to our roles . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Alright how were our means ? 
B:  Um  
A:  We needed more Play Doh colours . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah and more Play Doh , 'cause that was all the red we had . So even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype , we wouldn't have been able to . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , it c it might've been bigger . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh really ? Okay . 
A:  <laugh> But ever everything else was satisfactory ? Is that good  
D:  Yeah . The computer programmes are good . The  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . It could be really straightforward for the computer . I think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays but I think I was the only one who struggled with that . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . I don't think there was anything  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  I'm actually not sure if I've saved my presentations . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah ? 
B:  Mm . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  They'll probably still be there . 
B:  Uh me too . Yeah . 
A:  New ideas found . I don't really know what that means . 
C:  <other> 
D:  Um  
B:  Well I think we've all learnt stuff from each other , like the n um  yeah . Just about each different  . Got new ideas from each other . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . Through discussion . 
D:  I'm not sure , new ideas found . 
A:  Hmm ? 
D:  Yeah well I guess we really  it  we bounced off of each other , which was cool . Like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and  yeah , worked well . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  And we were a able to modify each other's ideas 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  to fit in with our areas of expertise . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Each other's  
D:  Oh does it have smart materials by the way ? 
B:  Sorry ? 
D:  Does it have smart materials ? 
A:  Mm . 
B:  Oh yeah . <laugh> Well mm , did it come into the into  I dunno if we counted that in the costs . <laugh> 
D:  Oh yeah . <laugh> 
C:  If if it if it  If it can be afforded . 


A:  <sings> Okay ? Well with that achieved , our last slide is our closing slide . 
C:  <laugh>
