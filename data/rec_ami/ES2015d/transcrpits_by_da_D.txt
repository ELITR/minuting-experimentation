<laugh> 
I'm sorry . 
What was the  
where's the L_E_D_ ? 
Oh . Okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh , 
there's no e 
okay . 
Okay . 
Sixty . 
<laugh> 
Well the there is a  there's a delay on remotes I think . 
Where you can have it  
it's like a five second input time . 
So as long as you hit them dada 
<other> it should be fine . 
As long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons . 
Was there  
so on the top there is volume and  
Channel up volume up . 
Okay cool . 
Yeah . 
It's the R_ . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yes 
. Oh it's nice . 
Oh I think I killed the five . 
I did . 
I killed the four . 
Oh god . <laugh> 
Oh it smells good . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Bravo <laugh> 
You want the  
<other> I don't know what order it goes in . 
I have one . 
Evaluation cri Okay . 
That's me . 
Hello . 
Oh there we go . 
Okay . 
Come on my computer . Come on . 
<other> Sorry 
my computer's giving me technical difficulties . 
Should I press it again ? 
Last time I did that it sh 
Okay . You're right . 
Oh . 
Still not there . 
Okay now I think for this one I could  
Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard 
or mayb maybe I'll just do it on  right on the screen where you can see it . 
Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen . 
Um and looking looking back at my notes from our  both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , 
um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . 
Um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do . 
Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . 
So basically the lower p the lower the points the better . 
<cough> Okay so question number one . 
Does the remote 
 whoops . 
Sorry . 
Oh I'm not gonna be able  
um , I'll do it on the whiteboard . 
I can't change it 
so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once . 
I'll write down our scores up on the  
Okay so number one . 
Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ? 
Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , 
but it's definitely different . 
It's not your traditional  
yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
I kinda  I like the potato look . 
It's very different . 
It's what ? 
Oh sorry 
the mango the mango look . 
<laugh> Yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood . 
So I myself would say a one or a two . 
It's a two ? 
Okay , 
and p 
One being true . 
So  
Two . 
Okay , 
actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that . 
Okay so question number two was <other> is it techn technologically innovative ? 
So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative . 
<other> 
Use of the rubber , the use of the L_E_D_ . 
Isn't  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
And I think  I mean it it's tough to say 
because we were  
we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose . 
So I mean I  
we'll put three , 
but I think we actually reached our goal . 
<other> We didn't want it any more than that . 
Okay question number three . 
Uh , will it be easy to use ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . S 
Yeah 
I think it's  
you can't really get confused with that . 
I mean , there'll be s we have to work out the uh number  the plus system . 
But once that's figured out , it should be fine . 
Number four . 
Is this a good-looking remote ? 
Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . 
Mm-hmm <other> . 
Whoops . 
Should just not touch it . 
<laugh> This time it's the three I killed . 
<laugh> I was just wondering if it should be like flatter . 
Or  
Well  
Yeah 
the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit . 
Oh . That's true . 
Maybe , it could  it could be on the bottom , 
so you wouldn't loo 
like if it's flat here , so it sits up . 
Like that . 
I g 
If it's weighted maybe . 
<laugh> Details , details . <other> 
Okay . So , is this a good-looking remote ? <other> 
Would we wanna show it off to our friends ? <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah ? 
I mean I gue yeah , it's personal taste , 
but  
Yeah . 
Okay , so should we say two for that ? 
Yeah ? 
Okay . 
Uh , question number five . 
What's um  
will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? 
Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah it  the marketing will have a lot to do with it . 
<laugh> Shake it and the buttons fall off . <laugh> 
No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , 
but  
I know I am , aren't I ? 
But you don't have to buy batteries . 
So in the long term this can actually save you money . 
So we'll market it that way too . 
So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it'll  
Yeah . 
Okay number six . 
Can someone read it out ? 
Or  
Um yeah . 
So that was mainly that the statistics  
we said  
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
Yeah 
I guess the  I think the key word there is average , 
'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . 
But they're not you and I really . 
So . 
Okay so one ? 
Okay . 
Number seven . 
C Heather could you push it down ? 
Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? 
Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . 
Now is there the  
is the alarm system still  was it implemented ? 
<other> 
<cough> 
<laugh> It turns into a duck and starts quacking . 
Here I am . 
<laugh> Um  
Okay . 
We  
oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype . 
But yeah , it'll be there . 
So we can  we could say that  
We can give it a one , 
because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . 
Okay . Um  
Question number eight . 
Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? 
Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . 
So it has to be  
yeah , 
it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . 
The plus thing needs to be worked on . 
Yeah . 
Well  
Do  
Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an  just an enter button ? 
So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least . 
 
You could just press six enter , 
or one two enter . 
Yeah . 
Um , okay so we can <other>  
we'll say yes it's uh one ? 
Okay . 
Question number nine . 
Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , 
which was repeated strain injury ? 
Um , which affected over a quarter of users . 
S 
It's soft , 
and  
And people could  
Mm-hmm . 
I don't know what other options there are . 
Could  
I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . 
But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard . 
So , I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control . 
So , one or two do you think ? 
Two okay . 
Okay number ten . 
Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? 
Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ? 
Is the yellow  
Mm-hmm . 
It sounds like the colour's something that we  
But I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though , 
depending on the  
So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the R_R_ . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
And the buttons in the middle . 
Okay 
So , do you think that's more of a three then ? 
Three , four ? 
Four ? 
Well we have good reasons for it , 
so we  but we can still put a 
a four ? 
Okay , 
and final question . 
<other> Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? 
Current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
No , uh , are the plates interchangeable ? 
I think I missed a few  
they are ? 
So you can have banana and kiwi and  
okay . 
Okay , so that's something that's kind of in the making too , 
like maybe it'll become more  
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yes we do . 
So I  wh what was I gonna put for that ? 
A two for fashion ? 
Okay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven 
is  
Between  
okay . 
<laugh> Um . 
Yeah , that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one . 
Does that seem right then ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Sorry . 
Are you gonna do that ? 
Okay . 
Oh is it locked 'cause I'm in it ? 
Or  
okay . 
Mm . 'S good . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah 
and the conceptual and functional . 
Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess , but m 
When we can down to it . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah <other> . 
<laugh> Good leadership , I think we stayed on task . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
And the timing was good . 
We never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so  
<laugh> 
<other> Was good teamwork . 
I think we are well-suited to our roles . 
<laugh> 
Oh really ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
The computer programmes are good . 
The  
Yeah . 
I don't think there was anything  
<other> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
They'll probably still be there . 
Um  
I'm not sure , new ideas found . 
Yeah well I guess we really  it  we bounced off of each other , 
which was cool . 
Like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and  
yeah , worked well . 
Mm-hmm . 
Oh does it have smart materials by the way ? 
Does it have smart materials ? 
Oh yeah . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> By watching T_V_ ? <laugh> 
Mm . 
Conclusion ? Dadada .
