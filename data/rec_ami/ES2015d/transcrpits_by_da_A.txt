Okay . 
Here we go . 
Alright , 
the agenda for thi 
oh . 
Alright . 
Um the agenda for this meeting <other> is um  we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . 
And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave gave it . 
And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . 
I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . 
And um evaluate the product , as a group . 
And um  
So first we'll have the prototype presentation . 
Do you need the um PowerPoint for this ? 
Alright . 
On ? 
<laugh> A mango . 
Okay . 
Oh . Okay . 
Oops . 
Yeah . 
Notice you have a number ten button . 
<laugh> Okay . <laugh> 
<laugh> No problem . 
<laugh> Ah . 
Oh . 
You press a plus button ? 
Oh okay . 
I've never heard of that kind before . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Oh . 
I 
But  
Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ? 
Yeah 
but I mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away . 
'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards . 
Yeah I know , 
but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ? 
I th 
Um  
Yeah it wouldn't be a problem . 
But I was just wondering 
like as long as we realise that's what it'll do . 
Yeah . 
C_ and V_ . 
Right , 
where um where's the power button ? 
Oh okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Oh okay . 
Yeah . 
Ergonomic , definitely ergonomic . 
<laugh> 
The spon yeah . 
Yeah . 
Bit of a stress ball feel . 
Yes . I would . 
My goodness . 
<laugh> There you go . 
Genevieve ? 
Yeah . <laugh> 
And something hmm . <laugh> 
Oh right . 
Yeah . 
It looks more  
Think like vanilla and banana would . 
Okay yeah . 
<laugh> 
Kinda Christmas , you know . 
Yeah . 
Cool . 
<laugh> 
Alright , 
thank you very much . 
Good work everyone . 
Alright . 
And so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances 
and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle . 
So , I have 
something I'm going to  
Oh wait a minute . 
Do you need to do a presentation first ? 
Yeah . 
I'm gonna check that out for a second . 
What time is it anyw 
Oh yeah 
sorry 
you're right . 
Evaluation criteria is next in line . 
Yeah . 
Just press um function eight again . 
And then again I think . 
One more time . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Ooh . 
Yeah . 
The look is a little bit more playful . 
Oh definitely different yeah . 
Oh you were only given red and black ? 
Oh okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
It's mango . <laugh> 
It's mango . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
I would say two . Personally . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I'd say maybe three . 
Yeah we want it simple . 
Yeah . 
I think so . Yeah . 
Yeah . One . 
Th 
The plus number thing . 
Yeah colour will definitely be a factor . 
I think that the logo could be smaller . 
And maybe not such a prominent way . 
Maybe like at the bottom , kind of . 
Oh it just had to be on there I guess . 
<laugh> 
I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand . 
Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , 
and then the rest is like 
round . 
It would still be comfortable I think . 
We c we could handle it I think . 
Ah it'd fall over all the time though . 
It'd be annoying . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 'Kay we're done designing . 
<laugh> Come on . 
I think , it was another colour and it was like  I think it'd look okay . 
I think maybe a two . 
Sure . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Durable . <laugh> 
But you're our Marketing Expert . <laugh> 
Oh . Exactly . Exactly . 
Yeah . 
I would give it a two still though . 
Mm . 
Oh yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
We have the alarm system . 
I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up . 
Or or was it gonna make a noise ? 
You press the button it makes a noise 
right ? 
Yeah . Awesome . Awesome . 
I though w it was gonna make a noise . 
Okay . 
Oh okay . 
Whoo . Okay . 
Yeah , totally . 
No problem , mm . 
Totally . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
so it's just like channel six , six , enter . 
Yeah but you don't have to press zeros . 
And then like twelve , enter . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
I think so . 
It's like right in the  
Your thumb might get a little bit uh  
Yeah . 
But it is soft . 
And that's kind of what the um 
the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_ , 
so  maybe it is but  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yes we did . 
Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . 
So it could be grey on the banana one . 
Yeah . 
Mm , yeah . 
Hum . 
I would say so . 
But maybe more like two 
'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just sort of naming it by a fruit . 
With the with the colours . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
That's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates . 
Be like  
Yeah . 
Maybe if it was scented . 
<laugh> Yeah we have money for that . Um  
<other> Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ? 
Oh . 
I would say two . 
One point nine or something ? 
<laugh> I don't know these things . 
Um , between one and two . 
Alright . 
Yeah . 
I'm attempting to do that <laugh> right now . 
Yeah it is one point nine . 
Ooh . 
Go Heather Pauls . 
Yeah . 
<other> Alright , now with that over and done with , our next step is to see if we are under budget . 
And um my computer's frozen . 
And now it's not . 
Okay . So 
um in our shared folder , 
if everyone could go there right now , um 
I'm going to um steal a cable . 
Um it's it's um 
it's an Excel file . 
Oh . 
Yeah . 
'Kay there we go . 
Um , production costs . 
And um I have to access that as well . 
One moment . <whistles> 
'Kay so far I've added what I think  
or what is going on ? 
Great . 
It's blinking at me . 
It's locked for editing . 
Read only . 
I'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing . 
I have the original in my um my email account . 
I dunno . 
No . 
No , I was hoping that you guys could . 
Um , there we go . 
Okay here we go . 
So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing . 
So um if you can look up at the screen , 
um the large screen , 
oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think . 
Okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros . 
Um we're using a regular chip . 
Um , it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around . 
That's another three . 
We're already at five . 
Um , we're using plastic and rubber , 
so  
Good thing plastic is free , 
we're at eight . Um  
S 
Yeah . 
I guess we should do it just for one kind . 
So it's like special colour  well we'll have two colours 
right ? 
Well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons . 
So we can  
Um , we have push button interface , so that's inexpensive . 
And um we have a special colour for the button , and we also have a special form . 
And a special material . 
Which puts us just barely under budget . 
Hurray . 
Yeah . Good work guys . 
So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros . 
Awesome . 
And back to our PowerPoint . 
So we've  
'Kay . 
Yes we are . 
So we need to do a product evaluation , again , 
which is probably um  
I dunno . 
A different extension of a  
Hmm . 
Yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership , teamwork . 
Yeah . 
Alright so um  
Do you guys feel like there was room for creativity ? 
Pushed for creativity ? 
Ye Okay . 
So it'd be like need more time and materials . 
But you were allowed m creativity ? 
I think so as like  but you were supposed to have creativ 
Right . 
Right 
Okay 
Great . 
Leadership ? 
Is this me being like , guys do you like me ? Um . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Oop  
Okay . 
Teamwork ? 
I think we worked great as a team . 
Yeah ? 
Alright how were our means ? 
We needed more Play Doh colours . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> But ever everything else was satisfactory ? 
Is that good  
<laugh> 
Yeah ? 
<laugh> 
New ideas found . 
I don't really know what that means . 
Hmm ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Each other's  
Mm . 
<sings> Okay ? 
Well with that achieved , our last slide is our closing slide . 
Yes our costs are within budget . 
It's evaluated generally positively . 
And um don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . 
Then we celebrate 
in such a way that I have no idea . 
Alright ? 
Okay , bye . <laugh>
