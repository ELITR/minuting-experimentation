<cough> 
<other> Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? 
<laugh> Can I get a cup of coffee ? 
Okay . <laugh> 
 
Well , 
during my work I have no time either . 
So  <laugh> 
I think so too . 
<laugh> 
It is . 
It is . 
Yes . 
<cough> Okay . 
<cough> Excuse me . <laugh> 
Um  Okay , 
it's still the right thing . 
Okay . Um well , 
there are some changes in the design requirements , 
so there are some changes in the method also . 
Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . 
And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . 
Well , 
I th 
I tried to uh implement a picture here , 
but it's hardly readable . 
Can you see it ? 
No ? 
Well  Um , 
there's a energy source here . 
<other> And um basically 
there  
it's connected to three things . 
The user interface connected to a chip , 
which is connected to the sender , 
which generates messages using uh infrared light , 
which are sent to the receiver . 
That's basically the idea . 
And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . <other> 
Okay . Um 
what have I found . 
Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . 
That's all . 
It's cased together , nothing more than that . <other> 
It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . 
There are some exceptions , 
but most of all have uh infrared controls . 
And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . 
And I think that's what we w 
yes . 
In the  
and it's a little more  a little bit more fancy also . 
So maybe we should consider that . <other> 
Okay . 
I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . 
Um basically this is all there is . 
There's just one chip . 
There are a few buttons connected . 
Uh the buttons are lit . 
And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , 
and there is not a power source here . 
<cough> So 
that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment . 
There's nothing more to it . 
It's fairly easy . 
It's been done many times before , 
and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . 
So  <other> Okay , so uh 
personally I think we should infra use infrared , 
because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . 
So I think that uh should be clear . 
Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . 
Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components 
which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . 
And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them . 
<other> Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , 
um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment . 
And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . 
I think our uh users will really uh will really like that . 
No , 
they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also . 
So we can use them . 
So that's no problem . 
Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , 
but by uh um um making  
We can we can make its I think . 
Okay . 
Hmm . 
Yes . Well , 
it's not one light , 
it  
there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . 
No no no , no . That's right , that's right . 
So  well , 
this uh should be it . 
<other> Um have a think about it . 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Or a find  a finding function , 
you know . 
That's quite a  
yes . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
Yes , we should focus on that , I guess . 
Well , 
the technical uh  there  
I think there are no technical difficulties . 
There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . 
So um 
I don't think we have any hiccups there . 
So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . 
So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal . 
Well 
Yes . <laugh> Th that's a bit of  that's a problem . 
Usually  
Oh yes . 
Yes . Well , 
there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . 
Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . 
You press it 
and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , 
and your uh remote controls then start to beep . 
Yes . Yes , that's it . Yes , same thing . 
And um  
No , 
so we we should use something else . 
We do not control the T_V_ set so well . 
Yes , m yes . 
S 
and we b we want  to make so it's   is easy as possible for our customers , 
so we should think about  
<other> It's quite complicated . 
Well , 
it's quite complicated . 
Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds . 
Yes , yes . 
Well , basically 
the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , 
which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time . 
But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . 
Yes , 
so we don't want that . 
Maybe we can  
Something like that . 
Well , 
is there not something f something more easily  
Well , 
I don't think uh  . 
No , 
and y the 
the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh  . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself , 
uh we should use something like that . 
so 
w we should use have  
You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . 
Yes , something like that . 
But that will be very costly , I think . 
So that's not a good idea . 
Mm-hmm . 
I will . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated 
um and it will become more costly also . 
Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . 
And there are some implepe imp 
Well , 
I I think so , 
because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . 
So  
<laugh> Okay . <laugh> 
No , no . 
So 
that's out of the question . 
So  
I think also . 
Yes . Well , 
we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions 
and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface 
and  
Yeah , that's right . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
Well , 
is it  
maybe there's another possibility . 
You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , 
uh because it has many functions . 
Maybe it's more important to make the  make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , 
but um nevertheless  
Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
Ok like that . 
Well , 
I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . 
I don't know if if it's user-friendly . 
That's your field of expertise . 
Mm-hmm . 
There's  no , but there's no way to do that , 
because we cannot implement that kind of the system . 
W 
Mm-hmm . 
Well , 
maybe we can use a light for that . 
When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . 
So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . 
Something like that . 
Yes . 
yeah , something like that . 
Oh 
It's not really a stick , 
but  
Yes . Yes . 
Hmm . 
Yes , yes . 
And  
Yes , 
and this also looks more fancy , I think . 
I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think . 
But you're the marketing man . 
<laugh> 
Okay , that's good . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Okay . 
Okay . 
Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ? 
Okay . Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yes . 
Change . 
Yes , yes . 
Yes . 
<laugh> Well  <laugh> 
you're the secretary . <laugh> 
Mm okay , 
but make a s make a sub-folder for it , 
because it's starting to fill up already . <laugh> 
<laugh> Sure . <laugh> 
 . <laugh> 
Yes , that's important . 
Well , 
are are you sure ? 
I'm not so sure . 
Well , 
that's complicated , 
but is that so relevant ? 
Because I don't think  
but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so . 
Okay , 
I can imagine when 
I can imagine when you're  when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . 
But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh    you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough . 
Well , 
but how how often do you watch all these channels ? 
No , you're probably right . 
Okay . 
But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . 
Don't you think ? 
Okay . 
Well , 
The design . 
y 
then there should be  should done  be done something specific with it . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay , 
so you can experiment by  uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . 
Okay . 
Well , 
maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . 
So um 
when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . 
And it's very easy uh to find your remote control . 
So maybe that's a possibility , 
but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . 
But maybe when we uh  
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Okay , okay . 
Okay . 
Well . 
I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that . 
Yes . 
Well , 
the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . 
It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button  uh remote control function . 
So that's that's a big advantage , I think . 
There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . 
Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . 
So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries . 
But maybe can  we we can think something smart about it . 
There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . 
So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . 
You have to do nothing for it . 
<laugh> Maybe , maybe not . 
I'll have to find that out . 
Yes . 
So  
No , 
that's very cheap . 
It's  
Oh , 
it's very cheap . 
That's no problem . 
It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts . 
It's  
Yes , 
but they're they're mass production . 
They're very cheap . 
So it will cost us p practically nothing . 
<cough> 
Yeah . 
Profitable . 
Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . Um 
so uh basically 
we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . 
So 
on the outside it looks easy , 
but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . 
So that's one  the  
those are the choices we have to make . 
But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that  these kinds of things . 
Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . 
Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , 
and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , 
which uh I think our customers will like . 
The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving . 
Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not  do not implement these buttons . 
<other> If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . 
So that's another  
well , 
it wa it w 
it was an issue , 
but we also thought that  
we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . 
And this even uh makes it more cheapy . 
Mm-hmm . 
The circuit board . 
The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . 
And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . 
So that's that's another advantage . 
So  
Yes , 
because I don't know  
Yes . 
I d 
I really don't know . 
So  
It can be costly . 
Maybe not . 
Yes . 
Yes , 
I al I 
I hope my personal coach will uh <laugh> have a lo uh look at it . <laugh> 
How nice . 
Well , 
we understand . <laugh> 
Well  <other> 
Mm yes . 
So we drop the voice recognition ? 
Or  
Oh . 
Okay . 
Well um 
do we really have to decide now 
or can we decide next meeting ? 
Okay . 
Because I'll have some updated info on that uh  
Adapt . 
We can have the lunch .
