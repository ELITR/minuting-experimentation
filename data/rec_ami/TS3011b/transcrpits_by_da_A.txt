Welcome back . 
Uh let me see . 
Okay . 
Roo , welcome back . 
The waiting is for Sebastian . 
There he is . 
Sorry ? 
Uh no . You can't , 
sorry . 
<laugh> Well , 
this is life . <laugh> 
Sorry 
uh , Roo . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
People , welcome back with the second meeting . 
<other> Um for now on the schedule are a few points . 
Uh first of all the opening , 
which we are doing now . 
Um second , I received um some new project requirements . 
I'm not sure if you received them as well , 
um but I will tell you about it . 
Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation , I think ? 
Sebastian ? 
Roo ? 
Ruud ? 
Almost , okay . 
Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last . 
Um the top goal of this m 
<other> Um we will figure that out . 
Yeah , 
w we will see . 
Ca <other> can you try to  
Um  it is , yeah . Yeah . 
Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , 
so keep that in mind . Um 
<other> we have forty minutes . 
So 
it's now  
Yep . Okay . Um 
the new project requirements , 
first of all , um we didn't speak about it , 
but we should not um support teletext in the remote , 
um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date 
and internet is replacing teletext . 
So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product . 
<other> It's a board decision . 
Um the remote control should only be used for television , 
because it's not uh f uh feasible , 
it's not uh w 
uh uh  we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with . 
Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , 
<other> which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . 
Because the product should um be uh interesting 
and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um 
<other> then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . 
So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product . 
Is that clear ? 
Any questions on these requirements ? 
No ? 
<other> Okay . 
Um the individual presentations , 
I th 
um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? 
Uh uh yeah . Okay , 
great . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Uh-huh . 
Okay . 
Uh Ruud , did you get that ? 
Okay , so 
the important thing here is  
In the market , 
yeah . 
Yeah , okay , 
w we will s we all uh  
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Sebastian . 
No , it's not visible . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
So it's fairly easy . 
<laugh> Okay . 
Okay , 
good . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay , 
Ruud . 
Okay well , 
we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product . 
So any income is welcome . <laugh> Input . 
Okay . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Well , 
that's interesting . 
Yeah , 
that's definitely interesting . 
It uh it separates our product from others uh as well . 
Okay , 
go on . 
Okay . So 
that's what the market tells us . 
Yep . Okay . 
Yep . 
Well 
maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , 
like um turning on and off the the the lights . 
Reports rep respend response to it . 
But uh th 
Yeah , 
because we do not have a a a a a home um  
So 
Okay . 
what about the clapping technique ? 
Um because you se 
Well , 
you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh  
Yeah , a peak . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that's true . 
Well uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . 
Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution , 
because that's his  his field of expertise . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yep . 
Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . 
It's a different  
exactly . It's an uni an unique feature , 
and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and  probably more i interesting than uh than the lights . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well , um 
according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often . 
So  
Okay . 
Okay . <laugh> 
Well , 
we we do have a wise board , 
so I'm not questioning that . <laugh> 
Okay , so 
Yeah . 
on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext . 
Well , 
we skip that . 
Okay . 
No . 
Yeah . 
Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one . 
No . 
Yeah . 
Okay , 
Ruud , how do you feel about that ? 
Uh do you agree , 
do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm yeah . 
Okay , so 
this is is kind of uh  
Yeah . 
But but are we not in in the in the manual uh  
I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh 
But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? 
Because we do not implement uh a user history . 
I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um  
Yeah . 
Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions . 
Yeah , 
draw draw it on the board . 
Yeah , it can break down . 
Uh-huh . <laugh> 
Okay , yeah . 
Okay , 
but w we still <laugh> we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . 
Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . 
Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . 
We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness . 
Um well , 
for  
we do have to uh decide this this meeting . 
Yeah . 
We need to um have the uh the user function  uh the functions decided and um <other> uh our target audience . 
Um well , 
I do not want a full 
uh  it's not necessary to to have a full list , 
but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting . 
Well , 
for example , that that's what we should think about . 
 l 
how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but  
Yeah . 
A bit of a split mode . 
Uh l like  Yeah . 
Dual channel watch . 
Okay , well um 
m maybe I should write that down . <laugh> 
Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ? 
Mielsen , 
because I I was writing it down in the last uh  
Mielsen . 
Right . Um 
I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . 
So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um  
Yeah , 
that's that's  
if you want to do it , Sebastian . <laugh> 
Okay , um  <other> Okay , so so um  <other> uh  
Volume . 
Programme . 
Uh dual channel . Uh  
And and do we want um the ten digits ? 
Yeah . 
I agree actually . <laugh> 
But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels . 
Often . 
Well , 
it depends on the on the on the looks , 
on the on the  
You c <other> you can d make them very fancy 
by um  
<other> I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones 
and it still looks very fancy . 
So I'm I'm  I do not agree  
Exactly , exactly . 
Okay , 
speech . 
Yeah . 
To find  
yeah . 
Uh  If if we would um drop the ten digits 
but keep the programme and the volume , 
because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um  
Yeah . 
But we do focus on younger people . 
We d it 
it's a board uh decision . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay , g good . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Yep . 
Okay . 
But  But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ? 
Because it seems like a very  <laugh> 
Is a cradle very cheap ? 
I know , 
b uh but there should be an adapter as well . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um 
<other> I would like to hear um  maybe 
maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , 
yeah , 
but that are important . 
Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . 
Uh are there other things about the market we should know ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay , so 
although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh  Profitable . We we  yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people . 
Okay . 
O okay . <other> Um 
Roo . 
  Nothing to add . 
Sebastian ? 
Yeah ? Great . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Yeah , 
and that was the main issue , 
right ? 
The the board  
Yeah . 
The board . 
No , 
it's th 
yeah . 
It's the other way around , 
yeah . 
It shouldn't be a big issue . 
Okay . 
I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs , 
I will have a look at it . 
Maybe you will get some information on that . 
Um I'm not sure how how that  
Yep . 
Okay , great . 
Um <other> well , 
I think we're qui quite done . 
Um for now we will have the lunch break . 
Um I'm  don't know how long the break will be , 
but we'll find out . 
Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , 
uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it . 
Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . 
If you want to look at it um well , just do . 
Um <other> the Interface Designer , um I would like to  the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept . 
Uh  I'm sorry , 
yeah , 
I'm sorry . 
User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept . 
And um 
Well , 
i it should be easy , 
that's w w what we concluded . 
It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um <other> um yeah , some some fancy lights . 
I think that's what we decided . 
No no no , we didn't  
but it shouldn't be integrated  
yeah , 
it's  of course it's user interface , 
but um i I was talking about really the design of the  
No . 
We can decide the next meeting . Yep . 
Yeah . 
I guess all of you have i updated info . 
I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching . 
And I'm sure the market will um uh <other>  uh will change , adapt 
and um so 
we will see that . 
Um yeah , 
that's it for now . 
Any other questions 
or can we have the lunch ? 
Yeah , okay . 
Good .
