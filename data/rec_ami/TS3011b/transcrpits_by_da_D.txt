Hello . 
Almost . <laugh> 
Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the  . 
Uh okay . 
Yeah , uh b uh most . 
<laugh> 
Oh , 
user-friendly . 
<laugh> 
Well 
you could only lit uh the buttons  the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching . 
Or  
Hmm , true . 
<cough> 
Oh , mine is already outdated . 
<laugh> Since uh  
Okay , 
make  
Well  Uh 
then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units . 
Of   of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million . 
But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , 
I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . 
But uh since uh the requirements changed , 
that's uh not a good idea . 
Uh well , 
skip this . <laugh> 
Well , 
it's  
this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . 
The buttons to zap are used the  about uh fifteen hundred times , 
when uh the power button is only used one time . 
And the volume button's only four times . 
So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . 
And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . 
So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones . 
Or  
Yeah . 
Well , 
I just said that . 
And uh  well , 
this obvious , 
and he also said it . 
Uh that's about it , yes . 
Uh mo uh zap buttons most . 
Volume , they are  uh use a lot . But more than all the other buttons . So  
Yeah , that's uh  <laugh> a problem . Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
And you  
Yeah , 
and usually  
And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ , 
and it's  
<laugh> And b 
So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here . 
Well , t uh 
we won't support teletext 
which which was the third-most  the second-most used function . 
<laugh> 
Uh well  yeah , 
channel selection is obviously the most important . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
So  
So  
Nope . 
Uh well 
if we um include other uh innovative functions  <laugh> uh then they uh might , 
'cause young people uh like new features . 
So  
And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button . 
Yeah . 
A younger uh  Huh . 
And it's also quite easy to use , 
so it'll  it  uh attract younger people because well new , 
and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . 
<laugh> 
Mielsen . 
Yeah . 
Well , 
if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . 
Well  
But  
Yeah , 
and if if we  
And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . 
So  
Well  
And  
And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . 
Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , 
but it would be a solution uh for  
Yeah . 
Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . 
So then we should implement such a but 
Yes . 
M <cough> 
And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem . 
'Cause when  
Yeah . 
Um I think we dealt with the most important information . 
Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to . 
So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people . 
But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . 
So  I don't think that's a big problem 
Yes . Yeah , profitable . 
Yes . 
Hmm . 
Left . 
Hmm . 
Yeah .
