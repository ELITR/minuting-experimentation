Hello . 
There's one of mine . 
Hello , Flores . 
 . 
We have a slight problem . 
<laugh> I opened uh the C_D_ ROM box uh guys . 
So 
just cancel it . 
Yeah , 
I opened the C_D_ ROM box . <laugh> Accidentally . 
But it's alright . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . 
Okay . 
I don't think it's wireless here . 
Or it is . 
Yeah ? 
Okay , great . 
Yeah . 
Time , yeah . 
Yes . 
Yeah , I'll start . 
Um  Oh , 
how can I uh  
Geez , 
and sli and show . 
Um  Just uh press it . 
Uh yes . 
Alright . Um well 
w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . 
<other> Uh the method of the remote control is just  
the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . 
So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do . 
Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , 
the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion . 
And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . 
<other> Um but um  yeah . 
My personal preferences were ease of uh  the easy to use remote control , 
because uh the user-friendliness and uh  it can be more trendy in in user design . 
But um your new goal f was for uh people than  less than forty years old . 
So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . 
But it should b I think it should be a combination , 
but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . 
So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . 
But my  in  my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us . 
Yeah . 
<other> And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic . 
Yeah , 
what what does the market want ? 
I I don't know . 
Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control . 
<laugh> Scusi . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Energies and uh  
Yeah . 
The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed . 
<laugh> Succeed in it also . 
<laugh> And what's the um  
if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy 
or  
Okay . 
For the same costs , 
it's can be uh in our  
Combined with the low-cost circuit board 
so it's uh  
Yeah . 
But I think  
Yeah , 
I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , 
and not for  
Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think . 
Could you step a little bit more to the right ? <laugh> 
Yeah , 
thank you . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Sound signal . 
Yeah . 
The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used . 
So  
Yeah , well 
it should just have a design  The perfect design for those  only those buttons . 
And first um  
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
the sound signal . 
Just one thing 
I'm just wondering , <laugh> the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? 
<laugh> Another device is not a solution . 
It should be uh uh  
Yeah , 
but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it . 
just like uh the phones 
the  
Yeah , 
But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons . Uh  
But I believe you will have an  
I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us . 
But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something . 
Well 
if you lost th 
I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the  their remote . 
Uh that's just uh  
 just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility . 
Yeah . 
And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ? 
It's a unique item uh  
It will be an  a unique feature of our remote control . 
Yeah . 
And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um <other> an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . 
What should we choose in in design ? 
Well , the extra functions . 
Used option . 
<laugh> 
Well , 
so it just th the basic functions . 
And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff . 
So  <other> 
Yeah . 
Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it . 
So  
Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . 
Yeah , 
I don't know yet . <laugh> 
But does it  uh I 
then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round 
m 
well , 
should we just use a  
Um it's already uh  
oh , we have a blank . 
Oh . 
It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what  which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . 
A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down 
or uh 
just a round uh button should be the trick , I think . 
Yeah . 
Geez . 
Well , 
volume and something uh like that . <laugh> 
The programme up and down . <laugh> 
And the vol 
yeah , 
the pen doesn't uh really does what I want . 
But I think our our next step to look at is just that . 
So I don't think it's  um we have something to do . 
Uh we can't discuss it right now , 
because n no one of us have  has the information to discuss about that , I think . 
Yes ? 
Mm-hmm . 
but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . 
'Kay , 
The ten digits . 
Oh , 
and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change 
 yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Alright . 
<laugh> Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh  
<laugh>   
The ten digits ? 
Yeah , I believe so . 
Yeah . 
I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits . 
Uh and I think the most  
Just elder elder people would would buy it , 
but  
Yep . 
The older people only use five of them . 
Yeah . 
On the design . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So 
we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition . 
Mm-hmm . 
<sigh> 
<laugh> Twelve dollar fifty . <laugh> 
I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think . 
But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ? 
The circuit board . 
The fewer buttons you can use on it . 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah . 
Well 
it  
then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh  especially for the voice recognition . 
No . 
<laugh> 
We're done , I think . 
Me neither . 
Interface  industrial . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Uh the only problem is it  that it depends on the divisions  the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes . About the voice recognition . 
Well  
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Adapt . 
That's it . 
'Kay . 
I'll take the lunch .
