A:  Welcome back . 
B:  Hello . 
D:  Hello . 
A:  Uh let me see . 
B:  There's one of mine . 
A:  Okay . Roo , welcome back . 
B:  Hello , Flores . 
A:  The waiting is for Sebastian . 
C:  <cough> 
B:   . 
A:  There he is . 
C:  <other> Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? <laugh> Can I get a cup of coffee ? Okay . <laugh> 
B:  We have a slight problem . <laugh> I opened uh the C_D_ ROM box uh guys . 
A:  Sorry ? Uh no . You can't , sorry . 
B:  So just cancel it . 
C:   Well , during my work I have no time either . So  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Well , this is life . <laugh> Sorry uh , Roo . 
B:  Yeah , I opened the C_D_ ROM box . <laugh> Accidentally . But it's alright . 
A:  Okay . Okay . People , welcome back with the second meeting . <other> Um for now on the schedule are a few points . Uh first of all the opening , which we are doing now . Um second , I received um some new project requirements . I'm not sure if you received them as well , um but I will tell you about it . Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  I think so too . 
A:  Roo ? 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Ruud ? Almost , okay . Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last . Um the top goal of this m 
D:  Almost . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . 
A:  <other> Um we will figure that out . Ca <other> can you try to  
B:  Okay . 
D:  Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the  . 
A:  Yeah , w we will see . 
B:  I don't think it's wireless here . Or it is . Yeah ? Okay , great . 
A:  Um  it is , yeah . 
C:  It is . It is . 
D:  Uh okay . 
A:  Yeah . Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . Um <other> we have forty minutes . So it's now  


A:  Yep . Okay . Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product . <other> It's a board decision . Um the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not uh f uh feasible , it's not uh w uh uh  we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with . Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , <other> which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um 
B:  Yeah . Time , yeah . 
A:  <other> then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product . 
B:  Yes . 
A:  Is that clear ? Any questions on these requirements ? No ? <other> Okay . 


A:  Um the individual presentations , I th um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? 
B:  Yeah , I'll start . 
A:  Uh uh yeah . Okay , great . 
C:  Yes . 
B:  Um  Oh , how can I uh  Geez , and sli and show . Um  
A:  <other> 
B:  Just uh press it . Uh yes . Alright . Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . <other> Uh the method of the remote control is just  the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do . Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion . And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . 
A:  Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
B:  <other> Um but um  yeah . My personal preferences were ease of uh  the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh  it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than  less than forty years old . So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh 
A:  Uh-huh . 
B:  take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my  in  my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us . 
A:  Okay . Uh Ruud , did you get that ? 
D:  Yeah , uh b uh most . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay , so the important thing here is  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic . Yeah , what what does the market want ? I I don't know . 
D:  Oh , user-friendly . 
A:  In the market , yeah . Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh  
B:  Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control . 
A:  Yeah . Okay . 


A:  Sebastian . 
C:  <cough> Okay . <cough> Excuse me . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Scusi . <laugh> 
C:  Um  Okay , it's still the right thing . Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here , but it's hardly readable . 
B:  <laugh> Energies and uh  
C:  Can you see it ? No ? Well  
A:  No , it's not visible . 
B:  Yeah . The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed . 
A:  Yeah . Okay . 
C:  <cough> So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment . There's nothing more to it . It's fairly easy . It's been done many times before , and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . So  
A:  So it's fairly easy . 
B:  <laugh> Succeed in it also . 
A:  <laugh> Okay . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay , good . 
A:  Yeah . 


A:  Okay , Ruud . 
D:  Oh , mine is already outdated . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay well , we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product . 
D:  <laugh> Since uh  
C:  <cough> 
A:  So any income is welcome . <laugh> Input . 
D:  Okay , make  Well  Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units . Of   of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million . 
B:  Could you step a little bit more to the right ? <laugh> Yeah , thank you . <laugh> 
A:  Okay . 
D:  But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh well , skip this . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Well , it's  this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the  about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . 
C:  Mm . 
D:  Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones . Or  
A:  Okay . Well , that's interesting . 
C:  Or a find  a finding function , you know . That's quite a  yes . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , that's definitely interesting . It uh it separates our product from others uh as well . Okay , go on . 
B:  Sound signal . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yes . 
D:  Well , I just said that . And uh  well , this obvious , and he also said it . 
A:  Okay . So that's what the market tells us . 
D:  Uh that's about it , yes . 
A:  Yep . Okay . 


B:  The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used . So  
D:  Uh mo uh zap buttons most . Volume , they are  uh use a lot . But 
B:  Yeah , well it should just have a design  
D:  more than all the other buttons . So  
B:  The perfect design for those  only those buttons . And first um  
C:  Yes . Yes , we should focus on that , I guess . Well , the technical uh  there  I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yep . 
A:  Okay . We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um <other> I would like to hear um  maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important . Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . Uh are there other things about the market we should know ? 
D:  Um I think we dealt with the most important information . Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to . So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people . But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . So  
C:  <cough> 
A:  Okay . Okay . 
D:  I don't think that's a big problem 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay , so although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh  
D:  Yes . Yeah , profitable . 
C:  Profitable . 
A:  Profitable . We we  yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people . Okay . O okay . 
D:  Yes . 
A:  <other> Um Roo . 
B:  I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think . 
A:    Nothing to add . Sebastian ? 


C:  Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . Um 
A:  Yeah ? Great . 
C:  so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . So that's one  the  those are the choices we have to make . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that  these kinds of things . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
C:  Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving . Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not  do not implement these buttons . 
A:  Yep . 
C:  <other> If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another  well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that  we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . And this even uh makes it more cheapy . So  
A:  Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board  Yeah . 
B:  But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ? The circuit board . 
C:  Mm-hmm . The circuit board . 
A:  The board . 
B:  The fewer buttons you can use on it . 
C:  The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . 
A:  No , it's th yeah . 
B:  Yeah , okay . 
A:  It's the other way around , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . So that's that's another advantage . 
A:  It shouldn't be a big issue . 
B:  Well it  then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh  especially for the voice recognition . 
C:  So  Yes , because I don't know  Yes . I d I really don't know . So  
B:  No . 
C:  It can be costly . Maybe not . 
A:  Okay . I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs , I will have a look at it . Maybe you will get some information on that . Um I'm not sure how how that  
C:  Yes . Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will uh <laugh> have a lo uh look at it . <laugh> 
A:  Yep . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay , great . Um <other> well , I think we're qui quite done . Um for now we will have the lunch break . 
B:  We're done , I think . 
C:  How nice . 
A:  Um I'm  don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it . Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . If you want to look at it um well , just do . Um <other> the Interface Designer , um I would like to  the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept . Uh Roo , um from you I would like to see  
B:  Me neither . Interface  industrial . 
A:  Uh  I'm sorry , yeah , I'm sorry . User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept . And um 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Well , we understand . <laugh> 
B:  Uh the only problem is it  that it depends on the divisions  the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes . About the voice recognition . Well  
C:  Well  <other> 
A:  Well , i it should be easy , that's w w what we concluded . It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um 
C:  Mm yes . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> um yeah , some some fancy lights . I think that's what we decided . 
C:  So we drop the voice recognition ? Or  Oh . 
A:  No no no , we didn't  but it shouldn't be integrated  yeah , it's  of course it's user interface , but um i I was talking about really the design of the  
C:  Okay . Well um do we really have to decide now or can we decide next meeting ? 
A:  No . We can decide the next meeting . Yep . 
C:  Okay . Because I'll have some updated info on that uh  
A:  Yeah . I guess all of you have i updated info . I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching . And I'm sure the market will um uh <other> 
B:  Yep . 
D:  Hmm . 
A:   uh will change , adapt and um so we will see that . Um yeah , that's it for now . 
B:  Adapt . 
C:  Adapt . 
D:  Left . Hmm . 
B:  That's it . 'Kay . 
A:  Any other questions or can we have the lunch ? 
C:  We can have the lunch . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , okay . Good . 
B:  I'll take the lunch . <sound imitating computer alert>
