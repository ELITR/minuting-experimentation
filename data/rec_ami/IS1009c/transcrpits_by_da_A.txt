Okay . 
Hello everyone . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Um how uh how we doing ? 
Uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . 
Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working , 
meaning gathering i suggestions 
from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the  within the budget uh that was given . 
Uh in general <other> the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . 
Um it's also an item that people lose a lot . 
So we should address that . 
And , of course , it should be something s s that is very simple to use . 
In addition to that to make it sell , of course , uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive , 
or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another 
so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's a very important fact , 
'cause um if they say , well , I go home and think about it , that won't work . 
Um also mentioned was it should be uh  it should have a very short learning curve . 
And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan . 
<other> Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip 
that has infra-red bits 
and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip . 
Therefore , messages uh will be controlled in the same manner . 
There should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep . If too many buttons are pressed , 
mm uh uh child lock 
um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um  you could see the time , you know , what show they want to watch . 
Also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes . 
So the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , 
and maybe some kind of a holder uh for the for the uh item . 
Francino who is our um 
interface designer um uh has mentioned that the  that it , of course , should have an on-off button , 
and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock . 
Particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable . 
It should be compact . 
Her personal favourite was it should be T-shaped . 
And maybe have an anar alarm-clock . 
And the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature . 
Uh the different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio-waves . 
Uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature . 
And <other> even possibly a timer to  so that people can program <laugh> their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote .
