Hi . 
<other> 
<other> 
<laugh> <cough> 
Yeah , I think that pretty much is it . Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
<other> 
<other> 
<other> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
You don't know me . 
<laugh> I could lose that in a minute . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
<other> 
Well , um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there . 
Um what uh <other> I'm  
No suggestion's bad . 
But uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more . 
I don't think that we can get uh  
The T-shape is good , the child one is good , 
the too big to misplace , I think it's just funny . 
<laugh> Um I don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter . 
It's it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy . 
Yeah mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Have to come back to that later . Okay . 
No , I think her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options . Yeah . 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . Good point . 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yes . 
<other> 
Yes . 
Okay . 
Hmm , that's interesting . 
Uh yeah , on the scroll and the push-button , um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ? 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
Um . 
We'll just go for push buttons 
for  in the interest of cost . 
Okay . 
<cough> 
Okay . 
Go right to my first  my next slide . 
Um alright , my method is uh  I'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , 
so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . 
I s I <other> spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing . 
And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have , 
and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it . 
And I would encourage you all to do the same . 
Um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful . 
Um people like something that really fits in their hand . 
Simple is beautiful . 
They don't want to have to squint at small print um , 
they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want um as few buttons as possible , 
and they don't <other> care for the mode thing . 
They want each button to do something . 
And eye-catching is important . 
It's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing . 
Go ahead , 
I'm trying to finish fast for you . 
Um <cough> and our preference is , as far as I'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . 
Ours has to be  look really great and it has to come out before the others , 
so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item . 
And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . 
If we try to tell people it has too many great features , um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere . 
So we've gotta narrow our selection down to <other> li <other> two things , I think , that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product . 
And I've been looking around um at what designs  every year different things are popular . 
And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . 
And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . 
They are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . 
So those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item . 
<cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
You wanna try to come back to yours , and limit yours a bit ? 
Okay . 
So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned ? 
Yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature . 
That that  be really good , yeah , I agree with that . 
Distance problem ? 
Uh . 
<other> 
I think I think battery , 
and I think we all agreed on that . 
That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing . 
Yep . 
Bright , colourful , trendy trendy design , and strong . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
<other> Well , I think that  
Yeah , 
or <other> or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement . 
Her speech recognition feature would be a supplement . 
Okay , so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is . 
<other> 
Okay . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Wherever they're hiding ? <laugh>
