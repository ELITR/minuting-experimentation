A:  Okay . Hello everyone . <laugh> 
C:  Hi . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Hi . 
B:  Hi . 
A:  Um how uh how we doing ? 
C:  Yeah , good . 
A:  Uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working , meaning gathering i suggestions 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the  within the budget uh that was given . Uh in general <other> the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . Um it's also an item that people lose a lot . So we should address that . And , of course , it should be something s s that is very simple to use . 
D:  <other> 
A:  In addition to that to make it sell , of course , uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive , or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's a very important fact , 'cause um if they say , well , I go home and think about it , that won't work . Um also mentioned was it should be uh  it should have a very short learning curve . And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan . 
C:  Hmm . 
A:  <other> Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip 
D:  <other> 
A:  that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip . Therefore , messages uh will be controlled in the same manner . There should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep . If too many buttons are pressed , mm uh uh child lock um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um  you could see the time , you know , what show they want to watch . Also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes . So the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and maybe some kind of a holder uh for the for the uh item . Francino who is our um interface designer um uh has mentioned that the  that it , of course , should have an on-off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock . 
B:  Interface designer . 
A:  Particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable . It should be compact . Her personal favourite was it should be T-shaped . And maybe have an anar alarm-clock . And the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature . Uh the different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio-waves . Uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature . 
D:  <laugh> <cough> 
A:  And <other> even possibly a timer to  so that people can program <laugh> their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote . 
B:  Yes . 
A:  Uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ? Okay . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yes . 
D:  Yeah , I think that pretty much is it . Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
A:  <other> Okay , then we  I'm looking for three presentations . And uh I don't know whether the order matters much uh , I don't I don't think so , so whoever w wants  Yeah , okay . 


B:  Okay , I can start first . Okay . Now my slide , please . <laugh> 
A:  Okay , your slides . Okay . Oh , come on , close already . 
D:  <other> 
A:  And that's number two , right ? 
B:  Three . 
A:  Three . 
B:  Participant three . Yes . Okay . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Now as an interface designer , I would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers . Next , please . 
B:  And the personal preference <other> uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function . 
D:  <other> 
A:  Mm-hmm . Right . 
B:  Thank you , that's  
A:  Mm-hmm . Okay , thank you very much . Uh any comments on uh her presentation ? 
D:  Well , um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there . Um what uh <other> I'm  No suggestion's bad . But uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more . I don't think that we can get uh  The T-shape is good , the child one is good , the too big to misplace , I think it's just funny . <laugh> Um I don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter . It's it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm yes . Okay . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , I I th I think  
B:  Okay .  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  No , I think the these are her presentations , but uh as far as the decision making we getting to that after after but if  I just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation . 
D:  Yeah mm . Mm-hmm . Have to come back to that later . Okay . 
B:  We can . 
D:  No , I think her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options . Yeah . 
A:  Mm right . Mm-hmm . 


A:  Ho who wants to go next um ? 
C:  Yeah , maybe . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Okay , and you  
C:  Participant two . 
D:  <other> 
A:  Uh okay . 
C:  Uh the next one , sorry . It's it was the old one . 
A:  Oops . 
C:  Components . 
A:  The components design . Mm-hmm . Okay . 
A:  Okay , well thank you . Any particular comments by anybody ? 
D:  Uh yeah , on the scroll and the push-button , um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ? 
C:  No , no , no , th the the the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , uh <other> which which we used to do before ten ten years before , I think . Now , nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all . So I think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons . Yeah uh yeah , push-buttons . Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . <other> Um . We'll just go for push buttons for  in the interest of cost . Okay . 
B:  Push-buttons . 


A:  We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision , and the marketing expert has to present her her thing . 
D:  <cough> Okay . Go right to my first  my next slide . 
A:  Uh okay . 
D:  Um alright , my method is uh  I'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . I s I <other> spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing . And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have , and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it . And I would encourage you all to do the same . Um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful . Um people like something that really fits in their hand . Simple is beautiful . They don't want to have to squint at small print um , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want um as few buttons as possible , and they don't <other> care for the mode thing . They want each button to do something . And eye-catching is important . It's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing . Go ahead , I'm trying to finish fast for you . Um <cough> and our preference is , as far as I'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . Ours has to be  look really great and it has to come out before the others , so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item . And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . If we try to tell people it has too many great features , um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere . So we've gotta narrow our selection down to <other> li <other> two things , I think , that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product . And I've been looking around um at what designs  every year different things are popular . And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . They are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . So those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item . 
B:  'Kay . Mm-hmm . 
D:  <cough> 


A:  Okay . Uh that concludes the presentation of everyone . And what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  And uh so what do we think on the concept 
D:  <other> 
A:  of the remote ? 
D:  You wanna try to come back to yours , and limit yours a bit ? 
A:  <other> 
B:  Uh yes , I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser . 
A:  Y <other> <other> Okay . Mm-hmm . <other> 
D:  Okay . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned ? 
C:  Yeah , but w 
B:  This could be uh one feature which could be sellable . 
D:  Yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature . That that  be really good , yeah , I agree with that . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  I think that's  
C:  Yeah , but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how <other> how uh far it will work , because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems , issues . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Distance problem ? 
C:  Yeah , it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice , like maybe different people will be having different voices , so it like it's uh  everything so i 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Uh . 
A:  Well , you you teach  You have to teach uh  
C:  So to get a good recogni recognising system , it's a costly thing , I think . 
D:  <other> 
B:  No , it's it's , uh yeah , it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already , and then you're expecting an answer from th For example , you have a T_V_ system , I'm the user and my family members are the user , I will already record uh a question like , uh good morning , like around eight o'clock I want to see the news in the television . So I'll say just good morning and the T_V_ will switch on . It will recognise my voice and will switch on . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Yeah , but  Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
A:  Okay , before we get too far off here um , the components of the concept is the energy . What kind of energy do we foresee ? 
D:  I think I think battery , and I think we all agreed on that . That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing . 
A:  Battery . Battery . 
B:  Battery . Yes . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Okay then <other> chip on print . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
B:  Yes . 
A:  Okay . And the case . And I think we all agree on the case , we wanna have something uh maybe bright , colourful . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Bright , colourful , trendy trendy design , and strong . 
B:  And compact . 
C:  And also strong . Trendy , yeah . 
B:  Trendy design and compact . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Trendy design , compact and strong . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yes . 
A:  User interface concept , uh <other> interface type , supplements . 
D:  <other> 
A:  That will be your area I think , right , Jana . 
C:  Uh . Um like the switches , like we use buttons for user interface . 
B:  Push-buttons . 
A:  Put uh k I guess uh for  yeah . 
C:  Push-buttons . 
A:  And <other> Not sure what they mean by supplements . 
B:  And  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> Well , I think that  
B:  Supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have a f mute button or a swapping button . 
D:  Yeah , or <other> or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement . Her speech recognition feature would be a supplement . 
A:  Oh , like  Oh . A what ? Right , right , right , mm-hmm . 
B:  Recogniser . Yes . 
C:  Mm yeah . 
D:  Okay , so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is . 
C:  Hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
B:  Yes . 


A:  Okay . Uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , and the uh I_D_ is to  this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , and uh the U_I_D_ is supposed to <other> uh come up with the user interface design , 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  and the marketing expert with the product evaluation . In this phase , the two of you , Jana and Francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here . <laugh> You will receive specific <laugh> instructions <laugh> will be sent to you by your coaches . 
D:  <other> Okay . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  <other> <laugh>
