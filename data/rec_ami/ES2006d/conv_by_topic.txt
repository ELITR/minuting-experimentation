A:  <other> I'm proud of it . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Okay . This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . And again I'll take minutes . The  what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Um then 
B:  It does look very cool . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  And then do we get to make a remote control ? 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 'Cause we missed out . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  So 
A:  <other> 
C:  it's now  I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen . 
A:  Uh-huh . How how much do we have , forty minutes ? Yeah . 
C:  Is that right ? 
D:  Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah . 
C:  Yeah , until about four fifteen . So yeah . <other> 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> Okay , so . 


C:  Go for it . Do you want  
D:  So , you said um  are are we starting with the the  so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and  
C:  Yes . 
A:  Presentation . <other> Okay . <other> Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and <laugh>  we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . <laugh> Um  
C:  <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? It's a bit um phallic . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Um  
D:  <laugh> Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . <laugh> 
C:  Dual use , perfect . <laugh> Dual use , perfect . <laugh> Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? Sorry , sorry . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh , <laugh>  your remote control ? Oh that's just bad . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . So now we we have the  okay , so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here and uh <other> the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um 
D:  <other> 
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Wow . 
A:  well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah . 
D:  Uh yeah . 
C:  And it's  the whole thing's made of rubber , is that  
A:  <other> Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah . 
D:  Rubber . Yeah ,  . 
B:  Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? 
D:  Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be  and  <laugh> yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , so we said the back side round , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> Yeah , well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh  
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  It l does look like the  curvy and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . And it's spongy as well . <laugh> So <laugh> so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the <other> on the cover we just have the very basic things . So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three  there would be numbers in in the  on the actual one . So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . 
A:  Mm . Hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> <laugh> 
C:  Huh . Mm-hmm . Yeah . <other> Six seven eight nine . I like that . 
D:  Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly . And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and  like the previous one and the next one . And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . 
C:  Yeah . Uh-huh . 
B:  So where's the volume ? 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  The volume is is scrolling . On the side , this one . Yeah you just do it like this . And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . 
A:  It's on the side . 
B:  Ah , you did get that in then , mm-hmm . Oh okay ,  . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  See ? So the volume is <other> you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , <other> okay , there there you have the screen and and you have the mm <other> spinning wheel with options to choose . You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button . 
C:  Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
B:  Cool . Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button . 
A:  <other> Uh no , we we'd not put  <other>  so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials . 
D:  A mute button . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Well ,  we'll have this on the screen , on the display . 
C:  Y or you could have it  so you  on the wheel if you  
B:  On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . 
C:   . 
A:  Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . 
D:  Well , but the but the mute  yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? 
C:  But if you hold it in , if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? 
B:  Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ? 
A:  Mm . 
D:  Okay , yeah , okay . 
B:  Okay , cool . So that  that solves the whole mute issue . 
A:  Mm . 
D:  Yeah . <other> And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it . You can't really see it in the interface . 
C:   no . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah , it's hidden in there somewhere . 
D:  Yeah . And we do have the logo on it as well . 
C:  Mm-hmm , very good . 
D:  So I think it  
C:  And it's  <other> with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:   . 
D:  Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . 
A:  Cool . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> We ran out of resources here , so . <laugh> 
D:  In the actual one . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> So if you have questions . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  You can have a look . <laugh> 
C:  Very good , let's have a look . Test it out . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:   . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess . 
B:  Yeah , oh , we hold the remote . Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy . I hate Play-Do , it's just minging . But yeah , uh that's cool , cool . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> <laugh> 


C:  Very good . Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then we'll there  I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Okay . 
A:  Yeah , see the budget . 
B:  <laugh> <other> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country and 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  cut some of the prices that way . 
B:  Wales . <laugh> 
C:  Wales , for example . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm . Cool , okay . Right , okay . <vocal noise> <other> Fabulous , yeah . Okay , cool . So what we're gonna do is prefer  prepare the evaluation of the new design . <other> Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale , so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Um , you know . 
C:  Marketing Expert . Mm-hmm . 
B:  Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like  so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . Okay ? Cool , so these are what they are . Oh  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . Is that right ? 
B:  Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good . 
C:  Mm dots , never mind . 
A:  <other> <other> I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , the yeah , it's definitely attractive . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah , I agree . 
D:  Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot . 
B:  Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ? 
D:  Yeah . Shall I just prepare it now ? 
C:  Yeah , just prepare one now . 
B:  <other> Yeah . 
D:  It will be red , too . 
B:  Cool . Okay . So , be attractive to look at . That's this one . What do you all say ? 
D:  <other> S seven was th the maximum , yeah ? I I go for seven . 
A:  So ? 
C:  I reckon it  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Seven , yeah , it's terribly sexy . Yeah . 
B:  Oh <laugh> we're all so proud of the  . Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ . Could  oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in . 
A:  <laugh> Yes . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Ah , okay . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  Excellent . Except we can't  uh we can if we  then yeah , I'll take a note , it's fine . 
B:  Yeah . But that's alright . If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute . Okay , so <other> we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? Cool , okay . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? 
A:  But we can we can  I can I can take note uh uh  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> 
D:  I would think yes , yeah . 
A:  Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger . 
C:  I think it does . 
B:  Yeah . I mean  
D:  Yeah , so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m <other> model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . 
C:  Alright . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  But that's gonna be a problem , 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . 
A:  But then  yeah . Yeah . So bu it's it's not a huge problem , because i i it is operatable . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  I th I think it's not <other> it's not like it's a pen . 
D:  But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , so they just  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , but they can normally do most things right-handed , so I would say it's not such a big issue . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
D:  Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , so i if the majority are right-handed , it's uh  
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah . I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . So maybe we need to put  that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? What do you what do you all think ? 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
A:  Yep . Mm . 
C:  Um  Six . 
D:  Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues , I mean . Yeah . 
A:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah , I think I think for um  I mean most people are right-handed , so in <other> in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want  might want to um  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  One more thing is that i 
B:  Okay . 
A:  It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , so it opens on the side . So <other>  
C:  They  Mm-hmm . 
D:  No , yeah , but mm but we have it <other> nicely <other> with the hinges here  yeah . So it won't be a problem , it will be  and it will be  it won't be heavy . 
A:  <other> Yeah yeah yeah , I mean  yeah . So you guys can decide wh whether  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Oops . 
B:  I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top . 
D:  Yeah well yeah , but it's it's a bit long . It's a little bit long . Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah . 
A:  Yeah , but we  which makes it kind of really big , yeah . 
C:  The length is gonna be difficu 
B:  Yeah um  But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ? 
A:  <other> Uh this this kind of uh makes it more  and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel . 
C:  Mm . 
B:  Because  
D:  S uh slightly smaller . 
B:  So you have to keep that side flat . 
D:  Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work . 
A:  Right . 
B:  Okay . Um <cough> okay , so C_ . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? There's a locator . Cool , so that means you need a  that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , doesn't it ? To make it beep . Or a buzzer . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  No , we're gonna put it like  we've got th there's the locator dot . 
A:  No , we have a locator . 
D:  Mm that you stick on T_V_ . 
C:  Mm . 
D:  Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some  to make some sounds , so  yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  So that's two , so that's seven , yeah . It's locatable ? Fabulous . D_ . 
D:  Yep . 
A:  Intuitive , completely intuitive . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . If <other> uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's  I th I think it's  
C:  Yeah . I'd say six , 'cause the  I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . I really like the way you have it , but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Intuitive . 
B:  Yeah , and I mean d 
C:  So  
A:  And uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it . 
C:  Might be  But it  and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  So , should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive , but it's different , so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it , but you might have to think about it first . So we give that one a five , you think ? Yep . 
A:  So l 
C:  Five ? Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , okay . I'm gonna give a seven in everything , so . <laugh> 
C:  I'm happy with five ? Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  I'm glad you're accepting this . It has taken a little while , hasn't it ? Um intuitive but  Sorry , it's really hard to write on those . I just went a bit mad , didn't I ? Um okay , cool , E_ , okay . 
A:  Mm . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . Investigate . 
C:  Yep . But otherwise it's superb . 
B:  So , should we give it a six ? Six ? 
C:  Six . 
D:  Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design  well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , yeah ? See . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:   . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Yeah , unless you are a all the time sitting . 
D:  Yeah , so it's kinda  
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Well we've banned them from  
A:  Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic . 
B:  I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  And moreover it it has um <other> L_C_D_ and everything , so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , it's varied . Yeah . Six ? 
B:  Okay , so we give that a six , yeah . Okay , F_ . 
D:  <other> Yeah ,   it does have  yeah . 
A:  <other> Absolutely . 
C:  Voice control have seven . 
B:  Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? That's just  
C:  Ah , that's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide . 
B:  Oh okay , cool . Um <other> right , so <other> . 
A:  So it has voice control . 
B:  Yes , so that's a seven then . Um , cool . 
A:  Yep . 
C:  G_ technologically innovative . 
A:  <other> Anyway it ha yeah , it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . <laugh> 
D:  Technologi  well  
C:  <laugh> But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is  yeah , it's kind of new . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , but I mean you don't  
C:  All of the components have been used in other things before . But do  yeah , yeah . 
D:  But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new . 
A:  Yeah , but they've been brought together in a remote . 
B:  They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think . 
C:  Yeah . What do you reckon , five , six ? 
B:   . Yeah , what do you all think ? Six ? 
D:  Six . 
A:  <other> Yeah . 
D:  I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? It still has to do what i what it has to do . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  Well , that's it , I mean  
A:  <laugh> <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ? So , I don't think many peop 
C:  <laugh> Space remote . 
A:  <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  That's it , they can take it with them . 
C:  Put fashion in electronics . 
A:  <other> Absolutely . <laugh> The carrot banana remote . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , isn't it fashionable ? Yeah , sure . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  It's the maximum fashion . Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  So , we give it seven , and we write  
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  There we go . 
D:  So I think we've done very well , but  
A:  I think that's a  . 
B:  Cool . So , we need the average here , so we got  
C:  Very good . 
D:  <other> What's the assessment ? 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  The average is about six and something . A little bit over six . 
C:  <other> Yeah , one . 
B:  Seven  
C:  Or a seven <other> . 
A:  <other> There are how many sixes ? One , two , three . Three . 
D:  No , wait , a little bit under six . No , wait . 
B:  So we've got four sevens , so that's twenty eight , three sixes , eighteen . 
A:  And one five . 
D:  Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah . 
C:  <other> Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . 
A:  Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . Forty six and five , fifty one . Fifty one divided by  
D:  <other> Four sevens . 
C:  Six point point  about six point five . Close enough . 
D:  Six point something , yeah . 
B:  Two three four  
D:  <other> Six point five , yeah . 
B:  Seven eight . Okay , that's pretty good , I think . <other> 
C:  Now wait until we <laugh> get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ? 
B:  Um no , that's it , yeah . 


C:  That's it ? Alright . So , finance . And we'll see if we can unscrew this first . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Cool , there we go . 
C:  Sorry , this is  I'm just um  
B:   . There we go and there are the marks . 
C:  Beautiful . Not anymore . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Computer no signal ? 
A:  Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit . 
C:  Adjusting . There we go . Okay , so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . And now we have to calculate the production costs . So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that . Can you read that ? Almost . 
A:  <other> 
C:  More or less . Um I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . No hand dynamo , right ? One simple battery . No kinetic energy , no solar . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> Yeah . 
A:  Mm . 
C:  The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print . We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker . 
A:  Advanced , yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
C:  Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . 
D:  Yeah , yes . 
C:  Case material we said rubber . I don't know what special colour means . 
D:  Rubber . 
A:  Yep . Mm anything uh I think which is not more  . 
C:  <other> 
D:  I think something coloured , yeah , probably . So I think this is probably special co no ? 
C:  It could be  
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know . 
C:  Rub rubber comes coloured , it's  I would  <other> maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . 
D:  Yeah . Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it ,  yeah yeah , okay . 
C:  Yeah , let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , you might end up having to take off the 
C:  We we're definitely going to have to  so we've got pushbutton , and then we've 
D:  We have pushbuttons , 
A:  Mm . 
B:  sample sensor . 
D:  scro we have scroll wheel as well . 
C:  Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? S for the muting . 
D:  S yeah , yeah , we had , for muting , yeah . And we have L_C_ display and  yeah . 
A:  No uh we we have uh yeah . 
C:  Yeah . And button supplements . 
D:  Um  
A:  Mm no . 
B:   . No . 
A:  We don't have  we're not using any of that . 
C:  No . No ? 
D:  Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel  
C:  But the the spinning wheel's not there . I have  think  maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ? 
D:  Yeah . Okay , let's  yeah . 
B:  We've got more than one pushbutton though , haven't we ? 
C:  <other> I think the pushbutton  oh . 
B:  'Cause then you have  
C:  I don't know if that's one  
B:  That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget . 
C:  Yeah . That seems unlikely . Push what uh whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we  I don't think that makes sense . 
A:  Huh ? Wh wh what is the limit ? Uh . 
B:  Twelve point five . 
D:  We have to count all of them , or  yeah . 
A:  Mm I don't think so , no . No it says what what is the kind of interface , if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel  so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have . 
B:  No . Well it doesn't , but it uh  
C:  No . Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  And L_C_ display . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here . 
A:  <other> Wh wh what's our criteria ? 
B:  This sample sensor  . 
C:  Our budget's twelve point five . 
A:  Uh okay . 


C:  Well done , team . <laugh> Um we need  we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product . 
A:  <other> I think it mm  
B:  Cool . 
C:  Feedback ? Ideas ? 
D:  Yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  <other> I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . Um we kap kept a adding things randomly . So , had we known  
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  If we'd had that sheet at the beginning  should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can . 
A:  <other> Yeah , that or not , yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . So <other> d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm . <other> 
C:  But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of . 
A:  Yeah , mm . 
B:  I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . It wasn't like we were alone for very long , so you didn't <other> st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating <laugh> remote control <laugh> shaped like a banana , and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . <laugh> Um yeah , so yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . <laugh> Banana . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used . 
C:  Mm-hmm , the whiteboard digital pens . <laugh> We like the pens . <laugh> 
D:  And the pens . <laugh> 
B:  Uh I like the pens . I want one . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s 
C:  Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down and have it printed out when you got back to the office . They great ? 
A:  Yeah yeah yeah , that's it's it's  I wonder what one of these costs . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  Do you think they'd notice if one went ? 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> I don't think you should say that was the recording . Okay , cover up the microphone . Alright , let's take it . <laugh> Okay . 
C:  Oh okay . Yep . Shh . <laugh> Yep . But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the  I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there , yep . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  It is a bit limiting , isn't it ? Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the <other>  
B:  Yeah . The thing flew in , you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . That's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah . 
B:  Not that you can do that on the board , either . We could make some little  
D:  But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah . 
B:  Yeah , totally , I mean that was fairly tight anyway , I mean especially with that last-minute alteration .  back it , <laugh> this is  just had to be changed . And  yeah , so  cool . 
C:  Mm . 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm yeah . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ? 
C:  And presumably you don't  you can say nasty things as well . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah . 
C:  I have no stake in it . 
B:  Yeah , definitely . You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  You have to say that , 'cause I'm taking the notes . I'll leave the room and you can have another go . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  I know you've got the pen , you might attack me with it . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Better than that than the banana . 
D:  And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah . 
C:  I think it worked quite well . Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to 
A:  <other> Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  say their bit ? 
D:  To express them mm mm no . 
A:  Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group , so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:   . New ideas found . Not quite sure what about . Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Well it's it's it's pretty new , pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and  
A:  Mm . 
C:  <other> Yeah . 
B:  I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , neither neither do I , but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so . 
C:  <laugh> Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Hmm . 
B:  Yeah . I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay . That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a  remote control . 
C:  Yeah , that's right . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one . 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Patent patent patent . Mm . 
C:  Banana remote . 
B:  I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , but we've got no way of finding out . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control . <laugh> Flip . Vibrate . And uh  yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  That vibrates  <laugh> <laugh> Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Nothing that you really want . <laugh> True . Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <other> Okay . So , costs are within budget , well within budget , including a little  what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . 
D:  Yes . <cough> 
B:  Yes . 
C:  Um we've evaluated 
D:  Yes . 
C:  the project . You've got the scores . Can you put that in the project documents file ? It's in there already . And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . Were there any  was there anything that you found difficult , or anything 
B:  And it's fabulous . It's in the project documents  . 
C:  that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ? 
D:  And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . Otherwise it's it's all fine . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , yeah , sometimes it's like a little bit rushed . 
A:  Mm-hmm . <other> I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um  yeah . Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> <other> 


C:  Okay then . Um I think we're still well within our 
B:  Yeah , we've got like five minutes left . 
C:  time . We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . We're just too too efficient and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> We certainly are , mm . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yes . 
C:  So I would say that's the end of that meeting . 
A:  <other> 
D:  Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you . 
C:  Thank you , team . It was very productive day and  
B:  'Kay . 
A:  <other> Yeah , same here . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> We could draw animals on the board again . 
C:  <laugh> Mm uh no . <laugh> 
A:  Mm uh no . <laugh> I don't think so . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  You can make some animals . Oh , you don't like anim 
B:  I don't like Play-Doh , no . It's just minging . It smells so bad . 
A:  <other> 
D:  <other> It doesn't ? Smells quite nice . Smells very sweet . 
B:  It does . Mm . 
C:  Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . I don't know if it's already sent or not . Um presumably I have to  
A:  Was there a questionnaire already sent ? 
B:  No , it hasn't been . Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? 
C:  I don't see why you can't stay here , really . 
B:  Okay , so the other way . <other> 
C:  <other> Did I save this one ? Production costs . 
D:  <other> I made your animal for you . 
C:  <laugh> It was supposed to be pink . <laugh> But it was blue on the board . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , that's the one
