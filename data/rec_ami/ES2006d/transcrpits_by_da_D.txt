<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah . 
So , you said um  
are are we starting with the the  
so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things 
and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and  
<laugh> 
<laugh> Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Uh yeah . 
Rubber . 
Yeah ,  . 
Um it could be made a bit smaller , 
and and of course it would be  and  
<laugh> yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , 
so we said the back side round , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And it's spongy as well . <laugh> 
So <laugh> so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the <other> on the cover we just have the very basic things . 
So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three  
there would be numbers in in the  on the actual one . 
So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . 
Yeah . 
And then , well this is on off button . 
It's it's quite standard mm place for it 
and and also the colour is quite often red , 
so it's it's kind of user friendly . 
And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and  
like the previous one and the next one . 
And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . 
The volume is is scrolling . 
On the side , 
this one . 
Yeah you just do it like this . 
And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . 
See ? 
So the volume is <other> you just scroll , 
but then once you flip it open , <other> okay , there there you have the screen 
and and you have the mm <other> spinning wheel with options to choose . 
You can move back and forth 
and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button . 
A mute button . 
Well ,  we'll have this on the screen , on the display . 
Well , but the but the mute  
yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? 
Okay , yeah , okay . 
Yeah . 
<other> And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it . 
You can't really see it in the interface . 
Yeah . 
And we do have the logo on it as well . 
So I think it  
Yeah . 
Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . 
In the actual one . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
So if you have questions . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , the yeah , 
it's definitely attractive . <laugh> 
Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot . 
Yeah . 
Shall I just prepare it now ? 
It will be red , too . 
<other> S seven was th the maximum , yeah ? 
I I go for seven . 
<laugh> 
I would think yes , yeah . 
Yeah , 
so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m <other> model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . 
Yeah . 
But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , 
so they just  
Yeah . 
Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , 
so i if the majority are right-handed , it's uh  
Or maybe six , 
because it's just one one i one among the issues , 
I mean . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
No , yeah , but mm but we have it <other> nicely <other> with the hinges here  yeah . 
So it won't be a problem , 
it will be  and it will be  
it won't be heavy . 
Yeah well yeah , 
but it's it's a bit long . 
It's a little bit long . 
Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah . 
S uh slightly smaller . 
Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that . 
Mm that you stick on T_V_ . 
Yeah well w 
but l but the speak sample speaker is included , 
so it it has some capacity to mm to do some  to make some sounds , so  yeah . 
Yep . 
Yeah . 
If <other> uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things 
and it's  I th I think it's  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design  
well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , 
but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , 
yeah ? See . 
Yeah , so it's kinda  
Yeah . 
<other> Yeah ,   it does have  yeah . 
Technologi  well  
Yeah . 
Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is  yeah , it's kind of new . 
But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new . 
Six . 
I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? 
It still has to do what i what it has to do . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , isn't it fashionable ? 
Yeah , sure . 
It's the maximum fashion . 
Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . 
So I think we've done very well , 
but  
<other> What's the assessment ? 
The average is about six and something . 
A little bit over six . 
No , wait , 
a little bit under six . 
No , wait . 
Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah . 
Six point something , yeah . 
<other> Six point five , yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<other> Yeah . 
Yep . 
Yeah , yes . 
Rubber . 
I think something coloured , 
yeah , probably . 
So I think this is probably special co no ? 
Yeah . 
Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , 
 yeah yeah , okay . 
Yeah . 
We have pushbuttons , 
scro we have scroll wheel as well . 
S yeah , yeah , 
we had , for muting , yeah . 
And we have L_C_ display 
and  yeah . 
Um  
Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel  
Yeah . 
Okay , let's  yeah . 
We have to count all of them , 
or  yeah . 
But it was very no innovative 
 innovativeness  . Well um  yeah . 
Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , 
but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . 
This would be  
Yeah , yeah yeah <other> 
there you record your samples your speech samples and  
Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . 
Yeah b 
no no , 
you can push this one , 
but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . 
Mm-hmm . 
But I mean <other> we can put an additional mute button on the top as well . 
If you  
Mm . 
So  
Mm-hmm . 
Okay , yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
<other> Well  we're going to have a beeping thing . 
But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , 
so we still have the locate . 
Which colour , 
the the colour of the phone or the colour of the  
But it can be yellow as well . 
It can come in the same colour as the the case . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah mm , 
as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . 
The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used . 
And the pens . <laugh> 
Yeah , yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the <other>  
Yeah . 
But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah . 
To express them mm mm 
no . 
Well it's it's it's pretty new , 
pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and  
Yeah , neither neither do I , 
but I've never seen anything 
and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so . 
Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one . 
Patent patent patent . Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yes . <cough> 
Yes . 
And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . 
Otherwise it's it's all fine . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yes . 
Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you . 
You can make some animals . 
Oh , you don't like anim 
<other> It doesn't ? 
Smells quite nice . 
Smells very sweet . 
<other> I made your animal for you . 
Yeah , that's the one
