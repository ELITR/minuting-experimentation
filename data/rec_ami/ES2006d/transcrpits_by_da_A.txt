<other> I'm proud of it . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Uh-huh . 
How how much do we have , forty minutes ? 
Yeah . 
<other> Okay , so . 
Presentation . 
<other> Okay . 
<other> Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and <laugh>  we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . 
<laugh> Um  
<laugh> 
Yeah . Um  
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . 
So now we we have the  okay , 
so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . 
And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . 
And we have the user interface o in here 
and uh <other> the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . 
Um 
well , everything else is probably user interface , so . 
Yeah , yeah . 
<other> Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah . 
<other> Yeah , 
well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh  
Yeah . 
Mm . Hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
It's on the side . 
<other> Uh no , we we'd not put  <other>  
so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials . 
Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> Yeah , it's hidden in there somewhere . 
Cool . 
<other> We ran out of resources here , so . <laugh> 
You can have a look . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , see the budget . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<other> I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
So ? 
<laugh> Yes . 
Okay . 
But we can we can  
I can I can take note uh uh  
Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , 
so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger . 
But then  yeah . 
Yeah . 
So bu it's it's not a huge problem , 
because i i it is operatable . 
Right . 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
One more thing is that i 
It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , 
so it opens on the side . So <other>  
<other> Yeah yeah yeah , 
I mean  yeah . 
So you guys can decide wh whether  
Oops . 
Yeah , but we  which makes it kind of really big , yeah . 
<other> Uh this this kind of uh makes it more  
and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel . 
Okay . 
Right . 
Okay . 
No , 
we have a locator . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Intuitive , 
completely intuitive . <laugh> 
Intuitive . 
And uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology 
so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni 
so it is kind of not very intuitive 
but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it . 
Yeah . 
So l 
Yeah , okay . 
I'm gonna give a seven in everything , so . <laugh> 
Mm . <laugh> 
 . 
Yeah . Yeah , 
unless you are a all the time sitting . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic . 
Mm yeah . 
And moreover it it has um <other> L_C_D_ and everything , 
so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . 
<other> Absolutely . 
So it has voice control . 
Yep . 
<other> 
Anyway it ha yeah , 
it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . <laugh> 
Yeah , but they've been brought together in a remote . 
<other> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<other> Absolutely . <laugh> 
The carrot banana remote . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
I think that's a  . 
Yeah . 
<other> There are how many sixes ? 
One , two , three . 
Three . 
And one five . 
Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . Forty six and five , fifty one . 
Fifty one divided by  
<laugh> 
Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit . 
<other> 
Mm . 
Advanced , yeah . 
Yep . 
Mm anything uh I think which is not more  . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
No uh we we have uh yeah . 
Mm no . 
We don't have  
we're not using any of that . 
Huh ? 
Wh wh what is the limit ? Uh . 
Mm I don't think so , no . 
No it says what what is the kind of interface , 
if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , 
it's a scroll wheel  so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , 
so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have . 
<other> Wh wh what's our criteria ? 
Uh okay . 
Uh it does not have for voice recognition , 
but it does have for the feedback speaker . 
 when you say  when you press one it says one or it says hello . 
Mm <other> and the locator also goes away . 
A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , 
because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . 
Uh I mean uh um  yeah . 
Um  
So tha that <other> mean that we cannot press  
how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ? 
If <other> 
in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? 
But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button . 
No w w w but ha 
it's it's the scroll wheel 
and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . 
That comes with the L_C_D_ ? 
Oh so so the the this is  
 . So <other> 
we're adding costs for  right , okay 
uh I mean I think this is good . 
Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up  for up and down . 
On the side . 
Mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah . 
<other>  . 
<laugh> 
<other> We have , yeah . 
Not really , no . 
Because we keep all the features , 
we keep voice recognition , 
we keep L_C_D_ display . 
We  
instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . 
Um yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> But we lose the locator . 
So instead of speaker ,  . 
'Kay . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> I think it mm  
<other> 
I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . 
Um we kap kept a adding things randomly . 
So , had we known  
<other> Yeah , that or not , yeah . 
Yeah . 
So <other> d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented . 
Mm . <other> 
Yeah , mm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah yeah yeah , 
that's it's it's  
I wonder what one of these costs . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Mm yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<other> Yeah . 
Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group , 
so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> I thought that was good though , 
because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um  yeah . 
Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute . <laugh> 
<other> We certainly are , 
mm . Yeah . 
<other> 
<other> Yeah , same here . <laugh> 
Mm uh no . <laugh> 
I don't think so . <laugh> 
<other> 
Was there a questionnaire already sent ? 
<laugh>
