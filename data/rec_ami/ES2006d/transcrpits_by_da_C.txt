Okay . 
This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . 
And again I'll take minutes . 
The  
what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , 
so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . 
Um then 
<laugh> then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . 
Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 
'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . 
Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . 
Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . 
So we've got forty minutes . S 
<laugh> 'Cause we missed out . 
So 
it's now  
I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , 
so we've got until four fifteen . 
Is that right ? 
Yeah , 
until about four fifteen . 
So yeah . <other> 
Go for it . 
Do you want  
Yes . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Dual use , perfect . 
<laugh> Dual use , perfect . 
<laugh> Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? 
Sorry , sorry . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Wow . 
And it's  the whole thing's made of rubber , is that  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Huh . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
<other> Six seven eight nine . 
I like that . 
Yeah . 
Uh-huh . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Y or you could have it  so you  on the wheel if you  
But if you hold it in , 
if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? 
 no . 
Mm-hmm , very good . 
And it's  <other> with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Very good , let's have a look . 
Test it out . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess . 
<laugh> 
Very good . 
Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria 
and then we'll there  
I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , 
but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow . 
We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country 
and cut some of the prices that way . 
Wales , for example . <laugh> 
Marketing Expert . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . 
Is that right ? 
Mm dots , never mind . 
<laugh> Yeah , I agree . 
Yeah , just prepare one now . 
I reckon it  
Yeah . 
Seven , yeah , 
it's terribly sexy . Yeah . 
Ah , okay . 
Excellent . 
Except we can't  
uh we can if we  
then yeah , I'll take a note , it's fine . 
Yeah . 
I think it does . 
Alright . 
But that's gonna be a problem , 
'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Um  
Six . 
Yeah , 
I think I think for um  
I mean most people are right-handed , 
so in <other> in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , 
but we might want to flag it for management , they want  might want to um  
They  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
The length is gonna be difficu 
Mm . 
No , 
we're gonna put it like  we've got 
th there's the locator dot . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
I'd say six , 
'cause the  I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . 
I really like the way you have it , 
but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to . 
So  
Might be  
But it  and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . 
Five ? 
Yeah . 
I'm happy with five ? 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yep . 
But otherwise it's superb . 
Six . 
Yeah . 
Well we've banned them from  
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
it's varied . 
Yeah . Six ? 
Voice control have 
seven . 
Ah , that's the second one . 
So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , 
but not on the previous slide . 
G_ technologically innovative . 
<laugh> But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new . 
Yeah . 
All of the components have been used in other things before . 
But do  
yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
What do you reckon , five , six ? 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Space remote . 
Put fashion in electronics . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Very good . 
<other> Yeah , one . 
Or a seven <other> . 
<other> Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . 
Six point point  
about six point five . 
Close enough . 
Now wait until we <laugh> get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it . 
That's all you've got at the moment , 
or did you have anything more ? 
That's it ? 
Alright . 
So , finance . 
And we'll see if we can unscrew this first . 
Sorry , 
this is  I'm just um  
Beautiful . 
Not anymore . 
Computer no signal ? 
Adjusting . 
There we go . 
Okay , 
so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . 
And now we have to calculate the production costs . 
So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that . 
Can you read that ? 
Almost . 
More or less . 
Um I started filling it in , 
but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . 
No hand dynamo , right ? 
One simple battery . 
No kinetic energy , 
no solar . 
The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print . 
We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker . 
Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . 
Case material we said rubber . 
I don't know what special colour means . 
<other> 
It could be  
Rub rubber comes coloured , 
it's  I would  
<other> maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . 
Yeah , 
let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . <laugh> 
We we're definitely going to have to  
so we've got pushbutton , 
and then we've 
Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? 
Yeah . 
And button supplements . 
No . No ? 
But the the spinning wheel's not there . 
I have  think  maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ? 
<other> 
I think the pushbutton  
oh . 
I don't know if that's one  
Yeah . 
That seems unlikely . 
Push what uh 
whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we  
I don't think that makes sense . 
No . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here . 
Our budget's twelve point five . 
Yeah , 
so that has implications though for the  . 
For the locator . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
What else does it need ? 
Yeah , 
'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing . 
Yeah , okay , so we  
Uh-huh . 
Right , so we need one fifty off . 
Take it down to just a scroll wheel . 
<other> We could do  
Yeah . 
You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute . 
That's with the L_C_ 
We decided , 
'cause it's not on our list . 
The scroll wheel is on the side . 
We're point three over at the moment . 
It's nothing n 
Yeah , 
I have  
Yeah . 
Rather than having three different things that people have to do . 
There we go . 
Oh look , we're way under budget 
and we'll make huge profits 
and we'll all get bonuses . 
<laugh> Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . 
So that's alright . 
We we'll leave it at that  
and then I'll take  I can send it back to management 
and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , 
if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , 
yeah . 
Excellent . 
Alright . 
So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ? 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Alright then . 
We're gonna have a beep . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Tha 
 . 
'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh  . 
<laugh> Yeah , I know I know , my pen vibrates . 
But only for a very short time . 
Um 
okay . 
So 
looks like we've designed a banana . 
<laugh> Well done , team . 
<laugh> Um we need  
we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , 
so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , 
um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product . 
Feedback ? 
Ideas ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> Banana . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm , 
the whiteboard digital pens . 
<laugh> We like the pens . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
you could take it to lectures 
and just write stuff down 
and have it printed out when you got back to the office . 
They great ? 
Do you think they'd notice if one went ? 
Oh okay . 
Yep . Shh . <laugh> 
Yep . 
But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 
'cause the  I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static 
and you can't change it once you're in there , 
yep . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
That's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And presumably you don't  
you can say nasty things as well . 
I have no stake in it . 
You have to say that , 
'cause I'm taking the notes . 
I'll leave the room and you can have another go . 
<laugh> Better than that than the banana . 
I think it worked quite well . 
Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ? 
Yeah . 
 . 
New ideas found . 
Not quite sure what about . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<other> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , that's right . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Banana remote . 
Yeah . 
Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control . 
<laugh> Flip . Vibrate 
. And uh  yeah . 
<laugh> Nothing that you really want . <laugh> 
True . Yeah . 
<other> Okay . So , 
costs are within budget , 
well within budget , 
including a little  what have we got ? 
One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . 
Um we've evaluated the project . 
You've got the scores . 
Can you put that in the project documents file ? 
It's in there already . 
And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . 
Were there any  was there anything that you found difficult , 
or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ? 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Okay then . 
Um I think we're still well within our time . 
We've got about five minutes left , 
but if we've finished , then we've finished . 
We're just too too efficient 
and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time . 
So I would say that's the end of that meeting . 
Thank you , team . 
It was very productive day and  
<laugh> Mm uh no . <laugh> 
Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . 
I don't know if it's already sent or not . 
Um presumably I have to  
I don't see why you can't stay here , really . 
<other> 
Did I save this one ? 
Production costs . 
<laugh> It was supposed to be pink . 
<laugh> But it was blue on the board .
