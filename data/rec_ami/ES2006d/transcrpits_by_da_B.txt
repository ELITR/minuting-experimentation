It does look very cool . 
And then do we get to make a remote control ? 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? 
It's a bit um phallic . 
Oh , <laugh> 
 your remote control 
? Oh that's just bad . <laugh> 
Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? 
Yeah . 
It l does look like the  curvy 
and then the whole shape's curvy , 
so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . 
<laugh> I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . <laugh> 
So where's the volume ? 
Ah , you did get that in then , 
mm-hmm . 
Oh okay ,  . 
Cool . 
Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button . 
Yeah . 
On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . 
Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ? 
Okay , cool . 
So that  that solves the whole mute issue . 
 . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
 . <laugh> 
Yeah , oh , we hold the remote . 
Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy . 
I hate Play-Do , 
it's just minging . 
But yeah , uh that's cool , cool . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
<laugh> <other> 
Wales . <laugh> 
Mm . Cool , okay . Right , okay . <vocal noise> 
<other> Fabulous , 
yeah . 
Okay , cool . 
So what we're gonna do is prefer  prepare the evaluation of the new design . 
<other> Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale , 
so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement 
and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . 
Um , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . 
Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like  
so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . 
Okay ? 
Cool , 
so these are what they are . 
Oh  
Yes , 
I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , 
but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . 
Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good . 
Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ? 
<other> Yeah . 
Cool . Okay . 
So , be attractive to look at . 
That's this one . 
What do you all say ? 
Yeah . 
Oh <laugh> we're all so proud of the  . 
Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ . 
Could  
oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . 
Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in . 
Yeah . 
But that's alright . 
If you take a note of them , 
and then I'll put them in in a minute . 
Okay , so <other> we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? 
Cool , okay . 
Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? 
Yeah . 
I mean  
Yeah . 
I th I think it's not <other> it's not like it's a pen . 
Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , 
left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , 
but they can normally do most things right-handed , 
so I would say it's not such a big issue . 
Yeah . 
I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . 
So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . 
So maybe we need to put  that needs a little bit of investigation , 
maybe give it a five , I would say ? 
What do you what do you all think ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top . 
Yeah um  
But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ? 
Because  
So you have to keep that side flat . 
So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work . 
Okay . Um <cough> okay , 
so C_ . 
Are are we admitting defeat on C_ 
or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? 
There's a locator . 
Cool , 
so that means you need a  that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , 
doesn't it ? 
To make it beep . 
Or a buzzer . 
Okay . 
So that's two , 
so that's seven , yeah . 
It's locatable ? 
Fabulous . 
D_ . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , and I mean d 
So , should we maybe say f a five 
and say it is intuitive , 
but it's different , 
so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it , 
but you might have to think about it first . 
So we give that one a five , you think ? 
Yep . 
I'm glad you're accepting this . 
It has taken a little while , hasn't it ? 
Um intuitive but  
Sorry , 
it's really hard to write on those . 
I just went a bit mad , didn't I ? 
Um okay , cool , 
E_ , 
okay . 
Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , 
so possibly for left-handed . Investigate . 
So , should we give it a six ? 
Six ? 
I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , 
and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , 
so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest . 
Okay , so we give that a six , 
yeah . 
Okay , F_ . 
Hang on , 
how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? 
That's just  
Oh okay , cool . 
Um <other> right , so <other> . 
Yes , 
so that's a seven then . 
Um , cool . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , but I mean you don't  
They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think . 
 . 
Yeah , 
what do you all think ? 
Six ? 
Well , that's it , I mean  
Yeah , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ? 
So , I don't think many peop 
That's it , they can take it with them . 
So , we give it seven , 
and we write  
There we go . 
Cool . 
So , we need the average here , 
so we got  
Seven  
So we've got four sevens , 
so that's twenty eight , 
three sixes , 
eighteen . 
Two three four  Seven eight . 
Okay , 
that's pretty good , I think . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Um no , that's it , 
yeah . 
Cool , there we go . 
 . 
There we go and there are the marks . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know . 
Yeah , 
you might end up having to take off the sample sensor . 
 . 
No . 
We've got more than one pushbutton though , 
haven't we ? 
'Cause then you have  
That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? 
Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget . 
Twelve point five . 
No . 
Well it doesn't , but it uh  
And L_C_ display . 
This sample sensor  . 
Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 
'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . 
Yeah . 
But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? 
We can afford to get rid of it . 
So that means no locator , does it ? 
I mean does  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay , yeah . 
See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 
'cause  
But that's  well you would just have to to spin it down  . 
So that's point three . 
Yeah , 
I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more . 
That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? 
Didn't that come with the L_C_  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
S so we're point three over . 
Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether 
and just have pushbuttons for the volume . 
Could b still put them on the side . 
But yeah . 
I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve  , couldn't we ? <laugh> 
Yeah , but   
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
No . 
No , I don't think so . 
Yeah . 
We just got rid of a gimmick that was never  anyway , 
and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was  
it's not a great difference I don't think . 
Really ? 
Cool . 
That's not a very exciting colour . 
I think you should make it more vegetable-like . <laugh> 
Oh the the beeper thing . 
It  
Yeah , I think Jen wants it to vibrate . 
You know , your pen vibrates ? 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Cool . 
Yeah . 
If we'd had that sheet at the beginning  should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can . 
Yeah . 
I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . 
It wasn't like we were alone for very long , 
so you didn't <other> st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating <laugh> remote control <laugh> shaped like a banana , 
and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . 
<laugh> Um yeah , so yeah . 
Uh I like the pens . 
I want one . 
That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s 
<laugh> I don't think you should say that was the recording . 
Okay , cover up the microphone . 
Alright , let's take it . <laugh> 
Okay . 
It is a bit limiting , isn't it ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
The thing flew in , 
you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 
'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah . 
Not that you can do that on the board , either . 
We could make some little  
Yeah , totally , 
I mean that was fairly tight anyway , 
I mean especially with that last-minute alteration . 
 back it , <laugh> this is  just had to be changed 
. And  yeah , so  cool . 
Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah , definitely . 
You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good . 
I know you've got the pen , 
you might attack me with it . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I don't know , 
I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , 
maybe somebody's already though of it . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay . 
That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a  remote control . 
Yeah , yeah . 
I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , 
but we've got no way of finding out . <laugh> 
That vibrates  <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it . 
<laugh> 
Yes . 
And it's fabulous . 
It's in the project documents  . 
Yeah , yeah , 
sometimes it's like a little bit rushed . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Yeah , 
we've got like five minutes left . 
Yeah . 
'Kay . 
<laugh> 
We could draw animals on the board again . 
<laugh> 
I don't like Play-Doh , no . 
It's just minging . 
It smells so bad . 
It does . 
Mm . 
No , it hasn't been . 
Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? 
Okay , so the other way . <other> 
<laugh>
