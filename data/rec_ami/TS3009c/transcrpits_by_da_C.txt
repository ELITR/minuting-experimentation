<other> 
<other> 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Alright . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . Alright . 
Alright . 
<laugh> 
Easy to use ? 
I think that's your ta 
Mm . 
<other> 
You  
Yeah . Yeah , yeah , 
you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , 
so ease of use  <other> It's not a very comp complicated device . 
Alright . 
<laugh> 
<other> <laugh> 
<laugh> Uh you think ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
 
Mm . 
<laugh>  
Alright . 
Yeah , among the old people , yeah . 
Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design . 
Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties . 
This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device . 
And the materials ? Um I have heard several things , 
so I uh I'll have to change that on the way . 
But uh the case ? 
Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic . 
But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong . 
It should feel strong . 
So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient . 
We should move to uh something  
Well yeah . 
Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , 
but it doesn't have a really really tough look . So  
Yeah . 
Also  
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
But we'll return to that . 
Uh the buttons of course rubber , 
I think everyone agrees . 
And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . 
The chips made of silicon , I guess . 
I think that's the best uh way to do it . 
And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb . 
Then I've uh <other> had a few findings , made a few findings . 
Uh the target audience product style . 
Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like , as you said , uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that . 
They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . 
But of course that's not our uh things this . 
So this is things we must not do . 
And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people , 
which is of course our uh group , 
the people we aim at . 
Um under forty five years old . 
Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours . 
Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , 
that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking . 
But they like soft materials , 
uh so we might uh we have to consider that . 
And also they like curved round shapes . 
So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . 
And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . 
But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we don't really have to consider that . 
Mm . 
Well I also have um several examples of uh styles , 
so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean . 
Uh <other> these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff . 
It was not very uh interesting uh , 
very classical looking , 
but that's n that's not what we want . 
We have these kind of things . 
I don't know what exactly they are . 
It looks like  
Well you know uh you recognise the shapes , 
it's very primary colours , uh bright colours and uh round shapes . 
You also uh <laugh> see uh this device , it's not very round and  
Fruity of course . 
Yeah , it uh  
That's true . 
And uh well round shapes , primary colours . 
You can see it all here . 
And of course uh this famous device . 
I think as you know something uh some devices like this . 
So to give you an idea of uh  
This has a strong look . 
Although it's plastic , it's it's grey to to to give it iron look . 
That's uh  
Yeah . 
Well we have to make a  
Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control . 
I don't think that's very practical , 
but  But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour . 
Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger . 
'Cause if you look at this , it it doesn't look very very strong , 
becau But this is plastic , and and this too , but  
The feel ? 
Uh alright . 
Well  
Mm-hmm . 
And I  Then I have some more findings . Um <other> uh about the energy energy source of the of the device , 
uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . 
I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . 
But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , 
because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun . 
And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote , 
that's a bit , oh , that's a bit uh  That's a bit uh much . 
And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case . 
Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . 
That that's the information I received . 
If you use the curved case , uh a curved case , double curved then you can't use titanium . 
Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look . 
And uh <other> now the the shape , yeah ,  a curved case . 
Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . 
Uh  a more modern look not plain , long box style , but  
<other> I'll draw it , 
but maybe later . 
<laugh> And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have uh  . 
Um anyway  
Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . 
No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , 
because it makes more complex and expensive . 
And , uh as we agreed , we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um <other> uh speak uh speech uh controlled <laugh> device . 
<laugh> Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . 
But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , 
so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , 
which is more complex and expensive . 
But  It's worth the trouble I think , 
because  
Uh rubber is a soft material , I guess . 
Uh soft enough . 
So that's uh basically what I want to talk about . 
Oh , yeah , I understand . Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
But it it's n nice for young people . 
They like gadgets . 
Yeah . 
If it's cheap . Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Can you draw it now of uh  
Can you draw it now ? 
Mm . Alright . 
 button , yeah . 
I suggest a banana shape . 
Because of the fruity uh fashion . 
Yellow and  <laugh> 
Yeah alright , yeah . 
Just a hunch . <laugh> 
Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? 
And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ? 
 
Alright , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
Uh by pe pressing the menu button again . 
By pressing the menu button again , you go uh out . 
It's usual the the the d kind of the way it works . 
Yeah ? Yeah ? 
Yeah . 
But you can men you can press menu again to get out . 
No . 
 
Why would you put it uh then , 
and where is the recording uh the microphone ? 
Where would you put it ? 
Uh-huh . 
Microphone , yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah I understand . 
Uh but uh we could uh d do , but it's perhaps more expensive , uh the speaker on the back or something . 
Alright . 
Well yeah yeah yeah . 
I can live with it . 
They do they don't look fruity enough . 
Tho Yeah those  
But it doesn't uh the  
Yeah , ok Yeah . 
<laugh> But it it must not look too childish of course huh ? 
But it  Yeah .  
Not not too strange . No . 
Exotic yeah . 
We have t 
Yeah , yeah . 
I will design it , we design it later . 
So we'll get to that later I guess . 
The specific shape . The  
<laugh> Our sources . 
But uh we should decide now . 
So we have to uh put it in one uh document . <other> 
Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document , 
and then uh put the answers after the subjects . 
<other> Yeah . 
Well we have to decide all these things ? 
W we can uh override them ? 
Well a case ? Uh that's me . 
Uh I suggest  
Well what do I suggest actually ? <laugh> 
<other> Uh s solid , 
yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah , I understand . 
<other> Yeah . 
So we have titanium . <other> 
<other> Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , 
to give that uh strong look . 
And then the front is made of plastic . 
And you can put that on and off , 
and switch it . 
No but you have titanium of course . 
Uh you have the best of both worlds . 
And of course , yeah , you have the the the plastic front end . 
But you also have the titanium . 
Yeah of course , 
but yeah <other> you have to make a decision . 
I guess so . 
Uh titanium I sh I think uh  
Huh ? 
Well , well the  
According to my sources , uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh  Titanium is available , and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it , if we want . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah , 
I think that's a nice trade-off . 
Alright . 
Yeah , for the front 
and then titanium for the back . 
For the non-removable uh part . 
Well but  <other> 
The titan titanium isn't isn't v very  
Yeah , i it doesn't uh <laugh> curves . 
<laugh> No uh I nei . <laugh> Titanium is very  
No no no , 
but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , 
and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . 
I dunno if if you disagree , 
but I think it's doesn't matter very much . 
And even if it does uh doesn't match , it will uh  People like mm colours that don't match . 
Cop copper uh material . 
Excuse me ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah copper i just a ba basic uh  
Yeah in  
Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh  
 
Oh external ? 
Well  <other> A coffee grind doesn't have  
Na ja . Never mind the coffee grind . 
<laugh> Right ? 
<cough> 
Alright . Mm-hmm . 
Yeah the the the front w 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
For the for the launch , yeah . 
So e th then a c couple of basic colours . 
Not not very uh <other> sim Not  <other> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Very boring , yeah . 
The most boring fronts possible . 
Yeah but you you can have some basic colours , 
and then we come with the special patterns on them , 
and and uh  
And uh  
Uh we still have to make  We have still have to make the es the the real basic design . 
<other> Because yeah we have the sketch but  
<other> 
Alright , yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <other> 
The price ? 
We all agree on that . Yeah . 
Together or uh  
Yeah together . 
How  
Yeah yeah , but how do I  
<laugh> 
<laugh> Some  Some non functional tasks . 
<laugh> You're fired . <laugh> 
No but  <other> 
Well , can we talk about something else ? Uh  <other> 
Uh no I don't know anything , 
but maybe uh anyone else uh  
Yeah ? 
Round I think . 
To make it as uh as round as possible . 
But now I see the  <other> 
Well th th th th th that depends uh . 
Well we uh  
We we j we'll just give them an uh  
We'll design it , 
and then they can give comments on it . 
<other> 
Well yeah . Um I think um <other> a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be  
Yeah , why not ? <other> 
If there's enough space , <other> you can put uh  
We'll we'll  
Well , our slogan is not very long . 
It's just a simple  
What is it ? <laugh> 
<other> You c <other> 
But you can put it on the back , 
on the titanium part . 
The logo and the and the  
Yeah they do . Well yeah . 
Right corner , 
or maybe here in the middle ? 
Yeah 
it it should be hard on the on the on the board , 
and you can remove the front . 
I l I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing . 
But <other> am I the only one , or uh  
No not on the front , 
but on the backside . Uh  
I think it's a nice idea , <other> to make it more recognisable , 
that the next to the logo you have the slogan . 
To make more uh of an impression . 
Not too big . No , 
very small . 
Not <laugh> on the entire back , 
but uh just very small . 
<other> But readable enough of course . 
But we'll uh we'll take that uh with us into the design . 
Lo Uh yeah . 
Or maybe here in the middle , 
but we'll decide later . 
Do you do you see a bit of the of the um of the uh titanium ? O on the front ? 
Uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium , 
 the front is the the upper part , 
and the the bit with the with the L_C_D_ screen . So  
Yeah . 
No no betwe 
of between 
we can do 
but  But then you have two parts of front , two fronts that  
This enti entire bottom ? 
<other> 
And then the lower part is titanium ? 
I think that's nice , yeah . 
Yeah . 
I like that bit of uh titanium also on the uh  
A bit like uh a bit like your mobile phone . 
Maybe you can show it . 
It also has the those <laugh> two distinct uh  
Mm bit like this . 
Uh it's uh  
Yeah yeah . <other> 
That uh  
Yeah . Maybe a nice touch , yeah . 
 
I think I'm going to buy it . 
That's a bit too much , but  
No , no no no , 
but <other> I think uh this looks uh pretty nice actually . 
Of course , because it's my design but  
No our d our design , alright . 
But don't erase my cat . 
I want to preserve it . 
<laugh> 
What are you doing chief ? 
Yeah 
until the until the beep goes . 
But I don't uh  Do we have to stay here , 
or I think we have to return first . 
The high powers from above <other> will have to tell us , yeah . 
Yeah , touch-pads , yeah . 
We can uh do a touch-pad on our remote . 
<laugh> No just kidding . 
Well we have uh b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too , 
because it becomes too too too too stressy . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
But uh th youth doesn't care about functio functionality , so  
Yeah . 
Bless you . <laugh> 
Mm . 
Too much ? 
Well they uh  
I think that's good . 
We all had uh our talk 
and we agree I guess on uh several thing , on most uh on things . 
Yeah you have to push harder . <laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Where's the good old chalk board with the the green board with the , how do you call it , chalk , yeah . 
Yeah , maybe . 
Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated , we can draw a thing quick , and then before it uh <other> goes off again . 
Maybe w maybe we maybe w m Can we get email here ? 
Huh ? Yeah . 
Guess so . 
<laugh> A happy hol happy holidays . <laugh>
