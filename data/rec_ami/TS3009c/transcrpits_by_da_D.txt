I'm listening . 
Right . 
Great . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Alright , great . 
Yeah , great . 
Alright , Trendwatch . 
 
Right . 
I will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , 
and uh things we must not do . 
Uh the trends . <other> 
It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling . 
Uh this because of our last model was very functional , 
but <other> it uh people didn't like that , 
so our new mo model must be very good-looking . 
That's uh something you uh have to take a look at . 
And uh the feeling has to be very great . 
Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great . 
Um there's a minus uh two times here , because this is the most important point . 
This is uh two times as less important , 
and uh same for this one . 
<other> Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too . 
Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier . 
So we have to have uh something like that , 
like we uh  
Right . 
<other> Uh the last point is easy to use . 
Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself . 
I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that . 
Yeah ? 
Yeah , I know . 
I think we have to go for the first one . 
It's the most important one . 
So  we have to uh take that one . 
So it it <other> it isn't very important that <other> that it works easy . 
<laugh> But <other> it has to look great . 
We'll see . <other> 
Yeah , right . 
But the most important thing is that it looks great 
and people say  wow , that's real great uh great concept . 
Alright . 
Uh these are the new colours of this year . 
So it must be very bright , very colourful . 
People like this . 
So we we have to think uh in this direction . 
So i set your mind to it . 
Findings ? Fashion update ? 
Fruit and vegetables are cool . 
I am told . <laugh> 
The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables . 
So <laugh> we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way . 
Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong . 
I was thinking of something like uh <other> well uh iron plate over it , 
maybe in a colour or something , 
that looks so f really flashy 
but it it is also strong . 
And that's uh also for the younger public . 
Yeah , that's great . 
But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin . 
So it looks very heavy 
but you can still uh use it very easily . 
Well , the don'ts . 
Older people like dark colours and simple shapes . 
Well we don't want uh older people , 
we want young people . 
So uh we're gonna turn that around . 
We're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours . 
Right ? 
Okay . 
We don't want wood . 
Old people . 
So , that's it for me . 
Yeah , we should change that . 
No no no . 
<laugh> 
Mm . Yeah . 
<laugh> 
We keep coming back to the fronts . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> Fruity . <laugh> Fruity . 
Well it's got a strong look , this . Yeah . 
Yeah , it still has a strong look . 
But then you are losing your fruity colours . 
That's true . 
Yeah but the  
But it doesn't have to look strong . 
The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy . 
The feel . 
Nah yeah the feel  
Right . 
I agree . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> I dunno . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah right . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . Right . 
<laugh> 
Oh okay . 
 
Right . 
No . 
But that that makes it cheap . 
It's <other> it's just a an extra function , 
and it's cheap . 
No but <other>  
Yeah , right . <other> 
Young people love them . 
Yeah , ple 
Right . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Alright . 
How  How  
How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen ? 
Alright . 
So you have a menu button , 
and then you can go up and down . 
Yeah right . 
Yeah . <other> 
<laugh> 
 . 
 You have to push hard . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
You've  
Right . 
And you you need a you need a speaker . 
For the   
Yeah . Yeah . 
Exit . 
But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part . 
Or don't  
Right , 
and spea speaker at the back , or something . 
<laugh> Alright . 
Alright . 
Yeah , fine . <laugh> 
Move on . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<other> Nei They're n they're not trendy . 
It doesn't look strong . <laugh> 
Yeah right . 
This is just crazy . 
Nah th It's too expensive . 
Yeah . 
But are we going for a strange uh form ? 
'Cause people like that . 
Not too strange . 
You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is . 
I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone , with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms , s something like that . 
You know ?  
Yeah , 
but people like something uh new you know . 
Yeah , different . 
Y yis 
Alright . Great . 
Your bag . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Materials are the most , most impor 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Do you know the new uh  
No <other> no <other> 
The front is the most important . 
But the feel of plastic isn't strong . <other> 
Yeah alright , alright . 'Kay . 
Yeah . <other> 
Fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas 
Yeah , but it it's expensive . 
Bendable . 
<laugh> Bendable . 
Yeah . 
Paint spray . 
Yeah alright . 
So , 
we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front ? 
Yeah , great . 
Yeah . 
But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you can't switch it . 
When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match . 
You know ? 
<laugh> I understand . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . 
Alright . 
Yeah . Alright . 
<laugh> Funky customers . 
Alright . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Nei . 
So external . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<sighs> Alright . 
<other> 
I think we can launch a couple of packages . 
You can buy a different kind of of of machine , 
but it's the same thing , but with another front . 
So  
And you can you can  
Yeah right . 
Yeah but if you if you launch uh five different packages like iPod mini  
Yeah . 
It's good marketing . 
Yeah , 
n not too heavy . 
You can always take another pick . <laugh> 
<laugh> They have to buy it later on . 
<laugh> Yeah right . 
<laugh> More basic . 
<laugh> Yeah . <laugh> <other> 
Yeah , right . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But we we must remember that <other> fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing . 
Else it w won't sell . 
So  
<laugh> Lost my mouse . <laugh> 
<laugh> Unbelievable . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah togeth <laugh> 
<laugh> You can take the SMARTboard . <laugh> 
<laugh> Have fun <laugh> . 
'Kay . 
We don't have produ product yet , 
so kind of difficult . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
 Ajax . Nah . 
Um round . 
Yeah . Round . 
Curvy . Yeah . 
So you can see you have to up or down . 
And this must be uh volume I think , 
and this programme . 
Yeah . <other> 
Yeah , that's right . 
Yeah . Okay . 
Yeah , I noticed . 
You can't uh click the corners . 
It's a real real great thing . 
<laugh> Let's start the design . 
O 
Yeah . Me too . 
But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts . So  <other> 
Yeah , right . 
The logo  
Yeah . 
But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front . 
Yeah . <other> Yeah . 
Yeah , 
Yeah . 
I agree . 
But not too big . 
Just uh  
<laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh>  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
No no no no . 
Else you you get problems with the L_C_D_ . 
Yeah . Some some kind of wei weight in it . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
So uh a little corner of titanium . 
So this this is the exchangeable part . 
<laugh> 
Right . 
<laugh> Taking all the credit . <laugh> 
But there's a problem . 
Yeah . Nah that's alright , that's alright . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
 This one is empty . 
You have to empty one huh ? 
<laugh> 
Alright . 
No  
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I I don't have a laptop . 
Yeah right . 
<laugh> Half 
No . 
It's all about cool things . 
And it will sell . 
We will be rich . 
No . 
<laugh> 
No man . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Mm . 
Recalibrate it . 
Yeah . 
Finish meeting now . 
Yeah . Oh . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Alright . Have fun lads . 
<laugh> 
but you can scratch it off or something . 
It's better if you have it uh  
Yeah . 
You have to make this titanium too . 
Like dust in it and so things like that . 
When you exchange all the fronts and it's open . 
you can make it go round this corner too where the logo is . 
Because it has to be uh there all the time you know . 
We can't uh take a blank one . 
Or can we ? 
It's not relaxing . 
<laugh> Dream on . <laugh> 
You just have to push harder .
