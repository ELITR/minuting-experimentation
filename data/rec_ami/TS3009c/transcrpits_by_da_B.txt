 
Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Bananas . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Soccer fronts . <laugh> Mm . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
And it it doesn't have to be strong , also . 
<other> Only the feel . <other> 
<other> 
Oh . 
<laugh> 
 
Yeah . Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material . 
Because people like that . 
Yeah . Right . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier . 
Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented . 
Um we must decide where , this meeting . 
Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , 
<other> um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . 
And um well they're cheap , 
so we could use them now . 
Um it's not really speech recognition , 
it's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , 
and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . 
So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that . 
No it doesn't does not do anything . 
But i it's just a  
Yeah it's it's cheap . 
No 
but that's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks . 
Yes , we we should really uh include that one , I think . Um  
Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . 
Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and  uh and that kind of stuff <laugh> 
um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons . 
I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that . 
Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . 
For the learnability 
and uh well to keep it recognisable . 
A voice recognition can be uh implemented . 
And uh I drew an example , 
but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do . 
Hmm ? 
Well I have the  I can draw it again , 
and I know what I did wrong . 
I didn't tick the note bo box in the  . Um  
<other> Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the  
Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen . 
Yes . 
<other> Um I shall draw this . If it uh works . 
Mm so have I . 
<laugh> 
Nah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct . 
Yeah just uh the numbers . 
<other> 
These these will be bigger in the the real design . 
This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen . 
And with this you can uh , yes , go to through the menus 
and that can 
Um the video button should be uh an apart button , 
because you want it to uh t , yeah , to use it fast within one uh click . 
Um it's  <other> 
Hmm ? 
This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus  
Well we we can add another button here , but  
Yeah . 
Ah right . 
Well you you  
No no , 
we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button 
and this the Okay button . 
Ah once you have an extra Menu button , you don't need that that extra option . 
You have uh redundancy . 
Yeah , 
if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should . 
Well they that could be anywhere . 
That's very small . 
It could be uh down here . 
<other> Um . Well , not here . 
I <other> yeah I suggest here . 
But that's just a little <other> gap . Yeah . 
Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Well i 
Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , 
so they won't be uh very expensive . But  
This is my suggested design . 
Um  Yes . 
And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . 
<cough> But  <laugh> 
Oh , um I had some uh examples . 
You can uh  
<other> But  I did not like it very much , but  
Well these are quite obvious , very ugly remote . <laugh> Um  
No , well th 
Yeah . 
Well not all . <laugh> 
Uh this is for children but <other> th 
<laugh> No . 
W but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to . 
Well this is a terrible  
Um this looks  
Yeah . 
This uh these are the L_C_D_ screens . 
I think we should , if it's um possible , uh one with colours , but  
I don't know uh  
Too expensive ? 
Alright . 
Well  Nah . 
Ha , even more . N 
Well  
<other> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , this is what we've just done . Right ? 
Ah right . 
<other> 
Not everything . 
Yeah but <other> all these examples are uh of a coffee machine . 
I think we  <other> 
Why don't we um use uh titanium 
or or a hard , yeah , some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front . 
That  
Just like um most cell phones are . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
No but you you have this  
Yeah . 
Yeah , you have the re remote in your hand like this . 
So you feel titanium .  
Yeah . 
And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to . 
Yeah . 
Well any colour   
Yeah , 
then you you paint it in the colour you want it . 
The plastic is is the colour you want it . 
So   Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Well titanium is neutral . <other> 
<laugh> <other> 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
Well  
Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours , 
and they don't use uh wood . 
Mm . Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
The electrical cable uh does  
No we don't use an electrical cable . 
Yeah inside , 
but this is for the coffee uh machine . 
Yeah , 
but that's not what's meant here , I think . <other> 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Well I got a better one here 
and I will um  
The shared folder . 
I will work this out uh for the uh next meeting . 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
that's the whole idea of the front . 
Yes . 
But that's for later on . 
The fronts y you can do anything with them . 
Yeah , right  
For the uh initiative uh launch . 
Mm . 
Oh yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . Yeah . 
Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so , 
so that they can uh experiment with it 
and that they want more . 
Red red , blue and green you give them or something , 
and then you can give them  uh other ones . 
<other> 
Yeah we should do that . 
Mm . 
Yeah , 
we can do that . 
But bu we stay we stay here or something ? 
Ah right . <laugh> 
And take it to our rooms 
and uh  <laugh> 
Ah , 
specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . <other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . Um  
Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ? 
Yeah I I I also uh thought  Yeah . 
And these uh these s these buttons <laugh> uh are more uh triangle-ish shaped 
with a square one in the middle . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Mm . 
<other> Well most of the time uh up and down is programme 
and left and right are volume , I think . 
Yeah , it depends , but  
If you turn up the volume , you always see this thingy go up . <other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah alright . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Uh I I'd say only the logo . 
Too much text and it gets too too busy . 
Well <other> it's quite a long phrase . 
Ah the logo should be on the top I think . 
Right corner , yes . 
 uh the text ? 
Yeah . 
Uh yeah , at the back ? 
Well you c Well uh  Yes . 
You can  
The logo can be on on every uh front . 
Yeah , but then you must uh really uh yeah <laugh> push it in or something . 
<other> 
Yeah , on the backside . 
Well n n not not on the front side , I think . 
<other> On the back  Yes , you you can , yeah , push that in , 
<other> so that it is always be there . 
Yeah . 
Yeah I think over here the logo . <laugh> <other> 
Yes 
we could  
No , they have two fronts , 
that . You you can  
Yeah . Yeah . <other> Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
No , you can you can just  And then not a straight line but uh some sort of wave or something . 
This is titanium . 
And this is uh  
F front . 
Yeah . 
With the with the curved edge . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> <laugh> Tada . 
Yeah . 
Ah . 
Yeah , 
that's nice finishing touch you need . 
Yeah , this is the front . 
My design . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
We'll stay here I guess ? 
Well we can uh erase an animal I guess . 
Uh the fourth one . 
Uh the fourth one is empty , isn't it ? 
Yeah . 
 
Yeah . 
Yeah I think we have to wait ? 
<other> <laugh> 
Maybe . 
<other> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> Aha . This has no function . <laugh> 
We've done too much in the previous meetings . 
Yes , 
we've got nothing to do now . <laugh> 
Its the best remote ever . 
<laugh> Pinball . 
Yes , but you you get really close to the screen with your hand , 
and I don't think that's  
Hmm . 
<tuts> 
We can better uh draw a design on this . <laugh> 
Yeah , but we can't . 
Well  <other> 
We'll stay here ? 
Or we'll get the email . 
Yeah . 
Well we'll wait a few seconds 
and then we'll get an email . 
Yeah .
