Okay . 
Uh door is closed . <laugh> 
Well , let's begin . 
Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting , we'll have to hurry up . 
Um well I'll start with the presentation again , the agenda . 
Yo . 
So . 
<other> <laugh> Uh  <laugh> 
This one I think . 
<laugh> Uh yeah . 
Well alright . 
Um well , I'll show you the notes . 
It's not as uh interesting as it should be 
because we just uh had the meeting , 
but I'll show them . 
We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design . 
Um  
Then we'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts . 
I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder , which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take . 
So <other> this time we exactly know what to decide about . 
And then we'll close again . 
Uh  
Well these are some examples , 
but we'll talk about them later . 
We'll <other> first look at your uh presentations . Alright ? 
Walter will uh start again this time ? 
Yo . 
'Kay . 
<laugh> 
'Kay . 
Less . <laugh> 
<clicks tongue> 
Well , yeah . 
L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts . 
Well , easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh  
Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use . 
Well we have to choose one of them . <laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
We'll we'll look at uh  . 
'Kay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
So  
Well  
<other> 
Yeah , well  
Yeah . 
B 
Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . 
Th this year it's fruits 
but next year it's it's something totally different . 
Yes . 
Yep , alright . 
<laugh> 
Wood is popular . Aha . 
<laugh> Yeah yeah yeah . 
Alright . 
Nice , uh well  show us . 
Well maybe it it it is , 
but it doesn't look strong . 
So maybe  
But we still have to look at our price of course . 
Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh  
Yeah ? 
<laugh> 
Yes . 
Sports uh , they're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh 
 Huh ? <laugh> 
That's nice . <laugh> 
All the  results ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . <laugh> Nai . Uh no . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
It's t terrible . 
Alright . 
<other> 
Hmm ? 
Yeah , alright . 
Yeah . And it's round . 
Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . 
So uh those kind of things you can you can combine . 
No , it isn't . 
Okay . 
Yes . 
So , if you ti 
Well  
You you  
Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something . 
So it it looks pretty but it feels strong . 
<laugh>  No titanium . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
What do you exactly mean with double curved ? 
Double curved ? 
It it mean  
Yeah , well okay . <laugh> 
Well  
This soft material thing from uh  Yeah . 
Alright . Okay . 
We will take that . 
And then uh Mike ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
<other> Oh  
That's interesting . 
Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function . 
Oh . 
That's a bit uh  
Yes . I understand . 
But <other> it has no functionality for our remote at all . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ? 
Ah . 
But then we should also have an uh an Okay button . 
Just uh  <other> 
There is already a blank . Yes ? 
So  Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh>  
<laugh> 
No 
m Next year that's out . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yes . 
And what's the menu button ? 
But how did  How do you get out of the menu then ? Yeah . 
Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay . Uh  
Yes , well but 
bec because when you <other> push Menu you get in , 
and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice . 
Well that's also the Okay button . 
That's you you should have uh  
Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out . 
Exit  . 
Well , it's just a choice . 
<laugh> 
Huh ? 
Yeah ? Okay . 
Well , okay , alright . 
Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make . 
I'd  I agree . 
<laugh> Fine . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yes ? 
Too big . 
<laugh> 
They're all black . 
<laugh> Hey , that one I like . <laugh> 
No . 
<laugh> The remote . <laugh> 
Terrible . 
It's it's all too much buttons . 
Too many buttons . 
That's  
Well , that's too expensive I think . 
Alright . Yeah . 
Okay . 
Huh . 
Mm no . <laugh> 
'Kay . 
No , not very strange . 
It still has t 
Yes . 
Th 
a a kind of bridge . 
So it f falls over the hand . 
Yeah ? Yeah ? 
Yeah . 
Well I have at home <other> a remote with a bridge . 
It's just a half round half half circle at  
And then it falls exactly over the hand , 
and that's very nice . 
That's  It feels comfortable . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , alright . 
Um where did I put it ? 
Um conceptual phase , I think this is it . 
I got this from our friends . 
So  <laugh> Uh yeah the conceptual design . 
These are a few examples which we have to decide about . 
All the the materials from the case , uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story . 
Um  
<laugh> Yeah . 
Um now from the user interface , your uh package ? <laugh> 
Um where  
No well , that's more like the buttons where they have to come . 
And um  B a bit of , yeah well , a bit of uh design . 
Yes , 
but we have to decide about these now . 
And uh the trend-watching . 
So as you said , fruity is in , 
well  sells good . 
Wow . 
Uh these things . 
Uh yes . 
Um so if we uh go through them  
<vocal noise> 
Yeah well uh  
Why should I uh  
Yeah . 
So  
What what kind of properties should it have ? 
Well we just listened . 
You know what ? 
Alright . 
I've uh  
Titanium back , plastic front . 
Okay . 
Um well I am going to put it in here , 
uh because we can uh look . 
I  Um solid feel and trendy look . 
So material , um hard plastic 
for the front ? 
<laugh> 
Okay . And well 
the the electrical cable is just normal uh  . <laugh> 
It's uh from uh our coffee uh  
  
<laugh> 
Of course . 
Well uh 
all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work . 
So  <laugh> 
The chip is normal silicon . 
Uh the buttons are normal , etcetera . 
Okay ? 
So that's just easy . 
Uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our <other> earlier uh remotes . 
The conceptual specification of the user interface ? 
Um well we have our beautiful drawing . 
Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder , 
and then I'll put it in our end report . 
Yes , 
you can  
Mm yeah . You can uh put some uh which button is what . 
Okay . Um 
the trend-watching  
 included these days . 
And what do we ? 
We thing that fruit and bright colours are  
Yes . 
We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot . 
Uh those kind of things . 
Yeah . 
Launch different lines at once . 
We should not give them the m the most lovely front when they buy it for the first time . 
Yeah .  <laugh> 
Come on . <laugh> 
We still have to make those fifty million , yeah ? <laugh> . 
The most ugly . 
Two . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Alright . 
Um well the buttons etcetera , we get from Mike . 
Uh this fruit and bright colours , 
yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour , we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch , when we uh <other> well introduce our remote . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
Well I'll have to , 
before I get another warning for five minutes , I'm going to get  
Where is my mouse ? 
Uh where is my mouse ? <laugh> 
Oh yeah . <laugh> 
Um this is it . 
<laugh> 
Well , um this we have . 
Uh basic stuff . 
Interface we have . Supplements , L_C_D_ . 
Maybe a a cheap voice recording . 
Well  
Yes . Alright . 
Individual actions . 
Industry designer ,  . User Interface , Mike . You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . 
<laugh> That's what I got uh to hear . 
Yes 
well we'll get it to hear that I think . 
But I think so . 
Th they're saying SMARTboard and that's it  
This is the SMARTboard , so  
Um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype , 
and y Well that's includes uh specifying the buttons etcetera . 
Yeah . 
So you'll get it on your em on your laptop . 
Um well you will go and do something else uh on the project <laugh> 
yeah project evaluation . 
So um  
 , what are you going to do ? 
Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means , 
but uh you'll get uh the specifications . 
Yeah . 
That's why I uh  
But uh  
How long do we still have ? <laugh> 
Yeah .  
Why does  
Ah f fuck you . 
Heh ? 
<other> 
<laugh> We can't get  
Ts 
It doesn't work any more . 
We can't save them . 
So we'll just have them uh standing there . 
No . <laugh> 
It's a bit uh bit a pity . 
<cough> Well we still have uh more than five minutes . 
Um  
So <other> 
what are we going to do ? 
<other> 
I as Project Manager ha don't have a clue . <laugh> 
Oh we can uh decide how we implement <other> the feeling from our company into the remote . 
Also the slogan ? On the  
We put the fashion in electronics . 
We put the fashion in electronics . 
On the top . Yeah . 
Well in in in the right top corner ? 
And well you c 
On the back , you can put uh h <other> At the bottom , you can put the logo with the  
Yeah . 
Just just small . 
Yeah well  
Carved into the material .

Well , management would like it . <laugh> 
The front side , no no l no slogan . 
Sorry . 
Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo 
and logo also on the front 
but not exchange uh  Uh ? Hmm ? <laugh>  Uh when changing fronts . 
Alright , that's decided . 
Five minutes left . 
So a bit of titanium between ? 
That's a bit  Oh that that's that's pretty cool .

Yes . 
I already have uh all kinds of uh filth between the mobile .

The Phillips remote uh costs more . <laugh> 
Well uh you two are going to work together . 
You'll get your uh specifications on your uh laptop , 
and then uh <other> you uh  
Well I think we can , 
I just   It's

Or get your mouse . 
Because it's little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates . 
I always have a mouse next to my laptop . 
I hate these  
Ugh .

And in your remote control . 
So we put a touch pad on it , 
and say ha ha .
