D:  <laugh> 
A:  Um well , I'll show you the notes . It's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting , but I'll show them . We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design . Um  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Then we'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts . I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder , which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take . So <other> this time we exactly know what to decide about . And then we'll close again . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  <laugh> Alright , great . 
C:  Alright . 
A:  Uh  Well these are some examples , but we'll talk about them later . We'll <other> first look at your uh presentations . Alright ? 
C:  Mm-hmm . 


A:  Walter will uh start again this time ? 
D:  Yeah , great . 
A:  Yo . 
D:  Yeah ? 
C:  Easy to use ? I think that's your ta 
A:  Well , easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh  Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use . Well we have to choose one of them . <laugh> 
B:   
D:  Yeah , I know . I think we have to go for the first one . It's the most important one . So  we have to uh take that one . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Mm . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  So it it <other> it isn't very important that <other> that it works easy . <laugh> But <other> it has to look great . 
B:  Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use . 
C:  <other> 
A:  Yeah . We'll we'll look at uh  . 
D:  We'll see . <other> 
C:  You  Yeah . Yeah , yeah , you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use  <other> It's not a very comp complicated device . 
D:  Yeah , right . 
C:  Alright . 
A:  'Kay . 
D:  But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say  wow , that's real great uh great concept . 
D:  Old people . So , that's it for me . 
A:  Alright . Nice , 


A:  uh well  show us . 
A:  Yeah ? 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  Sports uh , they're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh  Huh ? <laugh> That's nice . <laugh> 
B:  Soccer fronts . <laugh> Mm . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Mm . 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  Well I also have um 
A:  All the  results ? 
D:  We keep coming back to the fronts . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  several examples of uh styles , so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh <other> these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  Yeah .

D:  Yeah . Right . 
B:  Yeah . Right . Yeah . 
A:  Alright . Okay . We will take that . 


A:  And then uh Mike ? Okay . 
B:  Yeah . Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier . 
B:  Um I shall draw this . If it uh works . 
C:   button , yeah . 
A:  Just uh  <other> There is already a blank . Yes ? So  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . <other> 
B:  Mm so have I . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Nah . 
D:   .  You have to push hard . 
A:  <laugh>  
D:  <laugh> <laugh> 
C:  I suggest a banana shape . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Because of the fruity uh fashion . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  No m Next year that's out .

B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah alright , yeah . Just a hunch . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  Huh . Mm no . <laugh> 


A:  Um where did I put it ? Um conceptual phase , I think this is it . 
C:  The specific shape . The  
B:  <other> 
A:  I got this from our friends . So  <laugh> Uh yeah the conceptual design . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Our sources . 
A:  These are a few examples which we have to decide about . All the the materials from the case , uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story . Um  
D:  Your bag . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . Um now from the user interface , your uh package ? <laugh> Um where  No well , that's more like the buttons where they have to come . And um  B a bit of , yeah well , a bit of uh design . 
B:  Yeah , this is what we've just done . Right ? 
C:  But uh we should decide now . 
A:  Yes , but we have to decide about these now . And uh the trend-watching . So as you said , fruity is in , well  sells good . Wow . Uh these things . 
B:  Ah right . 
D:  Yeah . Materials are the most , most impor 
B:  <other> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  So we have to uh put it in one uh document . <other> 
A:  Uh yes . Um so if we uh go through them  
C:  Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document , and then uh put the answers after the subjects . <other> Yeah . 
A:  <vocal noise> 
B:  Not everything . 
C:  Well we have to decide all these things ? 
B:  Yeah but <other> all these examples are uh of a coffee machine . 
A:  Yeah well uh  
C:  W we can uh override them ? 
A:  Why should I uh  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> 
A:  So  
A:  Okay . And well the the electrical cable is just normal uh  . <laugh> 
C:  Cop copper uh material . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Excuse me ? 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  The electrical cable uh does  
A:  It's uh from uh our coffee uh  
C:  Yeah copper i just a ba basic uh  
B:  No we don't use an electrical cable . Yeah inside , but this is for the coffee uh machine . 
A:    
C:  Yeah in  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh  
A:  Of course . 
B:  Yeah , but that's not what's meant here , I think . <other> 
D:  Nei . 
C:   
D:  So external . 
B:  <other> 
C:  Oh external ? Well  <other> A coffee grind doesn't have  Na ja . Never mind the coffee grind . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Well uh all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  work . So  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Right ? 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  The chip is normal silicon . Uh the buttons are normal , etcetera . Okay ? So that's just easy . Uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our <other> earlier uh remotes . The conceptual specification of the user interface ? 
C:  <cough> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Alright . Mm-hmm . 
A:  Um well we have our beautiful drawing . 
D:  <sighs> Alright . 
B:  Well I got a better one here and I will um  
A:  Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder , and then I'll put it in our end report . 
B:  The shared folder . I will work this out uh for the uh next meeting . 
A:  Yes , you can  
D:  <other> 
B:  Yeah yeah yeah 
A:  Mm yeah . You can uh put some uh which button is what . 


A:  Yes . Well I'll have to , before I get another warning for five minutes , I'm going to get  
C:  Alright , yeah . 
A:  Where is my mouse ? Uh where is my mouse ? <laugh>

D:  Yeah . 
A:  Well  Yes . Alright . Individual actions . 
B:  Yeah we should do that . 
C:  The price ? We all agree on that . Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  Industry designer ,  . User Interface , Mike . You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . 
B:  Yeah , we can do that . 
C:  Together or uh  Yeah together . How  Yeah yeah , but how do I  
D:  Yeah togeth <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> That's what I got uh to hear .

C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> You can take the SMARTboard . <laugh> 
B:  Ah right . <laugh> And take it to our rooms and uh  <laugh> 
A:  This is the SMARTboard , so  Um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype , and y Well that's includes uh specifying the buttons etcetera . 
B:  Ah , specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . <other> 
A:  Yeah . So you'll get it on your em on your laptop . Um well you will go and do something else uh on the project <laugh> yeah project evaluation . So um  
D:  <laugh> Have fun <laugh> . 'Kay . 
C:  <laugh> Some  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Some non functional tasks . 
A:   , what are you going to do ? Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means , but uh you'll get uh the specifications . 
D:  We don't have produ product yet , so kind of difficult . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . That's why I uh  But uh  
C:  <laugh> You're fired . <laugh> No but  <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh>

C:  Uh no I don't know anything , but maybe uh anyone else uh  Yeah ? 
D:   Ajax . Nah . 
B:  Yeah . Um  Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ? Yeah I I I also uh thought  Yeah . 
D:  Um round . Yeah . Round . 
C:  Round I think . To make it as uh as round as possible . 
B:  And these uh these s these buttons <laugh> uh are more uh triangle-ish shaped with a square one in the middle . Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Why does  
D:  Curvy . Yeah . So you can see you have to up or down . 
A:  Ah f fuck you . 
C:  But now I see the  <other> 
D:  And this must be uh volume I think , and this programme . 
A:  Heh ? 
B:  Mm . 
A:  <other> <laugh> We can't get  
B:  <other> Well most of the time uh up and down is programme and left and right are volume , I think . 
C:  Well th th th th th that depends uh . 
D:  Yeah . <other> 
B:  Yeah , it depends , but  
C:  Well we uh  
B:  If you turn up the volume , you always see this thingy go up . <other> 
C:  We we j we'll just give them an uh  We'll design it , and then they can give comments on it . 
D:  Yeah , that's right . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah alright . 
D:  Yeah . Okay . 
A:  Ts It doesn't work any more . We can't save them . So we'll just have them uh standing there . 
D:  Yeah , I noticed . You can't uh click the corners . 
A:  No . <laugh> It's a bit uh bit a pity . <cough> Well we still have uh more than five minutes . Um  
B:  <laugh>

C:  <other> 
A:  So <other> what are we going to do ? <other> I as Project Manager ha don't have a clue . <laugh> Oh we can uh decide how we implement <other> the feeling from our company into the remote . 
D:  <laugh> Let's start the design . 
C:  I think I'm going to buy it . 
A:  <laugh> We want it . And it's only f twenty five Euros . Come on . No that's nothing . 
B:  Yeah , this is the front .

B:  This is the  <laugh> 
C:  That's a bit too much , but  No , no no no , but <other> I think uh this looks uh pretty nice actually . Of course , because it's my design but  No our d our design , alright .

D:  Right . 
B:  My design . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Taking all the credit . <laugh> 
A:  Well uh you two are going to work together . You'll get your uh specifications on your uh laptop , and then uh <other> you uh  


B:  Yeah . We'll stay here I guess ? 
D:  But there's a problem . We can't uh take a blank one . Or can we ? 
A:  Well I think we can , I just   It's  
B:  Well we can uh erase an animal I guess . Uh the fourth one . 
D:  Yeah . Nah that's alright , that's alright .

B:  <other> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah right . <laugh> Dream on . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  And in your remote control . So we put a touch pad on it , and say ha ha . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> We know you'll you'll you'll hate it but <laugh>  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Aha . This has no function . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Half 
C:  <laugh> But uh th youth doesn't care about functio functionality , so  
D:  No .
