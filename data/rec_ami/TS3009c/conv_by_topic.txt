A:  Okay . Uh door is closed . <laugh> Well , let's begin . Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting , we'll have to hurry up . Um well I'll start with the presentation again , the agenda . 
C:  <other> 
D:  I'm listening . Right . 
C:  <other> <other> 
D:  Great . 
A:  Yo . So . <other> <laugh> Uh  <laugh> This one I think . <laugh> Uh yeah . Well alright . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Um well , I'll show you the notes . It's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting , but I'll show them . We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design . Um  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Then we'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts . I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder , which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take . So <other> this time we exactly know what to decide about . And then we'll close again . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  <laugh> Alright , great . 
C:  Alright . 
A:  Uh  Well these are some examples , but we'll talk about them later . We'll <other> first look at your uh presentations . Alright ? 
C:  Mm-hmm .

A:  Walter will uh start again this time ? 
D:  Yeah , great . 
A:  Yo . 
D:  Yeah ? 
C:  Easy to use ? I think that's your ta 
A:  Well , easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh  Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use . Well we have to choose one of them . <laugh> 
B:   
D:  Yeah , I know . I think we have to go for the first one . It's the most important one . So  we have to uh take that one . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Mm . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  So it it <other> it isn't very important that <other> that it works easy . <laugh> But <other> it has to look great . 
B:  Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use . 
C:  <other> 
A:  Yeah . We'll we'll look at uh  . 
D:  We'll see . <other> 
C:  You  Yeah . Yeah , yeah , you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use  <other> It's not a very comp complicated device . 
D:  Yeah , right . 
C:  Alright . 
A:  'Kay . 
D:  But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say  wow , that's real great uh great concept . 
D:  Old people . So , that's it for me . 
A:  Alright . Nice ,

D:  Alright , Trendwatch . 
A:  'Kay . 
D:   
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Right . I will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and uh things we must not do . Uh the trends . <other> It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling . 
A:  'Kay . 
D:  Uh this because of our last model was very functional , but <other> it uh people didn't like that , so our new mo model must be very good-looking . That's uh something you uh have to take a look at . And uh the feeling has to be very great . Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Alright . Alright . 
D:  Um there's a minus uh two times here , because this is the most important point . This is uh two times as less important , and uh same for this one . <other> Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too . 
A:  Less . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <clicks tongue> 
D:  <other> <laugh> Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier . So we have to have uh something like that , like we uh  
A:  Well , yeah . L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts . 
D:  Right . <other> Uh the last point is easy to use . Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself . I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that .

D:  Alright . Uh these are the new colours of this year . So it must be very bright , very colourful . People like this . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <other> <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  So we we have to think uh in this direction . So i set your mind to it . Findings ? Fashion update ? Fruit and vegetables are cool . I am told . <laugh> 
A:  So  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Well  
C:  <laugh> Uh you think ? 
A:  <other> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables . So <laugh> we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way . Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong . I was thinking of something like uh <other> well uh iron plate over it , maybe in a colour or something , that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong . And that's uh also for the younger public . 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , well  
B:  Bananas . 
C:  Mm . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:   
A:  B Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . Th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different . 
D:  Yeah , that's great . But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin . So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yes . 
C:  Mm . 
A:  Yep , alright . 
D:  Well , the don'ts . Older people like dark colours and simple shapes . Well we don't want uh older people , we want young people . So uh we're gonna turn that around . We're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours . Right ? Okay . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh>  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Alright . 
A:  Wood is popular . Aha . 
D:  We don't want wood . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah yeah yeah .

A:  uh well  show us . 
A:  Yeah ?

A:  <laugh> 
A:  Sports uh , they're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh  Huh ? <laugh> That's nice . <laugh> 
B:  Soccer fronts . <laugh> Mm . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Mm . 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  Well I also have um 
A:  All the  results ? 
D:  We keep coming back to the fronts . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  several examples of uh styles , so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh <other> these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> Hmm ? Yeah , alright . 
C:  So that's uh basically what I want to talk about . 
D:  Yeah . Right . 
B:  Yeah . Right . Yeah . 
A:  Alright . Okay . We will take that .

C:  Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design . Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties . This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device . And the materials ? Um I have heard several things , so I uh I'll have to change that on the way . But uh the case ? Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic . But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong . It should feel strong . So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient . We should move to uh something  
D:  Yeah , we should change that . 
A:  Well maybe it it it is , but it doesn't look strong . So maybe  
C:  Well yeah . Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , but it doesn't have a really really tough look . So  
D:  No no no . 
A:  But we still have to look at our price of course . Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh  
C:  Yeah . Also  Yeah . Mm-hmm . But we'll return to that . Uh the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . The chips made of silicon , I guess . I think that's the best uh way to do it . And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb . 
topic_description:	None


C:  Then I've uh <other> had a few findings , made a few findings . Uh the target audience product style . Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like , as you said , uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that . They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . But of course that's not our uh things this . So this is things we must not do . And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people , which is of course our uh group , the people we aim at . Um under forty five years old . Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours . 
A:  Yes . 
C:  Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking . But they like soft materials , uh so we might uh we have to consider that . And 
D:  Mm . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  also they like curved round shapes . So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we don't really have to consider that . 
topic_description:	None


C:  It was not very uh interesting uh , very classical looking , but that's n that's not what we want . We have these kind of things . I don't know what exactly they are . It looks like  Well you know uh you recognise the shapes , it's very primary colours , uh bright colours and uh round shapes . You also uh <laugh> see uh this device , it's not very round and  Fruity of course . Yeah , it uh  That's true . 
A:  Mm-hmm . <laugh> Nai . Uh no . 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  <laugh> Fruity . <laugh> Fruity . 
A:  <laugh> <laugh> It's t terrible . Alright . 
C:  And uh well round shapes , primary colours . You can see it all here . And of course uh this famous device . I think as you know something uh some devices like this . So to give you an idea of uh  
topic_description:	None


D:  Well it's got a strong look , this . Yeah . 
C:  This has a strong look . Although it's plastic , it's it's grey to to to give it iron look . That's uh  
D:  Yeah , it still has a strong look . 
A:  Yeah . And it's round . 
D:  But then you are losing your fruity colours . 
C:  Yeah . Well we have to make a  
A:  Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . So uh those kind of things you can you can combine . 
D:  That's true . 
C:  Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control . I don't think that's very practical , but  But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour . Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger . 'Cause if you look at this , it it doesn't look very very strong , becau But this is plastic , and and this too , but  
A:  No , it isn't . Okay . 
D:  Yeah but the  
A:  Yes . 
D:  But it doesn't have to look strong . The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy . The feel . 
C:  The feel ? Uh alright . Well  
A:  So , if you ti 
B:  And it it doesn't have to be strong , also . <other> Only the feel . <other> 
A:  Well  
D:  Nah yeah the feel  
A:  You you  Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something . So it it looks pretty but it feels strong . 
B:  <other> 
D:  Right . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Oh . 
D:  I agree . 
C:  And I  Then I have some more findings . Um <other> uh about the energy energy source of the of the device , uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote , that's a bit , oh , that's a bit uh  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh>  No titanium . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	None


C:  That's a bit uh much . And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case . Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . That that's the information I received . If you use the curved case , uh a curved case , double curved then you 
A:  <laugh> What do you exactly mean with double curved ? 
C:  can't use titanium . Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look . And uh <other> now the the shape , yeah ,  a curved case . Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . Uh  a more modern look not plain , long box style , but  
B:   
D:  <laugh> I dunno . 
A:  Double curved ? 
C:  <other> I'll draw it , but maybe later . <laugh> And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have uh  . Um anyway  
B:  Yeah . Yeah . <laugh>

C:  Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive . And , uh as we agreed , we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um <other> uh speak uh speech uh controlled <laugh> device . <laugh> Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive . But  
D:  Yeah right . <laugh> 
A:  Well  
C:  It's worth the trouble I think , because  
B:  The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material . Because people like that . 
A:  This soft material thing from uh  Yeah . 
C:  Uh rubber is a soft material , I guess . Uh soft enough .

A:  And then uh Mike ? Okay . 
B:  Yeah . Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier . 
B:  Um I shall draw this . If it uh works . 
C:   button , yeah . 
A:  Just uh  <other> There is already a blank . Yes ? So  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . <other> 
B:  Mm so have I . <laugh>

A:  <laugh> 
B:  Nah . 
D:   .  You have to push hard . 
A:  <laugh>  
D:  <laugh> <laugh>

B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh>

B:  Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented . Um we must decide where , this meeting . Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , <other> um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . And um well they're cheap , so we could use them now . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> Oh  
B:  Um it's not really speech recognition , it's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the 
A:  That's interesting . 
B:  the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that . 
C:  Oh , yeah , I understand . Yeah . 
D:  Oh okay .  
A:  Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function . 
D:  Right . 
B:  No it doesn't does not do anything . But i it's just a  Yeah it's it's cheap . 
D:  No . 
A:  Oh . That's a bit uh  
D:  But that that makes it cheap . It's <other> it's just a an extra function , and it's cheap . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Yes . I understand . But <other> it has no functionality for our remote at all . 
D:  No but <other>  
B:  No but that's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks . 
D:  Yeah , right . <other> Young people love them . 
C:  But it it's n nice for young people . They like gadgets . Yeah . 
B:  Yes , we we should really uh include that one , I think . Um  
D:  Yeah , ple Right . 
C:  If it's cheap . Yeah . 
A:  Hmm . 
B:  Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and  uh and that kind of stuff <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons . I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that . 
A:  So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ? 
B:  Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable . A voice recognition can be uh implemented . And uh I drew an example , but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do . Hmm ? Well I have the  I can draw it again , and I know what I did wrong . I didn't tick the note bo box in the  . Um  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Alright . How  How  
C:  Can you draw it now of uh  Can you draw it now ? 
A:  Ah . 
C:  Mm . Alright . 
D:  How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen ? 
B:  <other> Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the  
D:  Alright . So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down . 
B:  Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen . 
A:  But then we should also have an uh an Okay button . 
D:  Yeah right . 
B:  Yes . <other> 
topic_description:	None


B:  Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? 
B:  correct . Yeah just uh the numbers . <other> 
C:  And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ?  
B:  These these will be bigger in the the real design . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Alright , yeah . 
B:  This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen . And with this you can uh , yes , go to through the menus and that can 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Um the video button should be uh an apart button , because you want it to uh t , yeah , to use it fast within one uh click . 
D:  You've  
A:  Yes . 
D:  Right . 
A:  And what's the menu button ? 
D:  And you you need a you need a speaker . 
B:  Um it's  <other> 
D:  For the   
B:  Hmm ? This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus  Well we we can add another button here , but  
C:  <other> 
A:  But how did  How do you get out of the menu then ? Yeah . Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay . Uh  
C:  Uh by pe pressing the menu button again . By pressing the menu button again , you go uh out . It's usual the the the d kind of the way it works . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yes , well but bec because when you <other> push Menu you get in , and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice . And  
C:  Yeah ? Yeah ? 
B:  Ah right . Well you you  
C:  Yeah . But you can men you can press menu again to get out . 
A:  Well that's also the Okay button . That's you you should have uh  
B:  No no , we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button and this the Okay button . 
C:  No . 
A:  Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out . 
D:  Exit . 
A:  Exit  . 
B:  Ah once you have an extra Menu button , you don't need that that extra option . You have uh redundancy . 
A:  Well , it's just a choice . 
B:  This is my suggested design . Um  Yes . 
A:  Well , okay , alright . Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make . 
B:  And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . <cough> But  <laugh> 
A:  I'd  I agree . 
D:  Yeah , fine . <laugh> Move on . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Fine . <laugh>

C:   
B:  Yeah , if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should . 
C:  Why would you put it uh then , and where is the recording uh the microphone ? Where would you put it ? 
B:  Well they that could be anywhere . That's very small . It could be uh down here . 
C:  Uh-huh . 
B:  <other> Um . Well , not here . I <other> yeah I suggest here . But that's just a little <other> gap . Yeah . 
D:  Right , and spea speaker at the back , or something . 
C:  Microphone , yeah . 
B:  Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah I understand . Uh but uh we could uh d do , but it's perhaps more expensive , uh the speaker on the back or something . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Alright . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . Well i Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they won't be uh very expensive . But

A:  Terrible . 
D:  This is just crazy .

B:  Um this looks  Yeah . This uh these are the L_C_D_ screens . I think we should , if it's um possible , uh one with colours , but

A:  Of course . 
B:  Yeah , but that's not what's meant here , I think . <other>

C:  Well a case ? Uh that's me . Uh I suggest  Well what do I suggest actually ? <laugh> 
A:  What what kind of properties should it have ? Well we just listened . 
C:  <other> Uh s solid , yeah . Yeah . 
B:  I think we  <other> Why don't we um use uh titanium or or a hard , yeah , some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front . That  
D:  Do you know the new uh  
B:  Just like um most cell phones are . 
C:  Yeah , I understand . <other> Yeah . So we have titanium . <other> 
D:  No <other> no <other> The front is the most important . 
C:  <other> Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , to give that uh strong look . And then the front is made of plastic . And you can put that on and off , and switch it . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  You know what ? 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  But the feel of plastic isn't strong . <other> 
C:  No but you have titanium of course . Uh you have the best of both worlds . 
B:  No but you you have this  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah alright , alright . 'Kay . 
B:  Yeah , you have the re remote in your hand like this . So you feel titanium .  
C:  And of course , yeah , you have the the the plastic front end . But you also have the titanium . 
D:  Yeah . <other> Fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah of course , but yeah <other> you have to make a 
B:  And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to . 
C:  decision . 
D:  Yeah , but it it's expensive . 
C:  I guess so . Uh titanium I sh I think uh  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Bendable . <laugh> Bendable . 
C:  Huh ? Well , well the  
B:  Well any colour   
C:  According to my sources , uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh  Titanium is available , and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it , if we want . 
B:  Yeah , then you you paint it in the colour you want it . The plastic is is the colour you want it . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm . 
D:  Paint spray . 
C:  Mm . 
D:  Yeah alright . 
B:  So   Yeah . 
D:  So , we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front ? 
A:  Alright . I've uh  
C:  Yeah , I think that's a nice trade-off . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  Titanium back , plastic front . Okay . Um well I am going to put it in here , uh because we can uh look . I  Um solid feel and trendy look . So material , um hard plastic for the front ? 
D:  Yeah , great . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Alright . Yeah , for the front and then titanium for the back . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  For the non-removable uh part . 
D:  But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you can't switch it . When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match . You know ? 
C:  Well but  <other> 
B:  Well titanium is neutral . <other> 
C:  The titan titanium isn't isn't v very  Yeah , i it doesn't uh <laugh> curves . <laugh> No uh I nei . <laugh> Titanium is very  No no no , but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . I dunno if if you disagree , but I think it's doesn't matter very much . 
D:  <laugh> I understand . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> <other> Hmm . Yeah . 
D:  Alright . 
B:  Well  
D:  Yeah . Alright . 
B:  Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours , and they don't use uh wood . 
D:  <laugh> Funky customers . Alright . <laugh>

B:   uh the text ? Yeah . Uh yeah , at the back ? 
A:  Yeah . Just just small . 
D:  But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front .

B:  Well you c Well uh  Yes . You can  The logo can be on on every uh front . 
A:  Yeah well
