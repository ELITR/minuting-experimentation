Good morning , <laugh> Mister P_M_ . 
<laugh> How are you today ? 
How was your business trip to Boston ? <laugh> 
Is there a schedule for this meeting ? 
I shall close the door . 
That's correct . 
Okay . 
Um is there any room for a little presentation ? 
Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Alright . 
I'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal . <laugh> 
<laugh> Well , I'll give it a try . <laugh> 
<cough> Mm . 
Very good . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
I was very good in drawing . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well , I guess you uh get the idea . <laugh> 
Beautiful . 
<laugh> 
Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion , 
because uh there might be some uh 
Okay ? 
influations influences . 
<other> Okay . 
Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . 
I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , 
and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . 
So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , 
but uh there might be some impossibilities . 
So that's one . 
<other> Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , 
but  well , these are quite the same . 
Sorry about that . 
Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available 
and which might be interesting to implement in our product . 
I have some uh initial ideas about some things 
um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . 
One thing about uh interopera operability . 
Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device  diverse subset of equipment . 
Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . 
So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment . 
Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . 
I think it could come in handy . 
We should discuss that . 
Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . 
We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh 
is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . 
But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth . 
Yes . 
Mm-hmm . 
But it's cost-effective . 
Mm-hmm . Well , not all , not all . 
So that's the point . 
So  
Maybe , 
but that's uh something we should discuss 
and uh about every everybody should think about it . 
So that's just my role , 
I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , 
and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look , 
but take these things into account when you start the discussion . 
Yes , 
so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment , 
and the way of communicating with these equipments . 
Okay . 
That's it . 
<cough> 
Yes , I think it should be something like that . 
We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? 
No , 
we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , 
so it should fit to every device . 
<cough> 
Yeah . <other> 
Mm-hmm . 
And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? 
Or are there any o other controls ? 
Are there only  any other cont 
Well , <cough> 
I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords . 
You know these things . 
And um it's very easy for a user to to switch  
w yes , 
to to switch b uh between uh channels 
or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , 
on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player . 
So maybe that's an idea , 
I don't know . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Uh is that uh  
are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? 
So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Do do you  
Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago , 
but I've seem to forget them  <laugh> forgot them . 
Um  
oh yes , I remember . 
Um you said something about visibility in the dark . 
Um 
uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ? 
Which makes it easier to operate it . 
I I don't know . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yes , but there's a cost limitation too . 
Well , that's more  
So that's a big problem , I think . 
I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . 
The cost price is very low . 
Um  
Okay . Very good point . Yeah . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . Okay . 
Okay . 
<other> It's use uh a lot of uh  
Hmm . 
well  
Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's  it seems to work uh quite okay . 
So uh technically it will be possible . 
No , you cannot . 
<other> Okay . 
Okay .
