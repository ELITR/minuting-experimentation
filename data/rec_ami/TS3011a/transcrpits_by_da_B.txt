Good morning , Flores . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<other> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Marketing Expert . 
Right . 
For the cameras 
Alright . 
<laugh> Geez . 
You have the same message of uh Windows cannot um 
sen oh stand-by . 
Close the the window . 
That's right . Ruud . 
So  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Alright . 
Okay . 
Progressions . <laugh> 
It's for the vision . Yeah . 
Sensors . 
But we all use the same white-board file 
So we can work together on it while we're  
or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah , alright . Yep . 
<laugh> 
It's a bunny . <laugh> 
But of course , Flores . 
Blank . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , I'm think about it too . 
<laugh> Format  . 
Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but <laugh> it works , 
right ? 
With a very small <laugh> legs . <laugh> 
You should feed that uh that animal . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Okay . 
And for a cell phone ? 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah . 
But  
Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . 
But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so 
y you you can  
Most of them . 
Or you shou sh use a  
you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well , I had a few uh things in mind . 
Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , 
um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different 
uh um  
Yeah uh , what is it , 
devices ? 
<other> Um so i i 
I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store . 
It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , 
right ? 
Yeah , I do I don't know that . 
It's no I have uh  
don't have the information for it . 
No , okay . 
Yeah . 
<other> Um  
Well , the techni fu technical function uh   what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . 
That's just the basic f technical function . 
So that was my  really my part for uh this session . 
Um  
Well , that's just the fu the technical function is <other> pure what should the remote control do , 
wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device . 
It just should change the T_V_'s state . 
So that's it . 
Um but furthermore  
Yeah . Yeah , with buttons . 
Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or  
Yeah . 
But  
They're very vu vulnerable . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . 
Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , 
so you must <other> point everywhere , 
so maybe infrared is  
Yeah , just don't even point it , 
so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that . 
Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or  yeah . 
For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , 
so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , 
but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in  outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh  
But  
Yeah . 
Two more things . 
Um 
You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um  <laugh> 
you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , 
so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand . 
You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think . 
And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , 
so it should be visible al um <other> in dark too . 
So when it's dark  
Those are two really uh user interface  
Yeah .   That's perfect . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Well , maybe I um  
but it it can be quite simple , 
you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it . 
The uh the the digits in black . 
Uh then it's already visible in dark . 
So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy 
 well , it can be for design , of course . 
Just remind something . 
The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade . 
You have a m uh  
Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it . 
The marks . 
Yeah . 
But um  
Necessary , yeah . 
Yeah . 
But then Bluetooth uh might be problem . 
'Cause I think Bluetooth uh  
Yeah , 
I know it from the cell phone . 
But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day . 
Does it  
<laugh> It's over ? 
Okay . 
Great .
