B:  Good morning , Flores . 
A:  G good morning . 
B:  Marketing Expert . 
A:  Oh yeah . 
B:  Right . 
A:  Are you ready ? You should put the laptop uh right into the square . For i for the cameras , yes . Good morning , Sebastian . 
B:  <other> For the cameras Alright . 
C:  Good morning , <laugh> Mister P_M_ . <laugh> How are you today ? How was your business trip to Boston ? <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:    I'm fine . 
B:  <other> 
A:  Um well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it . So  Do you want to open it as read-only . Um I guess I should close it here . 
B:  <laugh> Geez . <other> You have the same message of uh Windows cannot um 
D:   
B:  sen oh stand-by . Close the the window . 
D:  <laugh> Okay . 
A:  Okay , the waiting is for our Marketing Expert , Ruud . Um project kick-off . 
B:  So  That's right . Ruud . 
C:  Is there a schedule for this meeting ? 
A:  Yes , there is actually . Um I will li list the agenda for today . For this meeting . Good morning , Ruud . 
D:  Good morning . <cough> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> Uh it's important um  yeah , great . It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras . 
C:  I shall close the door . 
A:  Okay . Okay . 
A:  Um <other> we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here . Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , uh and we will have a discussion . Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind . 
B:  <laugh> Mm-hmm . 
C:  That's correct . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Alright . 
C:  Okay . Um is there any room for a little presentation ? Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ? 
A:  There is ? Yeah , there is . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> No problem . 


A:  Um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it's a remote control , a television remote control . Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . <other> Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things . The market , we should have a look at the market . Um <other> we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the   the the progressions , yes . Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific  uh specification of that . Um <other> the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think . 
B:  Progressions . <laugh> It's for the vision . Yeah . 
A:  Um and the last one is the working design . How exactly does it work in the technical sense . Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later . So we'll kop it  keep it with the functional design . <other> 


A:  Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here . Um as you see now I can give a presentation . <other> Um it's also possible to use this one as well . You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to . Um <other> to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . Um then we have this electronic white-board system . <other> Um yeah , I will show that now . Um you can draw on the board using this pen . There are little um uh sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end . Um 
B:  Sensors . 
A:  well , it  it's on the um eraser now , so we click the pen button . Okay , so not too fast writing . Um <other> you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . It's quite the same . Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file . So do not m make a new file . Just use this one uh during the day . <other> Um you can use the eraser to make something go away . 
B:  But we all use the same white-board file 
A:  Yes . 
B:  So we can work together on it while we're  or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? 
A:  Yeah . Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings . It's really like like a regu regular whiteboard . Um you can choose the format , um  sorry . Uh  
B:  Yeah , okay . Yeah , alright . Yep . 
A:  Let me see . Um  Well  <laugh> I guess it's maybe because I'm not s uh pen selected . Yep . Current colour , you can choose another colour . And um for example black , and you c I can choose the line width . Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour . Okay . Quite easy , if you uh do have any questions , just c ask me . Um <other> to um  oh well , I'm  I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us . Um as a little training <other> um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Um green . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  An animal . Okay . Um  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh a wee rabbit . 
B:  It's a bunny . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  A rabbit . Okay , well great . Um Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Alright . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  But of course , Flores . Blank . 
A:  Sebastian is thinking about the animal . 
C:  I'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal . <laugh> 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah , I'm think about it too . <laugh> Format  . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but <laugh> it works , right ? 
C:  <laugh> Well , I'll give it a try . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  It it should be a cat . Okay ? 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <cough> Mm . 
A:  <laugh> I'm guessing a horse . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Very good . <laugh> 
B:  With a very small <laugh> legs . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  I was very good in drawing . <laugh> 
B:  You should feed that uh that animal . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Well , I guess you uh get the idea . <laugh> 
A:  Yes , okay . 
C:  Beautiful . 
A:  <other> Beautiful . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . Um any questions  well , just just let me know . 


A:  Um okay , back to our project . Um <other> the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> 
A:  which is quite a number . <laugh> Um we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development , <other> um because uh , well , those are important numbers . 


A:  Um then the discussion , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation . 
C:  Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion , because uh there might be some uh influations influences . Okay ? 
A:  Limitations . Okay . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  Okay , great . 
C:  <other> Okay . Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . So that's one . <other> Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but  well , these are quite the same . Sorry about that . Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . 
B:  Okay . 
C:  I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . One thing about uh interopera operability . Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device  diverse subset of equipment . Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment . 
B:  And for a cell phone ? 
C:  Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . 
B:  Yeah , okay . Yeah . 
C:  I think it could come in handy . We should discuss that . Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth . 
B:  But  Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so 
C:  Mm-hmm . But it's cost-effective . Yes . Mm-hmm . Well , not all , not all . So that's the point . So  
B:  y you you can  Most of them . Or you shou sh use a  you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . 
D:  <other> 
C:  Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss and uh about every everybody should think about it . So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look , but take these things into account when you start the discussion . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability , and  
C:  Yes , so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment , and the way of communicating with these equipments . 
A:  Okay , and and uh  Okay . Okay , good . Um <other> that was your presentation ? Okay , okay . Um <other> okay . Great . Um 
C:  Okay . That's it . 


A:  <other> I'll go back to my own presentation . Um  Mm . Okay . Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things . Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um <other> how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . Um so let's start with you . H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ? 
C:  <cough> 
B:  Mm-hmm . Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um  Yeah uh , what is it , devices ? 
A:  Yep . 
B:  <other> Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store . It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , right ? 
C:  Yes , I think it should be something like that . 
A:  Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , not  we're we're  it's not a  
B:  Yeah , I do I don't know that . It's no I have uh  don't have the information for it . 
C:  We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? No , we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device . 
A:  No . No . 
B:  No , okay . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Uh Ruud , y do you agree ? Okay . Okay . 
D:  Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . 
B:  <other> Um  Well , the techni fu technical function uh   what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . That's just the basic f technical function . So that was my  really my part for uh this session . Um  
A:  Yeah . So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um  
C:  Yeah . <other> <cough> 
B:  Well , that's just the fu the technical function is <other> pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device . It just should change the T_V_'s state . So that's it . Um but furthermore  
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? Or are there any o other controls ? Are there only  any other cont 
B:  Yeah . Yeah , with buttons . Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or  
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay . 
A:  Okay , gentlemen , um uh just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting um  okay . 
B:  But  
C:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah . Two more things . Um 
A:  Is tha <laugh> Okay . Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting . Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the  such a product ? Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ? 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah .   That's perfect . <laugh> 
C:  Okay . Do do you  
D:  Uh I think most most things have already been said , like uh control multiple devices . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue . 
A:  Because ? 
D:  Uh well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . But uh lots of devices already use infrared . So  
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  we'll probably have to implement that . 
A:  Okay . Okay . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? 
C:  Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago , but I've seem to forget them  <laugh> forgot them . Um  oh yes , I remember . Um you said something about visibility in the dark . Um 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . 
B:  Yeah . Well , maybe I um  but it it can be quite simple , you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it . The uh the the digits in black . Uh then it's already visible in dark . So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy  well , it can be for design , of course . 
C:  I I don't know . Mm-hmm . Okay . Mm-hmm . Okay . 
A:  <other> 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Okay . Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . So  
C:  Yes , but there's a cost limitation too . Well , that's more  
A:  Yeah , twelve Euro fifty , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  So that's a big problem , I think . I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . The cost price is very low . Um  
A:  Okay . 
B:  Just remind something . The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade . You have a m uh  
A:  Okay , okay . 
C:  Okay . Very good point . Yeah . 
B:  Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it . The marks . 
C:  Okay . Mm-hmm . Okay . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  <other> So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or  yeah . I dunno , it's uh  <other> that's more Sebastian's uh um  
B:  But um  Necessary , yeah . Yeah . But then Bluetooth uh might be problem . 'Cause I think Bluetooth uh  
C:  Hmm . <other> It's use uh a lot of uh  well  Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's  it seems to work uh quite okay . So uh technically it will be possible . 
B:  Yeah , I know it from the cell phone . 
A:  Well does it ? I'm not sure . Uh  Yeah . 
B:  But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day . Does it  
C:  No , you cannot . 


A:  Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time . Um 
B:  <laugh> It's over ? 
C:  <other> Okay . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Okay . 
A:  <other> so we will go back to our own uh work . Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . Um so this was it . See you in thirty minutes . 
B:  Okay . Great .
