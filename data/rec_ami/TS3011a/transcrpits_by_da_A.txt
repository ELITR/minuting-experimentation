G good morning . 
Good morning , Ruud . 
Good morning , Sebastian . 
Um well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it . 
So  
Um I guess I should close it here . 
Do you want to open it as read-only . 
Oh yeah . 
Are you ready ? 
You should put the laptop uh right into the square . 
For i for the cameras , yes .

Okay , the waiting is for our Marketing Expert , Ruud . 
Um project kick-off . 
Yes , there is actually . 
Um I will li list the agenda for today . 
For this meeting . 
<other> Uh it's important um  
yeah , great . 
It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Um we're here to develop uh a new product . 
Um I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it . 
Um <other> and um 
this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it . 
Um you are here in a specific role . 
Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , 
Roo is here as the User Interface Designer 
and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer . 
Is that correct ? 
Okay . 
Um <other> 
we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here . 
Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , 
uh and we will have a discussion . 
Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , 
so we should keep that in mind . 
There is ? Yeah , there is . 
<laugh> No problem . 
Um okay , 
this new product we are are g are going to develop , um 
it's a remote control , 
a television remote control . 
Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . 
Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , 
um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . 
<other> Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things . 
The market , we should have a look at the market . 
Um <other> we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , 
um which consists of three different design stages . 
Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , 
um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the   
the the progressions , yes . 
Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , 
and we will um make a specific  uh specification of that . 
Um <other> the second is the technical functional design , 
um what effect should the remote have ? 
Well in this case control t the the television I think . 
Um and the last one is the working design . 
How exactly does it work in the technical sense . 
Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later . 
So we'll kop it  keep it with the functional design . 
<other> Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here . 
Um as you see now I can give a presentation . 
<other> Um it's also possible to use this one as well . 
You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to . 
Um 
<other> to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , 
which is on your desktop , 
at least it should be . 
Um then we have this electronic white-board system . 
<other> Um 
yeah , I will show that now . 
Um 
you can draw on the board using this pen . 
There are little um uh 
sensors , 
so do not grab it here , 
but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end . 
Um 
well , it  
it's on the um eraser now , 
so we click the pen button . 
Okay , so not too fast writing . 
Um 
<other> you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . 
It's quite the same . 
Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file . 
So do not m make a new file . 
Just use this one uh during the day . 
<other> Um you can use the eraser to make something go away . 
Yes . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings . 
It's really like like a regu regular whiteboard . 
Um you can choose the format , 
um  
sorry . 
Uh  
Let me see . 
Um  
Well  <laugh> 
I guess it's maybe because I'm not s uh pen selected . 
<laugh> 
Yep . 
Current colour , you can choose another colour . 
And um for example black , 
and you c I can choose the line width . 
Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour . 
Okay . 
Quite easy , 
if you uh do have any questions , just c ask me . 
Um <other> to um  oh well , I'm  
I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder 
if you want to uh discuss it with us . 
Um as a little training <other> um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected . 
A rabbit . 
Okay , well great . 
Um Roo , could you do the same please ? 
But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . 
<laugh> 
Sebastian is thinking about the animal . 
Okay . 
It it should be a cat . 
Okay ? 
I'm guessing a horse . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yes , okay . 
<other> Beautiful . 
Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . 
Um any questions  well , just just let me know . 
back to our project . 
Um <other> 
Um okay , 
the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . 
Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , 
which is quite a number . 
<laugh> Um 
we uh we will focus this internationally , 
so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . 
And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , 
so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development , 
<other> um 
because uh , well , those are important numbers . 
Um then the discussion , 
maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation . 
Limitations . 
Okay . 
Okay , great . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay , 
so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability , 
and  
Okay , 
and and uh  
Okay . Okay , good . 
Um <other> 
that was your presentation ? 
Okay , okay . 
Um <other> okay . Great . Um 
<other> I'll go back to my own presentation . 
Um  
Mm . Okay . 
Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things . 
Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . 
Um there are other things like um <other> how to make it trendy , 
which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . 
Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , 
which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . 
Um so let's start with you . 
H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ? 
Yep . 
Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , 
not  we're we're  it's not a  
No . No . 
Yeah . 
Uh Ruud , y do you agree ? 
Okay . Okay . 
Yeah . 
So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um  
Okay . 
Uh-huh . 
Maybe not even pointed . 
Yeah . 
Okay 
 Uh  
Okay , gentlemen , um uh just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting 
um  
okay . 
Okay , s yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
<other> 
Uh I'll write down glow in the dark . 
Is tha <laugh> 
Okay . 
Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting . 
Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the  such a product ? 
Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Because ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Okay . 
Yeah , yeah , okay , 
because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . 
So  
Yeah , 
twelve Euro fifty , yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay , okay . 
Okay , um 
I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now . 
Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily 
um or it should not consume too much um power . 
Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week . 
<other> So um 
maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or  
yeah . 
I dunno , 
it's uh  <other> 
that's more Sebastian's uh um  
Well does it ? 
I'm not sure . 
Uh  
Yeah . 
Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time . 
Um 
<other> so we will go back to our own uh work . 
Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes 
and um , well , you know your o your individual actions 
or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . 
Um so 
this was it . 
See you in thirty minutes .
