Wait for the marketing director actually , 
so . 
Anyways . Uh . See , 
shall we wait ? 
I'm not sure if he's late or delayed or whatever , 
so I'm gonna start soon , 
we have now  
don't have much time anyway . 
There you are , 
okay . 
Uh no problem . 
We're about to start , 
so have a seat . 
Okay , 
welcome again . 
Today , functional design phase . 
I'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting . 
Okay , 
that was just to get to know each other , 
have a little thoughts on what your vision is and  on this project , 
so  
I put the minutes on the  I made on the on the p the the project share , 
so if you wanna review them , they're there . 
I will do so after every meeting , 
so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there . 
Anyways , um 
today three presentations , from every one of you . 
Um after that I got some new project requirements from project board , 
so we're gonna go af go after  over this later . 
But I wanna start with uh stuff you did first , 
so we can see what everybody came up with . 
And after that we can have the new requirements 
and share some thoughts , 
so . 
Who would like  wanna go first ? 
Take it . 
<other> Anyway , 
let's see what you have . 
Uh it's still a bit open . 
You should close it on your own notebook , I guess . 
Okay . 
Yeah . So there ? 
If I can cut in , 
is it people or men ? <other> 
Is it people , okay . 
'Cause I thought it was only men , 
so  
'Kay . 
So we have to s we have to do something about that . 
Okay . 
Okay , 
just talk ahead . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . <other> 
Okay , that's okay . 
That's a little weird . 
Okay , 
we can we can hide those under a menu or something , 
okay . 
That's like a button on your T_V_ ? 
Okay . 
Remote , okay . 
We wanna have a little preview on the remote control . Preview what's on the channel . 
Okay . 
That sounds too  
It's possible , 
but uh I think it's expensive , 
but do continue . 
Okay , 
you don't set it yourself , 
it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example . 
You want the  you want it to be programmed , for example 
y programmed f 
or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ? 
Let's see , 
you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , 
so it recognises your favourite channel . 
Okay , so 
it's it it does  
it recognise itself , 
you don't have to set it  
Okay . 
Okay . 
I see . 
Okay . 
<other> No problem , it's it's okay , 
that's  
Yeah , go ahead . 
That seems very good . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay , so 
have it more  make it more durable actually . 
Okay . 
Okay , so 
the buttons should be  
Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
Wow . 
The s 
Yeah . Make it  make them bigger . 
Even more durable uh . 
Okay . 
Yeah , it's true . 
Yeah , that's clear . 
No , of course uh  
Yeah . 
I must say that it  
Hmm . 
That was it . Okay , 
that was good . 
So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere 
and increase it  the durability of of the thing , 
so  
The other aspects , we'll just see how  what you came up with 
and what's possible for that budget . 
Okay . 
<cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . <other> Of course , hmm . 
You mean integrate them all into the circuit board . 
Okay . 
<other> Yeah , okay . 
So you have  
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
That was it ? 
I'll get back to my thing then . 
Uh  Okay , 
back this up  to the screen . 
So 
I got some new information on the project specifications 
are changing a little . 
Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore 
because the uh the internet , 
nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly , 
so it can either  
Well , 
I don't think we should remove the button , 
because there are always people who are using it . 
But I don't think it should be <other> very  it should be one of the big buttons for example . 
Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever . 
It's not important anymore . 
Um we're targeting young people now , 
because our um  
<other> This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , 
which are  
um the younger people were defined under forty . 
I so I think it's  
that's also good with the fashion and everything , 
so yeah . 
They want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like . 
If they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they're actually gonna spend uh spend money on it . 
Yeah . 
 <other> see how far we can go with it anyway , so 
 And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , 
which is apparently <laugh> black and yellow , 
 I think we should keep the the logo in mind , 
but  I'm not sure if we 
because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody's taste . So  
With that concept I started thinking , so why not just steal Nokia's idea 
and just make changeable covers for your  
I mean those cost hardly anything I think , 
and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover 
and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see . 
Or we can sh 
for example we can make a different <other>  a basic design . 
And sell the covers separately , for example . 
That's just a little marketing idea that could be applied , 
so you can p 
it appeals to really everyone . 
So you don't have to  I think you don't have to make entire remote controls . 
We make a basic one 
and manufacture this cover separately . 
So 
that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone . 
So 
just  
I'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation . 
Would you like to share ? 
Okay . 
Oh yeah . 
I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen , 
like you said . 
I think for example it's it's huge  I think the L_C_D_ is huge , 
it consumes batteries like hell . 
I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power . 
It costs a lot , I think . 
What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview , 
but y I'm not sure if it's even possible <other> . 
For example , a little T_V_ guide . 
Like you have a little  
just just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing 
so you can use your remote as a T_V_ guide . 
I'm not sure it's even possible , 
but maybe okay , make it  
Yeah , 
find a little compromise in that , 
but  
What did I write down ? 
I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , 
just make a button on your T_V_ 
and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere . 
I think it's easy to implement , 
we should go for that . 
Uh speech recognition . 
I thin <other> 
Yeah , 
I mean where else should you put it ? 
Yeah , 
but <other> how are you gonna use that if your  
I mean if your remote control is lost , how are you gonna press  where are you gonna press the button ? 
A slap-on sticker . 
Oh , 
you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your T_V_ . 
Yeah , that could be possible . 
A little little box you can attach to your T_V_ is fine then , okay . 
I think it's universal . I think we should go for universal , 
because apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people . 
I think universal remote control should be possible . 
Yeah , 
I think we're targeting everyone , 
so remote  
Okay , universal is good . 
Speech recognition , I think it's very hard , 
because we're selling across multiple countries . 
So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus , it's very hard to do . 
Yeah , 
but I don't see Arabian people speaking one , two uh whatever . 
It's  
Yeah . 
It's not a mature technology , 
I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control , 
so  
I don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh . 
What else do we have ? 
Um well 
you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable . 
So the the the symbols won't fade , 
maybe a little harder plastic 
or especially li we don't  
maybe we don't have have to do all the buttons , 
but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons , 
so those always fade first . 
Mm the thing is the most important things that we have now . 
Let's see . 
For example ? 
Well , 
we're not we're not targeting older people , 
we should remember that . 
Everything we target is under forty , 
so . 
You assume that that they read correctly 
and I think they're  
The most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world , 
so  
No , of course . No , 
I think it's just something you you put over them , 
because  
Yeah we c Yeah , you ca Well , 
tha that's not a that's not a bad  that's not even  
it's not even a bad idea . 
For example , if your buttons are faded , after  I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . 
I mean , for example , if you're if you're into the durability issue you could  
Uh I'm not sure it's it's hard to make . 
So it's a good and a bad idea . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , I know , 
it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example , 
okay . Yeah , 
that's what I  
something I have to look into . 
Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover , 
I'm not sure which which is easier , 
so  <other> 
Um anyway , yeah , 
this is what we're gonna do afterwards , 
just lunch break and have more individual work after that , 
so let's see what we  let's see we  
So 
you have to come up with a components concept , 
yeah . 
I want some  
you should do some trend-watching , 
because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything , what people really want , that's what we need to know in this phase , 
because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with . 
<other> Um  Yeah , 
I think user interface is fairly obvious . 
I mean it should be very intuitive , 
s 
Yeah , 
it should speak for itself . 
Uh for example I bought a remote control last week with a new T_V_ , 
it was it l it's like all buttons 
and you have no idea what it does at first , 
and I'm  total T_V_ new , anyway . 
So 
I think it should be  have less or l very little buttons 
and maybe a second <other> second level menu for the advanced things . 
Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu , 
like you said the um <other> the sound options and the surround and whatever , they're more complicated , 
just stick 'em under one menu 
and uh give it a  
just put it in in s in a software piece , 
you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your T_V_ . 
<cough> 
That is true . 
No , that's true . 
Yeah , that's true . 
I'm not sure if it's impossible , 
but uh there's a chance it's not , 
so . 
A double-sided remote control ? 
I don't think that's useful . 
Yeah , 
but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons . 
For example you have a Sony T_V_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a  for a Sony that won't  for a Philips T_V_ . 
I don't think we should  
Yeah , 
for exam 
I'm not s 
yeah , 
for ex 
you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that  it should do what people usually do with their T_V_s , not not the very complicated settings 
that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing , 
but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s . 
I think there's I think there is a standard for example between uh  
because usually the the menu is  the menu button is is usable between different brands . Especially the big ones , the big brands , 
so . 
'Cause everybody  
I have a universal remote control 
and it can use the menu button , 
so I think  
I'm not sure , 
if you can put some research into that , if it's possible . 
Uh I think just a b 
and the navigation is very basic , 
it's usually the same thing . 
Yeah . Yeah , that's true . I think so 
uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu , 
I think it's possible , 
just the way how to . 
Yeah , 
then then you could do everything I suppose , 
because usually the T_V_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , 
so it's okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else , 
because it's  either it's both  mayb 
maybe the shape can be a little different . 
Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever . 
So um  
Yeah , 
this  . 
Not sure what  
because we have forty minutes , 
I'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway , 
so . 
Yeah , 
but it wasn't me , 
it was him closing something . 
So anyway , yeah , 
we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example . 
I mean what do you want , 
do you want  , but  
Yeah , 
may maybe something like this . 
But though smooth inside . 
So you have the transmitter here for example . 
Let's see that you  what would be handy . 
I think that the <other> the buttons should be  the channel buttons should be <other> uh on their own . 
Let's see 
one , two  
God damn it . 
Yeah , okay . <other> 
Another one here . 
Let's see what  
I think this should  
these are always on top of the of the control , 
so they should be here . 
Think it's like this . <other> 
Withi within the  
Yeah , 
just take it . 
Do you take triangles 
or  
Um I think it should be I think it <other>  
Maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , in the middle . 
It's it's usually uh there , 
but  
Mm . 
Yeah , 
but for example if it's lost in your armchair , we'll not see the flash . 
And flash takes up a lot of batteries again . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I thought about for deaf people for example , 
so . 
We could do that . 
Uh let's see . 
Oh yeah , it's true . 
Um that thing should be central . 
You shouldn't be  
you uh shouldn't press it by accident , 
but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
like that's gonna work . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
I thought maybe we should move the buttons down 
and put it here for example 
to  
From top to bottom . Yeah , that's true , 
you should  
I think the bu the power button should be on top , 
'cause it's the first thing you do <other> , turn it on . 
So power button on top . Um  
Mute . 
Do we hardly  
I think it should be at the bottom somewhere . 
Mute . Turn the sound off . 
<other> I don't think it's important , 
 but I think it I think it should be  you c 
you could put it somewhere here . 
No , 
because it  
Yeah , 
people are accustomed to that , 
it's  
<cough> Can I have that ? 
That's j 
Take this out and here see  
Uh are we gonna take triangles anyway ? 
I'm drawing triangles , 
but  
Yeah , 
it's maybe a bigger lesser than thing . 
So anyway , 
I think this is  should be the channels 
and  or sh 
<other> Here , 
okay . Okay , 
should we chan 
okay , <other> 
this two , channel up and down . 
Well , 
for  that is it's 
on one part it's um it's a good thing to recharge it  
Maybe we should  what 
what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example . 
You have  
just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable , 
because it's an it's it's it's very annoying . 
I'm not sure y <other> I'm not sure it's  if it's expensive , 
but just take a look at it , 
because it might be a very good idea . 
Because if  it's it's uh useful to have it rechargeable , 
but at the same time , if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch T_V_ now , you wanna be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour . 
I think I have a nice idea . 
Not exactly uh . 
I think it's uh it's a pretty good idea 
to have uh like sort of a  maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it . 
I'm not sure . 
A what ? 
Well , 
we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal 
or  
So you could put that on a T_V_ for example . 
It could be very flat , 
could be very small . 
It's a very small  
Yeah , 
I'm drawing it big now , 
but  
So you can put your remote on flat for example . 
And at the backside of remote just just just a little hole 
for example um you just <other> put it down , it recharges for example . 
I don't think it's very expensive . 
I'm not sure if it costs a lot , 
that that's what he r 
That's that you  
that's what you buy yourself . 
It's just an idea , 
we have to find out if it's possible . 
Do they want  
but they want a rechargeable one ? 
I'm not sure , 
you should find out if it's  if rechargeable is important . 
Yeah . 
They want to pay for comfort , 
we just assu we 
we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it , 
um and  Yeah , 
we have to  either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station . 
<other> I think it would be good actually . 
I like the beep part <laugh> anyway . 
So um 
let's go through the  
Covers is covers is good . 
Yeah , 
it's  
Oh 
we can save this . 
Up and saved . 
We even saved the ant . 
 Um  <other> Okay . So 
what we have is  you have  
I think you have <laugh> to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost . 
Maybe  
yeah , 
or <other> maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay . 
We are going for twenty five Euros sales price , 
but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it , 
because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers , 
uh we just have to see what it looks like . 
<cough> Yeah , 
if you have some financial information that that'd be nice , 
so . Hmm . <other> 
<other> <humming> 
No , it wasn't wasn't allo 
it was possible , 
not allowed , 
so . 
So that's um why I'm not sure that <laugh> you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft . 
I don't care . 
I haven't heard any complaints yet , 
so . Um  
Yeah , 
the oh , they inc uh 
they include the new one . <other> Or just for you . 
<other> Oh 
no , I didn't have that . 
All it tells  just  let's make make a new  
tick the new one . 
<other> Um other side . 
Yeah , 
let's increase it a little 
because  
Yeah , 
draw us up some some designs of of possible  
just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , 
so the more  less important  
More or less . 
Just play a little with this , 
put l 
shift a little up or down 
and we'll see what looks best . 
Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share . 
Yeah , so 
we don't want  we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot . 
Well 
what  
we had function that what people do , 
so . 
People change channels , 
people <other>  they change the volume 
and they they change channel , 
they turn T_V_ off and on , for example . 
That's the basic fu 
that's what you do  
I'm not sure who present that again , 
but those are the basic function that people use it for , 
so those should be very well represented . 
That's true , 
but that's what we stick under the menu button . 
Everything is  
you say in every T_V_ that's configured under the menu . 
Yeah , but  
But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu . 
Uh we'll we'll see what we can come up with . 
Under forty . Yeah ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah yeah . 
The want to pay for  
Oh . 
Uh shall we ? 
Younger , age sixteen and forty five . 
That's all here , 
here it says <other>  
Yeah , 
age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical . 
Okay , so 
we're not focusing on this . 
Um  All the interest in features , not really the L_C_  
oh 
here . 
Would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control . 
Hmm , okay ? 
Speech recognition is quite  
Yeah , just look at the possibilities then , 
because if  
apparently it's what people want , 
it's supposed to be a luxurious remote , 
maybe it's not even that expensive . 
Or find a compromise , 
maybe just a black and white or  for some extra information on it , on your programmes . 
Me too . <laugh> 
I mean we all do . <laugh> 
Right . 
I think it's something we should put into consideration . 
Apparently it's what people want , 
so . 
We should see if  what it costs , if it's possible . 
Yeah . <other> Yeah , 
we should do a little thing about design , 
because it looks boring really to me . 
Even if you put it  even if you put a different cover on it , it looks  still looks boring , 
so . 
I have no clue . 
I just drew something what  which would fit into your hand easily . 
I think it's a very  
Sorry ? 
Yeah ? 
Okay . Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , 
but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy . 
I mean we can stick it in in there , I think . 
Huh 
even if  
in the worst case we can even  
Could you give me the pen back ? 
So 
let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing . 
Let's take take the basic design again , what we  oh , crap  uh came up with . 
I'll just make it a little bigger now . 
So 
a transmitter here . 
Anyway . 
We could  
let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen , 
people want an L_C_D_ screen . 
So then we should probably put it here . 
It doesn't have to be really big , 
but just just have to be  has to be there . 
Think it's a good place , 
people don't  
No ? 
It's not that uh  it's not the most important function , 
it's just an extra thing , 
it just  
you press the buttons on top , 
because your finger is on top . 
How can you use an L_C_D_ screen ? 
Yeah , 
but why 
I  I'm not sure . 
Uh if you t if you press a button , you can see it , 
ri 
I'm not sure wha 
I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like . 
You would prefer it 
n 
Okay . 
So we have three people saying it should be on top . 
Okay , 
but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else . 
Anyways . 
Uh this looks a little  
About the L_C_D_s thing . 
Well 
if it if it's 
if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive , we should include it , 
because it's it's cool . <laugh> 
<other> Uh we have green now uh  
Or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit  that has it on on on the bottom . 
Maybe in a circle for example , like we  like in this example . 
I think this is not good , 
but for  
we could make circular buttons for example . For up and down , ma make it a circle on it , 
because it  
I think the channel button should be in the centre . 
Channel button should be st stick together , for example here in this section . 
Because it's uh  
We're not sure about the size anyway , 
just a general design . 
You can make it as big as you want . 
For example if you take uh  
No , 
let's see . 
For example just  
Yeah . 
I don't think if we if we even use an L_C_D_ screen , we need to , definitely . 
Yeah , 
but we have to see what the si what the size is . 
The L_C_D_ doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big . 
Mm let's see . 
Finish meeting now . 
Okay , we will . 
So either  
We either we have to decide what what people want . 
Either this one , 
this this could be the luxurious one . 
So we have channel buttons here . 
I'm just drawing something uh . Uh  
I think this would this would look cool . 
You could have it for example  small buttons here for some extra functions , 
so if your basic function's here , we should  like we decided before , programmes up and down , and volume here . 
<other> Well 
you can just  
no , I'm not sure if we can do that , 
but we could put a microphone in here for example . 
Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space . 
But let's cut the meeting for now yes . 
Yeah , let's think of a name , okay . 
Uh okay . 
Okay , at anyways , 
the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly , 
so there we go uh . 
<other> 
Yeah , to all .
