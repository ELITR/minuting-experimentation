Okay , 
we  
Mm . 
Okay , that's fine . 
Um . Okay , now 
work a little with me . 
Okay . Well , 
let's start it as it is . 
Okay , 
uh the method . There are a few questions that need to be answered , 
uh you already uh talked about it a little bit . 
Which buttons are wanted , 
uh is our remote control universal 
or should it be programmable . 
Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it . 
Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do . 
And uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? 
I'll tell you why that's important to me . 
Um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , 
so uh uh that's <other> why I also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs , 
uh I heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens , 
but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already . 
So keep in mind that everything that you keep uh  think of , it has to b to be built . 
So 
it's  
that's not as easy as it s might look like . 
Uh material study , I'm working on that um for the the costs . 
I have to check out how far I can go with that . 
Normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass 
uh and the wires are made of copper . 
Uh that is how it is done 
and all the remote controls work that way , 
I think we can just go on with that . 
Um then I've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . 
The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper . 
Exactly , 
so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that's cheaper . 
So we have to <other> make something that's not too difficult in design again . 
This is what look like uh looks like if you press one button , 
so this is not the entire thing . 
You have the the power coming in , 
then you have like a switch . 
The switch uh uh <other> uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code , 
that's how you should see it . 
The Morse code goes to the amplifier , 
then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . 
You have infrared 
and an interv 
um <other> uh how to say it ? 
Uh a light in indication , light that you know that it's functioning . 
Uh here again , that's my story about the different modes , 
if you do want to make remote uh universal , then the processor has to uh make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed . 
That makes it much more complex , 
so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . 
Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far , 
except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light . 
<other> That was it . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
No , 
I think this is a good idea . 
But  
Go ahead . 
Y Yes , I think so too . 
Okay , uh  
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
I have to check that out , 
I'm not sure . 
That must be possible . 
Ja . 
I'm sorry , 
whe where do you wanna hit the T_  you wanna <other>  
we want a button on the television .  
In th 
okay , 
but that rules out a universal remote control . 
Because that's not possible uh . 
Uh . 
Yeah . 
Exactly . 
Okay , 
then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , 
because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do . 
If not  
Okay . 
then I go for that . 
Okay , 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
No , 
it's fine with me , 
but then I know what to look for . 
Uh-huh . 
Mm-hmm . 
Exactly . 
I already noted that . 
Mm , okay . Okay . 
Hmm . 
If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area . 
That's fo <other> is 
uh especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language . 
That's  
okay , okay . 
Huh . 
Uh okay . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
<other> Uh but I know that the buttons are like a Nokia telephone on uh one sleeve , 
so you don't have to change your whole cover . 
Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve . 
Know what I mean ? 
It works the same as a Nokia telephone , 
it's it's in my uh  'kay . 
Exactly . 
Hmm . <other> 
<other> 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
I don't think so . 
No , I don't think so . 
Because the television needs to respond to the signal , 
and if it doesn't know how , it's  
Exactly , 
that's not possible . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
But that might be broken . 
 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm okay . <other> 
Mm . But I think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television . 
For instance , if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it . 
Because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our  
Okay , 
I thi I think so too . 
And I think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other . 
For instance uh Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices , 
and you always grab the wrong one 
because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different . 
We should not do that . 
Exactly . 
Mm that's your uh division . <laugh> 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you  if it's lost , for people that are deaf . 
They they won't hear the the beep . 
Yeah . 
Uh . 
Yeah , it's true , 
but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost . 
So . 
 deaf people ? 
<other> I have another idea , 
I'm not sure if it's possible . 
Mm . 
Yeah , me too . 
Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? 
That you don't have to buy new batteries if every  
Mm , yeah . 
But that's already possible . 
Uh . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
Okay . Uh 
you could make a device , 
but I'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable , 
but it  you're  
the remote also can act as a recharger . 
So then you can choose , you have every decision . 
Know what I mean ? 
You can uh put in normal Penlites , rechargeable Penlites , 
but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire . 
So  but  
But I think that will cost a lot . 
Uh a normal wire would be better . 
Like a like a P_D_A_ , a hand-held . You can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , 
you don't need basic station . 
Yes . 
That is possible , that's true . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Mm . 
Yes . 
I'm going to try to find that out . 
I'm not sure if there's information available on this , 
but  
Hmm . These are uh comfort issues . 
So I think people will pay  they wanted to pay for comfort . 
Well , 
this is comfort . 
Yes . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . Exactly . 
I think this is a brilliant product . 
I would buy it myself . 
Uh . 
I like the covers . That's a brilliant idea . 
I never thought  
I hope if I have information about that , 
I'm gonna  
 
Mm . <other> Yeah . 
I would like to make a decision  . What it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it 
and  
exactly , I need it . 
Was it not possible to uh send emails around the office ? 
Not  . 
Yeah , okay . 
What uh what did you wanna say ? 
Mm . Mm . 
Mm . 
But that's the question , 
is it ? 
Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . 
If it isn't , then we cannot reach it . 
I think so too . I think so too . 
Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ? 
If you rule out functions , then uh  and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it . 
Then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it . 
That's a bad bad com <other> commercial 
for <laugh>  
okay . 
That's true . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
<other> Did they really said it like that ? Those two things . 
Do they realise how much that costs ? <laugh> 
That's almost undoable . 
Even if i if we have this lost unit , then we cannot do it for that price . 
<other> No , 
that's that's  . 
<other> Yeah , that's true . 
Hmm . 
Uh . 
Uh I  
But I really need finance information . 
We all do . <laugh> 
Mm . 
Uh . 
Hmm . 
And the design , it should differ . 
This is Philips , 
huh ? 
Philips has this . 
Okay . 
Hmm . 
Uh . 
Mm . Oh , 
I realise if we make it small , then it needs to be a little thicker , 
because I need to put all the electronics in it . 
If we make it s uh smaller , uh less wide , then we need to m make it a little thicker , 
because I have to put all the electronics in it . 
No . 
Hmm . 
Me too . 
Ah 
but  . 
Hmm . No . 
M 
I personally would prefer it on the top . 
Huh . 
But it  
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
They want it uh . 
<other> We should just try to make that if it's possible . If it is possible we should really do it , 
but we need that information . 
Also keep in mind again , the L_C_D_ screen is very flat , 
but it needs transistors , resistors , I don't know what more 
and that needs space . 
So I have to look if that's possible . 
But if we  
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
If we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery . 
It is rechargeable , 
so we can stick with one instead of two . 
That might be an option . 
Yeah , 
but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen , that means a lot of space that we need . 
But it has to be a little bit heavier . 
Okay . 
No , 
but the things behind it .  space . 
Like a process uh . 
I like this one more . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
I'll try to . 
One more uh thing I'd like to say , 
uh let's give this uh a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars . 
Shall we all try uh to think about a name ? 
Good luck . 
Yeah , I've  
Do we uh save the  ?
