A:  So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere

abst_sum - abstract: Everyone agreed that they need to incorporate a locating mechanism in their design, and that changeable covers could make appealing-looking remotes.

B:  There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear .

C:  then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . 
C:  You have infrared

abst_sum - abstract: The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared.

A:  Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore 
A:  <other> This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , 
A:  um the younger people were defined under forty .

descriptions: Inform Inform Inform Inform 
abst_sum - abstract: There are some new requirements: the target group will be people below 40, the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product.

A:  we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example .

B:  Where would we want the uh teletext button ? 
B:  Do we put it somewhere over here ? 
B:  Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , 
D:  In the middle . 
A:  Maybe in a circle for example , like we  like in this example .

A:  we don't want  we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot .

abst_sum - decisions: It would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control, when the user loses it.

A:  I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , 
A:  just make a button on your T_V_ 
A:  we should go for that . 
C:  Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you  if it's lost , for people that are deaf . 
B:  We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you  that some light lights up . 
A:  We could do that .

A:  I think it's universal . I think we should go for universal ,

abst_sum - decisions: The remote is going to be a universal one.

A:  For example , if your buttons are faded , after  I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . 
descriptions: Suggest 
abst_sum - decisions: Because symbols may fade, the additional covers could include those.

A:  Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever . 
D:  And uh with different colours uh .

A:  but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s . 
C:  Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . 
C:  If it isn't , then we cannot reach it .
