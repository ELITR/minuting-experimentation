Oh , 
there he is . 
Go ahead . 
That's pretty shocking uh . <laugh> 
<other> 
<other> Which channel selection ? 
Oh , okay . 
<other> 
Is that manageable ? 
'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Shall I go ? 
Okay . 
So , 
some technical functions . 
Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier . 
Uh let's just start with the method . 
<other> It sounds really easy , 
what does the user do , what does the th remote control do , 
but there are quite some issues . 
So 
the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , 
because the technical aspect , that's pretty much covered . 
We can do that . 
What goes wrong <other> at the user . 
Gets the remote control . 
Where is the remote control ? 
We've all had it once , 
I want to watch some television , 
where's the remote control ? 
That was one of your ideas 
which you posted in the network folder , 
a really good idea . 
Uh these are just the issues . 
I come to some uh personal experience , findings , possible solutions later . 
Searches for the button . 
There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . 
Uh so either we lose those 
or we try to make it a little bit more clear . 
Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while . 
There's nothing more annoying than faded symbols , 
because you don't know which channel is this button , 
so possibly we could find uh something for that , 
yes . 
Uh covered that . 
Oh yes , 
user presses the button . 
Um usually when you have a lot of buttons , buttons are small . 
So you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that , 
so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control . <other> 
And possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger 
si 
So 
this is basically what I h had in mind in the  fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound , 
uh so 
clear we should stick to existing symbols , 
but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh  need to be replaced by others . Uh  
This I pretty much covered . <other> 
So what we want to go to is not this one , 
but more  less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons . 
that's basically uh what I had in mind . 
This is not the final design , 
this is just a general idea of how I'd like to see uh basically the general idea . 
<other> So 
that was it . 
So 
Yeah , I think it's a really good idea . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Oh . 
Is it manageable ? Is it easy ? 
Yeah . 
And it costs too much to fabricate , 
so we're on a tight budget here . 
And it's  
Maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal . 
Yeah , exactly . 
And it's  
Besides that , the technology isn't really super yet , 
so that <other> is a problem in implementing this . 
It's a good idea , 
but it's just not  I don't think the market's ripe for that yet . 
But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves 
or just the  
C 
that's a problem with the with the text then . 
<other> 
Oh yeah , I know what you mean . 
Yeah . 
Pretty straightforward . 
Is it techni technically possible to uh <other> send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu , 
because we're working with different types of television , 
so we're going to work with that ? 
It's an in-built menu , 
isn't it ? 
Yes . 
So basically 
we  
Or we could use a double-sided  for <other> less used functions 
you  
Yeah , 
with the cover . <other> 
I 
it's basically an idea to overcome these issues , 
because  
No , 
but basic functions  
but functions which are not frequently used . 
Because if we use a universal remote control , we're going to have to have most buttons on it , 
so  
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I have some ideas . I have some ideas . 
I'll put some on paper 
and present them next time uh the ideas that I have . 
I heard a beep go . 
Yeah , 
but we like some some curves 
or  
Yeah . 
Oh , 
we get the general ideas , yes . 
Yeah , 
and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume  
yeah yeah . 
So 
the volume , do we want that horizontal or vertical ? 
you have the up channel <other> the down channel  
This is basically what people are accustomed to , 
so  
Yeah , 
but this is just a g general idea . 
Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle . 
Whoa . 
You won't be able to find it . <laugh> 
We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you  that some light lights up . 
So we have the basic channels we've got here , 
uh the power button somewhere over here ? 
I usually press it on top . 
At least that's what I'm accustomed to . 
What would you like to  ? 
Okay , 
mute button . Is that somewhere here ? 
Is that used often ? 
The mute button ? Do people use that often ? 
'Cause uh I'm pretty much accustomed to it <other> right over here , at least in general , 
but  
It's not that important , no . 
Sure . 
That's pretty much what people are accustomed to , 
aren't they ? 
Well , 
I'm accustomed to the channels being on top . 
But isn't that expensive in the entire package ? 
 
But again , isn't that too expensive ? 
'Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station  
And do people actually want that ? To pay extra  they want to pay for rechargeable ? 
Can can we save this or  
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Could you post some <other> other essentials of what people want , 
so that I can work with some buttons , where to put it  
You seem to have information on that , 
I'd like to uh see some of it . 
No , it's not . No . 
Oh , your computer . Okay . 
Well , 
I have your PowerPoint presentation , 
I can get some inf information out of that . 
Let's see . 
Oh , 
where would we  
Where would we want the uh teletext button ? 
Because we decided that it's n not that important . 
Do we put it somewhere over here ? 
Or maybe this is something for the next meeting , 
I can draw out some ideas . 
Yeah . 
Well , 
we have decided <other> more or less the basic structure . 
I can put the other buttons in  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Maybe another idea uh . 
Yes , 
but it should cover all the functions , 
so possibly , just an idea that popped in  
Yeah , 
but we could go a step further , 
because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus . 
Yes , 
but it  
Because we're making  
We need to adjust to the <other> technology . 
True . 
<other> No , I thi 
Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen . 
<other> 
Well 
I doubt it , 
but  
Well , 
I had basically  
Something like this . To make it kind of futuristic . 
So 
what kind of  
Yeah , sure . 
Now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand . 
I'm  
I'm still not convinced of the  
Yeah . 
So basically 
 can I  
what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top . 
Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , 
or do we put it on he 
Would we like to press it in the middle ? 
Yes , 
but we do agree that we <other> keep this at the centre , 
because it's basically the most important function . 
Well , 
that would make them quite small . 
So maybe you'd put them here . 
Yes , 
but a big remote control probably not something which people would like . 
So 
would we like this 
or would we like the  
Let's see what we have here . 
Okay . 
So I think of a name . 
So  
Yes , 
go and finish up 
and I'll see you at lunch . 
Yeah .
