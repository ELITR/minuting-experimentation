Yes . 
Sorry , 
a little bit of pl little problem with computer . 
<cough>  . 
Uh . 
Yeah , sure , no problem . 
Um there was a little problem with my computer 
so not uh the whole uh presentation uh  
Yeah . 
Um  Okay , 
I want to open the my s 
oh no . 
Oh no , 
that's okay . 
Uh slide show . 
Yes . 
The functional requirements , it's uh <other> uh very important for uh the user , 
he he wants to  
yeah . 
The the method we used uh it it's not m not a slide , 
because it went wrong , 
but the method we use uh , um <other> we tested it w uh with uh a hundred uh men , 
and we asked them to w uh what the remote uh f feel uh like 
and uh what what's uh important . Uh  
People , 
sorry . 
Both women and men , 
yeah . 
Okay . Uh 
the findings um uh <other> 
seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . Um  
Yeah , 
and  
yeah , 
most th th 
they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control , 
so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it , 
and um they use  yeah , they use zap a lot , 
um uh fifty percent say they only  
So 
that's the most important things . 
Um  oh yeah , 
not all of it is it on mine on my PowerPoint presentation , 
but um uh the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection . 
It's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh <other> to use . 
Uh less important is tel teletext , 
uh um they use it , 
but it's not uh very uh important 
uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh 
and  
but not important is the channel selection , 
the the <other>  
hmm ? 
Oh , <laugh> 
the the  
no no no no no , 
that's very important , 
but uh w and not important in the audio settings , display settings 
and uh  
Yeah . 
<other> Um new preferences preferences . 
Uh um um beep to find your control , 
was  
that was  in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control , 
so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . 
And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition 
um so they can say uh what they want to  let's go to channel one and uh that's uh kind of things . 
And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen 
um to to look it um wh what's on every channel uh and uh what do I want with it ? 
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Um  
Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel , 
so I can uh I dunno , 
so I can zap to my uh f uh quick uh to my favourite channel 
wh what I uh  
so , the remote mu must see or um must um <other> see wha what mine preferences are for which channel , 
so I can zap t to  
What ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Recognise  
Yeah . 
Yeah , that's uh what my personal preference like . 
No , 
itself . 
Maybe it's easier to <laugh> to sell it , 
but  
I don't know it's manageable , 
but we will uh we will see . 
Yeah , 
it's a little bit 
uh it's the end of it . 
It's a little bit uh I lost it , 
the computer uh crashed , 
so . 
Yeah . 
Darn computer .

Yeah . 
Mm uh . 
Yeah . 
Uh . 
Yeah . 
B 
Yeah , 
and they want to pay for it 
and uh  
With more  Where  
with more technical specifications 
in the  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But  oh ? 
Yeah , 
with with an L_C_D_ screen you can  
Why ? 
Nokia w 
Uh . 
Okay .

It's  
And  
But you r 
And you are reading from the t

But  Which  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But  
Yeah , they want to pay for it .

hmm . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh>

My computer crashed , 
so uh 
I lost my uh presentation , 
but 
I have the uh <other>  
Yeah , 
but I 
Here I have the the s the homepage of uh our internet , 
and here is my 
here is my marketing report , 
maybe you ca you can look at uh <other> that 
and  
Ah yeah . 
And one  
And uh wha what people want , I've uh 
I have another thing uh  
Yeah . Um  
<other> Uh what I al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost , 
but it it's also for people , <other> they want to learn it fast , 
not uh  they want to  
No 
It's  
yeah , 
it's easy to learn 
wi and uh  
Um  
And  The  If  
Um  
 
If um  
Another thing I want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh <other> younger than forty . 
Um on my report , <other> I didn't uh <other> ish I didn't show it in my uh presentation , 
because my computer crashed . 
Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . 
So 
i 
yeah . Yeah , 
and  
Yeah . 
<other> Uh but  
If if they  
So uh 
we can 
We can look at the possibilities for an uh L_C_D_ 
and uh  
Yeah . 
I dunno . 
How much it will cost 
and  
Um  
<laugh> It will come uh  
Yeah . 
<laugh> Different colours maybe . 
But all  
Okay . 
<other> 
If you're reading from top to bottom , I think it's better to put it uh at the top . 
It's j <other> 
<other> Uh . But i if you if you are going to uh put the L_C_D_ on it , <other> I think it's very important to use it , 
uh because it's <other>  use it uh 
But nee the function of it . <other> 
So you can use it maximum , 
because uh it's a lot  it costs a lot . 
So  
Yeah . 
It's expensive to build it , 
so 
you must use the maximum of it . 
Huh . Uh . But uh  
Yeah , I know uh . 
In middle of it . 
In the middle . 
<other> Yeah . 
It's the most import yeah . 
 . 
  
Finish meeting now . 
It's on your computer . 
Uh . 
Or  
And uh what about speech recognition uh  
Yeah , yeah , 
but  or 
or an L_C_D_ or an uh speech . 
I think it's  L_C_D_ is better now . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , okay , yeah , 
that's <laugh>  
yeah , that's okay . 
Oh , good . 
Yeah . 
Same . 
 .
