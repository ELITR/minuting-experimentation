Mm . 
Oh 
my name's Andrew 
I'm a  I'm the Market Research person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control 
and uh yeah I'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design , 
what people want to  like  and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view . 
<other> 
Um , badger . <other> 
Uh it's it's got nice contrast with black <laugh> and white and uh <other> 
I feel they're  underdog kind of status 
and they're , the 
<laugh> 
Make mobile phones and T_V_ remotes <laugh>  
to make T_V_ remotes <laugh> . 
Yeah . 
Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with T_V_ players and  T_V_s and D_V_ players , like they aren't 
like an area that's put a lot of effort into , 
they're very boring , 
very plain . 
Like 
it's very  a very  
like um 
making a a stylish remote control would be a very like  
Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition . 
<other> Um . Something that looks looks  doesn't look like remote control . 
So if you want , <laugh> something that looks like uh  something that makes you think oh what's this ? 
Like this pen doesn't really look like a pen , 
but it makes you think oh . 
So , 
sorry 
that's a bit vague <laugh> . 
Uh I suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product . 
Mm . 
<cough> 
Yeah . 
Well 
from the mouse idea you could , 
 remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it 
which you press , 
whereas if you want   
could all be flat 
and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle 
that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see , like a mouse button . 
I suppose . 
Easily , yeah yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm , yeah that would be good . 
Mm-hmm , um <other> especially if we try to sell , what two million of them . 
Oh sorry , 
four million of 'em , 
but uh  I think if w if we market it as as not as not  
well 
this  you c you could either market it as the point of view  we could have the two  
we could have parallel marketing s schemes 
where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable 
and like you just  
it's it's like uh it's one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device , 
but that might  
considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice , 
therefore they want it 
so  make it practical at the same time . 
I think it's  this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room 
uh but also a device that uh 
is practically sound . 
So um , 
I dunno 
we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both . 
If you  . 
Mm . <cough> 
<laugh> 
Um , well 
uh like 
we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour 
or with  like you buy it with several 
you ge you get the f uh the face-plates with it when you buy 
but uh <other> maybe thinking of that , it's  considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing  like a second campaign to market new facials for your  to your  might go a bit astray 
or as a separate thing , 
since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one 
and then forget about it . 
Unless you were trying to  
Mm . 
<other> Oh 
it's  
that's a that's a good idea . 
Mm . 
Yeah true . 
<other>  .
