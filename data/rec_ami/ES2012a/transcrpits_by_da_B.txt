<laugh> Uh I'm Katie , 
I'm the Industrial Designer 
and I'll just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control 
and uh  
yeah . 
<laugh> 
Uh 's horses , 
no particular reason why <laugh> . 
<laugh> <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Um  <laugh> I think it's important that you should be able to  when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere 
and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself 
and twist your remote control to get it  the T_V_ to actually pick up the signal . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm that would be good . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<other> Oh 
I think it's it's  remote controls are kind of a unique object 
'cause it's  you depend on them so much , 
but you don't  i i it's  
you sort of just assume they're always gonna work , 
you don't think of them as a comp 
like a computer can break down 
and you're kinda like oh well fair enough 
there's all these complex things going on , 
it's gonna  
something's gonna get messed up eventually . 
They they just need to be very very dependable 
because people sort of take them for granted 
and then if your remote control breaks it's   God forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel <laugh> 
it just  
it needs to be very effective , very  always dependable . Uh 
I don't think we should make it too small 
I  'cause I think it needs to  
it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and um awkward , 
but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um , it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah . 
But  
so 
yes 
dependable , and have a  good medium range size . 
Mm , mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Well 
you could come up with like novelty ones , 
like they've done with the the mobile phones , 
you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control 
and sorta stagger the release of them 
and get people like oh I want that cover on it now 
and that'll keep them spending money . 
Thank you .
