A:  Right w welcome to the the first meeting of uh Real Reaction's uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control . Uh this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so um which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh <other> uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody , uh one that everybody wants , uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company . Uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that . Um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh <other> just as vital to this project um <other> I'll just go round th the table , Andrew , marketing , um m Kendra with the uh um  designing the the the User Interface uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design . Um . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  <other> What's uh  the the th th project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want , uh everybody has a contribution to make and uh <other> everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say . Um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um  everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the the company for a while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do , if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh  uh everybody's experience is please do so . Uh in fact I'd I'd I'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves , in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you  you're looking to make . So we'll start with Andrew . 


D:  Oh my name's Andrew I'm a  I'm the Market Research person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control and uh yeah I'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design , what people want to  like  and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view . 
A:  Right <other> Kendra . 
C:  <other> I'm Kendra and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and um <other> I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but I'm m so I'll be <laugh> working on the design . 
A:  Right at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so . 
C:  Right . Yep , I'm just open to being creative . 
B:  <laugh> Uh I'm Katie , I'm the Industrial Designer and I'll just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control and uh  yeah . 
A:  Yep , good . Okay , very very quickly , um <other> this  I don't want to make this meeting too structured because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank . Everybody says what they  what they want to say , uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do . The the remote control needs to be original , there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different , uh I want one , um and that goes along with being trendy , uh uh you know the I want it uh scenario . User-friendly as as we all know , remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up and think oh yes that's  it's obvious how that works , uh and they also want to look at the price and think oh yeah that's something that  I may not need another remote control but uh it's such a nice one I'm gonna have one . And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money , and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants . 
D:  <other> 
A:  The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh what it uh what it must actually do , the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production . Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and uh uh <other> let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here , um  In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires , that we don't do that , um 


A:  So I I  everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal , but le let's go round the table , your favourite animal . 
D:  Um , badger . <other> Uh it's it's got nice contrast with black <laugh> and white and uh <other> I feel they're  underdog kind of status and they're , the 
A:  Mm and why ? Uh-huh . Oh right uh my my wife says my beard looks like a badger's arse 'cause of the the white streaks in it . <laugh> Kendra . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Um probably a duck I just  I li I like the way they look and they're just nice animals and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever . 
A:  Uh-huh . Right , okay . 
B:  Uh 's horses , no particular reason why <laugh> . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh-huh ,  fair enough yeah . I'm not sure that I've got any favourite animal to be quite honest , I think homo sapien because of their  their uh overall ability to uh uh  
B:  <laugh> <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Make mobile phones and T_V_ remotes <laugh>  to make T_V_ remotes <laugh> . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Sorry ? Indeed absolutely yes , tha that's um  
B:  <other> 


A:  Okay and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh  we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um , we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent . <other> It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make . Um so we're not only looking at a a very trendy original product , we're looking at making it at a very good price . Um , okay , um <other> would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls . 




A:  Mm-mm . Right , okay I think we've got um a good idea now . We uh  meeting is uh  
D:  Mm . Yeah true . 
A:  Needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly . So uh um we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail . Um then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised . Uh thank you very much indeed . 
D:  <other>  . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  Thank you .
