<other> I'm Kendra 
and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and um <other> 
I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before 
but I'm m 
so 
I'll be <laugh> working on the design . 
Right . 
Yep , 
I'm just open to being creative . 
<laugh> Um probably a duck 
I just  I li I like the way they look 
and they're just nice animals 
and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well 
I think  I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons 
and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well . 
Um , but that  it's easy to  if you can switch back and forth instead of having to <other> press a bunch of different buttons 
and  
so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled 
and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use , 
you know . 
Yeah . 
I think something that's comfortable to hold 
because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things 
and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto , 
so something that's more comfortable 
that fits in a person's hand better . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them  be kind of down 
so you could feel them 
better . 
<other> Oh yeah . 
Like a like a mobile phone ? 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> Well , 
most  I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey , 
so maybe we should go with something different 
or be able to  
I was just thinking of um <other> what they're doing with mobile phones now 
how you can get the different um  what are they called ? Like the face-plates 
that you change 
so we could have maybe  
I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that , 
where you can change the face-plates 
or have kind of a variety 
so people can get different different things . 
Have it kind of look how they want to , different colours , things like that , 
probably just plastic 
because that's always the lightest . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay .
