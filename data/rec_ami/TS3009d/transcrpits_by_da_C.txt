<laugh> W what ? Alri alright . We'll see . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , that's important too . Yeah . <laugh> 
Alright . 
From me of course , yeah . 
Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> It's a nice chorus , yeah . 
<laugh> 
Repeat it yeah . Alright . 
Alright , we both uh will ? 
Or one of us will ? 
Uh  
Alright . 
If I make mistakes uh you'll uh  
Right . Uh well 
this is our design . 
Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . 
With uh the different uh perspectives of it . 
Uh we'll begin uh with the front . 
We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . 
Um with uh the upper part being the front . 
Th So there's this part um <other> which is made of hard plastic , the front . 
And uh we're we're using different colours . 
Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , 
and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . 
But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . 
<other> Um then we have uh the lower part <cough> of the of the device . 
Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , 
because it's also titanium . 
You can see it also on the on the on the side view , 
that only this part is the front , 
and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , 
and has the titanium colour of course , the look . 
Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , 
uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part . 
Yeah ? 
It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo  
Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , 
but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there . 
Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . 
Then we have the buttons . 
Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round  
I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons . 
So  uh oval , n those are here . 
And then we have the m 
The m 
Yeah 
the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . 
Um um with kind of arrow shapes , 
which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh <other> uh square buttons . 
And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . 
We have the Okay button . 
Oh nei 
we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers . 
And then we've here the Menu button 
and the  
And the video button . 
The  
Yeah . 
And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen . 
Uh this is what we made of it . 
You can make uh suggestions uh if you want . 
Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk 
and then you can add suggestions . 
Maybe I I don't want to  <laugh> I don't want to suppress you 
but n I'll uh finish this uh quick . 
Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ? 
Yeah the back . Yeah . 
<other> We thought about  
Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . <other> 
And we thought about the logo big in the middle . 
Just so again the double R_ . 
We have then the logo on front and on the back . 
Maybe that's too much 
but you have to say uh say that if you think that way . 
And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo . 
That's basically what we were thinking about , 
and  
<other> 
Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course , 
the voice recorder is uh at the bottom . 
And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device . 
Why ? 
<other> Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , <other> 
mean uh the the the the  
<other> In the middle in the  
That's the question . 
Uh well  Yeah . 
H What do you suggest I mean we do ? 
 This was Mike's prototype , 
and y you seemed to agreed on it . 
But now you have a totally different  . 
The size ? 
Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean  
Side ? 
Uh oh the side ? 
W we we he drew the s the side , 
but you d you weren't paying attention as usual . 
Well any case , we'll discuss it now . 
Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea  . 
But you you hold it like this . 
You're not holding it like this or something . 
You , yeah , y How do you call it ? Yeah . 
Well y y y you don't have it like this . 
You have it more like this . 
 You you you're using buttons this way , 
or if you're right-handed , this way . 
So you  Yeah . So  
Yeah well  
And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher , 
so  Well  
Well the the  Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but  
If necessary . 
But uh are d Can you live with it ? Uh  
Y Yeah , 
y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable . 
But do you 
But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . I think . 
<laugh> Not totally , well  
Yeah but of course 
y you are also human . 
We have to take uh <other> every everyone into account . So  
Yeah . 
Well uh who who else thinks like you ? 
We don't know . 
Maybe a thousand people , 
or a million people . 
<other> Let it be . 
Alright . 
So that's that . 
Uh any other suggestions ? 
<laugh> You're very personal again . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well d we designed it , 
so of course we are very  
Yeah . 
So and we ha we have answer now ? 
Yeah .  
I  Yeah , I think it  
 
Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one . <other> 
Well , I guess uh I think uh <laugh> it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything .  
That was our target audience of course . 
But it's also not completely um <other> uh u unacceptable for older people I guess . 
Uh it's it's not f a device that  
Yeah , that's that's uh for older people , 
it's it's more that classical look . So  
Uh no . 
<other> I think  
Yeah they like black of course , 
but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also  Uh I think it's also good for them , 
so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . 
So I think it's very good-looking 
and not only for youth uh young people . 
Yeah , the fourteen yeah . 
Is it easy to t change channels ? 
Yeah well I think so . 
<other> I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh  
So I  <other> Yeah . 
You  How can you make it any easier ? <other> 
Yeah , huge is a  Yeah . 
D we d we don't we don't have uh that s 
Yeah . 
Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so , 
but um um  
Yeah . Yeah . 
Mm ? 
Are we take too much time ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah , very much . 
One . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
And I think fancy-feeling too , 
because of the titanium back . 
Yeah . 
So well maybe two 
because of the voice recorder . 
F 
Yeah . 
One or two . Yeah . 
Four ? 
Well , it doesn't really resemble any fruit , uh that's true . 
But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course . 
And you can also have  front with uh with fruit on it . <laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly . 
There had to be some kind of trouble along the way . 
My god . 
The what ? 
The  
Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option . 
No . No , d th No . 
Yeah . 
No . 
N 
Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think . 
Because uh  
 the L_C_D_ screen . 
Yeah . 
No . 
Because uh that uh y <laugh> 
because my information says it . 
Huh ? 
Uh well yeah I I read something about it , but  
<other> 
<other> Yeah , 
I I read something about it , 
but it wasn't very clear . 
I d I didn't in include it in my report . 
<other> Single  
Well you have to use a chip . So  
Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen . 
But if you have a regular chip , you can't have the L_C_D_ screen . 
That that's a fact . Uh  
Yeah , but it's only one half . 
Uh it d it doesn't  
But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen . 
Yeah , I know 
but that's what my information says . 
I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . <other> 
You have to use it . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
For the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Yeah . 
Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again ? 
Because we you have uncurved <other>  
Yeah . 
Well  
But what what did what do n 
Sorry , 
but  <laugh> What do they mean with the curves ? 
Is th Is this a curve ? 
One curve ? 
Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah . 
It's how you  It's how you look at it . 
Well then we have a huge problem I think . 
W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half . 
<laugh> 
But uh I  
<laugh> Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing . 
<laugh> Well that's pretty uh l 
N not very practical . <laugh> Well  
<other> But I'm n I don't agree . 
I think  
I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the  
And also the the older people will like it because of that . 
And because i 
Alright it's not our target audience , 
but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people . 
Yeah . 
<other> I think the titanium is very important . 
Yeah we have a problem , yeah . 
W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then . 
Well what else ? 
W I mean uh  
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah , well yeah . Alright . 
I agree with that . 
So we u we use uh  Unfortunately . Um . Titanium-coloured plastic . 
So titanium-coloured plastic for the back . 
Yeah this is good , 
but it it's not good enough . <laugh> 
So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid . 
What do we  Well what do we know ? 
All we want is a is a fancy design 
but we don't really consider the costs . So  
Yeah al alright , yeah . 
But we have to deal with it now . So  
So  
Titanium gone 
and add plastic . 
And on plastic times two 
and then we uh are there ? 
No  
<laugh> No yeah well  
Oh six . <laugh> 
A lot of plastic , yeah . <laugh> 
No two for the to make it clear . 
I want gold plating . 
No no um  <other> 
<laugh> We have we have to uh fill  
W we ha <other> 
No no no , 
but th that's not f um  
Well you can you can double curve , if you don't have titanium . 
And that we dropped , 
so it it can be done . 
<laugh> But it's pretty funny . 
We we do want to reach twelve point five . 
But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven . 
We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half . 
Objection . 
Well I can't get no satisfaction , but uh  <laugh> 
I think it's uh  
Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah . 
Its it's uh ridiculous actually , but  
<laugh> Which isn't very practical , 
but <other> that's the way . 
Uh-huh . <laugh> 
Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements . 
It's the requirements of the user , uh I guess . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah 
but they base that on on the user specifications . 
<laugh> 
It was a complete disaster . 
<laugh> No  Uh it it it uh it is uh  
No it's other way around . 
That's the SMARTboard . 
That's the digital panel . 
That's that's the smart 
<laugh> A televi Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . Left or right ? <laugh> 
Well I didn't use uh  
Nei It it's much m <other> 
But uh you can uh  
I I sent it about three times now . 
Uh <other> a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing . 
The simple uh sch school board . 
I I didn't use it . 
I wrote things down 
but I didn't import it into my laptop . 
<laugh> That's the   
W <other> But also y you write things down . 
And i you can also bring your your your note block . 
So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into  
<other> Yeah alright . For drawings , 
but not for personal notes . 
I think that's not very  
Uh I mean <other> you can bring your paperwork along 
and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper  
If you've  If you've  <other> 
<laugh> 
Yeah I understand . 
But I think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork . 
<other> You can't  
It's not very uh ni 
Yeah well a lot of documents are  Yeah . 
Mu Yeah right . 
Can we keep them ? Uh . 
Well did you really uh  Did you really take uh take those in account ? 
<other> I <other> half of time I didn't notice they were there . So  
<other> But we shouldn't talk about that . 
Because <other> this is a realistic environment . 
 
Right . Okay . <other> 
<laugh> 
<other> But yeah . W well th that's just the the environment they set us up f with . So  
<laugh> 
Well , for drawing for drawings . Yeah . 
Well  
No  
But it's still an expensive uh expensive  
But if w Yeah . 
Well and if  
And but what if uh maybe this this board uh SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone . 
But suppose it was working correctly , 
what uh would it be useful then , if it wasn't off all the time ? <other> A 
Really ? 
Anything you want . 
Any b b Yeah . L li li 
Yeah . 
Well it isn't , 
but maybe that thing is uh is <other>  
Yeah , board , a school board , yeah . 
Yeah . 
I it has  It is useful . Yeah . 
This uh if it works correct , 
maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning . 
So uh if we get in uh if we get another one 
and you make sure it does work , 
I think then it's pretty useful . 
Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room . 
And then you can save it immediately . 
Did you type that ? 
<laugh> 
Maybe till four o'clock or something ? 
Well dunno . Yeah . 
No 
we must save this thing , yeah . 
In the shared map map . 
Map , is it a good word ? 
The folder , yeah . 
So it is useful , yeah . 
No but uh  
Radical . <laugh> Yeah . 
Do you believe it yourself ? 
<laugh> 
They also want to see my cat and his rabbit , and uh  
Your big beautiful bird . 
<laugh> Maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn't . 
Of or the other way around uh  
Yeah I think so too . 
<laugh> Who is she you're talking about ? 
Oh you mean our uh coach , our f personal coach . 
Is she also our accountant ? 
Is she responsible for sending that information so late ? Oh . 
Because then we have to confront her with our  
<other> 
<laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
That that's our new slogan . 
<laugh> Yeah , I like that . <other> 
Blame our accountants . 
<laugh> But we couldn't , yeah . <laugh> 
<other> <laugh> 
Well I th Yeah . 
<laugh>
