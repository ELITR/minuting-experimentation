C:  this is our design . 

C:  We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . 

C:  Th So there's this part um <other> which is made of hard plastic , the front . 

C:  Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , 

C:  And uh we're we're using different colours . 

C:  and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , 

C:  Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , 

C:  It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo  

C:  I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons . 

C:  the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . 

C:  we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers . 

C:  And the video button . 

B:  Menu for the L_C_D_ screen . 

C:  And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen . 

C:  And we thought about the logo big in the middle . 

C:  And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo . 

C:  the voice recorder is uh at the bottom . 

A:  Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands . 

C:  That's the question . 

D:  Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . 

D:  And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it . 

C:  But you you hold it like this . 

B:  Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree 

C:  Well the the  Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but  

A:  <laugh> For me , I I wouldn't buy it . 

A:  So <other> let it be like this at uh at this moment . 

D:  I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . 

D:  Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? 

C:  So I think it's very good-looking 

D:  Easy to change channels ? 

C:  <other> I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh  

D:  The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ? 

C:  Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so , 

D:  R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? 

A:  Are there enough technology ? 

A:  Uh well well a bit , 

D:  Three . 

A:  Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? 

D:  Three , alright . 

A:  Is the material attractive ? 

A:  So I would say at least two . 

A:  look at the costs at this point . 

C:  My god . 

A:  The sample speaker , 

A:  Kick it out . 

A:  Then we go to fourteen point six . 

B:  Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ? 

A:  Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said . 

A:  What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ? 

C:  but it wasn't very clear . 

A:  Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there , 

C:  But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen . 

D:  Yeah , we need to have the <other> the L_C_D_ screen . 

A:  We can also make it flat . 

C:  Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah . 

A:  No , it's one curve . 

C:  W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half . 

B:  Well we make it more expensive to buy . 

A:  Well , then we have two dollars less profit . 

D:  If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . 

C:  <laugh> Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing . 

B:  Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium , 

A:  Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy . 

A:  I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days . 

C:  So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid . 

A:  But then we can add the special colour ? 

B:  Well I think uh the case is double curved then . 

B:  Well y we have curves in all directions . 

A:  So  alright . 

A:  but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project , 

A:  are we satisfactory about our creativity ? 

C:  Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah . 

A:  and you had to dump all your creativity . 

A:  Uh leadership 

D:  Well it's <laugh>  It was very democratic . <laugh> 

A:  <laugh> Well the managers were terrible . So , with their all their useless requirements . 

A:  teamwork ? 

C:  It was a complete disaster . 

D:  <laugh> That one isn't accurate . 

B:  But I I think this is meant by the digital pen . 

C:  Uh <other> a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing . 

A:  And uh the digi the digital pen ? 

D:  It isn't practical . Right . 

D:  Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . I I agree on that . 

A:  <laugh> N new ideas found ? 

B:  Well I missed uh the option to uh to email , 

D:  Communicate in between . 

C:  uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part . 

A:  If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But  

B:  and only Nils
