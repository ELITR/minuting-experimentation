Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Mm right . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
<yawns> 
Yeah , I agree . 
It depends on the size . 
If it's kinda small , this is is great . 
But if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it . 
Yeah , that's the question . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . 
You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . 
And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it . 
Like you're holding your telephone . 
Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen . 
Yeah , I agree on this . 
No , I don't think so . 
That's not uh the point  
And you might be uh  You might be target customer . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Alright . Great . 
<clicks tongue to sound like a horse> 
<whistles through teeth> 
Well , this is just a short intro . 
I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . 
That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria . 
So I made a  I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends . 
And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . 
Well , I put some questions in a Word file . 
See if I can find them . 
Uh uh uh uh mm . 
Well  
I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , 
so uh I don't have to explain it . 
Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? 
Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . 
Seventy five percent of them . 
So what do we think ? 
Yeah <other>  
No , I know , 
but <other> I have to uh evaluate it . 
So I have to take this questionnaire . 
Yeah <other>  
Yeah , but I can't can s 
Yeah , but uh , you know  We dis we di <other> we designed it to be perfect . 
So <other>  But we have to be critic critical about it . 
And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . 
So we <other> we know where we stand . 
'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten . 
Right , so  
Right . 
Uh is it good-looking ? 
The titanium might be uh f for older people . 
It you put uh put a black front on it or something . 
Right . 
Right . 
Right , a number please . 
So the last one is seven . 
Easy to change channels ? 
Oh , sorry . 
Yeah , right . 
Change channels ? 
Right . 
<other> 
The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ? 
Two ? 
Alright . 
The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ? 
Yeah . 
Six ? Right . 
Yeah , I agree . 
Yeah . <other> 
Alright . Two ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah <other>  
Yeah , I agree . 
No . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Right , 
R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? 
<other> R_S_I_ sensitive ? 
Four . 
Um  
<other> Yeah . <laugh> 
Right . 
<other> Yeah , that's great . 
Well , with the uh  
Three . 
Nah 
f four I think . 
<other> If you look at this  <other> 
No . 
Three , alright . 
Yeah , that's true . 
But  <laugh> 
Right . 
The average will uh come later . 
It has to go to twelve , right ? 
Twelve and a half . 
Out . 
That's easy . 
Kick it out . 
Yeah . 
The speaker . 
That's some wrong info , man . <laugh> 
No . 
It's uh  
It's just extra . 
Kick it out . 
What more ? 
<laugh> Batteries are uh quite  
<other> Uh no , no no no . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , we need to have the <other> the L_C_D_ screen . 
No  <other> 
Yeah , but <other>  
No , that's n It's not relevant . 
Yeah . 
No , <other>  
Then the whole concept is uh 
You  
You can make you can make it cheaper . 
But if you don't sell 
<laugh> 
 No 
no no no . 
 
If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . 
But  Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back . If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy . 
If you if you make it cool to have  
Oh , that's just great . 
Oh , alright . <laugh> 
 
That is pretty stupid . <laugh> 
<whispers to self> 
<laugh> 
Y 
Yeah , I agree . 
I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen . 
Or you shou <other> It's  
Or change the titanium 
or dump the L_C_D_ screen . 
But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen . 
Because you have lots of functions <other> in it too . 
Yeah , I agree . 
Osl <other> 
If you don't have the money , you can't make it . 
So s 
If you don't have the money , you can't make it . 
So this is too expensive . 
So we have to make it cheaper . 
Right . 
<laugh> It's just free , man . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah right . 
I want chrome . <laugh> 
<laugh> Well , th that that is the problem . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Shoot . 
<laugh>

B but you  
This is just a large t large television . 
You u you use the  <laugh> 
Yeah , but you ca 
This is just a beamer function . 
And here , on this one , you can uh draw the pictures and things like that . But  
That one . 
<laugh> That one isn't accurate . 
<other> It just doesn't work . 
You can <other>  
Yeah , but I think there's a big distinction between the <other> these th 
I don't need a SMARTboard . 
Yeah , 
but <other> give me a beamer . 
That's uh that's much uh much cheaper . 
Right . 
Yeah . 
I agree .

Yeah . 
Yeah . <other> 
It isn't practical . Right . 
Your notepad . Yeah .
