A:  Uh fourth meeting . <other> 
B:  We have to do what ? 
C:  <laugh> W what ? Alri alright . We'll see . 
A:  Some extra deciding . <laugh> Well  
B:  Oh . 
A:   I'll show you the notes again . Very interesting . Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  Then um  I guess that's your bit ? I I didn't s see anything about it , so <laugh> I already uh thought you uh you were  to do that . So the you're uh  . I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah , that's important too . Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  <other> Bit late . <laugh> 
A:  And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it . Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close . 
C:  Alright . 
A:  Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh <other> I'll show you the notes . <laugh> I don't think it's very interesting . <other> 
B:  I think it is . 
A:  Oh nei . Uh no . <laugh> Alright . This is copy paste . So  
C:  From me of course , yeah . Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . Yeah . <laugh> It's a nice chorus , yeah . <other> 
A:  Of course . You had some very strange layout . <laugh> Well um  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  We ge we went through the agenda , and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . And uh I summarised what you said to us . So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again . So uh  
C:  <laugh> Repeat it yeah . Alright . 
A:  This is what we decided . It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that . And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us . 
C:  Alright , we both uh will ? Or one of us will ? Uh  
A:  Yeah . 


B:  <other> Alright . No you go and I'll uh 
C:  Alright . If I make mistakes uh you'll uh  
B:  supplement you . <other> Yeah . 
A:  Correct . <laugh> 
C:  Right . Uh well this is our design . Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um <other> which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . <other> Um then we have uh the lower part <cough> 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
C:  of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part . Yeah ? 
A:  Mm . 
B:  Yeah , it's a double R_ , but  It's a double R_ . 
C:  It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo  Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there . Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . 
B:  But <other> it's very difficult to to draw that in  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , alright . Okay . Yeah . 
C:  Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round  I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons . 
B:  Oval yeah . 
A:  Alright . 
C:  So  uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m 
B:  Channel up and volume ? 
C:  Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh <other> uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers . And then we've here the Menu button and the  
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Alright . 
B:  Menu for the L_C_D_ screen . 
C:  And the video button . The  Yeah . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen . 
D:  Mm right . 
A:  So  
B:  <other> 
A:  'Kay . 
C:  Uh this is what we made of it . You can make uh suggestions uh if you want . 
A:  Well if I look at it , the side the side view  
B:  Well , at the back  <other> 
C:  Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk and then you can add suggestions . Maybe I I don't want to  <laugh> I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick . Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ? Yeah the back . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh yeah alright . Yeah  .  
B:  No the back . With the logo and our uh l uh  
C:  <other> We thought about  Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . <other> And we thought about the logo big in the middle . Just so again the double R_ . We have then the logo on front and on the back . Maybe that's too much but you have to say uh say that if you think that way . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  No I don't think  
C:  And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo . That's basically what we were thinking about , and  
B:  And the  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <clicks tongue> Okay . 
B:  And about the side view um  
A:  W 
C:  <other> 
B:  This the front won't be as thick , but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh  
A:  Well I see , but  
C:  Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course , the voice recorder is uh at the bottom . And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device . 
A:  Well . Yeah I see it . Yes . 
D:  <yawns> 


A:  When I look at uh when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible . If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But  
B:  Well , it won't be visible . Mm ? 
C:  Why ? <other> Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , <other> mean uh the the the the  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I agree . 
A:  Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands . 
B:   If y <other> If you handle a remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this . You you have it a bit uh  Yeah . 
C:  <other> In the middle in the  
D:  It depends on the size . If it's kinda small , this is is great . But if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it . 
A:  And how large is it ? 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , that's the question . 
C:  That's the question . Uh well  Yeah . H What do you suggest I mean we do ?  This was Mike's prototype , and y you seemed to agreed on it . But now you have a totally different  . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Well uh  Well the sides I haven't seen yet , uh  ? 
B:  Well , they lay there all the time . 
C:  The size ? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean  Side ? Uh oh the side ? W we we he drew the s the side , but you d you weren't paying attention as usual . Well any case , we'll discuss it now . Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea  . 
A:  They the the the the the side view , we didn't uh  
B:  Yeah yeah . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <other> 
C:  But you you hold it like this . You're not holding it like this or something . 
B:  Yeah you you don't you don't grab it , you you  <other> 
C:  You , yeah , y How do you call it ? Yeah . Well y y y you don't have it like this . You have it more like this .  You you you're using buttons this way , or if you're right-handed , this way . 
A:  <laugh> No no no . 
B:  <other> 
D:  Like you're holding your telephone . 
A:  Yep . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  So you  Yeah . So  
D:  Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen . 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  Yeah well  
B:  That way , it it falls into your hand . I think . <other> 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Yeah , I agree on this . 
C:  And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher , so  Well  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  No , I don't think so . That's not uh the point  
B:  No but but  
C:  Well the the  Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but  
B:  <other> Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree and only Nils  
A:  Yeah well uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it . 
B:  But you're the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions . <other> <laugh> 
A:  Yes . So uh I c I c Well , we'll we we'll do it like this . Alright , if you think that that's the way it should   
C:  If necessary . But uh are d Can you live with it ? Uh  
B:  Yeah ? 
C:  Y Yeah , y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable . But do you 
A:  No  No , when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick  But  
C:  But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . I think . 
A:  In the market uh  No not totally . <laugh> For me , I I wouldn't buy it . Let's say it like that . 
C:  <laugh> Not totally , well  Yeah but of course y you are also human . We have to take uh <other> every everyone into account . So  
A:  No   
D:  And you might be uh  You might be target customer . 
C:  Yeah . Well uh who who else thinks like you ? We don't know . Maybe a thousand people , or a million people . 
A:  Yes but  
B:  Mm . 
A:  Yeah , we don't know , but that's uh that's that's that's more market research . So <other> let it be like this at uh at this moment . Okay ? 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <other> Let it be . Alright . So that's that . Uh any other suggestions ? 
B:  <laugh> <other> 
A:  No , I think it's great . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  But what about the redesigning ? Okay 
A:  <other> Comes to that later . 


A:  Um you . Uh c You can uh  <laugh> Walter . <laugh> You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ? 
B:  . <laugh> <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> You're very personal again . 
D:  <laugh> Alright . Great . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  That's more useful 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  than just <other> speaking . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <clicks tongue to sound like a horse> <whistles through teeth> Well , this is just a short intro . I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria . So I made a  I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends . 
A:  Yes . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Mm-hmm . 
D:  And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . Well , I put some questions in a Word file . See if I can find them . Uh uh uh uh mm . 
A:  'Kay . 
D:  Well  
B:  Hmm . 
D:  I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh I don't have to explain it . Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . Seventy five percent of them . So what do we think ? 
C:  Well d we designed it , so of course we are very  
B:  Mm . 
A:  Yeah , we're we're not quite uh objective about this . 
D:  Yeah <other>  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  No , I know , but <other> I have to uh evaluate it . So I have to take this questionnaire . 
B:  Well we designed it to be good-looking . 
C:  So and we ha we have answer now ? Yeah .  
A:  To the customers ? To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ? 
D:  Yeah <other>  Yeah , but I can't can s 
A:  Nei . Oh no . I know , I know , I know . But um  Well <other> we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . Uh do we find it good-looking ? Well we think so . Uh  
B:  Hmm . 
C:  I  Yeah , I think it  
B:  Yeah . We designed it to be good-looking , so  
D:  Yeah , but uh , you know  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  We dis we di <other> we designed it to be perfect . So <other>  But we have to be critic critical about it . And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . So we <other> we know where we stand . 'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Well , one . 
C:   
A:  Well so it's point four . 
D:  Right , so  
A:  Easy to find t 
C:  Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one . <other> 
D:  Right . Uh is it good-looking ? 
C:  Well , I guess uh I think uh <laugh> it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything .  That was our target audience of course . But it's also not completely um 
A:  Two . <laugh> 
C:  <other> uh u unacceptable for older people I guess . Uh it's it's not f a device that  
D:  The titanium might be uh f 
C:  Yeah , that's that's uh for older people , it's it's more that classical look . So  
D:  for older people . It you put uh put a black front on it or something . 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  Uh no . <other> I think  Yeah they like black of course , but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also  Uh I think it's also good for them , so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . So I think it's very good-looking and not only for youth uh young people . 
D:  Right . 
B:  I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , because I don't know how how many points there are but uh  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
A:  No . I totally agree . We we have to get get on , go through this . 
C:  Yeah , the fourteen yeah . 
D:  Right , a number please . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Is it easy to t change channels ? Yeah well I think so . 
D:  So the last one is seven . Easy to change channels ? 
B:  Um , no it's uh  
A:  No , not false . It's one . 
D:  Oh , sorry . Yeah , right . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Well uh two ? Y Well we have to go through it  . 
D:  Change channels ? 
C:  <other> I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh  
D:  Right . 
C:  So I  <other> Yeah . You  How can you make it any easier ? <other> 
D:  <other> The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ? 
B:  <other> With two huge buttons . 
C:  Yeah , huge is a  Yeah . 
A:  Yep . Two . 
D:  Two ? Alright . The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ? 
A:  Well , no . We didn't implement anything about that .  
C:  D we d we don't we don't have uh that s 
B:  Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something , because of the colour . But  
A:  <laugh> Well six then . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . Six ? Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> <other> 
C:  Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so , but um um  
A:  Are the functions easy to learn ? Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an  
B:   We have so few functions , so  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I agree . 
A:  And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ? 
B:  Well , I should  I think two , because <other> the voice recorder is n not self learning . <other> 
A:  Yeah . Ah . 
D:  Yeah . <other> 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:   
D:  Alright . Two ? 
C:  Mm ? 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , but just do some <other> <laugh>  We we  
D:  Yeah <other>  Yeah , I agree . No . <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  <other> I th I th I think this is too time consuming . Uh not not towards you , but towards this all . Th this is   
C:  Are we take too much time ? <laugh> 
D:  Right , R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? 
A:  We you have to put it to the customers . 
D:  <other> R_S_I_ sensitive ? 
A:  Uh well well a bit , so four . 
D:  Four . Um  
A:  Yes . 
C:  Yeah , very much . One . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  One . And features included also one . And  <laugh> One . Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . Uh we still think so . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Device fancy feeling . Yeah , cool man . 
C:  And I think fancy-feeling too , because of the titanium back . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
A:  Are there enough technology ? Yeah well also we have two . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> Yeah , that's great . 
A:  Is the device easy to use ? Yes we have <other> not many buttons . 
B:  The  
C:  So well maybe two because of the voice recorder . 
D:  Well , with the uh  Three . 
B:  Two <other> two . 
A:  Two , three . 
B:  T 
A:  Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? Well in our covers , in our fronts . So yes , one . Is the material attractive ? 
C:  F 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . One or two . Yeah . 
B:  One or two , another two . 
D:  Nah f four I think . <other> If you look at this  <other> 
C:  Four ? Well , it doesn't really resemble any fruit , uh that's true . But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course . And you can also have  front with uh with fruit on it . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  No . 
A:  Oh okay . Okay  . 
B:  Well three . 
D:  Three , alright . Yeah , that's true . But  <laugh> 
A:  Is the material attractive ? Well the titanium is strong , and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . So I would say at least two . 
B:  Mm . Yeah . 
C:  <other> 
D:  Right . 
A:  Okay . 


B:  <other> <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Well  Yeah . 
B:  This is the last meeting ? Yeah . 
A:  Yes , but we we have to design much more , because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . 
D:  The average will uh come later . 
A:  <other> Um  
C:  I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly . 
A:  Oh . 
C:  There had to be some kind of trouble along the way . 
A:  Uh  
B:  Yeah . <other> 
A:  Yes . Well , look at the costs at this point . 
C:  My god . 
A:  I had to fit it in . 
D:  It has to go to twelve , right ? Twelve and a half . 
A:  I twelve and a half . So  Well what costs a lot ? The sample spea costs four . 
C:  The what ? The  
A:  The sample speaker , the s sensor . 
D:  Out . That's easy . Kick it out . Yeah . 
A:  Kick it out . We have to go to twelve and a half . The speaker costs far , by far the most . 
B:  The what ? 
D:  The speaker . 
B:  Oh . 
C:  Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option . 
D:  That's some wrong info , man . <laugh> 
A:  It it isn't worth it . 
C:  No . No , d th No . 
D:  No . 
A:  We could make two different versions , one with and one without . But for this  <other> 
D:  It's uh  It's just extra . Kick it out . 
A:  So , zero . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Then we go to fourteen point six . 
D:  What more ? 
A:  Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually . 
D:  <laugh> Batteries are uh quite  
C:  No . 
A:  L_C_ three ? Yeah hand dynamo ? Y t come on , w a remote control has a battery . 
D:  <other> Uh no , no no no . 
B:  Um  
C:  N Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think . Because uh  
A:  But then we can add the special colour ? 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  As we have money over uh left . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . W 
A:  And we still have money left . What do we want , guys ? 
C:  I want gold plating . No no um  <other> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah right . I want chrome . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Well I think uh the case is double curved then . 
A:  Yes . 
C:  <laugh> We have we have to uh fill  
B:  Because you y have that curve and you have that curve . 
D:  <laugh> Well , th that that is the problem . 
A:  Y Oh no . <laugh> Alright . 
C:  W we ha <other> No no no , but th that's not f um  
B:  Yeah well uh  
A:  Safe . 
B:  Well y we have curves in all directions . 
C:  Well you can you can double curve , if you don't have titanium . And that we dropped , so it it can be done . <laugh> But it's pretty funny . We we do want to reach 
B:  <other> 
A:  So  alright . 
C:  twelve point five . But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven . 
A:  Finance ? 
B:  I mean , this this ain't titanium , but it looks like it . 
C:  We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half . 


A:  Well , guys ? Guys ? We have to dump our titanium , and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project , <other> <laugh> project . <laugh> Well , <other> satisfaction on for example , are we satisfactory about our creativity ? 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . Shoot . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Objection . 
B:  <laugh> Pro project . <laugh> 
C:  Well I can't get no satisfaction , but uh  <laugh> I think it's uh  Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment . That's really bad . But that that that's that , yeah that's a reason , but also for our creativity . We had um nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , me too . 
C:  Its it's uh ridiculous actually , but  
B:  And uh unrealistic . Well we we we used our creativity , but we just had to adapt it to the costs . 
D:  Right . 
C:  <laugh> Which isn't very practical , but <other> that's the way . Uh-huh . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> <laugh> Nei . Uh no . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Well , alright . Uh leadership next . Uh teamwork ? <laugh> 
B:  <other> Terrible . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Leadership . 
B:  Leadership ? Well  
D:  Well it's <laugh>  It was very democratic . <laugh> 
A:  Uh yeah well <other> I think so also . I al I I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time , so  <laugh> Well the managers were terrible . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  <other> Yeah yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  So , with their all their useless requirements . But o alright , the teamwork ? 
C:  Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements . It's the requirements of the user , uh I guess . 
B:  <other> 
A:  No they said , oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext , uh we won't use the D_V_D_ . <other> <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . Yeah but they base that on on the user specifications . 
B:  <yawns> 
A:  Alright , teamwork ? Well great I think . 
D:  Well  
B:  Right yeah .  
D:  Yeah , think so too . 
A:  Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ? 
C:  <laugh> It was a complete disaster . <laugh> No  Uh it it it uh it is uh  
D:  <other> Yeah , I don't like it . Yeah ? 
A:  Well  
B:  No , that's a SMARTboard , and that's a digital pen . Or not ? 
A:  It's also a It's both the SMARTboards . 
D:  <other> 
C:  No it's other way around . That's the SMARTboard . That's the digital panel . 
A:  I liked this SMARTboard , but I hated that one . Well it's both a SMARTboard . 
D:  This this this isn't a SMARTboard , right ?

D:  Your notepad . Yeah .
