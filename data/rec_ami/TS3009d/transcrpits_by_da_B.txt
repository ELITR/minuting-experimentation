And about the side view um  This the front won't be as thick ,

Yeah . We designed it to be good-looking , so  
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , 
because I don't know how how many points there are but uh  
Yeah . 
Um , no it's uh  
<laugh> 
<other> With two huge buttons . 
Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something , 
because of the colour . But  
<laugh> <other> 
 
We have so few functions , 
so  Yeah . 
Well , I should  I think two ,

Simple .

You must change the chip back , Nils . 
Hmm . <other> No <other> we oh <other>  
You you we have an advanced chip-on-print ,

I think that's a bit double . 
Y we don't need both . 
Says  . 
I ? 
 ? 
<other> One curve . <laugh> 
Well we make it more expensive to buy . 
<laugh> 
Yeah or we could replace it  
Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium , 
uh titanium-coloured plastic ? 
Yeah 
well if we uh we we have to get cheaper . 
But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again . 
Ah no no . 
It's not ugly looking . 
The looks remain the same . 
Well , I do think so . 
 feel . 
Yeah alright 
but then we we won't get there . 
We can dump the special colour . 
We l we use plastic . 
And plastic is already in colour I think . 
No , nothing . 
Amen . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But  
No no no no . 
W Titanium stays there .
