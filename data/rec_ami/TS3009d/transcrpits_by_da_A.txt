Uh fourth meeting . 
<other> 
Some extra deciding . 
<laugh> Well  
 I'll show you the notes again . 
Very interesting . 
Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype . 
Then um  I guess that's your bit ? 
I I didn't s see anything about it , 
so <laugh> I already uh thought you uh you were  to do that . 
So the you're uh  . 
I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design . 
And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it . 
Because uh well we'll see about the costs . 
Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production 
and then uh we can close . 
Well the finance uh we'll do later , 
so um firstly uh <other> I'll show you the notes . 
<laugh> I don't think it's very interesting . <other> 
Oh nei . Uh no . <laugh> 
Alright . 
This is copy paste . 
So  
Of course . 
You had some very strange layout . 
<laugh> Well um  
We ge we went through the agenda , 
and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . 
And uh I summarised what you said to us . 
So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again . 
So uh  
This is what we decided . 
It's also copy paste from what we made together . 
So we still know that . 
And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . 
Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us . 
Yeah . 
Correct . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Yeah , alright . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Alright . 
Mm-hmm . 
Alright . 
So  
'Kay . 
Well if I look at it , the side the side view  
Oh yeah alright . Yeah  . 
 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
<clicks tongue> 
Okay . 
W 
Well I see , but  
Well . Yeah I see it . 
Yes . 
When I look at uh when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible . 
If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But  
Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands . 
And how large is it ? 
<laugh> 
Well uh  
Well the sides I haven't seen yet , uh  ? 
They the the the the the side view , 
we didn't uh  
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
No no no . 
Yep . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah well 
uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it . 
Yes . 
So uh I c I c 
Well , we'll we we'll do it like this . 
Alright , if you think that that's the way it should   
No  No , 
when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick  
But  In the market uh  
No not totally . 
<laugh> For me , I I wouldn't buy it . 
Let's say it like that . 
No   
Yes but  
Yeah , we don't know , 
but that's uh that's that's that's more market research . 
So <other> let it be like this at uh at this moment . 
Okay ? 
No , 
I think it's great . 
<other> Comes to that later . 
Um you . Uh c You can uh  <laugh> Walter . <laugh> You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ? 
That's more useful than just <other> speaking . 
Yes . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
'Kay . 
Yeah , we're we're not quite uh objective about this . 
To the customers ? 
To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ? 
Nei . Oh no . I know , I know , I know . 
But um  Well <other> we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . 
Uh do we find it good-looking ? 
Well we think so . Uh  
Yeah . 
Well , one . 
Well so it's point four . 
Easy to find t 
Two . <laugh> 
No . I totally agree . 
We we have to get get on , go through this . 
No , not false . 
It's one . 
Well uh two ? 
Y Well we have to go through it  . 
Yep . 
Two . 
Well , no . 
We didn't implement anything about that .  
<laugh> Well six then . <laugh> 
Are the functions easy to learn ? 
Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an  
And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ? 
Yeah . 
Ah . 
 
Yeah , but just do some <other> <laugh>  We we  
<other> I th I th I think this is too time consuming . 
Uh not not towards you , 
but towards this all . 
Th this is   
We you have to put it to the customers . 
Uh well well a bit , 
so four . 
Yes . 
One . 
And features included also one . 
And  <laugh> One . 
Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . 
Uh we still think so . 
Device fancy feeling . 
Yeah , cool man . 
Are there enough technology ? 
Yeah well also we have two . 
Is the device easy to use ? 
Yes 
we have <other> not many buttons . 
Two , three . 
Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? 
Well in our covers , in our fronts . 
So yes , one . 
<laugh> 
Oh okay . Okay  . 
Is the material attractive ? 
Well the titanium is strong , 
and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . 
So I would say at least two . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Well  Yeah . 
Yes , 
but we we have to design much more , 
because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . 
<other> Um  
Oh . 
Uh  
Yes . Well , 
look at the costs at this point . 
I had to fit it in . 
I twelve and a half . 
So  
Well what costs a lot ? 
The sample spea costs four . 
The sample speaker , 
the s sensor . 
Kick it out . 
We have to go to twelve and a half . 
The speaker costs far , by far the most . 
It it isn't worth it . 
We could make two different versions , one with and one without . 
But for this  <other> 
So , zero . 
Then we go to fourteen point six . 
Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually . 
L_C_ three ? 
Yeah hand dynamo ? Y t come on , 
w a remote control has a battery . 
Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said . 
Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ? 
What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ? 
And simple ? 
<other> Nothing . 
Well  ? 
Your part . 
What happens if we do  
How much do we win ? 
One . 
 
Yeah . 
Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there , 
because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour . 
Yeah , 
then you s then you only have one half left . 
Uh yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah ? 
No , <other> 
the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display . 
Says , his  Uh that was in the second meeting , I think . 
Well I I did single curve to  
Well you said s double curved , 
uh he , 
because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already . 
We can also make it flat . 
But  
Curved ? 
Yes , that's curved . 
Yes . 
No , it's one curve . 
One curve , simple . 
We have a big financial problem . 
Well , then we have two dollars less profit . 
Come on , 
if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh  <laugh>  
By the way , we also have this one . 
Oh , costs nothing . 
That's nice . <laugh> 
Plastic is  <other> 
Yes , 
but I just got it . 
Who ? 
You want to dump the titanium ? 
And make all plastic , then we ha then we're there . 
Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy . 
No , I don't think so . 
Yes . 
And the feel , 
and th that it is strong , and  
We still <other> 
we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , 
but not lose the one  
Why can't I  
I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days . 
I I'll talk to the managers . <laugh> 
Titanium , I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote . But  <laugh> 
Ah those  those account managers , what do th d what do they know ? 
Come on . Riot . <laugh> 
Yes , yes . 
One and a half Euros . Hmm ? 
So ? 
Well , no it's just uh all plastic . 
<laugh> Well alright . Huh . 
 <laugh> 
<laugh> Four . So  
But then we can add the special colour ? 
As we have money over uh left . <laugh> 
And we still have money left . 
What do we want , guys ? 
<laugh> 
Yes . 
Y Oh no . <laugh> 
Alright . 
Safe . 
So  alright . 
Finance ? 
Well , guys ? 
Guys ? 
We have to dump our titanium , 
and we'll hate the managers for that , 
but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project , 
<other> <laugh> project . 
<laugh> Well , <other> satisfaction on for example , 
are we satisfactory about our creativity ? 
<laugh> 
I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment . 
That's really bad . 
But that that that's that , yeah that's a reason , 
but also for our creativity . 
We had um nice design , 
and then you get the cost , 
and you had to dump all your creativity . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Well , alright . 
Uh leadership 
next . 
Uh teamwork ? <laugh> 
Uh yeah well <other> I think so also . 
I al I I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time , so  
<laugh> Well the managers were terrible . So , with their all their useless requirements . 
But o alright , the teamwork ? 
No 
they said , oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext , uh we won't use the D_V_D_ . <other> <laugh> 
Alright , 
teamwork ? 
Well great I think . 
Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ? 
Well  
It's also a It's both the SMARTboards . 
I liked this SMARTboard , 
but I hated that one . 
Well it's both a SMARTboard . 
No . 
It's both a SMARTboard , 
but this one is used for a desktop , 
and that one is used to to draw . 
Well , wi w which one did you like ? 
<laugh> That one . <laugh>

We're now talking about the SMARTboards . 
Or install a laptop to a beamer , 
or have this one standing here in an 
 I I like it . 
Okay , alright .

So  
And uh the digi the digital pen ?

Yes . 
For drawings , yes .

But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict  
Uh you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . 
And notes uh for a meeting are very strict .
