Okay . 
So do I unplug this bit here ? 
Okay . 
Right . 
That's page one of my presentation . 
So 
the uh method . 
We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . 
Um remote control works as follows . 
This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . 
Um sends message to another system , 
so 
there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , 
there's an integrated circuit , 
which is the microchip , 
um and that actually compose the messages 
and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . 
A user interface controls the chip , 
basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . 
So 
my findings , 
um I just did a preliminary study here 
and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . 
And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . 
Um too much metal is used sometimes 
and people pick up radio signals and the like , 
and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire 
and injuring the customer , 
just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad . 
Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . 
Um , components . Just some ideas that I had , 
um , energy source , 
it's kinda hip to be eco friendly 
so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . 
Um the user interface , 
I was  
since we can't use metal 
I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic . 
The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , 
we can't really be different in that respect . 
Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 
'cause it is the industry standard , 
multi channel , 
that's a word I made up , 
I don't really know what it means . 
Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible 
and uh probably a two hundred foot range . 
Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . 
Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s . 
Um personal preferences , 
I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , 
um , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits 
which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value , 
'cause we were thinking  
Right . 
Yeah that shouldn't be a problem . 
Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do . 
<other> That's the end of my presentation . 
<laugh> 
Is it plugged in well ? 
There it goes . 
Computer adjusting . 
Mm . <other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Right . 
I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology . 
With a simple command like locate . 
And then it could start to beep 
and 
therefore be found . 
Oh yeah I think that's very doable . 
It's a good point . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
I was thinking uh  
Oh go ahead . 
Yeah . 
Gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things . 
It seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . 
The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism . 
So it's just something to consider . 
Back to the uh the cost  the material . 
<other> We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? 
That's something I w for  
say we're including three or four face plates , it's gonna drive the cost up . 
And the other question is , if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market ? 
We haven't done any tests on face plates and whether  
See if there  if there's even interest out there . 
Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Can we afford to include one of those ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Right . 
Okay . 
Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? 
Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody . 
What what would be on that touch screen ? 
'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um 
logo or something or motto , 
I can't remember exactly what you said . 
'S too much . 
Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen . 
That'd be okay . 
Mm . True . 
<laugh> 
People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on . 
They just want it to be on and ready to go .
