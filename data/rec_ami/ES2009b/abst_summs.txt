A:  I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um <other> remote control . 
A:  And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found 
A:  and then we'll have a bit of discussion . 
A:  what I've just found out from the board 
A:  but it needs to be television only . 
A:  we're not doing D_V_D_ , 
A:  Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it . 
A:  that's red and black . 
A:  And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . 
A:  Um and no teletext . 
A:  I'm not sure what teletext is 
A:  so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design . 
A:  <other> For reasons that I don't really know . 
A:  but it's the board so there you go . 
A:  given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design 
A:  we'll discuss it later

abst_sum - abstract: The Project Manager went over new requirements for the project: that the device was solely to control television, and that there would not be a teletext component.

A:  I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation 
B:  We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . 
B:  Um remote control works as follows . 
B:  Um sends message to another system , 
B:  there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , 
B:  there's an integrated circuit , 
B:  which is the microchip , 
B:  and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . 
B:  A user interface controls the chip , 
B:  basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . 
B:  and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . 
B:  And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . 
B:  Um too much metal is used sometimes 
B:  and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire 
B:  just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad . 
B:  Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . 
B:  Um , components . Just some ideas that I had , 
B:  um , energy source , 
B:  it's kinda hip to be eco friendly 
B:  so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . 
B:  Um the user interface , 
B:  since we can't use metal 
B:  I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic . 
B:  The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , 
B:  Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 
B:  'cause it is the industry standard , 
B:  Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible 
B:  and uh probably a two hundred foot range . 
B:  Um personal preferences , 
B:  I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , 
B:  which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value , 
A:  <other> Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics 
A:  that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value 
A:  on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice , 
B:  Yeah that shouldn't be a problem .

abst_sum - abstract: The Industrial Designer gave his presentation on the basic components of a remote control device, and advised the group to use plastic for the casing material instead of metal.

A:  <other> Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well . 
C:  Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . 
C:  Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , 
C:  it needs to be universal 
C:  um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices 
C:  although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem . 
C:  Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . 
C:  Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , 
C:  some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control 
C:  sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well 
C:  but uh this remote control has many functions 
C:  but it uh it is quite complicated 
C:  and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions 
C:  because they don't know how to use them 
C:  and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it . 
C:  Um . Another remote control , slightly different , 
C:  it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions , 
C:  um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . 
C:  Um it also has a bit of a cheap look 
C:  and it's also quite boring . 
C:  my personal preferences . 
C:  <laugh> Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control . 
C:  Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device 
C:  but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with . 
C:  Um . Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face

abst_sum - abstract: The User Interface Designer presented the technical functions of remote controls and compared the interfaces of two existing remote control products.

D:  I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got 
D:  and we had a usability test 
D:  where we were actually sort  like watching a hundred people <other> use T_V_ remotes 
D:  and see what it is that they're using 
D:  and then they filled out a questionnaire 
D:  about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices . 
D:  Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , 
D:  the majority of the time that's all that's going on , 
D:  for some people they're important , 
D:  the other functions happen , 
D:  but the primary uses are really really basic . 
D:  Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , 
D:  they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with . 
D:  <other> And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their  the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they can't find it in the room . 
D:  So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . 
D:  <other> Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes , 
D:  and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , 
D:  and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . 
D:  I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , 
D:  but it is s something worth thinking about , 
D:  especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , 
D:  Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are

abst_sum - abstract: The Marketing Expert made a presentation of the needs and the desires of the consumer and emphasized simplicity as one of the most desired features.

A:  I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um <other> through you guys's presentations 
A:  um <other> we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . <other> 
A:  Um Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions 
A:  um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , 
A:  you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , 
A:  <other> um so do we wanna go for that , 
A:  or do we want to go for an older demographic , 
A:  if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics <cough> um . <laugh> 
D:  <other> We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so . 
A:  So maybe this  we should look into this younger demographic . 
A:  <other> uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster 
A:  um think we're constrained to plastics 
A:  we've got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um , 
A:  this voice operation thing is  I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable , um at least for the basic controls , 
A:  you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ 
A:  but we might be able to say um <other> volume up . 
B:  I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology . 
B:  With a simple command like locate . 
B:  And then it could start to beep 
A:  The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find . 
A:  but then again you have this wee  this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too . 
C:  A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television . 
A:  but  yeah I like that , I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system . 
C:  <cough> The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control . 
C:  So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market . 
C:  and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not . 
D:  Are we still thinking about this screen  
D:  if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that's an option technically right now to that ? 
C:  I've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not , 
C:  they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point . 
D:  especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , 
C:  'S definitely an option technically . 
D:  menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things 
B:  Gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things . 
B:  It seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . 
A:  I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development 
A:  I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , 
A:  but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control . 
A:  Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it 
A:  I guess we've c we've touched on most of this . The idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates . Um . 
A:  we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ? 
C:  I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable . 
C:  We could have the casing , the the face plates . 
B:  <other> We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? 
B:  Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere . 
D:  in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , 
D:  whereas you're just sit at home , 
A:  we can  we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth , um . 
A:  but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important . 
C:  have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um  
A:  Yeah I think that would be best . 
A:  based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased 
A:  try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic 
A:  With a touch screen for the basic functions . <other> Um  
A:  let's provisionally  let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff 
A:  basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . 
A:  it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls . 
A:  <other> Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost . 
D:  'Cause it would have a docking base ? 
A:  But then again that costs as well . 
C:  these new lithium batteries they last twenty years <other> even with the touch screen ? 
A:  I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in 
A:  if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple 
A:  Um <other> it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um 
A:  Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button 
A:  that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control 
A:  to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep . 
B:  Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? 
B:  Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody . 
B:  What what would be on that touch screen ? 
B:  'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um 
B:  logo or something or motto , 
A:  it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control . 
B:  Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen . 
D:  it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading 
C:  I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device . 
D:  Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 
D:  'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think . 
A:  it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there . 
B:  People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on . 
B:  They just want it to be on and ready to go . 
A:  But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . 
C:  all you have to do is touch the screen 
C:  and it automatically goes on . 
A:  or go into like a dormant mode .
