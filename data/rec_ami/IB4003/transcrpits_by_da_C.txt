Ch 
<sharp inhale> 
And don't forget the  
I have a copy . 
Two  
Six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen . 
Do we really need that ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And if we don't get this space then what happens ? 
These , yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
why didn't we have a meeting together ? 
Well , certainly we have to ask uh Pierrette and uh and Maggie , 
since they're not here , 
because they also have a lot of students that they have to see as we do , 
and so that's another consideration , too . 
Oh great . 
Ye mm before um talking more about individual preferences , is there any possibility , what they have done in the uh faculty of law , for example , that they actually split rooms ? 
And so we would take uh uh one of the two people rooms and split it . 
And you would see that you would have the same size office , 
but that would give the privacy . 
Um insofar as in just about every other faculty in the building , every professor has their own office . 
And it's it's really  it goes a bit far that uh we have to have this uh all this sharing uh . 
So one option  and that  but that we would need to ask about if we could uh split one of the rooms uh  
That doesn't really solve it uh  
I mean there's there's really a difference to having  to have your own  
Yeah ,  
and sometimes you have uh  you need to have private uh discussions with somebody or whatever , so  
Well , I I think it's uh really a matter of personal preference . 
As you know um , I prefer to have uh my own office . 
Um , I also have uh a lot of phone calls 
and y you know , have to see people , 
and with the other work that I'm doing with the rectorate uh , that is really confidential information that I'm treating . So I  That I have to be really careful about too . 
But it's a personal preference uh . 
Insofar as what we've had up until now , both Maggie and Pierrette have been happy to share with others . 
So I mean I think that we should still check with them  
Well , not sharing with each other . 
They each share with an assistant . 
Yeah . 
Paid on that  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , and also some of our  the people mentioned here are working on more than one project too . So  
For example , uh Marianne de uh  , she's also working with me on the virtual campus project , 
so she  
that one wasn't mentioned , 
but I'm not saying that I necessarily want to be with her in the office , 
but uh it's just to say people are working on uh sometimes more than one project uh  
Yep . 
Yeah . 
Well , yeah , 
we'll skip that for now . <laugh> 
No I d 
um the lounge okay , 
but I think we need to also see it as a overflow place when we have um uh visitors for any length of time , so they actually have a place to work . 
No , 
you want to have visitors . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yes , 
but we have more space here than what we currently have , 
so it's at least some  
Mm-hmm . 
No . 
No , 
because they can share their ideas across the project , yeah , I would say . 
No , 
and if you look now at their uh the the current division of the offices , for example , uh Bruno and Agnes are sharing an office 
and they're working on totally different projects 
and and they're they're just fine with that . 
Well , there there were , 
but they sort of disappeared as of October when the no smoking rule came in , 
because before we were grouping the smokers 
and now that there's no smoking , uh I guess that's not very important option , though  
Well , except for that maybe you don't even want anybody smoking on your balcony , so  <laugh> 
No . 
No , 
n it's in in principle it's a it's a no smoking building . 
You can smoke outside . 
So you can go outside onto the balcony to smoke . 
Not even in the cafeteria . 
No . 
Full no smoking building for all of the six thousand students . 
There is the  there's that terrace . 
Yeah . Yep . 
No . 
The other way . 
No , 
we we do have one constraint that's difficult , which is uh Gisella , 
because when she's there she's very noisy . 
She's on the phone a lot  
It's just it's by  
Yeah . 
It's by nat uh by the nature of her work that uh a lot of it is communication . Yeah . 
Yep . 
<other> I think that's a excellent idea . 
Why don't we ask about that ? 
I mean there is certainly enough space uh down the hall , 
wi if all of those uh uh offices that are , where half of them are also half time , and they're very under-used . So um  
<other> And Pierrette too . 
Yeah , 
yeah . 
with with younger people , 
No . 
So  <laugh> we we invite invite  and then we say , okay you can sit with Gisella . <laugh> 
Except for in every other faculty . 
Um  
Yes , it is so . 
Every other faculty as far as I have seen their offices and the people that I know and that's in um in law , uh socio-economics , uh okay ? 
It's a  They all have their own office . 
I mean in in the in the law faculty they're at best there half time . 
We're gonna have to . 
Okay , 
I'll ask um uh Maggie and Pierrette uh if they have uh any preferences . 
Yeah . 
No . 
Yeah , since they're not at the meeting I think it's in  out of courtesy we should first ask them . 
He means reading room . 
No . Coffee machines . 
No , there's the cafeteria is downstairs , 
but they close at five . 
Yeah , 
but there's the two machines , 
and they're uh the vending machines where you just put the money 
and and you can get  
Yeah . Yeah . 
Wait . 
Wait , wait . 
Tuesday um  
<other> Um we have the  don't forget we have the other meeting the M_D_M_ meeting in the morning , 
so it would have to be in the afternoon . 
Yeah . Exactly . 
Yeah . 
At nine thirty , 
but we could do  we could have this meeting then in the afternoon . 
Nah ? 
Yep . Okay . Yeah . Okay .
