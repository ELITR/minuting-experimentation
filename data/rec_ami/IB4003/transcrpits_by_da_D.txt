 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Oh yeah . 
Andre , just , yeah , just a a clarification question , 
are they  number of people per room indicated strict , or can we play around with ? 
I mean if there are two people , is it really that you can't put three or uh two and a half or uh 
how how was it calculated ? 
'Kay . 
Mm-hmm . 
I have everything . 
Okay , so  
Are you sure of that ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , 
but counting the rea the the reading room . 
Mm-hmm . 
And Susan , don't forget the time we spend to  for discussions about that room , 
so you should be able to valorize this if possible . 
But I still agree with you that the b the  we are not so we are not so large , as far as space is concerned . 
Uh because fifteen people to put in there eighteen positions , 
so uh to the best uh if you take uh two people room for the reading room , then you have uh sixteen places . Mm . 
Yeah , that that also means that the growth will be zero . 
Visiting visiti visiting researchers , 
students coming for  exchange students et cetera . 
We j we stay where we are . 
No the the the chances might be that there are more people to put in that space . 
Andre , sorry for interrupting , 
but uh one again clarification question , 
what is the real margin of manoeuvre that we have for these discussions , 
because uh at least we are half per cent  uh fifty per cent of from E_P_F_L_ 
and uh sometimes you have meetings where w y the the decision is already taken , 
so uh um you can spend quite a lot of time discussing things , 
so what what will be the impact of what we will come out  come up with ? 
So , another way of a 
Another way of asking the question , is there any other group already working on uh on the how this should be uh should be allocated ? 
Or are we the the one that is supposed to do the p the the p position for it ? 
But wha why why don't they have any representative here . 
Yeah , 
why do we do it separately ? 
I mean  <other> 
Okay . 
No , 
but you know that that's a standard thing . 
It's  
Suppose that somebody for some strange reasons want to be in the corner and we don't know about that , 
we'll put them  put her or him somewhere else , 
then we will do plenty of work for nothing , 
because we'll not have this constraint . 
We'll not be aware of this constraint . 
Oh , okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I agree with that . 
That's  
Whe whe where part-time is important is that it's n an overlo load on a room , 
so um for sure if you have a part-time person , it reduces the the ranges of time where too many people in the room . 
As far as I am concerned I probably might be able to have a kind of a regular presence here . 
Um , the uh the thing that f in my case has to be taken into account is that I will have a lot of phone calls . 
So I'll be talking o o o over the phone all the time . 
So that's not necessary  
Well , it depends on  
I I have nothing against sharing a a an office with somebody . 
I d already did it before , so  
and it was perfectly fine . 
It just has to be somebody who can work while somebody else is having phone calls in the in the room , which is very d much dependent on people . 
Some people are not disturb at all by this . 
Some people just can't work . 
I'm not . 
But uh  and uh what might happen , but it uh it will not be so heavy here uh at ISSCO is visitors . 
So that I will have more at E_P_F_L_ , uh typically students coming in um or asking for things . 
As I'm not teaching here , I'm teaching at E_P_F_L_ , this should shouldn't be a  such a big load . 
So for me it it will be essentially  I will not be I will not be able to be silent in the room , 
because I will be communicating also through vocal means , so  
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
Do you go for boxes for instance ? 
In the in the bigger rooms where , yeah  You know like uh cubicles ? Yeah 
You mean , you really want to have walls . 
Yeah , sure sure . 
Yeah . 
Four walls . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
I fully agree with that . 
That's uh  it's much easier to me to uh to foresee having two people of the same position sharing a room , than uh  
Oh sharing with their students . 
Oh sorry ,  
because  but that that's uh it's it's tricky because of confidentiality reasons , as you said . 
Yeah , you you you are discussing a budget on the on the project , you over the phone typically 
you don't necessary want to have somebody who will be dependent on that budget being part of the discussion , so  
No . 
No , 
because pro project doesn't last in time . 
They will change . 
That's what  
The only thing that will not  or that will change only progressively in time is the status of the people . Mm . 
Yeah , 
they will promote that . <laugh> 
But still , th some things  Well , yeah . 
Yeah . 
If if it if i if projects are what you have in mind , I think that uh meeting room is the the tool for that . 
If you need to have people in a projects talking together , they just have a meeting room 
if it's not too far away then then it's a very good good practice . 
Yes . 
That's why I was quite receptive to uh Susan's remark at the beginning is 
<other> I wouldn't formulate it in a such a an extreme way as , do we really need the lounge ? 
But uh I would p probably formulate it in the way that uh , do we want to have only a lounge or s something that can be used only as a reading room ? 
Because because meeting rooms to me are very important tools to do uh collaborative work . 
But on the other hand we also have to relax , so that's  
Yes . 
Yes . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
'Cause that's really my  one of my worries with the plan that we have here is that it's  it pr provides no possible  possibilities of expansion . 
And this will happen . 
I mean you can't you can't prevent having visitors . 
<laugh> And you shouldn't . 
Which for for fifteen people it's not enough . 
I mean uh  
Yeah it's  
We have we have four professors here and and and two researchers . 
Mm . 
It's bad it's bad . 
Because this is really related with security uh regulation as well . 
I mean you can't just put walls in in rooms without any specific authoris Yeah . 
Uh it's not necessary heavy in terms of work . 
It's heavy in terms of administrative authorisation . 
At least at E_P_F_L_ . 
I think so . 
If you organise the desks in a in a intelligent way . 
Yeah , right , that's the point . 
No . 
Yep . 
Coffee machines are that  made for that . 
No , 
that's that's  proximity doesn't play a big role there . 
We can discuss with people that 
the the space is very small , 
I mean , altogether it's  
And uh you don't y you don't need to discuss about the projects , 
you f more need about th to discuss about where is the printer , how do I get furniture , I'm  I don't have a a pencil , where is the the box with the pencils , and so on . 
This is not project related . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that's true . 
No . 
It's non-smoking campus . 
Not even in the cafeteria ? 
Downstairs ? 
Okay . 
Wow . 
<laugh> On the roof maybe . 
The balcony , okay . 
But Andre , uh just a  
Still some places where smokers can survive . 
But Andre , just a comment abou about your your previous uh request . 
I I don't think that anyone will provide you information such as who doesn't want to be with whom . 
That's a typical uh <other> output of ex uh research in expert systems . 
These are the rules that you never get . 
But uh you can get them through a proposal . 
So you propose a set-up , where people are with other peoples 
and they will find politically correct ways to tell you that uh they don't want to have a view on the mountains , but they prefer to have view on the old town , 
so they would be in   the toilets . <laugh> 
They would um p prefer to be in another room . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But that's a sec s that's the admin that's the admin uh so it's part of the work . Yeah . 
And that that's a problem , you're right , 
because because we don't have a one person we d we don't have enough one person rooms for uh accommodating the uh the admin place . 
And uh if you put two person persons or three persons for the admin space , who who who else would you put in there ? 
Because we don't have any assistant manager 
or we don't have  We have only one half part  half-time uh admin 
and no other non-researcher positions , if I'm not mistaken . 
And this is really a piece of a problem . 
Maybe you could put some visitors , but um  I know . It's not very uh realistic in a in a in an admin room , but uh  
Yeah , because  You can't put a researcher there . 
That's just  
Either you lose one position or you find another admin or assistant manager . 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
No that's not sure  that's not sure . 
Uh the there are  To me there are two options possible 
is either you  we can take one of the one person rooms for the admin , 
because some of , typically , the professors have good reasons for sharing . 
Sharing either with a colleague or sharing uh with some of their uh one of their P_H_D_ students . 
In that case it's it's realistic . 
Then we could very very simply uh allocate the one pers one of the one person rooms for the admin . 
And that would solve the problem . 
The other thing is to take a two person room for the admin . 
That could be the one uh close to the uh close to the  here in the centre so uh the  
Yeah . 
But tha No no no , 
the other one , the the one op Yeah , here , this one . 
But then uh that <other> the the question of what do we do with the second position there remains fully open . 
So I would be I would be more of the opinion to to see whether it's it's so evident that , let's say the at least the two full full-time professors that are here on the list , we have one here , but uh Maggie is is not present . If they really  Yeah , and Pierrette . If if if <other> because of personal preferences they would be happy with a two person room , which might or might not be the case . 
I mean it's it's certainly not uh something that we should impose , 
but we can ask . 
Yeah , but that's not realistic either . 
I mean , you have you have a fore foreign researcher coming visiting you and you will put put him in the admin office ? 
Uh you'll not do that . 
I mean uh , maybe you can do that with an exchange student , that's  
But you can't take a senior visitor and uh  <laugh> him in the in the secretary . 
<laugh> Uh you're here . <laugh> 
As Susan said , p 
<laugh> Yeah ? 
Is that so ? 
Oh . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
No no , that's it . 
As we said , it's it's really a matter of personal preference , 
it cannot be something else . 
It cannot be imposed for sure . 
It's uh  
 job . 
Again uh uh um , Andre , I think that the only realistic way we can do is to speak for our for ourselves . 
I can tell you according to what I know now where I would like or would be ready to be , 
but I really don't see how I could decide for uh Maggie or Pierrette or whoever else on the list , that they should be there . 
Yeah , b why why couldn't we do like  couldn't we do it like for for the the set-up of meetings . 
You you  <laugh> 
everyone received that and uh should provide  Yeah , I would like to be here . 
And then you will have this multi-constraint problem 
and uh you work during two hours and you come up with the optimal solution . 
Yeah , 
I would I would ask for their place . 
I mean that's that's that's the important thing you want to know . 
Uh it's a reading room . 
Reading room , it's not a cafeteria . 
But that that's an open question 
whether it's a it's a it's a it  
At the origin it was supposed to be a f pure reading room for relaxing , uh reading the newspapers , et cetera , et cetera . 
Uh there has been a very long discussion about that . 
I stinct uh this discussion is still vivid , that some of the people , I bel belong to these people , would like to have a mixed room where you can have a reading room for sure , but also meeting room if necessary . 
Or , as uh Susan said , a room  an emergency room where you can put uh some visitors in a decent environment for for for for work , 
because you don't have any other place to do it . 
But that's that's really an open discussion 
and that d I think no decision , no final decision has been taken about that . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
<laugh> The one that I don't want to have in the next room ? <laugh> 
Okay . 
Okay . 
That would be great . 
That would be great . 
C that that of course is one of the main  well not main but one of the important features that we need to know about . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
We don't have cafeteria . 
No , there is no coffee in the reading room . 
That was the wrong  
We <laugh> we did not have any money for buying the coffee machines , so  
Five . 
And you can bring your coffee in the reading room . 
T to try the coffee ? <laugh> 
Wait , wai wai wai wait . 
Next Tuesday . 
not so easy , eh ? 
Uh , well well well well , 
Next Tuesday we have a meeting , yeah . 
That might be  
Where is the meeting ? 
It's Unimail ? 
Okay , so , yeah yeah , then it could be that  
That  yeah . 
That that would be great , 
because that would allow us not to move , or not to travel twice . 
Yeah , after lunch . Right . Yep . Okay . 
Thank you .
