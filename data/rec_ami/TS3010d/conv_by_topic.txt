A:  Yes . 
B:  And uh  We uh we had some uh <laugh>  We had a new idea <laugh> that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside . And then it covers the  these buttons 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay . 
B:  until here or something . And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick . 
D:  Yes . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . And then it can break . 
A:  Okay . And the buttons ?

B:  Very obvious . 
C:  Up is channel up . Down is channel down . To the right is volume up . To the left is volume down . 
A:  <other> 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ . What's the R_R_  d <other> 
C:  The R_R_ ? 
B:  R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo . 
A:  Okay . Very good . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  So , we have  
D:  That's on the rub rubber part . 
B:  Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here . Oh . 
D:  Yeah ? 
A:  So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good . So , that's it . 


A:  That's prototype . Now , the finance . <laugh> We don't know if it's  th it  if it's okay . So , I'm gonna look . We have  Sorry ? 
D:  Alright . <laugh> Do we  Do we change the  Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ? 
A:  Finance is um  Yeah it's  No , first uh  Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet . Sorry . 
D:  Okay . That's uh um   That can be none . 


D:  Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh  uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh  Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . <laugh> So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Criteria . 
D:  You   So we open up that blank here . Um  <laugh> Think I can  Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm . 
A:  No , it's okay . 
D:  Well , uh we can't do that . 
C:  I'll get it . 
A:  Oh , it's okay . 
D:  Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item . 
A:  What do you think ? 
D:  Yeah , I think it's uh  <laugh> Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh  it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it  Um , I think I will give it a  yeah , yeah , yeah  , a four . Hmm . 
C:  I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . 
D:  <other> 
C:  What uh  not anoth uh , not a lot of uh  a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six . Sorry , six . 
A:   Yeah . 
D:  So now i I think you uh see it  um its statement . And you  true or false . And true is one . 
C:  Oh , true or false . Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two . Sorry . 
D:  So , yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Two . You ? 
B:  Three . 
A:  Me too . So it's a three . 
D:  'Kay . Um , well  It's a one . <laugh> The first item . So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers . 
B:  Mm  
D:  Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that . 
A:  So it's a  
D:  That's uh a six . 
C:  Five . 
B:  Mm , four . 
A:  Yes , it's for the younger g group . So it's uh half half of the people . 
B:  Yeah , but it's it's  
A:  So I think it's four . 
B:  Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons . So  I mean , the colours are for young people , but 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  No . Yes . So , I think it's four . 
B:  older  
D:  <other> 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Maybe version uh three point O_ uh  <laugh> has other colours . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . Maybe . 
A:  Okay . Give it a four . Yep . 
C:  Four . 
D:  Four . Uh , okay . Mm . 
A:  We put the fashion in electronics . 
D:  That's uh the motto of our company . Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? I um  Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two . 
C:  Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Yes . Two . 
D:  Two . 
A:  Uh , I say uh a five . It's not fashion , it's new . It must be a fashion . But it isn't . Yes . It w If it's not a fashion 
C:  It  it will be fashion . 
A:  we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh  <laugh> Okay . 
B:  Then make it th three . 
D:  Okay . Yes , I'll think of that too . Yeah , agree ? 
A:  No . Oh . I use my feet though . <laugh> 
C:  'Kay . Three is okay . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Oh , we'll wait outside . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> A three . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Yeah okay . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five . 
C:  I give it a one . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:   . Yes , a one . I like it . 
A:  Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half . <laugh> 
D:  We have to do our uh  Two or three ? Two . Okay . 
C:  Say two . Two . 
A:  Okay , two . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep . Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average . So , um that's why it's a negative in it . Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to <other> uh this fashion , I  We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two . 
C:  One . 
A:  <laugh> You ? 
B:  One . <laugh> 
A:  Me too . One . 
D:  One . <laugh> Um , but <laugh> where where is the  ? 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Next , six . It does not get lost easily . 
D:  So  Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ? 
C:  <laugh> Uh  <laugh> Just a small thing . <laugh> 
B:  Yes . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  No , we did not . So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ? I don't think so . 
B:  Yeah , but uh  Yeah . 
C:  Ah . Yellow . Looks like a pistol . Uh  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yes . Not a not a normal shapes . So  
C:  It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch . 
A:  No . It won't get lost . So  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh  
D:  It won't . 
A:  A one ? <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , o one . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay , a one . Next . 
D:  One . Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market . Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two . 
A:   Yeah me   
C:  Yeah . Me too . 
A:  That was our target . Two . 
C:  Two . Yeah ? Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yep . Right . There's a fancy look-and-feel . 
D:  Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I didn't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ? I would say yes . So um  Well , let's also give this a two . T 
C:  I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's  Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy  trendy . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Yes , a one . 
A:  I say a two . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy . So I think s two is better . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , okay . 
D:  Okay . Two . And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends . 
C:  Two is okay .  . 
A:  No , it's new . Innovation . 
D:  If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh  We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . So , I would  did not give this uh a one or two . I  We'll go for a three . 
C:  Oh . I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Uh  
A:   . 
D:  Yes . 
C:  But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Mm , three . 
A:  Me too . Three . 
D:  A three . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating . So , we will do that . Yes . 
A:  Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty ,  . Twenty one . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third . 
D:  By nine . 
C:  Two . 
D:  Yeah . Um , uh okay . <other> Two . 
A:  Yep . 
D:  Come on . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh , nah . Okay . 
D:  So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think . 
B:  <laugh> Yes . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  So , it's good . 
D:  So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . <laugh> 
A:  Okay . Thank you . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , I think  . 
D:  Oh . Nah . How am I doing ? Yes . And I closed your slide-show . 


A:  Okay . Back to my uh  
D:  Which one was the last for you ? Uh , dreaming . 
A:  Yep . Next please . So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ? 
D:  Next . Finance . 
A:  Um , so if uh  I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Cheapest there is . 
A:  Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip . 
C:  Expensive . 
A:  Yeah it's the most advanced . Chip-on-print . We have that one . 
C:  Well , it's the most advanced . 
A:  We have the simple , regular and advanced . 
C:  Advanced . 
A:  We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved .   <pause filling noise> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  So  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Then we have plastic , wood , rubber .  we have half rubber , half plastic . 
B:  Mm , yes . 
A:  No titanium . Special colour . Yes , yellow . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh , yellow . <laugh> 
B:  Mm , yeah . 
A:  Interface , push-button . Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display . So , we have the L_C_D_ 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ? 
C:  One . 
D:  One . 
A:  And it's not really a s 
C:  Joystick uh thing . 
D:   . 
A:  Yeah , it's this one . Now , uh button supplement . Special colour . We already  Uh , that's the  from the  for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm , yeah . 
A:  So , then uh  then then then then then then  Then  
C:  <laugh> We're not gonna make it . <laugh> 
A:  Uh , no . It's too expensive . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> Wh 
A:  So , we have to change something . Fifteen Euros . Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve . 
C:  What what are the costs ? <laugh> Fifteen . 
A:  We have rubber , special colour . 
D:   . We would have uh n 
C:  A special colour . Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour . 
A:  Oh , no , we  No , it's uh  Sorry ? 
C:  Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ? 
D:  For a remote control . I've  For a remote control , I think it is . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> What ? Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right . 
A:  Um , then we uh lose two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much . Exactly the special colours . 
C:  And what if we use only one sort of um  
A:  So  
C:  Um <other> just only plastic or only rubber ? 
A:  That's one Euro . 
C:  One Euro discount . <pause filling noise> 
A:  So , I don't think that's good . Mm  I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . If  
C:  If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left . 
A:  Yes . Then it's only thirteen Euros . 
C:  <other> And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ? 
A:  So uh  yeah . Yeah . Then you have  Or you have to cut this off . 
C:  Uh  uh-uh . 
A:  Then it's not good anymore . So , wait . Okay . I'll have a look . 
C:  No . 
A:  <pause filling noise> We  
C:  And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour  it's a normal colour , wh <laugh> No one will see it . <laugh> 
A:  Yellow rubber . Yeah , normal . 
C:  Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left . 
A:  Uh  
C:  And it's twelve Euros , I think . 
A:  One minute , please . Uh  <pause filling noise> Is it maximum . Um  Yeah , it's normal colour . But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ? 
C:  No . Uh , no , no , no . Uh  
A:  Or it's then a regular ? 
C:  Oh , wait wait wait . 
D:  The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ? 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh yeah . 
A:  So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick . 
C:  Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . 
A:  And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ? 
C:  If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ . 
A:  Yeah , regular chip . But  Is it a good design ? 
C:  Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ . 
D:  If uh  <other> 
C:  So , the T_V_s has to uh  have to be up-to-date . 
D:  If we have the n no buttons  If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have  uh , we have thirteen Euros ? 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm , yes . 
D:  And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ? 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Then it's okay . 
C:  Huh . No knew that . 
D:  Yeah . <other> 
A:  Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we  then we get push-buttons from half a Euro . 
C:  Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay . 
A:  Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour , 
B:  Okay . All the same uh  
A:  you have to pay point two Euros . 
C:  So , all the buttons has to  have to be the same colour . But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh 
A:  Yes . 
C:  for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ? 
B:  Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what  Yeah . 
C:  Recognisable , yeah . 
A:  Yes . 
B:  Mm , yeah . 
A:  So  
C:  Yeah ? 
B:  Okay . 
C:  Okay . 
A:   So  Well  Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ? 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Oh , well that's clear . 
A:  <laugh> So  And  
D:  <other> 
A:  Where's  ? Yeah . So , now it's  
C:  And the joystick away . And its buttons . 
A:  Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Now it's  
D:   still , he waited at the  <laugh> 
C:  <celebratory noise> 
D:  No . 
A:  Very good . 


A:  Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well  What do you think of it ? Uh  <other> 
D:  <other> 
C:  About the 
D:  Project . 
A:  About the project . 
C:  process . Went good . Uh  I think uh the creativity uh <laugh> was good enough . <laugh> We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote . <laugh> So  <laugh> yeah that was clear . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh  no , uh o only the  <laugh> the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . <other> Nope . 
A:  Okay . And you . 
B:  Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh  Yeah , it uh  It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um  Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor  and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion . 
A:  Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions . So , it's good for the speed . 
C:  <laugh> No . 
B:  No . 
C:  Yep . 


A:  So , I think we're ready . Good price . Evaluation ready . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Ready . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <celebratory noise> Beer . 
A:  <laugh>
