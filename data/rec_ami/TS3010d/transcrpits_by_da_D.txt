<laugh> This is it . 
Yes . 
Yeah . 
That's on the rub rubber part . 
Yeah ? 
Alright . <laugh> 
Do we  
Do we change the  
Do we change the the order ? 
Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ? 
Okay . 
That's uh um   
That can be none . 
Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . 
But I have uh a introduction how it works . 
So , it will come up . 
Uh-oh . 
Okay . 
Um , yeah . 
Well , we uh  uh , 
I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , 
uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . 
Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? 
And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . 
We can uh  
Well , it look like this . 
But we gonna uh do it here , they said . 
<laugh> So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . 
Yeah . 
Okay , yeah . Yeah . 
Um , well uh we have the Word document 
<laugh> 
You   
So we open up that blank here . 
Um  
Think I can  
Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . 
But um , if I can get a number in here . 
Hmm . 
Well , uh we can't do that . 
Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . 
Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . 
And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . 
The first uh on each item . 
Yeah , I think it's uh  <laugh> Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh  it doesn't contain many new features . 
Only the L_C_D_ . 
So , it  
Um , I think I will give it a  yeah , yeah , yeah  , a four . 
Hmm . 
<other> 
So now i I think you uh see it  um its statement . 
And you  true or false . 
And true is one . 
So , yeah . Yeah . 
'Kay . 
Um , well  
It's a one . <laugh> The first item . 
So , okay the second item . 
Um , this product is for all sorts of customers . 
Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market 
and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . 
It doesn't look like that . 
That's uh a six . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Four . 
Uh , okay . 
Mm . 
That's uh the motto of our company . 
Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? 
I um  Yeah . 
I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . 
Um , so I would give it a two . 
Two . 
Uh  <laugh> 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yes , I'll think of that too . 
Yeah , agree ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> A three . 
Yeah okay . 
The next element um is the product looks good . 
Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . 
So , I would give this a five . 
We have to do our uh  
Two or three ? 
Two . Okay . 
So , well we gonna do the next part . 
Uh , yep . 
Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . 
Um , yeah , 
I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . 
And in the end we calculate an average . 
So , um that's why it's a negative in it . 
Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . 
So , um uh did we uh do that ? 
Well , uh if we go to <other> uh this fashion , I  We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . 
But you can you can go for that . 
And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . 
So , I would give this a two . 
One . 
<laugh> Um , but <laugh> where where is the  ? 
So  
Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
It won't . 
One . 
Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market . 
Uh yeah , did we achieve that . 
I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two . 
Yeah . 
Uh , yes . 
That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . 
I didn't uh say it in my presentation . 
But um , 
well does it have that ? 
I would say yes . 
So um  
Well , let's also give this a two . 
T 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay . Two . 
And um , then the last one I could think of , 
uh it goes with the latest trends . 
If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , 
well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food 
but we didn't uh  
We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . 
So , I would  did not give this uh a one or two . 
I  
We'll go for a three . 
Yes . 
A three . 
Okay . 
So um , come back to the presentation now . 
So , we find yourself there , 
and now we have to calculate an average rating . 
So , we will do that . 
Yes . 
By nine . 
Yeah . Um , uh okay . <other> 
Two . 
Come on . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think . 
So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . <laugh> 
Oh . Nah . 
How am I doing ? 
Yes . 
And I closed your slide-show . 
Which one was the last for you ? 
Uh , dreaming . 
Next . Finance . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
One . 
 . 
 . 
We would have uh n 
For a remote control . 
I've  
For a remote control , I think it is . <laugh> 
If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right . 
wasn't it ? 
The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ 
If uh  <other> 
If we have the n no buttons  
If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have  uh , we have thirteen Euros ? 
<laugh> 
And then uh we move the the colour . 
What will that be ? 
Yeah . <other> 
<other> 
<other> 
 still , he waited at the  <laugh> 
No . 
Project . 
Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . 
I think um  
Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . 
Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient . 
Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor  
And with a normal mouse . 
and uh you would also see there . 
Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . 
Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . 
And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . 
To tell their opinion . 
Yeah . 
Okay .
