So , it's good . 
Okay . 
Thank you . 
Okay . 
Back to my uh  
Yep . 
Next please . 
So , now uh we have a product . 
Very happy . 
But uh , is it cheap enough ? 
  <pause filling noise> 
Um , so if uh  
I'll have a look . 
We have a battery . 
One battery . 
Okay , one battery . 
Electronics . Advanced chip . 
Yeah 
it's the most advanced . 
Chip-on-print . 
We have that one . 
We have the simple , regular and advanced . 
We have the adva advanced . 
'Kay , so uncurved or flat . 
Nope . 
Single curved or double curved ? 
We have double curved . 
So  
Then we have plastic , wood , rubber . 
 we have half rubber , half plastic . 
No titanium . 
Special colour . 
Yes , yellow . 
Interface , 
push-button . 
Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display . 
So , we have the L_C_D_ 
We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ? 
And it's not really a s 
Yeah , it's this one . 
Now , uh button supplement . 
Special colour . 
We already  
Uh , that's the  from the  for the buttons . 
The buttons are regular colour . 
So , then uh  then then then then then then  
Then  
Uh , no . 
It's too expensive . 
So , we have to change something . 
Fifteen Euros . 
Yeah , 
well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 
'Cause we can't lose the battery . 
We can't lose the advanced chip . 
We can't lose the double curve . 
We have rubber , special colour . 
Oh , no , we  
No , it's uh  
Sorry ? 
Um , then we uh lose two Euros . 
Then we have thirteen Euros . 
Half a Euro too much . 
Exactly the special colours . 
So  
That's one Euro . 
So , I don't think that's good . 
Mm  
I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . 
If  
Yes . 
Then it's only thirteen Euros . 
So uh  yeah . 
Yeah . Then you have  
Or you have to cut this off . 
Then it's not good anymore . 
So , wait . 
Okay . I'll have a look . 
<pause filling noise> We  
Yellow rubber . 
Yeah , normal . 
Uh  
One minute , please . 
Uh  <pause filling noise> 
Is it maximum . 
Um  
Yeah , it's normal colour . 
But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ? 
Or it's then a regular ? 
So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick . 
And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ? 
Yeah , regular chip . 
But  
Is it a good design ? 
Mm , yes . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Then it's okay . 
Okay , so no joystick . 
Oh no , but we  then we get push-buttons from half a Euro . 
Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . 
No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . 
Twelve and a half Euros . 
Then it's okay . 
So , we have to change that a little bit . 
And you cannot use the red and green button . 
Because if you give them a s uh colour , 
you have to pay point two Euros . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
So  
 So  Well  
Now we have to change that , 
but that's okay . 
Rubber . 
What's the normal colour ? 
<laugh> 
So  
And  
Where's  ? 
Yeah . 
<other> 
So , now it's  
Yeah . It is . 
But then it will be just that ones . 
Now it's  
Very good . 
Now , uh project eva evaluation . 
Well  
What do you think of it ? 
Uh  
About the project . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
And you . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Well , what do I have to say . 
I think it was good . 
Not too many discussions . 
So , it's good for the speed . 
So , I think we're ready . 
Good price . 
Evaluation ready . 
Ready . 
That's it .
