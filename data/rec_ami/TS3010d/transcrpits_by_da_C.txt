Five . 
Mm-hmm . 
Maybe version uh three point O_ uh  <laugh> has other colours . <laugh> 
Four . 
Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . 
But the rest of it is . 
So , I think a two . 
It  
it will be fashion . 
<laugh> 
'Kay . Three is okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Oh , we'll wait outside . 
I give it a one . <laugh>

It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch . 
Uh  
Yeah , o one . 
Yeah . Me too . 
Two .

Yeah . 
I gave this a one because of the rubber . 
It feels soft . 
Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . 
It's  Yeah . 
Yeah , f very fancy  trendy . 
Two is okay . 
 . 
Oh . 
I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . 
Uh , the latest trends are soft things , 
you know , like uh I said in my presentation . 
Uh  
But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . 
Something what also younger people want . 
It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two . 
Two . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , I think  . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Cheapest there is . 
Expensive . 
Well , it's the most advanced . 
Advanced . 
Uh , yellow . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
One . 
Joystick uh thing . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> We're not gonna make it . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Wh 
<laugh> 
What what are the costs ? 
Fifteen . 
A special colour . 
Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour . 
Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ? 
<laugh> What ? 
Yeah . <laugh> 
And what if we use only one sort of um  
Um <other> just only plastic or only rubber ? 
<pause filling noise> 
One Euro discount . 
If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left . 
<other> And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ? 
Uh  uh-uh . 
No . 
And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour  
it's a normal colour , 
wh <laugh> 
No one will see it . <laugh> 
Normal colour , and the the joystick away , 
and put the button up , button down , right , left . 
And it's twelve Euros , I think . 
Uh  
No . Uh , no , no , no . 
Oh , wait wait wait . 
Oh yeah . 
Oh yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah , yeah . 
If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ . 
Uh , yeah . 
Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . 
And you don't have the L_C_D_ . 
So , the T_V_s has to uh  have to be up-to-date . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Huh . No knew that . 
Yeah , 
then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay . 
So , all the buttons has to  have to be the same colour . 
But then the print on it will g um change it . 
Make it uh 
for everybody to see what button it is . 
Uh l How you call it ? 
Recognisable , yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah ? 
Okay . 
Oh , well that's clear . 
<celebratory noise> 
And the joystick away . 
And its buttons . 
Yeah . 
About the 
process . Went good .

I think uh the creativity uh <laugh> was good enough . 
<laugh> We have a gun instead of a remote control . 
Um  
Uh leadership . 
Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote . 
<laugh> So  <laugh> yeah that was clear . 
Team-work okay . 
Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . 
And uh  no , 
uh o only the  <laugh> the drawing uh was very difficult . 
But , nah .
