Uh , Dave Cochrane . 
User Interface Defin Designer , yes . 
Um  <other> Um , the monkey , um . 
The one f uh  
in fact this is a  somewhat oblique reference 
in fact to 
uh  well 
my  
I have a three uh three y year old daughter 
who h who who who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey . 
Um , monkeys have attitude . 
Which I think is a good thing . 
And I mean fr <other> and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting . 
Um , so I like monkeys . 
And and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most . 
Well , 
one thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes 
that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , 
so you get the sort of you get um you <other> 
you can redesign the interface to your own needs , 
you can programme in macros , 
and you get a much greater degree 
um um I mean you get in these sort of <other> three in one , five in one , whatevers , 
but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to a much greater extent , 
and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound , for instance . 
Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . 
And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket . 
Absolutely prohibitive , 
yeah . 
Yeah , 
I mean I wouldn't like to say you g <other> 
I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , 
but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . 
Some  
and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for <other> um running macros . 
For instance , 
um let's say oh oh um , or um you know 
you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , um 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , 
something that just fits <other> fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . 
But of course , uh al al also allows for  the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall , <other> . 
A curve , 
mm-hmm . 
Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , 
<other> uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway .
