B:  Okay , well I think we're ready to begin . Right , my name's Adam Duguid , we're here because of real reaction , um , we have in the group 
C:  Oh , Ebenezer Ademesoye . Would you like me to spell that ? S 
B:  Um , yeah , go for it mate . 
C:  Um , N_E_Z_ 
B:  N_ E_ Z_ . Ebenezer . And your role is ? 
C:  E_R_ . I'm the Marketing Expert . 
B:  You're the Marketing Expert , okay . Next we have ? 
D:  Tarik Rahman . T_A_R_I_K_ . 
B:  T_ R_ I_ K_ . And your role in this is ? 
D:  Industrial Designer . 
B:  Industrial Designer . And , lastly we have ? 
A:  Uh , Dave Cochrane . 
B:  And you're going to be the User Interface , is it ? Designer . Okay . 
A:  User Interface Defin Designer , yes . 


B:  Right . This is the agenda for today's meeting . As you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . Um , we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance . 


B:  So , the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , as you probably all know . The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . Course , we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that , but uh <other> personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design . Um , there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . This is how today seems to be going to work . We're gonna have the three kay phases , as you've probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . Um  First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . Second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . Of course , you've all got the similar emails , I believe , right . 


B:  <other> What can I say ? Ebenezer , you wanna have a  you wanna draw your favourite animal <laugh> ? 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Sure . <cough> Whiteboard . 'Kay . S okay . I will make this quick , since we don't have much time . <other> Um . <other> 'Kay , so it's not the best picture in the world . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <other> Here we have an elephant . First point , begins with an E_ , same like Ebenezer . Also , elephants have a very good memory , much like myself , and I can't remember back when I used to live back in Nigeria , but I think I used to have a pet elephant . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  So elephants are big , strong and gentle , and they have great memories , and they begin with the letter E_ , just like Ebenezer . 
B:  Brilliantly done . Thank you . <laugh> Tarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ? 
C:  Thank you . 
D:   . 
D:  <laugh> Uh , destroying your elephant here . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <other> <other> <other> Uh , here we have a tiger . Uh  I've always loved tigers . They're just  they're big , they're biggest cats , uh I did a project on cats in the wild when I was a kid and uh it was my favourite cat , just 'cause it was  looks the best , the stripes , orange . My dad used to talk about  he's from Bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was  when I was a kid . And uh they're just the most feared of of uh animals in the wild . So uh that's why I like them . Didn't say an anything about me really but <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Excellent , thank you very much . Dave , if you'd like to uh have a dash . 
A:  Um  <other> Um , the monkey , um . The one f uh  in fact this is a  somewhat oblique reference in fact to uh  well my  I have a three uh three y year old daughter who h who who who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey . Um , monkeys have attitude . Which I think is a good thing . And I mean fr <other> and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting . Um , so I like monkeys . And and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Cheers . Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now . Also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but uh cats are one of my favourite animals , they're very independent , they're snotty as hell at the best of times , and uh , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal . 


B:  Right . I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , so , on to it . Project finance . As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit . That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware , and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them . 
C:  Oh , that was profiting , that was an amount , so that's the amount made , okay . 
B:  Yep . Well , fifty million , and if you're making twelve point five Euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold . 
C:  Yeah . 


B:  Okay . Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project . So I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls . Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ? 
B:  Okay , well we're beginning to run out of time now , so , we've got a couple of ideas , we can  we'll have to work fast , um , alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so <other> we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , um , how the user interface might work , that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it , you have to have a lot of response back , or at least some kind . Um  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  And we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out 
C:  What the user wants uh . Okay . 
B:  what the user wants , yes . Um , right . 
B:  Um , right . 


B:  I'd say we finish this one up , we get started , I'll get in , I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done , and I'll get that out to everybody . 
C:  'Kay . So . 
B:  Yeah ? Okay . <laugh> 
D:   . 
C:   . 


B:  Um , as far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here , um unless we get told otherwise , and just take the laptops with us .
