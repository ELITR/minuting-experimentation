Well 
um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , 
um when I was younger 
we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , 
but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , 
and <other> the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games . 
So perhaps one that was more um 
specialised for game playing or interactive television . 
They they've recently brought out this new remote control , 
for people to set their favourite channels , or um to record things . 
Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , 
and slide another bar to say what time it ends , 
you know that's  
Yeah , 
it's it's taken out the  
Y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control . 
I think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot . 
<other> 
Uh , you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , 
so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and stuff like that . 
Yeah . 
What the user wants uh . 
Okay . 
Oh . Okay ,  . 
Mm-hmm . 
'Kay . 
So .
