Okay , well 
I think we're ready to begin . 
Right , 
my name's Adam Duguid , 
we're here because of real reaction , 
um , we have in the group 
Um , yeah , 
go for it mate . 
N_ E_ Z_ . 
Ebenezer . 
And your role is ? 
You're the Marketing Expert , okay . 
Next we have ? 
T_ R_ I_ K_ . 
And your role in this is ? 
Industrial Designer . 
And , lastly we have ? 
And you're going to be the User Interface , 
is it ? 
Designer . Okay . 
Right . 
This is the agenda for today's meeting . As you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . 
Um , we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance . 
So , 
the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , 
as you probably all know . 
The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . 
Course , we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that , 
but uh <other> personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design . 
Um , there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway , 
so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . 
This is how today seems to be going to work . 
We're gonna have the three kay phases , 
as you've probably already been told , 
the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . Um  
First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . 
Second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , 
and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . 
Of course , you've all got the similar emails , I believe , 
right . 
<other> What can I say ? 
Ebenezer , you wanna have a  you wanna draw your favourite animal <laugh> ? 
<laugh> 
Brilliantly done . 
Thank you . <laugh> 
Tarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ? 
Oh , um , 
you can clip them to your belt . 
You should also l um have your  the lapel mic on as well . 
Yep , 
the  , it's just across there , 
that's it . 
Yep . 
Yeah . 
It'll follow you 
if you  
You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now , 
I wouldn't worry too much . 
Should have good range . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Excellent , 
thank you very much . 
Dave , if you'd like to uh have a dash . 
Cheers . 
Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world 
but it'll do for now . 
Also not quite as feared as your average tiger , 
but uh cats are one of my favourite animals , 
they're very independent , 
they're snotty as hell at the best of times , 
and uh , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal . 
Right . 
I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , 
so , 
on to it . 
Project finance . As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit . 
That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware , 
and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . 
If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them . 
Yep . 
Well , 
fifty million , 
and if you're making twelve point five Euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold . 
Okay . 
Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project . 
So 
I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls . 
Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ? 
Okay . 
Okay , 
yeah , tha that's true , 
with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our  
yeah . 
But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion . 
Would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of  
Okay , that sounds like a a good strong idea . Um  
<other> Any takes on this ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah 
I've heard  
I've seen the bar-code design before , 
yeah . 
<laugh> 
Okay , well 
we're beginning to run out of time now , 
so , 
we've got a couple of ideas , 
we can  
we'll have to work fast , 
um , alright 
as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , 
so <other> we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , 
um , how the user interface might work , 
that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility 
because you have to program it , 
you have to have a lot of response back , or at least some kind . Um  
And we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out 
what the user wants , yes . 
Um , right . 
Has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage , anything they think that might have been missed so far ? 
I I don't see why not , 
almost everybody is probably used to a console by now , 
and all of them incorporate small keypads on them , 
in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well , 
so it's probably an interface that most people are used to . Um 
and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well . 
Okay . 
So , 
small , stylish , and something that's just a little different . 
Okay . 
That's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily . 
I would I would have hoped so anyway . 
Um , right . 
I'd say we finish this one up , 
we get started , 
I'll get in , 
I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done , 
and I'll get that out to everybody . 
Yeah ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Um , as far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here , um unless we get told otherwise , 
and just take the laptops with us .
