 
<other> Oh God . 
Uh , no that's okay , 
sorry . 
Um is it okay if I postpone that til later , 
I just want to get access to a little bit more information , 
is that okay ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Could I  can I interject to ask a question there , 
is that appropriate ? 
You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the  surrounding it ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Right , 
the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ? 
Oh I see . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
That's a very important part , 
it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present . 
No . 
The plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? No . 
Meter adjusting . 
Mm . 
'Kay . 
Have I got to keep this here ? 
Does it matter ? 
I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I ? 
Uh , whoops . 
Will it manage ? 
Bit more , 
oh dear . <laugh> 
Oh . <laugh> 
Is that okay ? 
Thank you , 
just pull it closer a little bit . 
Get it right over , 
okay , thank you . 
Okay , um , 
I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view 
and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . 
<other> Um , so that's where we started , 
we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , 
we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , 
male and female , 
all age groups from fifteen upwards 
and um we observed them in the lab , 
just their general use of the remote control , 
you can see we had a hundred subjects there . 
<other> Our findings , lots of findings , 
I've just summarised some of them here . 
The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , 
so it has obvious design implications there . 
Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . 
Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , 
we were quite surprised by that finding , 
but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . 
Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . 
For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , 
so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . 
So again there's power implications there . 
<other> Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , 
so again a big design issue there . 
Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um 
the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , 
it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh 
fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . 
Uh thirty four percent of people take  said they take too much time to learn to use 
and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , 
they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . 
Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . 
You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . 
Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , 
again that was to aid I think in uh  when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . 
Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . 
Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . 
So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five 
and in the older age group it kind of reverses , 
they're not so bothered with this . 
<other> I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you , 
but I think I'll just keep it simple , 
if there's any more information I can email you extra details , 
is that okay ? 
Mm-hmm , 
so can we not programme a video with this remote control ? 
Just channel-hopping . 
Would that imply video use ? 
Mm-hmm , yes . 
Yes . 
Um we didn't really look into that 
but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons , 
I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on 
and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
In fact I've just called up that table there , 
we asked those two questions , 
the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate . 
Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen , that's multi-function remote 
and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? 
So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there , 
and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , 
I think that's just general fear of new technology . 
Oh yeah . 
Right . 
Mm . 
Yes . 
That's a super idea . 
Yeah . 
Yes , 
further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , 
it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty 
and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . 
What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno , 
you get the idea . 
It's it's gonna vary around the world . 
At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , 
it's the user interface design that may  and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . Mm-hmm . 
Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm , mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
I'm concerned , 
when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , 
I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . 
Um , R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements . 
I'm j I really can't get my head round this one , 
this may have to be postponed to a future meeting 
but it's something we should think about . 
Mm . 
I know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes I know . 
Yeah . 
Yes . 
Mm-hmm . 
Do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . 
Do we really have to go for everyone right away ? Um . 
Mm . 
And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people . 
<cough> 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm <other> . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , 
for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate 
and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first 
 it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this . 
Mm . 
Right , 
I've not come across that function 
but it sounds wonderful <laugh> . 
Ah , hmm . 
Right . 
Superb . 
Mm . 
Yes . 
Right . 
Excellent , mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Right . 
Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , 
I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , 
but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me ,  to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features , 
um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it , 
they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones . 
Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service 
so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? 
Mm . Mm-hmm . 
Right . 
Alright . 
<laugh> Yes 
<laugh> If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel , 
but I mean for  if there were any more  
or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video , 
we're not gonna put any  <other> 
okay , just a thought . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Sure . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Not for such simple functions 
because we're focusing on that , 
yes okay . 
Mm . 
Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes . 
Sure , okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
And we don't w 
I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical , 
these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . 
We definitely  
an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , 
we don't want that . 
Mm-hmm . 
Slightly curved , curved . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
 
I mean look at the mobile . 
I think that's  <other> that sounds a really attractive idea , 
I've not come across anything like that before , 
if it kind of 
 yeah 
and that opens out into your flip-top . 
Then it's nice t to h 
you can make it lightweight plastic , 
nice to hold in the palm of the hand 
and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think . 
I think it's a really nice idea 
and plus you can get  <other> 
you know even though we're using plastic , you can still  I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , 
we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Less chance of it being lost too , 
it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa 
and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament 
they don't  not gonna lose it so much <laugh> either . 
It's easier to  bit nice to handle . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything . 
So it's no teletext , 
it's only for T_V_ and by implication video , 
our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , 
um something about Videoplus . 
Right . 
Right . 
Right , so when they press for programming you  it comes up on the L_C_D_ , a reminder about using Videoplus ? 
So that they have a look at the guide and  
Or was  is this nothing to do with the project requirements , 
is this just  that was an add-on feature ? 
Uh-huh . 
Right . 
Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ? 
Right . 
Mm , and the rechargeable batteries . 
Was there anything else there that we  in the new new project requirements ? 
Mm-hmm . 
That's not at the moment a requirement , 
it's something we're looking at , 
what preference  
so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like . 
Okay . 
What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? 
Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Whoops , questionnaire four . 
'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think .
