Okay . 
Oh , that's not gonna work . <other> 
Oh , alright . 
<other> Okay . 
Okay . 
Um alright . 
I'll just put that there . 
Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . 
Uh I'm Nick Debusk , 
I'm the Project Manager . 
Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um . 
Go ahead . 
'Kay . 
Okay . 
Um so 
we've got our opening , 
our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . Uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing . 
Uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . 
Um so 
we are putting together a new remote control . 
Um we want it to be something original . 
Um of course we're a  not only a electronics company but a 
fashion um conscious electronics company , 
so we want it to be trendy um 
and we want it to be easy to use . 
<other> Um we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design 
um which basically is is the three of you um . 
And w uh <laugh> well um 
functional design um . 
Um do we have  um any ideas of of  <other> maybe d 
let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , 
and then we can go into how we're gonna design it 
and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it . 
So 
we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or  
I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ? 
'Kay . 
Mm-hmm . 'Kay . 
I I think  yeah , yeah , r universal remote . 
Um this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control , 
so  
<laugh> I think we're all in the same boat here . 
<other> Um  
Okay . 
So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh 
like a tracking device 
or or like a a  
It makes a noise , 
there's a button on the T_V_ that you press 
and  
'Kay . 
Yeah . 
Do we want  
so they're kinda like long and rectangular . 
Do we want something crazy ? 
You know , 
we want something new that's gonna stand out . 
A m a modern  so our remote should be  
'Kay . 
Um . 
<other> Okay so  yeah , 
so we want it to be sturdy , 
we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room 
or , as you said , 
people kinda throw it , 
so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe , 
then it  
'Kay . 
Um so 
we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , 
um  
So our form and our function . 
Um we want it to be um easy to find . <laugh> 
Um  <other> 
What else  it  what else do we want it to to do ? 
So we want it to be universal . 
It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros 
um and you know , 
goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so . 
'Kay . 
So marketing , 
you know , 
how  maybe uh 
marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing <laugh> remote control out there . 
'Kay . 
Um  <other> 
Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? 
Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . 
Some ideas ? 
We want it to be a b a ball , 
you know , 
we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball 
and maybe th um where the buttons are located . 
<laugh> 
Uh-huh . 
How would we go about um making you know  getting rid of our weak points ? 
What  
I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? 
<laugh> Not to put you on the spot , 
but  
What did you say your title was again ? 
You're the the Industrial Designer . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
<other> Yeah . 
It's not new , 
it's not innovative , 
it's  
you know , 
everybody does long remote 
because it's easy , 
it's it's stable um . 
So if  <laugh> 
no , 
go ahead . 
Something with a grip . 
<other> Yeah . 
Because even  I suppose even with the ball 
it's  
it might not be the easiest to hold onto um . 
So perhaps the the joystick  the the keyboard idea might work better . 
But then again , people like to use one hand to flip 
and one hand to hold their soda , 
so maybe maybe we  
I feel like I'm just shooting everything down here . 
Uh <laugh> um  
Yeah . 
Okay , so 
unfortunately we've got about five minutes here <laugh> to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . 
Um we've talked about our experiences with remote control 
and um we've got a couple ideas um . 
Let's see here . 
What if we had what if we had not only um  
say we went with the ball the ball function 
um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um 
to make it easier to hold on to . 
So you know um s so 
it's easier to hold onto that way . 
Course that'll then remove some of our our ball . Unless this unless this part were raised , 
so 
say the cover flips over 
and covers that part . 
So the grip is  
No , that wouldn't work either um . 
But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . 
So if it were flat on the bottom 
and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess , 
um 
and then <laugh> flat uh  
And then we have the problem with the hinge . 
So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , 
it'll stay where we want . 
Mm , that's true . 
So 
we don't have it flip open . 
We just have a ball  
Okay , 
so then we forget the ball . 
<laugh> It looks cool , 
but it's really not  it's not functional um . 
So we've got our sort of keyboard kind . 
What if we flipped it around here , 
so that it were um  
Sorry , 
that doesn't look anything like what you <laugh> had there . 
Um so 
it's up and down , 
you hold it this way . 
Course then it's it's like the rectangular <laugh> again , only with a couple of jutting out points . <laugh> 
But it's one-handed um . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . <other> 
Yeah , 
because it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks do . 
Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? 
So that either way you're pointing it it would work . 
More expensive and  yeah . 
<other> 'Kay . 
Um  
True . 
'Kay . 
Are we out of time ? 
Okay , well , 
just to finish up , 
should we s go with this plan , 
start making some  
Are good ideas , what are not . 
Uh . 
Must finish now , so . 
And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want . 
Okay . 
And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next <laugh> time around , 
be a little bit more prepared . 
And uh alright , 
good meeting .
