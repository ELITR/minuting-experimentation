Uh , uh , um . 
Okay . 
<other> I am Corinne Whiting 
and I will be the Marketing Expert 
and in each of the three phases I will have a different role . 
In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , 
and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , 
and I'll be doing research to figure this out . 
In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching 
and I'll be doing marketing research on the web . 
And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation 
and so I will be collecting the requirements 
and ranking all the requirements to see how we did . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Huh . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Ours too . <laugh> 
Mm . 
Ch 
Like a tracking device ? <laugh> 
Mm . 
Be good . 
Lot more modern . 
Maybe like user-friendly , 
like a little 
you know , 
where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association , 
maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal . 
That's more on the research end , but  the marketing . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , 
'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting . 
<laugh> 
Futuristic . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . <cough> 
'Kay , 
I'll draw something . <laugh> 
What ? <laugh> 
My idea was just to have it be kind of like a 
keyboard type shape , you know , like video games 
l so . 
But maybe  
I mean that would be kinda big and bulky . 
We could also try to do the hinge thing , 
so it could like flip out that way . 
I don't know . 
<laugh> That's my idea . 
Yeah . 
Mm . Yeah . 
<laugh> True . 
Mm . 
<laugh> That's fine . 
You're the boss , 
you're <laugh> allowed to . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Looks cool though . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Right . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Sorry to interrupt , 
but we have a warning to finish . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Great . 
<laugh>
