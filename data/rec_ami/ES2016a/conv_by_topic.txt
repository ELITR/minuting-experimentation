A:  Okay . Oh , that's not gonna work . <other> Oh , alright . <other> Okay . Okay . Um alright . 
D:  Uh , uh , um . 
A:  I'll just put that there . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . Uh I'm Nick Debusk , I'm the Project Manager . Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um . Go ahead . 
topic_description:	opening_None


D:  Okay . <other> I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role . In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and I'll be doing research to figure this out . In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web . And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did . 
A:  'Kay . 
C:  Hiya , I'm Ryan . Um I'm the User Interface Designer . Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design . Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . Um in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . And the detailed design um <other> sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , uh things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special . That's about it . 
B:  <other> Right . <cough> I'm Manuel and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um . In the functional design phase I'm  I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . Um I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one . Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product . And uh the detailed design  in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . Okay . <other> 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	project specs and roles of participants_None


A:  Um so we've got our opening , our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . Uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing . Uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  Um so we are putting together a new remote control . Um we want it to be something original . Um of course we're a  not only a electronics company but a fashion um conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use . <other> Um we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um . And w uh <laugh> well um functional design um . 
topic_description:	project specs and roles of participants_None


A:  Um do we have  um any ideas of of  <other> maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it . 
A:  Um this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control , so  <laugh> I think we're all in the same boat here . 
C:  Ye yeah . 
D:  Huh . <laugh> <laugh> Ours too . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> Um  
A:  Um  <other> 
topic_description:	discussion_None


C:  Yeah . Well uh s function of remote control is just just  you know , change channels is its main function . 
A:  So we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or  I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ? 
C:  Oh right . I suppose you c try make it a universal remote for  could work on all sort of electrical 
A:  'Kay . 
C:  products in in one person's house . But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming . 
D:  Mm . 
B:  <cough> 
A:  Mm-hmm . 'Kay . 
C:  I think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like  I don't actually know .  But is it just infra-red ? Is that standard ? 
B:  Mm . 
A:  I I think  yeah , yeah , r universal remote . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


C:  Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature . 
D:  Ch 
A:  So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh 
D:  Like a tracking device ? <laugh> 
A:  like a tracking device or or like a a  
C:  Oh you can get those key  well you could whistle or make a noise and it'd beep . 
A:  It makes a noise , there's a button on the T_V_ that you press and  
B:  Mm , mm . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
A:  'Kay . 
D:  Be good . 
B:  So  
topic_description:	how to find when misplaced_None


C:  Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . 
A:  Yeah . Do we want  so they're kinda like long and rectangular . Do we want something crazy ? You know , we want something new that's gonna stand out . A m a modern  so our remote should be  
C:  Just long . <other> Yeah . Black usually . Yeah . 
D:  Lot more modern . 
C:  I think so . Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball . 
B:  <cough> 
D:  Maybe like user-friendly , like a little 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing . 
C:  People  I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another  if it was in a ball , and maybe the actual controls are inside or something . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  'Kay . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  Um . 
B:  Well there are of course certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , so there are always the  some restrictions we have to apply here . Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much um . What are we gonna build that thing out of ? How sturdy is it gonna be ? Do we want it to last longer or rather have people 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm . 
B:  whatever , have to buy one every half a year ? 
A:  <other> Okay so  yeah , so we want it to be sturdy , we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe , then it  
C:  Yeah . Yeah . It could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside . 
A:  'Kay . Um so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , um  So our form and our function . Um we want it to be um easy to find . <laugh> Um  <other> What else  it  what else do we want it to to do ? So we want it to be universal . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros um and you know , goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so . 
D:  Mm . 
topic_description:	project budget_None


D:  Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association , maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal . 
A:  'Kay . 
D:  That's more on the research end , but  the marketing . 
A:  So marketing , you know , how  maybe uh marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing <laugh> remote control out there . 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  <cough> 
D:  And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , 'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting . 
A:  'Kay . 
C:  Ye Small . 
B:  Right . 
topic_description:	other_marketing strategy


A:  Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . Some ideas ? We want it to be a b a ball , you know , we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located . 
C:   I'd  I could draw sorta the ball idea . My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , where maybe you  this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle  Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . If that  if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , and then you'd have 
B:  <cough> 
C:  just sorta you you you know , your buttons . Thing is inside I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , um as few buttons inside as possible . Um , I dunno , what's the idea for . Just something  maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . It's looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though , to be fair . <laugh> But yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Futuristic . <other> 
C:  That was that was a sorta simple idea I had and then you know you could  about  
B:  <cough> 
A:  Uh-huh . 
C:  Right , it would almost be like a ball . So that was just just an idea I had . I don't know whether anybody else has other ideas ? 
B:  Right . One problem you'd get with this design is um  the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really , but of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , take away that part . That's one of the big issues . Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's um a problem . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . Maybe f yeah . Yeah , that's g that's a good idea . Yeah . The idea  it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge , that was just one idea though . 
B:  <other> That's that's <other> interesting of course , but that's of course a weak point , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  How would we go about um making you know  getting rid of our weak points ? What  I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? <laugh> Not to put you on the spot , but  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> E No no , uh uh <cough> . 
A:  What did you say your title was again ? 
B:  N n 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh , I'm your Industrial Designer , so i b well , the point is 
A:  You're the the Industrial Designer . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  that <other> well maybe  I dunno . The shape is perhaps not the most ideal . As as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  Well I I suppose that things become  design . But I mean i 
D:  Mm-hmm . <cough> 
C:  I was trying to think of like the design of others . I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah . 
A:  <other> Yeah . It's not new , it's not innovative , it's  you know , everybody does long remote because it's easy , it's it's stable um . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  'Kay , I'll draw something . <laugh> What ? <laugh> My idea was just to have it be kind of like a 
A:  So if  <laugh> no , go ahead . 
D:  keyboard type shape , you know , like video games l so . But maybe  I mean that would be kinda big and bulky . We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . I don't know . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> That's my idea . 
C:  I think definitely doing something different 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  is a good idea . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like <other> uh I suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . 
A:  Something with a grip . 
D:  Mm . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , with a grip . 
A:  <other> Yeah . Because even  I suppose even with the ball 
C:  It still might be hard to  it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . 
A:  it's  it might not be the easiest to hold onto um . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  So perhaps the the joystick  the the keyboard idea might work better . But then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so maybe maybe we  
C:  Like  yeah . 
D:  <laugh> True . 
C:  Yeah . It's d yeah . I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  I feel like I'm just shooting everything down here . Uh <laugh> um  
D:  <laugh> That's fine . You're the boss , you're <laugh> allowed to . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Well with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . So if the remote is too small it  if it's small it probably looks better , but 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  may not be th as functional . So for that there's  
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  Okay , so unfortunately we've got about five minutes here <laugh> to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . Um we've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we've got a couple ideas um . 
B:  So  
A:  Let's see here . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  What if we had what if we had not only um  say we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to . So you know um s so it's easier to hold onto that way . Course that'll then remove some of our our ball . Unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  So the grip is  No , that wouldn't work either um . But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess , um and then <laugh> flat uh  And then we have the problem with the hinge . So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want . 
B:  The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? 
A:  Mm , that's true . 
B:  <other> It's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so I don't know if a lid is a good idea . From stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , uh the more we sell . So it's  don't make it too stable <other> uh . 
A:  So we don't have it flip open . We just have a ball  
C:  But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then . 
B:  To the other design . 
A:  Okay , so then we forget the ball . <laugh> It looks cool , but it's really not  it's not functional um . So we've got our sort of keyboard kind . What if we flipped it around here , so that it were um  
B:  <laugh> It looks cool . <other> 
D:  <laugh> Looks cool though . Yeah . 
B:  Uh <other> functional . 
A:  Sorry , that doesn't look anything like what you <laugh> had there . Um so it's up and down , you hold it this way . Course then it's it's like the rectangular <laugh> again , only with a couple of jutting out points . <laugh> But it's one-handed um . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Right . Right . Question is what makes those game pads functional ? W I think that's pretty much the form for full hand . So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , right , makes it nice , so that's the essential part . Except for that I think we'll not  probably not get a get away from some longer design . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . <other> 
D:  Right . 
A:  Um  
B:  I mean of course it'll be evident after a while or  if you look at it , it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and the <other> the buttons and stuff , but um it's rather about an instinctual thing , like you just grab it , you don't have to s look at it , you know , which way around to point it . Otherwise the design of  or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work . 
A:  True . 
C:  Put it  Even if you designed it  in some  in a way that you know , isn't a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . So if that's your thing and you got something like that instead , and there's your s you kn you know which way you're gonna pointing it . 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  'Kay . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


B:  'Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing . 
A:  Yeah , because it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks do . 
B:  You know , all that dif batteries  right , and  Batteries go weak as well , so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wanna control with it , right ? So , have to m show which is the front , which is the back . 
A:  Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? So that either way you're pointing it it would work . 
B:  I suppose you could do that . O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so . 
A:  More expensive and  yeah . 
B:  Course you can do that . 
A:  <other> 'Kay .
