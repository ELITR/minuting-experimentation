Hiya 
, I'm Ryan . 
Um I'm the User Interface Designer . 
Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design . 
Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . 
Um in the concept design , the user interface , 
how the user reacts with the the product . 
And the detailed design um <other> sort of like the user interface design , 
what they might be looking for , uh things like fashions , 
what makes wha 
how we're gonna make it special . 
That's about it . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . Well uh 
s 
function of remote control is just just  
you know , 
change channels is its main function . 
Oh right . 
I suppose you c try make it a universal remote 
for  
could work on all sort of electrical 
products in in one person's house . 
But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming . 
I think they all work on the same prin principle as well 
sorta like  
I don't actually know . 
 But is it just infra-red ? 
Is that standard ? 
Ye yeah . 
<laugh> 
Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em . 
So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature . 
Oh you can get those key  
well 
you could whistle 
or make a noise 
and it'd beep . 
Yeah . 
Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . 
Just long . 
<other> Yeah . 
Black usually . 
Yeah . 
I think so . 
Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball . 
Yeah . 
People  
I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another  
if it was in a ball , 
and maybe the actual controls are inside or something . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
It could be cased on the outside 
and t everything could be inside . 
Ye 
Small . 
 I'd  
I could draw sorta the ball idea . 
My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , 
where maybe you  
this is where it's connected together , 
and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , 
and then when you fold it out the middle  
Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . 
If that  if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , 
and then you'd have 
just sorta you you you know , your buttons . 
Thing is inside 
I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , 
so maybe as simple as possible , 
um as few buttons inside as possible . 
Um , I dunno , what's the idea for . 
Just something  maybe if you ha 
if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . 
It's looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though , to be fair . 
<laugh> But yeah . 
That was that was a sorta simple idea I had 
and then you know you could  about  
Right , 
it would almost be like a ball . 
So that was just just an idea I had . 
I don't know whether anybody else has other ideas ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Maybe f yeah . 
Yeah , that's g that's a good idea . 
Yeah . 
The idea  
it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge , 
that was just one idea though . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Well 
I I suppose that things become  design . 
But I mean i 
I was trying to think of like the design of others . 
I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , 
maybe small , sort of fatter ones , 
but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I think definitely doing something different 
is a good idea . 
I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like <other> 
suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , 
but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . 
Yeah , with a grip . 
It still might be hard to  
it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . 
Like  
yeah . 
Yeah . 
It's d 
yeah . 
I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then . 
Yeah . 
Put it  
Even if you designed it  in some  in a way that you know , isn't a rectangle , 
but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . 
So if that's your thing 
and you got something like that instead , 
and there's your s you kn 
you know which way you're gonna pointing it . 
Um  
Does it say  what does it say for n 
it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think .
