<other> Right . 
<cough> I'm Manuel 
and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um . 
In the functional design phase I'm  I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , 
um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . 
Um I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one . 
Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product . 
And uh the detailed design  in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , 
um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . Okay . <other> 
<cough> 
Mm . 
Mm , mm . 
Right . 
So  
<cough> 
Mm . 
Well 
there are of course certain restrictions , 
you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , 
so there are always the  some restrictions 
we have to apply here . 
Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , 
that refers to the material , pretty much um . 
What are we gonna build that thing out of ? 
How sturdy is it gonna be ? 
Do we want it to last longer 
or rather have people 
whatever , have to buy one every half a year ? 
<cough> 
Right . 
<cough> 
<cough> 
Right . 
One problem you'd get with this design is 
um  the ball is a nice idea 
because of it's stability really , 
but of course , since it's a ball , 
it'll roll , 
so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , 
take away that part . 
That's one of the big issues . 
Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's um a problem . 
<other> That's that's <other> interesting of course , 
but that's of course a weak point , yeah . 
<other> E 
No no , 
uh uh <cough> . 
N n 
Uh , I'm your Industrial Designer , 
so i b well , 
the point is 
that <other> 
well 
maybe  I dunno . 
The shape is perhaps not the most ideal . 
As as stable as it is , 
there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Well 
with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size 
w 
'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . 
So if the remote is too small it  
if it's small it probably looks better , 
but 
may not be th as functional . 
So for that there's  
So  
The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? 
<other> It's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , 
so I don't know if a lid is a good idea . 
From stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is , 
but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , uh the more we sell . 
So 
it's  
don't make it too stable <other> uh . 
To the other design . 
<laugh> It looks cool . <other> 
Uh <other> functional . 
Right . Right . 
Question is what makes those game pads functional ? 
W 
I think that's pretty much the form for full hand . 
So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , 
right , 
makes it nice , 
so that's the essential part . 
Except for that I think we'll not  probably not get a get away from some longer design . 
'Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing . 
You know , all 
that dif batteries  
right , 
and  Batteries go weak as well , 
so um 
after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wanna control with it , 
right ? 
So , have to m show which is the front , which is the back . 
I suppose you could do that . 
O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so . 
Course you can do that . 
I mean of course it'll be evident after a while or  
if you look at it , it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it , 
since you have the the numbers and the and the <other> the buttons and stuff , 
but um it's rather about an instinctual thing , 
like you just grab it , 
you don't have to s look at it , 
you know , 
which way around to point it . 
Otherwise the design of  or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work . 
Mm . 
Let's . 
Obviously  
Alright .
