<cough> 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
<cough> <laugh> 
Yes . 
Well . 
Oh my god , it's better than what I'm gonna be able to do . 
Take my contraptions with me . 
Alright , 
I'm Jessy . 
I'm from around D_C_ ish sort of in the U_S_ . 
And we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on ,  animal . 
Don't really know how to draw this . 
Just where can I  
Mm . 
Mm . 
Maybe if I do the water , 
but how ? 
Sort of give an idea . 
<laugh> I have no idea how one would explain this . 
Mm maybe with some whiskers . 
Briefly , it's supposed to be a seal . 
You can imagine it in the water . 
I like them , 
because they are like playful and silly sort of 
have a good time . 
Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that . <laugh> 
It's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it . 
<other> That's impressive . 
Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ 
like you have to do one for the power of the T_V_ 
and then like another one to get the actual screen on 
and something else to get it all going , I don't know . 
Now they keep combining all different remotes together , 
and I don't know if I necessarily like that 
'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload . 
I just wanna watch the T_V_ <laugh> um . 
<other> 
Always gets lost . 
Some sort of like device to help you find it . 
Yeah . 
What about like batteries and things like that , 
like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries 
or do all remotes require batteries ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
And maybe that spatially divides it , 
so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here , 
then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here , 
all the  whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , 
'cause then you like , I don't even know what I'm turning on . 
<cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm hmm . 
I think it's just T_V_ , 
I mean , if it  if we're taking it just  new product a new television remote control that's not like <other> doesn't say . 
You know , things might be more advanced than that . <laugh> 
It's an idea with the buttons being really  . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
I'm four .
