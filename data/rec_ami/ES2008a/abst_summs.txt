A:  Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , 
A:  it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . 
A:  Um so we're gonna divide us up into three <other> compa three parts . 
A:  First the functional design 
A:  which will be uh first we'll do individual work , 
A:  come into a meeting , 
A:  the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , 
A:  and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting .

A:  Um we're gonna do a little tool training , 
A:  so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you . 
A:  Um introduce yourself , 
A:  and then draw your favourite animal 
B:  My name is Alima Bucciantini . 
B:  and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project . 
B:  I will draw a little turtle for you all .

A:  We're gonna talk about project finances . 
A:  we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales 
A:  and because this is such  this is for television it's a  we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range , 
A:  Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro .

abst_sum - abstract: The project manager then talked about the project finances and discussed selling prices, profit aim, market range, and production costs.

A:  just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , I could  I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , 
A:  what would be the best um like you  what are the features that you really like 
D:  Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ 
D:  'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload . 
C:  especially , like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of  in front of me , you know , one for the T_V_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . Um . 
C:  And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , 
C:  uh too too sort of too sort of complicated 
C:  they've got too many buttons on them 
B:  and that there's not too many buttons , 
B:  they are not too small , 
D:  like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries 
A:  but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery 
A:  it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . 
B:  I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for .

abst_sum - abstract: The project manager then led the team in a discussion on their experiences with remotes and what features they would like to include in the remote they are producing.

A:  it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . 
B:  doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder 
B:  but that just has your major buttons for  that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off , 
D:  so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here , 
D:  then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here , 
D:  all the  whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , 
B:  and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day . 
C:  would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ? 
C:  are we designing a remote control for a television only 
C:  Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ? 
A:  <other> I'll look into that . 
B:  If it's just a television then that  it's a bit simpler , 
B:  If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it . 
A:  so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things .

A:  <other> I'll look into that .

A:  Um the industrial design , Alima will be doing um the working design .
