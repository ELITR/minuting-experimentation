<laugh> 
Uh Okay . 
Well , 
my name is Iain uh 
and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project . Um . 
And I'll try and draw my favourite animal . 
I'll  
I should leave that one on there 
shouldn't I <laugh> 
before I callously rub it off . 
<laugh> 
Um I'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um . 
<other> Is that at least identifiable ? 
It's a whale <laugh> , yes . 
<laugh> Thanks . 
<laugh> Um and , yeah , 
the reason I like whales is 'cause uh they're  well , first of all they're quite intelligent 
um and also they're they're kind of mysterious , 
like we don't really know much about them 
or or understand how they work , 
how they form groups . 
And I just find them interesting animals . 
Cool . <laugh> 
<other> 
I've used , I've used remote controls , for things like T_V_ and the C_D_ player and video recorder 
and I I guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh . 
You don't have to get up 
and walk across the room to change a channel . 
So especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice . Um . 
I find them  
they can be a bit annoying , 
especially , like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of  in front of me , you know , one for the T_V_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . Um . 
And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , 
they've got too many buttons on them 
uh too too sort of too sort of complicated 
when all I really wanna do is switch on and off , 
change the channel , 
change the volume . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Can I ask , 
are we designing a remote control for a television only 
um , and if if this device is just to be used for the television 
would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ? 
Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> So we should  maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control . 
Well , 
I mean I suppose it would be nice to have <other> playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well 
I I don't know if that works technologically or not . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
'Kay . 
<laugh> 
What we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting ? 
Do we know that ? 
Right . 
Yep . 
Yep . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Can you e-mail your slides as well ? 
Is that possible ? 
Cool
