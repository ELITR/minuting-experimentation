Alima . 
<laugh> <laugh> 
Okay . 
Um I don't know which one of these I have to bring with me . 
<laugh> Right , so , 
I'm supposed to draw my favourite animal . 
I have no drawing skills whatsoever . 
But uh let's see , introduce myself . 
My name is Alima Bucciantini . 
Um I'm from the state of Maine in the US . 
I'm doing nationalism studies , 
blah , blah , blah , 
and I have no artistic talents . 
A_ L_ I_ M_ A_ . 
Oh , 
and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project . 
So 
let's see if I can get 
um here . 
I will draw a little turtle for you all . 
Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , 
but just that I think they're drawable . 
And you have the pretty little shell going on . 
Some little eyes . Happy . 
There you go . 
That's a turtle . 
Um . I I like the whole having a shell thing . 
It's quite cool carry your home around where you go , 
um quite decorative little animals , 
they can swim , 
they can , 
they're very adaptable , 
they carry everything they need with them , 
um and they're easy to draw . 
<other> No , 
you can erase the turtle , 
it's alright . 
<other> 
Snake . 
Well , 
snake ? 
<laugh> It's w <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Oh , 
a cat . 
Yeah . 
Right . 
That's  
That's pretty impressive . 
<laugh> 
Yeah um . 
I agree with having too many remotes around . 
My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , 
and I don't know how to work half of them um . 
What's important for me , I guess , is that it's easy to use 
and that there's not too many buttons , 
they are not too small , 
you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing . 
And one thing I particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red . 
Um , I think there is a way around that , 
but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , 
so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the T_V_ itself , 
and I think that's  if we're gonna make a remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing . 
So  
I know . 
Yeah , 
something that doesn't  
Mm . 
<other> Yeah . 
Could we get something that 
just has  
No 
doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder 
or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about , 
but that just has your major buttons for  that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off , 
channel changing . 
Yeah . 
N that way  
Yeah . 
<other> Yeah , 
and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day . 
Um . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Right . 
Mm . 
Mm yeah . 
<other> 
Yes . 
I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for . 
If it's just a television then that  it's a bit simpler , 
'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it . 
Large . 
If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it . 
<other> 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
'Kay . 
I'm sure we'll be busy . 
I'm two . 
Alright . 
'Kay .
