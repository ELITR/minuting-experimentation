A:  Okay . Good morning everybody . Um I'm glad you could all come . I'm really excited to start this team . Um I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . My name is Rose Lindgren . I I'll be the Project Manager . Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise . And then we'll move into the project plan , do a little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . 


A:  First of all our project aim . Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . Um so we're gonna divide us up into three <other> compa three parts . First the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work , come into a meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting . So that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and um collaborating . 


A:  Okay , we're gonna get to know each other a little bit . So um , what we're gonna do is start off with um let's start off with Amina . Um Alima , sorry , Alima . Um we're gonna do a little tool training , so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you . Um introduce yourself , um say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it . 
B:  Alima . <laugh> <laugh> Okay . Um I don't know which one of these I have to bring with me . 
A:  Probably both . 
B:  <laugh> Right , so , I'm supposed to draw my favourite animal . I have no drawing skills whatsoever . But uh let's see , introduce myself . My name is Alima Bucciantini . Um I'm from the state of Maine in the US . I'm doing nationalism studies , blah , blah , blah , and I have no artistic talents . 
A:  How do you spell your name ? 
B:  A_ L_ I_ M_ A_ . 
A:  Thanks . 
B:  Oh , and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project . So let's see if I can get um here . I will draw a little turtle for you all . Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , but just that I think they're drawable . 
D:  <cough> <laugh> 
B:  And you have the pretty little shell going on . Some little eyes . Happy . There you go . That's a turtle . 
D:  Yes . 
A:  So what are your favourite characteristics ? 
B:  Um . I I like the whole having a shell thing . It's quite cool carry your home around where you go , um quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , um and they're easy to draw . 
A:  Mm . <laugh> Excellent . <other> Shall we just go around the table ? 
C:  <laugh> Uh Okay . Well , my name is Iain uh 
A:  Mm .

A:  Might be nice to have them all up there at same time . 
C:  <laugh> Um I'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um . 
B:  <other>

B:  Snake . Well , snake ? <laugh> It's w <laugh> 
D:  Well . 
C:  It's a whale <laugh> , yes . <laugh> Thanks . <laugh> Um and , yeah , the reason I like whales is 'cause uh they're  well , first of all they're quite intelligent um and also they're they're kind of mysterious , like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they work , how they form groups . And I just find them interesting animals . 
A:  Em 
D:  Oh my god , it's better than what I'm gonna be able to do . Take my contraptions with me . Alright , I'm Jessy . I'm from around D_C_ ish sort of in the U_S_ . And we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on ,  animal . Don't really know how to draw this . Just where can I  Mm . Mm . Maybe if I do the water , but how ? 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Sort of give an idea . <laugh> I have no idea how one would explain this . Mm maybe with some whiskers . Briefly , it's supposed to be a seal . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  You can imagine it in the water . I like them , because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time . Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that . <laugh> 
A:  Mm 'kay . Mm 'kay ? I'm Rose and I'm Project Manager , <other> from California . Um . Hmm . <other> S <other> 
B:  <laugh> Oh , a cat . 
D:  It's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Um it's actually a coyote . Let's see . Let's see , let's give it a little bit of a snout , I don't know , some teeth . 
B:  Right .

B:  <laugh> 


A:  <other> Okay um , moving on to slightly more serious stuff . We're gonna talk about project finances . Um we have a couple <other> we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales and because this is such  this is for television it's a  we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range , we don't have to worry about specifics . Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro . So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for . 


A:  Okay um , just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , I could  I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , what would be the best um like you  what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , so  


A:  Okay . 'Kay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas . Mind if we move on ? Ps mm okay . Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes . I believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty , so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um , 
B:  <other> 
C:  'Kay . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 


A:  but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually . Um the industrial design , Alima will be doing um the working design . Um the User Interface Designer , that's for  . Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons . Um user requirements um , so you'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need , um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having , we'll get from the actual consum s consumers . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Mm 'kay um . And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach . I realised in this past one we we didn't have much , we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done . 


A:  Um so very exited to see all your animals and how  what wonderful um artists we all are <laugh> um . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Any questions ? 
B:  <other> 
C:  What we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting ? Do we know that ? 
A:  I haven't gotten an agenda yet , um I'll put that together . I'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together . So I'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time
