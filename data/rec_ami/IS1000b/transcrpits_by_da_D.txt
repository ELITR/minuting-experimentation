Yep . 
<other> 
Perfect . 
So y you are the secretary also . 
Right ? 
Okay . 
Perfectly yeah yeah of course uh-huh . 
You mean the social target group who we wants to target ? 
Oh the customers , okay . 
<laugh> 
It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's  
Okay too much time to learn . Okay . 
Not enough  
Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the  
Ah 
it's <other> it 
okay 
it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file 
okay . 
O otherwise you yeah . You can connect this one . 
Yeah . 
So 
these are important numbers 
that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional um  
Yeah  
Yeah 
these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design . 
Because if there are many numbers 
and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important . 
Speech recognition in  
Ah okay . 
So that we don't  
Do we not need any button on the remote control <laugh> 
it would be all based on speech . 
Okay . 
Interesting idea . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , 
maybe you know ? 
But it's quite noisy if there is the T_V_ uh shouting . 
Okay . 
So 
you had to to to summarise maybe the  
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
 
I thi <other> You us 
yeah yeah . 
Okay perfect . .. . 
Mm 'kay . 
Yeah . 
Mm I okay 
I stay  
<other> I can move as far as <laugh> <other> 
Maybe I take your chair ? 
I 
okay <other> . 
So 
I think as everybody knows uh I'm the uh Industrial Designer . 
And uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um <other> is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control . 
Um I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , 
so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because I think in the product it is important . 
So basically um 
the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed . 
And so 
an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , 
that can compose messages , usually uh through a um infrared bit 
and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages , 
alright . 
So 
my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first <other> the 
the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . 
I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . 
So 
for that 
yeah 
as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna 
and um w to to 
we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control 
and I show you the the working design . 
So um basically uh 
here is a really large view of what we want <other> . 
Uh we want an on off button , 
it can be uh  
it's simple 
but it's it's important , and also uh  the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , 
right . 
So 
the components I quickly draw here , 
is that 
in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver 
so that's  
my method is um will be to 
well 
my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control 
right . 
So 
of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver . 
This is <laugh> very quick uh design , 
uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you don't agree on it on that . 
And um so 
what I have found and <laugh> after a lot of work actually I <laugh> I draw this I draw for you this uh schema 
that can be maybe too technical for you 
but is very important for me 
you know . 
<laugh> <cough> <laugh> And uh that's it so I won't go into details about that 
but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components . 
So . So 
found 
and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive , 
but uh this one was not 
this one also really uh reliable 
um so yeah 
that's it for the working design , 
uh I hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components 
but maybe 
yeah  
No no no no 
we we will uh  
This is a preference 
but we can always change uh  
Yeah . 
Of course yeah . 
Yeah . 
We will use uh <other> infrared protocol uh using <other> yeah infrared 
and uh 
and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists 
and 
but we what we can do is uh uh adapting <other> the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles . 
Um . Okay .  
The frequencies ? 
Yeah yeah . Of course yeah 
in the chip you have it 
yeah . 
That can control o other things . 
Yeah . 
Of course yeah 
we should take that into account 
in the uh  
<laugh> 
Yes . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yep . 
These are kind of next generation <other> functionalities . 
Mm 'kay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed uh online uh yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Fourteen 
or for O 
okay . 
So  
 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Because they are already used to that , you know , product . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
.. . 
Yes . 
 
<other> <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yep . 
<cough> 
Yeah 
we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R_ s R_C_ 
and I think uh with this 
now you know that chips are very uh cheaps 
and uh we can include it in our control some new new features . 
Yeah . And um  But yeah 
that's  
Ye 
I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary  well , th for long term . 
Yeah . 
<other> Universal . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<other> Yeah 
because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million 
so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip is <other> uh price of a chip is very cheap . 
<laugh> So 
I'm okay for designing um a ne uh less <other> yeah a a kind of universal uh R_C_ yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah that's needed , yeah . <other> 
And if we want to get the market , we really need that . 
Yes . Exactly . <other> 
Is that okay for you ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yes . 
Oh 
that's that's fine then . 
Yeah . 
<other> Okay <other> perfect .
