Mm-hmm . 
What's the agenda for this meeting ? 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
That's the big question 
yeah . 
No , I don't . 
I wasn't . No . 
I c I can talk about it 
but I have no slides or anything . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well 
I've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group 
so , 
a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . Um . 
It's  
probably can't email this to you , 
I've just got a web page with some data on it . 
Um basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls . 
Um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Um . 
Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . 
Um . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . 
Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , 
so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . 
Uh . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , 
so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality 
but really most of the time they only use a small part of that . 
Um . 
I have an a web page yes . 
Yep . Yep , sure . Mm-hmm . 
So basically um 
there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control . 
Um , power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour . 
Um , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um <other> 
and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . 
Um . Teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour , 
so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . Um . 
An interesting thing that this report has brought up 
is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , 
so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . Um . 
Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , 
they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps . 
Um . 
Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . Yep . 
Um . And thirty  twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . 
I don't know how we'd go about combating that . 
For R_S_I_ ? 
Respet Repetitive strain injury . 
So . But  
Mm . 
Yeah . That's what the report says yeah . 
Um and then it's got a demographic breakdown 
on  
Uh I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now . 
Oh no , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Um , s hang on . 
Well . 
Oh 
I need to muck around with this . 
It's probably easier if you put it on yours 
and then I'll just email it to you . 
It's just a web link . 
One thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , 
is the  
hang on a minute . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yep . 
Um , one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control . 
And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . 
Yes , 
I'll just get this up . 
Well 
potentially yeah , um  
I think even for interesti 
yeah 
I think that would not work so well . 
You wanna have both options . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Um  
Well  
This is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , um . 
Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , 
it goes down from there , 
seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , 
thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , 
um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five 
and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . 
Yeah . 
But we sh 
Yeah , 
it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , um , 
which we'll be talking about later I think . 
Did you get the email ? 
Yep , 
that one . 
Just follow that link . 
It'll be in a different window , yep . 
That's  
left  
that one . 
Yep . 
Mm . So 
that's the figure that I was just talking about there , with the different demographics . 
Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen 
but there's no figures apparently on that . 
Sorry ? 
Oh . 
Mm . <cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> Well . 
<laugh> 
You drew it a long time ago ? 
Ninety one . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Ah . 
<laugh> 
That's handy . 
So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off . 
Yeah . 
I like that idea . 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yep . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
How would that work ? 
So 
you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate , 
so you  
on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote 
which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ 
and doesn't do anything on the T_V_ , 
so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ? 
or does it know which one you want to use ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
That's fair enough . 
Mm . 
But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here . 
That's , 
yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . Because y 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yep . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
So 
D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s ? 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . <cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market , 
that's the the the mm the new and the funky things , 
that's , 
yeah , 
there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , 
not too many pretty remote controls . 
That's  
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ? 
'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all 
and it's a very important issue . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Which I think is quite tricky . 
Um , basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control <other>  
wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? 
But it's not going to have more functionality , 
'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , 
we can't beat modern functionality , 
we might  we'll be able to <other> beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it 
but that's not a big seller , 
if 
they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , 
they have to actually need it as well . 
So I'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
But why are they buying one in the first place ? 
Mm . But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote . 
I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , 
otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . 
In that case they wouldn't buy our product , 
because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality . 
Well , 
we can't , with the price range . 
We We're not building a universal remote , 
we're not building a high end product . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
But  
yeah . 
If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that 
which would drive the cost up a lot . 
For universal remotes  
If you  mm . 
And quite complicated to use , 
yes . 
Mm-hmm . 
Not as flexible maybe , 
yeah , 
but s 
yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on . 
Okay . 
So 
they're  
yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . Yep . 
I don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is . 
Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , 
or are we kind of middle to bottom ? 
I don't know . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So 
I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ . 
And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm yep . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm .
