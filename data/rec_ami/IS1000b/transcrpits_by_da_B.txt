And we can start meeting . 
The  
I will uh present here agenda with with with with slides to you . 
Um as you can see here . 
So 
first uh just to mention I will take notes uh of this meeting 
and uh I will try to work them out 
and give them to you . 
I've also made notes of the previous meeting 
and um I was about to send them you 
but <other> then uh I had to go to this uh meeting 
so you will get them too uh 
Um . 
Yes . Indeed . 
Then I hope you all have uh worked out <other> some some uh <laugh> some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting . 
Um . W We will uh in a minute we will uh <other> start with them . 
Um , we will see in which order we will handle them of . 
Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements 
I I got uh from the uh account manager , 
I try to work them out , 
they were quite abstract , 
and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . Uh Um about the functions 
and  
Well 
in this meeting we should really <other> try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the  
Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this , 
the customers , indeed yes . 
Think that's that's important matter . 
Uh . <cough> So <other> 
And then uh we will close this meeting uh 
and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch . 
Good . 
Um . Maybe um 
why 
uh Anna can you c do you have a presentations ? 
You don't have presentation ? 
Uh you want a table to to uh 
Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it 
or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Do you Do you have this uh information on the web page you said ? 
Yes , 
mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh . Uh about this . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yes yes , 
I have <laugh> that too <laugh> . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
They think that or do their doctor the doctor says ? 
<laugh> But it's it's the opinion of the uh of the users huh ? 
So mm . 
<other> You can maybe just just  
 
<other> 
 
Hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
D do you have numbers o o on that ? 
<laugh> 
Well 
it would it would be a solution for uh when your remote control is lost , 
I mean when it has speech recognition then uh i then it doesn't matter where it is , my  well it's  we should be in range , 
or maybe it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is . 
But the these are all quite fancy features 
I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for <laugh> for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents <laugh> . 
Mm . 
Yes , 
that that that that's mm . 
Do you have some more important facts 
or can we go to the next presentation ? 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . Decline with age , mm . 
Mm . <other> 
Yes . We will talk about it later . <other> 
Okay . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Mm . Okay . <other> um 
Uh maybe uh Mael c c can you give uh uh your presentation uh ? 
Oh , 
this is  
Mm-hmm , y y you can move , uh . 
Yes . You can you can sa take my chair . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Uh-huh . 
Is huh 
overwhelming <laugh> . 
No . 
<other> And and why do you want these kind of component ? 
I mean , are they cheap , 
or are they uh reliable ? 
What were your  
Mm . 
Yes . It it it's more clear now I think . 
So <other>  
Mm-hmm . 
What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver , 
I mean 
can you can you get back to it ? 
<other> Yeah uh , 
the receiver is of course already in the television 
and we are not uh able to change it . 
So we we must adapt to the to the receiver . 
I I suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm . 
Yes . Okay . 
Thank you . 
Mm . 
Yeah yes 
I I I  
I I feel I I 
I think M Mael will will consider this uh th these things . 
Maybe Maybe we can go to to your presentation uh Matthew . 
I I I assume you were finished here . 
Uh okay . 
Oh . I  
Uh , sorry ? 
I know where it is . 
It's uh  
Yes . 
It's uh  
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm mm mm mm mm . 
Mm yes , 
but I think it's i i it's already there , 
I mean the hard disk uh recorders uh I I've seen them in the shop . 
W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this . 
Mean , you can go <other> pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects 
yes . 
But it's good to keep in mind . 
Mm . Very well . 
Good . 
<other> 
Um , so u um 
I have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager 
and uh I would like to share them with you . Um 
first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions 
but it's it's getting used less and less . 
That's that's especially because of the internet of course . 
So we should think about it um . 
Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself . 
Uh as uh a in any case it's it's not used , well very much , 
but it's it is still used . Um 
further yes we must think , uh do we stay uh to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back 
uh huh , 
or do we uh uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices ? 
Uh indeed indeed . 
And and and the hard disk recorders . 
Um , furthermore , uh , w we need really need to interest uh <other> y younger customers 
and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty , 
and our our current customers are mainly forty plus 
uh which 
well 
 Forty . 
So 
that's to that's 
I mean there's a market 
but uh they will grow older  older 
and you'll al <laugh> always need to have the the future with younger people . 
Um therefore , 
<other> younger people like trendy  trendy designs , 
so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible 
but it should also be uh have a reliable image , 
so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all . 
Hmm . 
Ma Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh  
Hmm . 
Yes yes 
mo 
Yes 
it's recognisable  
Mm mm . 
And and they are skilled uh by using it . 
Mael can you hand me over this uh ? 
Uh thank you . 
Mm well 
I think fi five min 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
'Kay 
I I think now that the idea's clear . 
Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group . 
Of course they have already one . 
So our our our remote control has to be better . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . I  well 
I think <other> many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh uh the appearance of the uh R_C_ is is important when they are buying one 
but  
Indeed . 
So 
that will be about functionality  
Mm . Mm-hmm . Mm . 
So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance  
What do  What do you think about  
What componen 
I don't know . I don't know whether that's necessary . 
Is the L_C_D_ screen  
I think thi this could be this could be a market 
because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive . 
S so we can try to go in between , 
and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated 
but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh R_C_ 
because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal . 
<other> 
Mm yes 
but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group . 
People  yes . Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control . 
Uh well 
<other> I think 
uh when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money . 
So 
d Do you agree ? 
Mm-hmm . 
You think it's possible for the twelve Euro fifty ? 
Okay . Um so 
then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control . 
Mm . Mm . Okay . 
Yes . 
Mm mm mm mm . 
So 
given we are going for this uh uh universal type 
uh m <other> maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need 
and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content 
and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market . 
So 
anyone uh has a point to bring in 
or shall we  
no . 
Okay . 
W 
yes , 
we uh we can have lunch now . 
So um 
Then th th the next meeting will uh 
after lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work 
and then we have the next meeting . 
But you will be informed via the computer . 
Okay .
