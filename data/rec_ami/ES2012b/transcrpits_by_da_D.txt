Uh I don't mind .  
Uh can I steal the cable ? 
Cheers . 
<other> I got a  
how do I start there ? 
That one . 
Cool . 
Well 
these are functionality requirements from the  our our guys down in the the research lab . 
Took hundred people 
and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . 
Um <other> everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are  how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . 
See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . 
So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly <laugh> . 
Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . 
Which is a a plus for us , 
if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . 
Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . 
I can empl 
I kinda take that to mean as um <other> they they don't uh  they , yeah , they only use  they only work for the television 
or 
yeah like 
as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . 
If it was 
uh  I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time 
and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . <laugh> 
Uh again , seventy five percent is  seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . 
I took to mean that they just  they use it a lot , 
they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume  . 
<other> And uh yeah , uh 
I think the big issue is 
fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 
'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like  
well 
we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , 
but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the  uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used 
and used very  
aren't considered relevant by the user . 
So I think maybe fewer buttons , 
which also make the design look sleeker , 
I dunno . 
Uh um yeah and uh 
frustrations of like people losing remote control . 
I dunno 
maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ 
or maybe that's b 
it would have to incorporate  , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . 
Maybe like it'll beep or something . 
And um , yep , 
the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is  
Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new  like first time users and stuff . 
And uh repetitive strain injury , 
I suppose we should make it more comfortable 
and make ma possibly even use  have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , 
like I was saying about the whole mice  the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . 
Maybe don't even have to hold it as such . 
<laugh> 
But uh yeah . 
It also asked um if we would  if people would pay more for speech recognition 
and younger people say they would . 
And uh there was another section on our  on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays , 
but the data wasn't there , 
so . I don't actually know what the results for that were , 
so . <laugh> 
May be incrementally emitting , 
but yeah . 
And uh <laugh> it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you  <laugh> 
Yeah , um  oh yeah , so 
possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . 
Oh , 
I've got some other things 
I couldn't fit onto this presentation . 
Um . You see this okay ? 
Almost  
no ? 
It's  
sorry 
it's a bit  . 
I'll read out to you . 
Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . 
So um 
like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , 
but it's not frequently used . 
You see what I mean ? 
Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance 
is used the most . 
So 
m we can maybe even start to cut down on  or 
I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . 
Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , 
which are low relevance 
and rarely used . 
And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily  
Oh yeah . 
Yeah , 
like the one that like slides back 
and the buttons are concealed underneath . 
Just remove them completely ? 
Uh yeah . 
<cough> 
Um no 
this is for  pay more for speech recognition . 
Yeah , that's true . 
Or even  I mean you could even just have it left on . 
You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ 
and never have to  
Yeah . 
<laugh> B_B_C_ one . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh yeah . 
Mm-mm . 
Relevance of two out of ten , 
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Stand out . 
Uh I just had a thought actually , 
sorry to interrupt . 
Uh you were saying about um it could  technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed  
we could maybe have like an activation 
word . 
'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , 
where you just  you address the remote , 
you address the computer , 
and then give it a command . 
Oh I see . Oh yeah , I see . 
<other> Mm-hmm , yeah . 
I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Oh 
no 
I I interrupted you , 
sorry <laugh> . 
Oh 
okay . 
Um well , 
I was just kinda wrapping up there . 
Yeah , 
I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . 
We could make things much more f I think the the 
eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , 
combined with uh decrease the  or 
take out the limited functio functions 
that we don't really use much . 
 alright take out teletext , 
but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . 
But , since  if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd  it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . 
<other> Oh , we could , yeah . 
We c 
yeah , 
we could even have it as like a  yeah the buttons control this 
and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , 
so . 
So uh yeah , 
if we could uh  power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really  
Yeah 
and probably it would look better as well . 
Yeah . yeah . 
Lined with numbered buttons and  
Uh yeah , yeah , that's everything . 
<other> 
Do you want the cable ? 
F_ eight . 
Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so . 
<cough> 
Yeah . 
<cough> <cough> 
Hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
It could have like uh  know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time . 
<other> I suppose , yeah . 
 
<laugh> Yeah . <cough> 
<laugh> 
Uh . That sounds pretty good , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
W 
like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used , channel selection a hundred and sixty eight 
times per hour . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
But then again , if you think it  of the amount of , you know amount of use it's like  
That's  it's less than a second , um . 
<cough> Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
like in the email of television only . In fact they're  in the constraints email that I got . 
Didn't you mention the teletext , just television only ? 
Oh okay . <laugh> Oh yeah .
