Sorry . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
It could be  
oh 
uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? 
Have you seen the new mo mobile phones 
that flip out 
and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , 
so 
you could have the most <other> used buttons on top 
and flip it out or something . 
Yeah . 
That might be the  
Maybe i 
Yeah , 
have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box 
and have it just go on the T_V_ 
and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , 
you won't lose it . 
No . 
<other> Oh . <laugh> 
Yeah , that's true . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay well , 
I can do mine . 
Yeah , 
let's see if I can make this work . Um . 
Oh . 
Is it doing  
Okay . 
Oh okay . 
<other> Okay , so 
this is just about the technical functions . 
So 
the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products 
and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas 
and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are  what you really wanna have a remote control do . 
Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . 
There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one 
which I will have pictures of 
and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . 
<other> So 
these are the two different ones . 
This one um  this is the user centred , 
it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons 
and then this is the engineering centred , 
which has a lot more buttons , 
and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons 
that you don't use . 
So basically , 
what a remote control is is you  it's to send messages to the television set , 
you know , 
turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . 
And so for this product it's gonna be television only , 
and then it has to have the uh logos 
for the company and the colours . 
And so , 
for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use 
and has quite a  you know , fewer buttons . 
Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television 
and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . 
It looks kind of narrow at the top , 
and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , 
then that would be easier . 
Um <other> and so 
we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . 
E 
the unique style , maybe have it light up 
so it's visible in the dark , 
um the changeable face-plates , 
and the lighting up and visible I was  
when we were talking about havi losing it , 
maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it  maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , 
so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . 
So 
that's my presentation . Yeah . 
F 
they probably clip to you . 
<laugh> 
Oh . 
Hmm I think it's all there . 
H 
Oh yeah . 
That's kind of strange . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
people are pro 
I would think that people might forget  
I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there , 
so . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
No . 
Um . 
Do they make batteries that last that long ? 
Yeah , they have that little solar  
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah , 
some people are  
Yeah . Yeah . 
<laugh> Per hour ? 
Wow . <laugh> That's a lot . <laugh> 
 
Yeah . 
Though I think with digital T_V_ , like I know on my cable box , you're not supposed to do that 
because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that , 
so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different 
channels that way instead of  
Uh-oh . 
Yeah . 
Um  <other> 
Oh 
I just have one question . 
So 
are we doing just the television 
or are we doing  
so not D_V_D_ players , 
we 
okay , okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Oh <other> okay . 
Okay . 
<laugh>
