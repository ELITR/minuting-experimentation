A:  <other> Okay . 


B:   Uh so the concept of the interface . Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . So let's start with this . 
B:  And uh what will people say ? 
A:  Mm-hmm . 'Kay .

D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:   
D:  Because uh I think there are two kinds of people . Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh I'm going to talk about this later but  and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature . My remote control is pink . Nobody else than me has a pink remote control . <laugh> And that makes me special . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Uh-huh .
