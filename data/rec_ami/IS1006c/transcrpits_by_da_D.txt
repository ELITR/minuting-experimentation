Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Thanks <laugh> 
Don't be sarcastic . <laugh> Mark . <laugh> 
Uh Rama . 
Ah . 
Mm-hmm . 
What is a double-curved shape ? 
Uh-huh . 
<cough> 
<cough> 
The cost . 
Mm like this ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Speech  
L_C_D_ . 
Seems not , 
it's either L_C_D_ or push-button . 
Ah . 
 The L_C_D_ would  
The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean . 
Just uh for output , 
yeah . 
Yeah . 
I guess no 
um . So 
the batteries uh are going to be very light . 
Okay . 
So 
this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , 
instead of clapping why not just be  ask . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . <cough> 
No , it's okay . 
Puts less of constraint on what we can do 
but 
it's always like that . 
We have dreams 
and the  in the end we find out that it's not feasible . <laugh> 
Anyway . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
L_C_D_ . 
L_S_D_ is something else , 
and it's quite nice as well . <laugh> 
So , 
go on uh artist . <laugh> 
Hmm . <laugh> 
<other> <laugh> <other> 
<laugh> 
Let's change millenniums . <laugh> 
 doesn't make sense . 
This is very <laugh> ugly . 
Oh no , 
too much concept . 
Ah . 
<other> <laugh> 
Ah , 
back today . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
 Do you think it can come in several colours ? 
Or did the  
Um but not the case . 
Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff , 
like  
Yeah , 
well 
they like uh something which is uh  
Mm yeah , okay , 
so that would be the option 
. I don't know 
I don't have a Nokia phone , 
but 
I don't use that 
but again , uh I might  
Yeah , 
bu but  <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Kind of upgradable uh <laugh> remote control . 
Wow , wow . 
Mm . 
Like a chameleon . 
Mm-hmm . 
Because uh I think there are two kinds of people . 
Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful 
uh I'm going to talk about this later 
but  
and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them 
so it it's like a signature . 
My remote control is pink . 
Nobody else than me has a pink remote control . 
<laugh> And that makes me special . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that . 
Those who wanted to have it pink . 
No mm no . 
It might be optional , yeah . 
The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends . 
Although similar but have something just slightly better . Pink <laugh> 
Mm . Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
You always have your remote . 
Oh , you don't ? <laugh> Yeah . You don't have your remo <laugh> 
Wh 
you you know like 
for instance take the iPod . It's a kind of remote control . 
<laugh> Uh it's white 
and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere . 
It has this distinctive look and feel and look  
which people seems to like <laugh> 
just because it's <other> a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . White . 
Seems important . 
Mm  glow in the dark , 
so  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Yeah . Uh-huh , yeah sure . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well so 
I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done 
uh so that's the smartness of the thing . 
Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition 
but we may have remote controls with speech recognition . 
I dunno . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Don't touch the remote . 
But  yeah . 
Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? 
So 
for instance the young guy would not be able to use it 
because his father doesn't want . 
Like with some  
Maybe fingerprint recognition or  
Mm . 
Um  
Mm . 
Okay . 
So it could be smart in that way . 
But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . 
S since it it knows who is using it , 
it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh  things like that 
and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow , 
I dunno , 
that might be expensive 
but 
that might also be a good sales pitch again . 
<laugh> The remote that knows you . <laugh> 
My turn ? 
 
Okay , 
it's alright . 
Four , I think . 
Trend , 
yeah . 
No uh 
yes . 
Okay , so 
I'm going to talk about trends 
and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . 
So , 
next slide please . 
So 
first maybe just a small recap on <laugh> how how do we watch trends 
so 
it's not so uh simple 
you might think that it's easy 
but uh it's not so simple . 
Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , 
so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , 
and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control 
which basically is a small device that people  have with them , always , like a phone . 
We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh <other> example of where to in be inspired . 
Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also  have also to be inspired 
because in fact they're not only watching the trends , 
they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . 
I hope I'm going to try to help you on that . 
This is more risky 
because you're not following the trend , 
you try to invent it , 
which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business . <laugh> 
So anyway uh 
next slide please . 
<other> Uh to be to be quick <laugh> 
there's a lot of words here 
but uh basically there are  uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very  pay much attention to . 
The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . 
And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy . 
Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , 
it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside 
and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing 
which we w may think that would have been the most important , 
which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . 
So as you see uh <other> it first have to be very nice , 
s something that people are proud of 
uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with 
uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff 
that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . 
And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control 
but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . <laugh> 
Next slide please . 
Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . 
If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas 
so  
currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of <laugh> of look or feel 
or 
so . <laugh> 
And I think of course uh <other> i it applies to everything . 
That's the thing with trends . 
<laugh> It it can travel f from clothe to furniture <laugh> same idea . 
Fruit and vegetable . Think fruit and vegetable . <laugh> 
And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , 
yeah . 
Well 
this <laugh> so so I think uh uh i 
When we were talking about rubber , 
I think uh the rubber aspect might be important 
because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess . 
Seems not , seems not . 
Yeah . 
So  <laugh> 
Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , 
as a  
even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . I mean  
And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like . 
So 
that's what people seem to  <laugh> 
yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought 
but that's that's fashion 
and  <laugh> 
Okay 
that's all I have to say . 
These  I'm sorry . 
Yeah , yeah 
we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , 
as you know our company is quite big 
and uh so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends 
that are also  
well . 
No , it's not it's not  
this this is very general , yeah . 
But it seems that trends travel across things . 
The  what we  
Sure . 
Yeah . 
We have to  I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables 
but we still have to put our chips inside , so  <laugh> of course . 
This is your problem . 
<laugh> This is not mine . <other> 
Yeah , 
I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material . 
If if it's something like rubber made or  I think it it's also going to be good . 
Okay ? 
Yep . Thanks . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Thanks . <cough> 
Spongy . 
<laugh> No , we don't have to , 
but seems it's the trend . 
Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend . 
So there's no  
Well , 
that's  
you t can try to convince us . 
Okay . <laugh>  that's a good idea , 
I  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Uh  
I think i 
yeah 
i it's again in this uh 
what I said first 
it has to be fancy 
so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us 
because we have it 
and others don't . 
It's fancy . 
Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Maybe you could explore the two option . 
Mm . Seems to be  . 
If you have time . 
<laugh> For creation . 
<laugh> 
You can paint it afterward  . 
No problem . 
We have a very large department of <laugh> paint . 
<laugh> You will do it . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says  if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are . 
Yeah . 
That's the converse to having zillions of button 
where each button does only one thing . 
Yeah . 
Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel . 
Anyway it's very  
in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control . 
<laugh> So . <laugh> 
Because the trend goes faster than the life of the  <laugh> 
So it's  very  
Okay . 
We're done .
