<laugh> <laugh> <laugh> 
<other> Ramaro . 
Yeah , participant two . 
Component . 
Yep . 
So 
we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . 
For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . 
First one , we can use simple battery , 
or we can use <other> traditional solar cells 
or  
mm and the material we can have plastic , 
rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ 
and then uh titanium , which can be  which have very good look 
an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . 
And we can use some  , moving  kind of thing . 
So , 
as we discussed before , 
we need to  
we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . 
So 
this can be simple kind of programmable chip 
and  
which can use microphone  sensors . 
And we also want to look at our remote control , 
so . 
Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to  in our twelve Euros or around that . 
So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house . 
So uh 
we discussed an  
<other> Excuse me . 
So 
we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells 
and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells 
and so we would like to just use simple battery . 
And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or  
and 
well 
the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes . 
<other> Like you can have two curves . 
Uh it's  I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . 
So , 
we want to go for simple push buttons 
because it need a simple chip 
and it's really lesser  uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ 
which are 
uh which needs advanced chip technology 
and it's more expensive , 
since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition 
we want to reduce uh cost . 
Uh  Uh  And also like in  if you put a  it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things 
and  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Like in cell phones recently 
these  you can  with the rubber in four directions and  
yeah . 
But full assembly  We'll use mainly for titanium  
rubber is expensive 
and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh . 
And this push buttons 
 we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s 
and so we want to mo 
I mean we're  we want to put speech recognition 
so we want to reduce price on this technology 
and so that we can have enough space or enough money 
for  
S S 
Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , 
so  
Uh l 
So uh 
it's like a  
Yeah 
maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design 
then if we have enough money or like for and  
because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or  or something 
so we want to reduce the cost on display 
or this inter 
Ok Yeah , that can we we can consider , 
because like it won't take much money I guess , 
because  
Okay , yep . 
You have any further questions 
or ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
we're to go for li 
and now I think we have many options in the market 
so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries 
for really light batteries and with uh good price . 
Yeah , 
that's  
then the the one thing we want to know is like 
because remote control is used for like in the household 
so it it it will be it  m maybe at least five , six people want to use it 
so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition 
whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . 
If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome 
and we need really m more technology 
and so  
Yeah , 
if if everybody in the house n  to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something . 
 
Yep . 
Thank you . 
Yeah . 
Oh . We have uh some limitations  . <laugh> 
<laugh> <laugh> 
Three . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <laugh> 
<laugh> So 
maybe you can use  in the end and  <laugh> 
Uh  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> But it's uh  
<laugh> But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ . 
Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . 
Maybe we can just  
if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly . 
So users have different  I mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so  
So we can just  
if they want they can just pay another two Euro . 
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah yes . 
If they want like uh  so that we can  
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Just they'll get few more things and few more colours . 
Lights , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Uh  
Mm . 
But those people will be really few , 
no ? 
So like 
we can  those  
Ah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
 
Yeah 
maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something 
so that like  at least um  
yeah . 
<laugh>  <laugh> Yeah , 
that  
Oh . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Uh that  mm that could be feasible I guess , 
like  
So 
since we have  we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use  
yeah . Yeah , yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh it's  
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
Four . 
<laugh> 
 
<laugh> 
 <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Yeah 
<laugh> kind of um maybe  
 
Yeah 
it  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
 We need to think about  mm mm . 
Fruit . 
Even shape ? 
<laugh> More  
yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Mm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
So 
these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? 
Or it's  
This  you you  so did you   
Where ? 
Oh . Oh , 
okay , mm-hmm . 
It's not from  
mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
It's more general trend 
it's not particular to the remote control . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid 
like they can't be really spongy 
or  
yeah yeah . 
yeah , yeah 
sponge , 
yeah yeah 
at least that's  
Yeah yeah 
that  
yeah yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
looking  
yeah 
fruit . These things can be easily incorporated . 
We can have t colours or this shape 
or at least  
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Look and feel de 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm sounds interesting . <laugh> 
So , 
can we highlight the specific features of our   
yeah , so so 
we want the speech recogniser 
and we want some kind of buttons 
and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , 
that's  
we want to follow general trend . 
Yeah . 
So , 
do you think  
Hmm . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> That's  <laugh> 
So 
what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? 
Or they really like  They more want these fancy features 
like  
Feature  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Uh 
we will try to explore these two options 
and  
yeah yeah . 
Uh yeah 
at least like we can make banana 
or  <laugh> 
yeah 
it's it's 
yeah 
that's a  
we're to look for  
and and s we're to see the  whether rubber is expensive 
and d 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Maybe we can have two different  assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium . 
 we have only the plastic or the  the chippy  yeah fibre chips or  
Uh . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Even design . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
So 
still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or  
 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
then we can  
yeah , yeah , 
that  user friendly 
or  
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
and we just stick with two batteries 
so it's not any solar or  
yeah yeah j yeah , 
because  
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , we're done . 
Yep .
