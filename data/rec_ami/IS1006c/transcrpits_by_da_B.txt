How was lunch ? <laugh> 
Mm . 
Why ? 
Mm-hmm . 
W we can use something like you know <other> the whole body's titanium 
but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts 
like 
to make it feel better 
and to 
you know  
<laugh> Yeah . Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay , 
and still we have  
mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ? 
L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_ . 
No , 
it's not gonna be a t no touchable 
but still like a source of information or source for menus . 
Okay , 
so let's try it , 
let's t 
Yeah , yeah , 
it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
No more questions . 
Mm yeah , yeah . 
But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice , 
L_C_ <laugh> 
I'm an artist , 
sorry . <laugh> 
So uh , 
that's not  
I hope that's not too much . 
Okay . <cough> Uh 
participant number three . 
<other> Uh 
mm mm uh have a look at this  
no it's  
yeah . 
 Uh so 
the concept of the interface . 
Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . 
So let's start with this . 
We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons 
and uh we got explanation for every button 
and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons 
and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here 
and uh go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , 
and um power on and off mm I I don't remember 
so uh 
it it it should be 
maybe this button is power on and off ? 
Or no  ? 
I can see nothing . 
So 
that's our concept . 
It's called the millennium remote control . 
Yeah . 
Really ? <laugh> 
I thought you like it . 
Ah okay 
just press the button , please uh . <cough> 
Yeah , 
we will not use this . We will not use this . 
But instead of this I will devise  That's our concept . 
And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed . 
And uh what will people say ? 
They'll say it's perfect . 
Or what will say ? 
Uh they will say it's splendid . 
And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it . 
And everyone's gonna be satisfied . 
<other> I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours . 
Not the case . 
Yeah . 
Okay , so 
let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels . 
Do you like it ? 
That's why you don't have it . That's why , 
'cause it's nasty . <laugh> 
No . 
Um , I am here . 
Mm-hmm . 
'Kay . 
Okay , 
what uh  
there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um <other> 
'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , 
like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , 
yeah . 
We can make it in fact . 
If if if the  
okay . 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , 
so  
Uh-huh . 
So , 
 be an option , 
yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah , yeah , 
yeah . 
But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time . 
<laugh> And it makes you different , 
you know ? 
Anyone has their remote controls here ? 
No ? <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ? 
That they can use it in darkness , like . Hand light , 
yeah . 
<laugh> Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> Okay . Okay . 
Okay . S well , 
let's go on maybe with the presentation . 
And um the remote control's going to be smart 
but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ? 
And uh 
I dunno 
that's a question to you 
and to mm to  
Mm-hmm . 
Okay , okay . 
<other> So just just just just think about it um . 
 Thank you . 
Uh yeah 
I just want to say it should be real smart . 
<other> Voice recognition is quite tough . 
I say don't use it , and the control just looks . 
'Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it . 
Yeah , sure . 
Mm-hmm . <laugh> 
Okay , 
thanks . 
What is spongy ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
So 
we have to 
uh for  
yeah 
so 
are we confident enough on creating trends ? 
Well , 
we can make it smell like fruit . <laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean  fruit-shaped . 
But  
Doub double-curved . 
Okay , okay . 
In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the  like titanium panels on a whole rubber body . 
Well , okay 
w we'll see . 
Yeah 
We'll see . We'll see . 
We'll see . 
I I really don't like this modelling clay 
'cause you know it makes some  for for 
I dunno uh  
yeah um 
we'll look . 
Okay , okay . 
Alright , alright . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Yeah .
