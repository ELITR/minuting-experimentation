How do you wear this thing ? 
Not too many cables and stuff . 
<other> 
<other> 
<other> 
Original . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Uh . Just one thing . 
Uh , you said twenty-five minutes , 
but I have something else to do uh , so gotta have another meeting uh soon , 
so maybe you could hurry up a bit  
It's true . 
I have another meeting 
so if you could uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
for the lawnmower project . 
Okay . 
<other> 
<other> What an original idea . 
Orangutan . 
<cough> 
Can I give you the 
 no ? 
But I don't have to say anything . When I'm drawing the orangutan . 
<cough> 
<other> 
It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan . 
Yes . 
I don't have a red colour . 
Usually orangutans have red hair 
so this is a very important 
but I don't have red pen , so  
<other> Yes . 
<cough> 
Yes . 
I know . 
<cough> 
<other> 
Wha what is this strange beast ? 
Is it a monster ? 
It's a cat ? 
I thought these things did not exist . 
Ah yeah <other> 
Does have a name ? 
Caramel . Ah-ha . 
Next time I concentrate . 
He looks like a bong . 
Okay . 
Sorry . 
No . 
Scary ? 
<laugh> 
<other> I I think we will be finished this uh  
Is it for uh for putting a  for logos , no . 
<other> That's  
I is there a matter for a new remote control ? 
Is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control ? 
Ah 
this is not defined at all ? 
Ah , okay . 
<other> 
Well uh do we sell other stuff ? 
Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one 
otherwise who would buy a remote control from us . 
Yeah . 
No , I couldn I cannot fi think of any requirements right now . 
<other> 
<other> 
Mm . 
Something like that , least fits in your hand . 
<other> Yeah . 
The basic requirement . 
<other> Only a buck . 
<cough> 
Waterproof . <other> 
<other> 
Mm . 
B it seems uh so , 
but uh if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f 
And , and that's one of the  that's one of the shock  I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it . 
That's people  they actually do it themselves . 
I it will look a bulky in that case . 
Like as an optional thing . 
Barks . 
<other> 
That's that's quite cool , 
but uh of course we  you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right ? 
So i it's just going to add t to the cost . 
<other> It's cool . 
I think I like the idea , 
but I'm not sure about the what you , 
who is giving  who's giving who's giving our budget . Who's  
Yeah . Yeah . 
'Kay . <other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Good . 
<cough> 
Uh , so we come back in five minutes ? 
Half an hour .
