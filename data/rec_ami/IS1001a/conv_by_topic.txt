B:

A:  Hmm . Mm mm mm . <other>

D:   
B:  <other> <other> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> Original . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Is recorded ? Okay ? Okay so welcome everyone . So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control . So I will first start with a warm welcome opening <laugh> stuff , then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be  you will have to fulfil to complete this process . So  
B:  Uh . Just one thing . Uh , you said twenty-five minutes , but I have something else to do uh , so gotta have another meeting uh soon , so maybe you could hurry up a bit  
A:  <laugh> <laugh> sorry ? 
B:  It's true . I have another meeting so if you could uh  
A:  You have another meeting soon ? 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <cough> 
A:  So you have to be quick . 
B:  Yeah , for the lawnmower project . Okay . 
A:  Okay . 


A:  So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly . 
B:  <other> 
A:  So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points . First it will be the functional design . Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that . 
C:  <cough> 
A:  And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing <other> and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point . 


A:  So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board . 
B:  <other> What an original idea . 
A:  <laugh> Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us ? <laugh> 
B:  Orangutan .

D:  <laugh> 
C:  He also . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> I I think we will be finished this uh  
C:  Mm .

A:  <laugh> Okay . 
B:  <other> That's  
A:  Let's move on . So  Here the uh financial objective of our project . That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros . 
B:  I is there a matter for a new remote control ? 
A:  <other> Yeah if it's trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs . 


A:  And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil ? 
C:  <other> I think we shouldn't have too many b for my part . I think  
B:  No , I couldn I cannot fi think of any requirements right now . 
C:  If we don't have so many buttons could be nice . 
B:  <other> 
A:  <other> Few buttons . Okay . And do you have it also to be  to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ? Might be a good idea . 
B:  <other> 
C:  <other> Yeah . 
A:  Okay . And do you have any um any uh idea of the trend  the trend in domain , what it shouldn't  it should look like , or things like that ? 
C:  <other> Something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  With rou okay . Like for  okay . 
B:  Something like that , least fits in your hand . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <other> Yeah . The basic requirement . 
A:  Okay . So . Fit in your hand , yeah . 
B:  <other> Only a buck . 


A:  Okay . So next meeting is in thirty minutes or so uh . <laugh> Don't pani . So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working  any working function we have discussed . 
C:  <laugh> Don't panic . <laugh> Mm-hmm . 
A:  So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  And also um <other> I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user . So . And then uh I will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon . <other> 
B:  Mm . 
A:  So . Thank you I think that's all for this point .
