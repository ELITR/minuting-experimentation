Mm-hmm . 
<cough> 
Okay . 
<cough> 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
Because it's open you mean . <laugh> 
<other> F_ five . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
Did you draw it ? <laugh> 
This  . 
What is the other chip for ? The one on top . 
<cough> 
For men . 
To the  in  
<other> Okay . 
Mm . 
What is F_P_G_A_ ? 
So why's it  how is it different from the Bluetooth ? 
Yeah . Programme it . 
Okay . 
Yeah . <other> 
Uh  
So this are the  they have to work together ? 
Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice  
Okay . 
Is the is the software par 
alri okay . 
Okay , okay . 
So you can control  if you want , right ? 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<other> 
<other> 
Mm . Mm . 
Mm . You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Uh  mm . 
Y yeah , yeah . 
Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ? 
<laugh> I dunno . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
So is mine . 
Oh . 
Yeah , this your  
Yeah . 
<other> So you can open uh <laugh> 
three . 
Yeah . 
<other> So  
So I'm working on the technical functions design . 
 can you show the next slide . 
So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . 
So <laugh> so I found on a webs on the internet 
<laugh>  yeah . <laugh> 
I spent a lot of time searching <laugh> 
and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . 
<laugh> For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . 
So I found two very good prototypes for <laugh> for this interface from our competitors 
so can you <other>  
Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
Ours is a bit uh different . 
So these are two example . 
One is from <other>  
the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah . 
This is the most competing prototypes I've found <laugh> . 
But then uh loo but then I found if you look at  you see on the left one there are too many buttons  
Yeah . 
O on the right I tried to play with <other> the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number 
so it's very lousy . 
<laugh> So you <laugh> so you move to the next the next one . 
Yeah , so I talk about the problem . 
And then I I look at the user manual 
they are a hundred pages thick , 
so we don't want that . 
<laugh> So I propose the easy to use uh prototype . 
You can navigate on T_V_ screen 
and we can  the user's preference 
and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end  in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ 
and we need some  to do some preprocessing . 
From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the <laugh> on the remote controller , right ? 
<laugh> And then we  the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in  we may K_I_V_ . 
Yeah , all the processing is done  the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah because  <laugh> are you just wondering what controller  okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
<other> Okay . 
So i the processing on on the remote controller  
so it can u be used in any T_V_ , any conventional T_V_ sets ? 
Mm . Okay . <laugh> 
N yeah , that's all . 
The next one ? 
So I come up with a simple design , 
just keep the v navigation buttons . <laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<laugh> Okay , that's all . <laugh> 
<other> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
No , because you choose by channel , 
so  you choose by T_V_ program 
so you don't have hundred channels to choose from . 
If you go by channel , you don't have to do that . 
Ah . 
Ah , a big jump . 
A mouse or  
Yeah . 
Mm . <other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Uh it's gonna be small . 
<laugh> <other> Yeah . 
So it'll beep if you wanna find it 
you just uh shout  y h just  
it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . 
<laugh> I dunno how bu <laugh> 
<laugh> And  responds to you , and  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<other> 
I- <other> mm . 
But I think if you  to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem . 
I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited  you have limited vocabulary  
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<other> But  <other> 
<other> 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
<other> I no  I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost . 
Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , 
yeah , extra features . 
Mm . <other> Yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<other> 
What is the teletext ? 
Mm . 
It is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller . 
So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? 
Or it's it's done via this remote controller ? 
It's very complex . 
<other> 
Mm . 
Yeah , then we can conclude that . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
but it's quite possible 
but maybe not in this project . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<other> Okay . 
Yeah . <other> Okay . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? Or what ? 
I didn't quite understand  
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah . 
<other> The future demand , market demand . <laugh> 
The functionality in the future . 
Alright . 
Yeah . Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital , right . 
All the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog . 
Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change . 
Okay . Thank you .
