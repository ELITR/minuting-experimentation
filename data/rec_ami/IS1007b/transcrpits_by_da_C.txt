Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah , alright . 
So uh  
Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder 
so I I I think you can reach it from here . 
Participant two . 
Yeah . 
Uh open . <laugh> 
<laugh> Right , so um I will talk about the the w working design and  
And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the  our new remote control for television . 
So uh can you go one page down , please . 
So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do . 
So uh mm I'm thin uh <other> 
I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market 
and what what is the the cheapest possible <laugh> things we hav we can use . 
Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype 
and to see uh with uh h how this little box <laugh> would uh look look like . 
And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that . 
And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . 
Okay so can you go down uh  
So , wha what I think <laugh> for now <laugh> is <other> we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired 
so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the  . 
Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . 
And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication 
So uh this is the <laugh> the schema of the <laugh> o of the future uh remote controls 
so uh you can you can see the components , uh battery 
and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set . 
The one on top is for the um  well the functionali the functionalities 
and the the th red um  sorry the green one is is to  well , putting things together , 
um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to  uh to communicate with the T_V_ set . 
And , that's it . 
I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for <laugh> for the functionalities which is easy to to t 
It's field programmable uh something array . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Well , uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can  pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want . 
And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices . 
No . 
Well , th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send . 
Yeah . 
Yeah <laugh> . 
Alright and that's it for the working design . 
So if you have any questions ? 
Uh no no no no , 
I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the  
yeah into the t . 
Yeah , yeah . 
And uh I I don't think it will need um <other> very uh much power to make it run , so  
Yeah . 
It's a good idea . 
Yeah . 
That's a good idea . 
Also , but but <laugh> I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote <laugh> control . 
<laugh> S <laugh> okay , so charger for  is the  . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Of course . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> So we have to t 
We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too . <laugh> 
I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that 
and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because  
Yes , that's a good idea , I think . 
We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to  i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh <other>  
Well , f four five buttons , it's sufficient . 
It's easy to build , 
it does not consume much power . <laugh> 
Well , then y you you go to the main menu 
and uh you have uh go to channel 
and then uh you  can  
Yeah . 
Maybe you  
 . 
 but uh I I think i i  if you if you want to to make uh  well a a big jump <laugh>  but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could  
Well , not a mouse 
but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , 
well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or  
So , 
we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that . 
But we'll see . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay , so uh next presentation  <laugh> 
Mm . <laugh> 
Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts 
Yeah . 
And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons 
so it's a good idea . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think  
Well , uh <other>  
<laugh> 
we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well  yes a microphone into the the remote control , so  
I  well  
it will be alright . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
I think it's a bit complex too  
For our next product , our new T_V_ set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment <laugh> light   
 . 
<laugh> 
Function . 
Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? 
I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ? 
Yes . 
Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh <other> about a way to to access the internet via the television . 
Because if  
Yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . 
So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a  w which will c which will come in a few years . 
So if we already have it in our remote control  
Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah , to desi 
well , not not to implement it , 
but to  well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a  yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible . <laugh> 
<other> Yeah , yeah . 
Okay . So  
Okay , thank you .
