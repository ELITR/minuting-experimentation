Just go to explorer . 
Or open . 
Participant two . 
Open uh . 
Slide show , view slide show ,  . 
<laugh> 
One is a communication . 
<other> Gateway arrays . 
It's a field programmable gateway arrays . 
Yeah  . 
Or it's something like  isn't hardware the first one ? 
And the second one is for the software . 
Yeah to run th to make it run . 
That's it . 
No . 
Okay , and how about the battery power ? 
Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? 
Into the <other> 
more compact and uh  okay ,  
Yeah , yeah . Okay . 
Yeah , that's right . 
Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . 
People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . 
We just make a small charger 
and put it  
<other> 
Bu <other> 
Our remote , 
we do not want to make it P_D_A_ . <laugh> 
G 
<laugh> 
Yeah , not the T_V_s . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that's right . 
Yeah , that's right . 
Oh , but you have a catch there , 
um assume that um if you want to go to  if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then <imitates zapping> . 
Uh-huh huh huh huh . 
Mm-hmm hmm hmm . 
But  
Yeah then yeah that's right . 
Mm hmm hmm . Okay . 
Okay . 
<laugh>  
too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . <laugh> 
Yeah , 
that's  . 
 just  give it a name and we call him . 
<laugh> Yeah , that's right . Yeah , that's right . 
Okay , after having the inputs from <other> industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . 
And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , 
and the users send the feedbacks , 
and based on that  These are the findings which we got 
and  yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote 
but the technology  We already know that  as discussed earlier  
An <other> it does  how feasible it is . 
Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . 
We just have the  
 it's not going to take much space also . 
It's going to be very slim . 
And next one was the size of the remote control . 
It has to be of course a very slim and small one . 
And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , 
so this is an important criteria here is  
I mean we have to look for a trade-off . 
The features and the cost . 
<other> 
Little bit more if it's with extra features . 
Okay . 
Yeah , yeah . That's right . 
I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . 
Or they say movie name  
or I don't go for movie names 
but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . 
So , I think this should be a good idea , to put this features . 
And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages . 
Mm , I think  
<other> 
Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but <other> I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . 
I mean  
I mean  yeah , it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not . 
I think  
I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing . 
The speech interface 
and uh less uh reasonable uh cost . 
And the lighting adaptation 
and the teletext . 
And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . 
If you are watching an foreign movie , you get  subtitles sometimes . 
And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . 
And if I am a German then I would like to have the  my options in German . 
So , the remote  it should have some  it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . 
That should be a good uh point . 
We already have some  . 
<other> Yeah , that's right . 
Yeah ,  . 
Okay , thank you .
