Hello . 
Yes , I made it . 
English from now on <laugh> . <cough> 
Drawing or  
Yeah . 
Ooh it works . 
<laugh> Spicy . 
Where are are all the other presentations ? 
The conceptual or  
Ah . Because I see only my own presentation <laugh>  
yeah . 
This ? 
 I'll just put it in there . 
Or not . 
Ah , 
I can't cut and paste it into the other folder but  
Move to meeting room . 
Yeah . 
Yeah me too ,  . 
<laugh> <cough> 
Yeah . 
Yes . 
Me first again or  
yeah . Alright . 
Did you open it already or  
no . Ah . 
Ah . 
Yes . 
So welcome to the marketing presentation once again . 
Um this time about trendwatching . 
<other> Uh well there has been inv investigation again , in the in the remote control market . 
Uh it shows a number of developments . 
Uh I will address them uh in a moment . 
Um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public , because that's our public . 
Um well 
fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , uh shoes and furniture . 
And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . 
So um the developments I will address them  
oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . 
So to give you an idea . 
Um well the developments ? 
Uh development one . 
<other> Uh well 
most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel . 
Um well fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface . 
And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative . 
Um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls . 
I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition , 
so I don't expect that to be a problem . 
And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use . 
Um  
Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . 
So um that kind of gets you this ratios . 
So fancy look-and-feel uh is the most important uh point of attention . 
Uh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material . 
Um well technolog technological innovation , we've covered that pretty much I guess . 
Um and easy to use , I don't think that will be problem . 
So my point of attention is especially this part . 
That this will be a crux . 
So that was the marketing uh presentation . 
I had only one document left . 
So kind of this  
<laugh> So a k a small example . 
Kind of this this look . 
Uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours 
I dunno . 
<laugh> Just made a quick design . 
Alright . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . It's okay . 
F_ five . 
<cough> 
Yeah . 
Wi an indoors . 
Oh . 
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I guess we can only choose one . 
Yeah . And it's more fun . 
Yeah , just playing with it 
and  especially when the material's rubber . It can be done , I mean , you can't harm it , 
so it's a perfect combination I guess . 
Yeah . 
So  
So double curved is like this , this , this , or  
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Also in in height ? 
Yeah okay . 
Yeah with the programme . 
And and the and the buttons that you need to control it , I guess . 
Yeah . 
<other> Back and okay . 
<laugh> 
No . 
Rubber material . 
So that's uh  
is that is that the advanced chip ? <other> 
Wow . 
Yeah . 
Alright . 
Kinetic . Double curved . 
 . 
The cost of making it should be twelve and a half ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah , so it's cheap . 
Um well the interface type supplements . 
If you go to your homepage or something , you should 
get your own information . 
I got my fresh and fyoo fruity uh picture uh also uh over there , so  
No . 
<laugh> Too less time . 
Yeah , also the menu . 
Yeah that that w 
Yeah . Yeah I was thinking of that also , with with a with a uh arrow . 
So that indicates that there's an menu under that menu . 
So  
Oh yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . <laugh> Cool . 
S underwater uh  <laugh> 
yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
 . 
Yeah . Also a kind of rubber uh  
Yeah . 
That should be nice . 
So s 
Yeah there's only in in this dimension . 
Like this . So curvy or not  . 
Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So from top view it looks kinda like this . 
But from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape . 
Maybe because the the screen is on top you can have  
Maybe you can c have this kind of shape . 
A little upwards . So that the screen is more 
towards yourself , so you can easily see your screen . 
Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . 
So then you have double double curved in some way . 
So this this is so the screen is positioned over here . 
Oh . 
Something like that . 
And the buttons are more , 
well it's very thick now but  
That's uh that's  
Yeah ? That that you can press it and then it comes up ? Or  
But then the side view can be straight . If you have a pop-up screen . 
But I dunno if that's too expensive . 
I mean maybe it's too much  
Oh the advanced buttons . Right . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<cough> Yeah . 
So  okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open . 
Yeah . 
<other> Yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your  
True . It uh c it can go open . 
An adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of uh thin rubber layer or something like that . 
Yeah , uh  
It's very no it's very strong . 
Yeah . 
Yeah the lower part doesn't work I guess , 
so maybe you should try it over there . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah but but that's optional for later I guess . 
I mean , we have to make  
Yeah we we better so choose one  
Yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape . 
But that's the kind of the idea , 
so it lays good in the hand , 
and then on on the side with with your thumb , 
you you can you can use , 
yeah , 
you can use the button option  
Spongey . 
Spongey can be reached by means of  
Yeah . 
And and the and the control thngs in the middle ? The the the arrows ? 
Yeah 
and then numbers . 
Yeah . Alright . 
Uh pretty nice design . Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah it looks uh pretty fancy . 
<laugh>  . 
Uh bananas  wierd shape and other fruits also , 
so it's better to have um some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary uh colours . 
I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? 
Like some soft <other> green or something ? 
Or  and then  
Oh yeah yeah , dark blue 
and then and then very bright , uh a yellow banana , <other> an orange , uh a green apple , stuff like that , 
with very uh bright tones I guess . 
So you have something like  
Yeah . 
Mm . 
<laugh> That doesn't really work . To draw , I guess . 
Oh . What's this ? 
Right . 
Hm . 
Yeah . Two hours further . 
 thickness . Oh . 
Oh . Wh why not go for the twenty ? 
Yeah . That's what I call painting . 
So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess . 
It's pretty nice . 
And then uh  
Oh  
Yeah with some some yellow banana  
Like  <vocal noise> . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah ? 
How do you mean ? 
Some some  
Yeah an orange . 
Well alright well this is more like purple I guess , 
but  it's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is uh pretty high . 
So uh yeah . 
That would be a nice uh nice device I guess . 
I mean , the the colour of the background of the display ? 
Ah well I don't guess it s has to be a sixty uh sixty six <laugh> five thousand uh colour , so yeah too expensive . 
So just just a <other> a blue blue backlight or something like that . 
Green is too old-fashioned . But blue , blue's okay . J 
White backlight , and dark . 
Yeah . 
Whatever which is visible . 
I know you sh you should test it under uh under a light conditions . 
I mean it's hard to tell uh I dunno . 
Yeah . True . 
Which which uh colour should the buttons be ? 
Why adjustable ? 
No uh  
But <laugh> maybe I mean they have to they have to have some colour right ? 
And if the background is very dark blue  
Yeah ? 
So more like  
Doesn't work very well . 
Uh . More like this colour . 
And then then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something . 
But then then again , which colour should the buttons be ? 
The the press buttons . Should they be white or black or  
Uh  
Yeah but it's pretty fresh , on the other side . 
Yeah . 
My couch is in that colour . 
Yeah . 
Well it works pretty well . 
And then time was up . 
Uh  
 . 
<other> That you have five minutes left or  
So something like this . 
That should be pretty nice colour . 
But maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people . 
Because the  of the green . 
Yeah . 
Yeah ? 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
So red buttons are okay ? 
How do you mean ? 
Yeah . 
No that's that's too busy I guess . 
You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess . 
So just an extra 
bit of light and attention . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Alright . 
Of the product ? 
Which we don't have yet . 
<laugh> So wh how should I do that ? 
Oh okay . 
Or you you or you send it to me . 
Or just  
because you are going to design it on this board right ? 
Yeah . I I probably get instruction on that , how to do that , 
so I make another presentation I guess . 
I kn I know what's gonna happen in in yeah so  
I've a basic idea . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Alright so that's uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
 . 
Yeah . 
On the left . 
S so , yeah . 
Yeah . 
This ? 
Uh pretty accurate . 
Oh we skip this I guess . Sound  button press . 
Light only button user ca user interaction . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So the pl the plastic plastic buttons also help uh because of um they are only lit during interaction . So  
Well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't um , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on  when when they are usable . 
Maybe you should draw it very large <laugh> like this . 
Oh right . 
Erase ? 
Yeah . 
Much easier , yeah . 
I don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but  
<laugh> Yeah . 
Oh . 
<other> Wrong one . 
Alright . 
But we we  
I is it  if if this is from the side  
woah . Steady . 
Because there the screen goes up like that right ? 
So then it's like this , 
or  that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the  
it's better to have it somewhat like this . 
Or does it flip all the way ? 
It's better to to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this . 
Yeah . 
So w yeah . 
But we still keep the flipping mechanism . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah but maybe  Yeah but maybe we we should then  
Yeah there the middle  
Sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ? 
And then like i oh th <other> 
doh . 
Come on . 
So this is the shape . 
Oh . It hasn't  
Okay but the screen is a bit lower 
because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen . 
So there's a layer of rubber on the side . 
So no flipping but just  
no . 
Throwing and the kinetics . 
Oh . We better make we better make it like this . Eventually . 
Yeah . 
Uh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control . Yes . 
<whistles> 
Yeah ? 
Ooh . <laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> Alright . 
Good . 
Yeah . 
We should work in our own room right ? Or not ? 
Yeah . Yes . 
See you two in half an hour uh  
<other>
