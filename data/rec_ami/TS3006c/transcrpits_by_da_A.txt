 . 
 . 
Yeah just testing . 
Mm ? 
English . 
 . 
Break is over . 
Whoo . 
<laugh> Spicy . 
So , he's coming . 
Oh okay . 
Ah . She  . 
You can look at the final report , 
'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such , 
so I'm trying to write it down between everything else . 
Oh . 
<Vocal expression> 
Yeah . 
Here we go again . 
Welcome . 
Uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh  f the remote control has to support . 
So who wants go . 
Yes ? 
Yeah sure . Doesn't matter . 
No . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
 . 
<Vocal noise> Yeah yeah sure . No . 
Cool . 
<laugh> Yeah you're just the user interface hmm ? 
Yeah layout . 
Yeah okay . 
You probably opened it . 
F_ five . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah okay . 
Calculator's can do it . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Uh I think you can only fit one uh source of energy on the  
Yeah 
I didn't receive any info uh . 
Yeah . 
S yeah it's safe . 
'Kay next . 
Uh  
Okay . 
Can we uh  
Yeah . 
Well the visual representation is not there with speech 
but you can  
Yeah . 
Just  yeah . 
I think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present . 
So I don't think you have to design anything else for that . 
Both . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
That would be the back . 
Back and okay . 
You did read the minutes I wrote ? 
You did read the minutes I wrote ? 
Oh okay 
'cause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were . So  
I hate doing work for nothing . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> That was it ? 
Okay . Uh  
 again . Ugh . 
<other> 
Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ? 
Uh energy source , chip type , case type . And user interface . 
But I didn't see a clear distinction between these so I think what we have is okay . 
So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . 
Uh the case would be doubly curved . So  
Rubber material . 
And that's the only thing we have left . 
Oh okay . No it's easy . <laugh> 
Advanced chip . Okay . 
Too  . 
Uh I didn't get any info on this . So  
Yeah . 
I have total here . 
Yeah I don't know . 
I didn't get any information about that so  
Yeah . 
Who doesn't . 
Uh let's see . Is there a new thing ? 
Yeah the interface , 
maybe can  
Ooh . 
No . 
Uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? 
And could you put that in the group folder ? Of the project folder . 
<laugh> Ah you didn't draw it yourself . 
<laugh> Ah . 
Arrow . 
Yeah . 
 . 
'S the target group . 
Yeah sure . <laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Oh okay . I see . 
Yeah also like this . So you can hold it . 
 . 
The children's story . Yeah I've got it . 
Distinction . Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Different . 
Mm-hmm . 
Camera . 
Yeah submarine . <laugh> 
<laugh> Well  
Yeah but this this the  is for the  . 
Okay . 
Uh  
Ah yeah bright colours . 
That's singly curved . 
Okay . 
Well we could make a compromise between that . 
But I don't know if it's worth the effort . 
Uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . So to appeal a little more to the all the public . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Also . 
Yeah that would be an option . 
I don't know what you think . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Yeah I'd agree . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Different . 
Stands out . 
Or  
Oh yeah a one hand uh solution . 
 can turn it maybe . 
To switch from buttons to interface hmm . If you turn it a little . 
 . 
Oh yeah . Least you can easily see it . 
If you can uh flip . 
<other> Uh so you have a the the side view . 
So and you want to be able to 
make this 
 . 
Okay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way . 
Yeah . 
Oh yeah . Yeah yeah yeah yeah . Right . Yeah that's good idea . 
Yeah . 
No not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons . 
But you can hide the okay and the back uh button . 
And the menu button also because when you flip it open  
and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically . 
<laugh> 
Why ? 
You could just make it mechanical . 
If you cover it with rubber . 
Mm . 
Yeah . So it can bounce . 
Yeah okay so that that may work . 
Okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape . 
Yeah . 
What kind of  
Harder . 
 . 
<laugh> 
Maybe can design two versions . 
Mm-hmm . 
And ergonomical shape . Yeah . 
The female shape yeah . 
With two uh  <laugh> 
Oh yeah . 
Some uh k esk uh  yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah . 
Yeah . 
So the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Buttons . 
Okay . 
I think that uh it's a nice design . 
<laugh> It's cool . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah that's  <laugh> 
Orange or something . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Huh cool . 
No it's  
 . 
Yeah it's text . 
N no you have to exit . <laugh> 
<laugh> You could also make line with uh  
Yeah . <laugh> 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Y 
<laugh> 
Yeah 
and then on top of that . 
Some yellow . 
Banana colour . 
Yeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it , basically . 
Well I think it's a bit too much but  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Who ? 
And then you can use yellow or semething . 
Why not ? <laugh> 
Aye . 
Like this . 
Colourblind yeah . 
No so that's mostly red and green I believe . 
Woah . 
All all buttons ? 
Okay . 
<other> It's difficult . 
Blue . 
Maybe green . 
Yeah you can  
Mm-hmm flashy . 
Mm bzz . 
Red maybe . 
Black . 
Why ? 
Yeah . 
So  
Ooh .  . <other> 
<laugh> 
Uh not yet . 
Yeah within five minutes yeah . 
Y left yeah left and then uh I have to kick you out . 
Yeah yeah . 
They have LEDs but they have a colour . 
<laugh> 
You can make them red . 
Yeah . But I think you need to keep in mind that the LEDs are just extra light . <laugh> 
Uh they they don't determine the colour that much , I think . 
'Cause you have to print on them  you have a background 
Each number is transparent . 
Uh partly but you have to print on the number . Or the the sign . 
So you can't 
 change the colour so  
Yeah . 
Bit of light . 
Bit of feedback . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay with  
Uh  
Don't mean to discourage you 
but  uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . 
Next thirty minutes to design something so  
And the  
You will do the evaluation . 
Yeah . 
Yeah uh about  <laugh> 
Yeah I don't know . 
<laugh> You probably get a mail . 
Yeah . Once they are finished . Yeah . 
Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation  you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . 
I don't know . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
About . Yeah . You have the basic idea . 
And you two uh are going to do this . 
Look-and-feel and  
Yeah . 
Good luck . 
<laugh> So I  
uh make new page and uh be creative . 
Yeah you have uh 
thirty minutes . 
Then we have to uh see something which we can uh 
show to the management . 
I would yeah . 
Yeah . 
Next . 
Oh and save this uh board . 
Just save it . 
Yeah okay 
but just press save and uh  
It'll be fine . 
<laugh> You can also include clip-art . <laugh> 
So if you'll rather draw in paint or something  <laugh> 
 then look . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
You can also include it . 
It's not much work . 
That's included . 
Yeah okay . 
Yeah . 
Sensitive . 
I dunno . 
Maybe just start typing . 
You also do the other sides . 
Not only on the front si uh the top side but also the the side view . 
<other> Uh . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Jesus . 
What do I write down ? <laugh> 
Why can't I work here ? This is much easier . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
No 
so I just work here a few minutes . <laugh> 
Five minutes left before the meeting ends . 
<cough> 
Yeah we keep the flip ? 
Keep the flip live . 
<cough> 
No flipping ? 
It's shaking . 
Yeah just light on top . 
Safer . 
Mm . Yeah okay that  the target group . 
Well . I just uh ended the meeting . 
You two go design . 
Oh . By the way . Um  
<whistles> 
I uh thought up a name for our product . 
Yeah . It's called uh the Real Remote . 
<laugh> With a copyright sign after Real . <laugh> 
So maybe you can include that somewhere . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
I don't see any power cables here so  
'Kay . 
Good luck . <laugh> 
<whistles>
