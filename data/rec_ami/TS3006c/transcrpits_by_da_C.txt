<other>  . <laugh> 
Just kidding . 
So annoying . 
I just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be  
yeah I think so . Yeah , conceptual design . 
What or whatever does it  
No no no , 
can you go back one ? 
Uh 'cause it has to be PowerPoint pre 
yeah components design , that's it . 
 . <other> I did get a bit more done than the last time , 
'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the  
<other> Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there , 
and also with  I don't know how to use PowerPoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it . 
Yeah . 
Thi 
Mm-hmm . 
Who wants to start ? 
Sound . 
Yeah yeah uh uh . 
Yeah . 
And shall I go first ? 
So I  
Yeah ? 
Alright . 
Uh components . 
Oh no . 
Yeah true . Um  
Alright . So <other> 
I'm dealing with the components design . 
Um let's see . 
I uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products . 
And I used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design . 
That's why I had to , wanted to go first . 
Well they gave me um an idea about what people want . 
We're f mainly focusing on this group , but I want to make the distinction clear . 
Uh I could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so I don't have examples of how it looks like . 
But it comes down to what you uh what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking uh type . 
If you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh , which looks like fruits you know , you can  
and shapes that are curved and not uh solid straight lines anymore . 
So this basically um yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier . 
There is a lot of um <other> factors involved in choosing the components . 
There's a lot of options that we have to discuss . 
Uh for example the energy source . we have four types . 
The basic battery . 
Uh we have a hand dynamo , 
which we yeah we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt . 
Uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it . 
Which will be fun for toddlers right , if they wanna use the  
And uh of course solar cells . 
But I dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product . 
So uh my  
yeah also also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in Scandinavia , they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know . 
So that's not cool either . 
So um <other> 
for the uh a case , there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case . 
Single curved , which means that it has uh curves in one dimension . 
Or the double curved . 
Um <other> I wasn't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet , 
but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now . 
Uh the case materials . 
Well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium . 
I would definitely go for rubber 
'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays . 
Um poo , 
this is a lot of text . 
I wasn't able to organise this yet . 
We have yeah several uh interface designs . 
Uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , 
but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons . 
So that's not really interesting . 
Electronics ? 
Yeah , <other> 
maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use  
the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement uh for the production , 'cause they they can print it better . 
Um  
Yeah . I think this is about it . 
Yeah I was working on some per personal preferences . 
I first uh chose for the battery , 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . 
But I really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy , 
where you have to move the thing to be able to use it . 
Yeah maybe we  
I can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make . 
But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again . 
And it's also more fun yeah . 
I always chuck my uh remote control around , so  
Yeah y exactly . 
You don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever . 
So that's the end of it . 
Uh go ahead . 
No it means curved in two dimensions . 
So uh w single curved ? Uh let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . 
And double curved would means that it would have curves curves in every direction . Like three D_ . Yeah . 
Design ? 
I  
And rubber . Rubber material . 
Yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and uh and f audio function . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Otherwise you would have a simple chip , just for pressing buttons . But we need more . 
I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost , 
to be able to m 
So 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five Euro a piece . 
That's gonna be difficult huh ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
<other> Child labour man , we love it . 
Um let me see . 
Wait a sec . 
Yeah I'm going there now . 
Inspiration . 
Well  
Um  
yeah maybe it's  
Maybe it's easier  
Yeah . Yeah perfect . 
Maybe it's easier if you guys come over here . 
S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form uh yeah serves the function , you know . 
It's like really basic . 
But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that . 
This is what we're looking for . 
And th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions . 
Not only like this but it has to be  
exactly . 
It has to be kind of instead of the PlayStation , the module . It has to be like the the Game Cube , you know , 
where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . And  
It ha 
Yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually , 
'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . 
And  
Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , 
you know , with the  
There is mobile phones , in which you can change the colour also of the lights . 
Maybe we should consider this function . 
To customise it and so  
I mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours 
and people who want something , you know , different , or more uh design , they can go for one colour 
like uh for example this uh photo th camera . 
Personally I think it's really ugly . 
Just give me the thing that it's inside there  
maybe I'm too old for this stuff . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
So those I think are all my  
oh . 
And this is , this is with the curved that I mean . 
Yeah . Yeah ? 
A compromise between what ? 
This , this would be uh single curved uh ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . <other> Exactly . Exactly . 
I think the  
I mean our aim is to make something different right ? 
To make something new . 
I would go for the double curved . 
And I I'm I'm thinking uh you know uh a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb . 
So it kind of holds nicely , something like that . 
Well this is really your decision but  
Yeah . As well . 
You can make a trigger button or something like that . 
Yeah 
or that that is the confirmation button or something , 
that you scroll with your thumb , with the arrows , and then confirm . 
That would be a nice way to use it but  
I mean , yeah , I'm thinking big already , 
and we need something that well that  that you can able to use in one hand I think . 
Yeah . 
 . 
How about  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah I understand what you mean . 
How about we do a uh a pop-up screen , like the laptop . 
So that the only the simple functions will be visible at first . 
And then if you want  
Yeah . Something like that . 
Yeah . 
No uh like  
I would draw it like this . 
Let's say this is the side view . 
That you have a a screen that will come up here , and can go down that way . 
If you know what I mean . 
So that it would come up like that . 
Yeah 
or <other> preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons . 
F for the L_C_D_ menu right ? 
So w w 
Oh  
Activate and th the  yeah . 
True . True . 
But you can make a , yeah , you can make a trigger here . 
You know a simple uh  with a  
Yeah . Exactly . 
Well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . 
And  
Exactly . Exactly . 
We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break . 
Th it's very solid yeah . 
That actually will offer some extra protection for the  
Yeah . 
Yeah I was thinking , if if you have your hand , 
it this is your th 
Okay . 
If this is your thumb , and this is your hand like that . 
With your uh wrist . 
That you , that it would be kind of shape like this , you know . 
So it's easier to hold in your hand , to y f 
Uh yeah . Yeah of course . 
Yeah then w then you would have to to make it like this . 
Like like you drew here . 
And maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre . 
Give it  
I would give it a female shape 
but uh yeah . Anyway . 
<laugh> Obviously . <laugh> Make it more appealing to guys . 
I mean  
Yeah but we have hardware inside , which is  so it has to have some sort of basic shape . 
And also the screen , you cannot mould it . 
You know kind of thing . 
Yeah . 
<other> And then you can  
You can place the screen here , which can come  . 
And  but then I w I would  
I would do the arrows here , kind of thing . 
Those buttons ? And the simple buttons here , 
so that  
I Uh y eah that's what I mean . 
The arrows over here , 
and here the s simple uh  
<laugh> 
 or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ? 
I dunno . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
we could make  
We should use  
Yeah w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow . 
Yeah . Yeah okay yeah . 
And how about some uh some flashing standby lights ? 
Like you have on the Samsung , 
well I don't like to call brands phones , 
<other> the you know that  <other> 
'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often . 
So it  not not only in in the colours <other> of the LEDs , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , 
or  
Um  
Yeah . Exactly . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
As long as you loo <other> use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . 
So that people with uh with 
<other> 
And also for people who are a bit colourblind . 
But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ? 
Like the pictures I showed you guys . 
Those things were all like like bright red , bright red , flashy . 
Yeah something like that , something that stands out more . 
Yeah . 
The green ? 
It's actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment . 
Do you get a pop-up if we  
Alright . 
No 
that's actu 
<other> Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . Even for colourblind . 
They will see one of each as grey . 
But if you use uh green on blue , those kind of colours will look the same . 
I think . 
I think so . 
You can  
what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with uh one coloured LED behind it . 
So that the whole button will shine 
as the colour the <other>  
<other> And if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands , 
but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine . 
Ah , right . 
So we're gonna work here ? On this sketchboard ? 
Alright . 
Thanks . 
Alright . 
Thirty minutes . 
Alright . 
Yeah . 
Shall we uh make a new uh  
Yeah , I just <other> make a new one . 
Alright . 
Huh ? 
Yeah I'll just I'll just keep it there . 
Yeah . 
Uh sorry . 
Okay . 
Current colour ? 
So um  
Shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first ? 
Because <other> I I  
Yeah 'cause I have to uh focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . 
So how it's gonna look . 
And you have to think uh how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things . 
So if I'm drawing and you think okay I'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct . 
Uh do you mind if I draw in black then ? For normal sketches . 
 so we kind of want the girlish 
figure . 
I'm not so good at drawing . 
Excuse me ? 
No uh uh . 
How do we uh uh 
or insert text ? 
<other> 
<other> 
Oh that's a bit big . Yeah . 
<other> 
Yeah . Ex exactly . 
Uh  
Uh I thought for the side view , that the w the basic section would be rather uh a bit thicker than the middle , where you're holding it with your  
'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and  
<other> Exactly but the uh but the upper side has to be a bit more like that I think . 
Uh don't you think ? 
So the display we will put in here , the basic uh functions in here , where it's most reachable . 
The  
The th 
Exactly . 
Oh . This is hard . 
What do  
 don't have to draw it exactly do we ? 
Wait . 
Let me try it one more time . 
Maybe I've uh  it's easier if I draw it in once . 
Okay , of course it will become way more ugly . <laugh> 
<other> 
Yeah . 
This'll take forever . 
It's fun to work with this pen . 
Um so , larger . 
And  
yeah . 
So side . 
'Kay . 
Um other views ? 
Uh  
Yeah . 
<other> Let's fill i fill in the buttons later . 
So this is gonna be from the 
uh from <other> 
yeah yeah . 
Sorry . 
Yeah . 
Yeah ? 
The the idea is that it has to flip up to here . 
Okay . 
Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . 
True . 
 you can adjust the angle to which it flips . 
So it can also from this angle , it can flip all the way up to there . 
You can flip it up to there if you want . 
Think so . 
Yeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that  
I dunno . 
<other> I thought it would be cool . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
 . It doesn't aim so well . 
Yeah yeah yeah . Definitely . 
Yeah I guess 
but uh I mean most votes count right ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah true true . 
Yeah . 
Yeah if you if you're going for the kinetics  
Yeah . I'm just thinking totally different designs also . 
Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy . 
Maybe we should try something like that . But yeah . 
Oh right . 
Alright . 
Yeah . I like it . 
Okay . This can go . 
Oh yeah we have to f uh include that in our design as well . 
Let's see . 
What the hell's that ? 
Uh  
Yeah . I think we do . 
Yeah 
or j or also scrolling for the m yeah . 
Yeah ? 
I dunno . 
We w kind of wanted to stick with the  
Yeah I'm just thinking , <other> if we i we wanna make something different 
right ? 
So the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons . 
I think .
