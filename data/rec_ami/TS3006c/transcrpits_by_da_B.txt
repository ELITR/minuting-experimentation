<cough> 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> I I've got the same problem as well . <cough> 
Oh . No . Yeah . No problem 
Yeah . No . I I don't mi I don't mind . 
That's  
Do you want to go first ? Okay . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
It's better than than my uh drawing . <laugh> 
Yeah okay but I have to design the  
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Pushbuttons . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
As an optional uh feature . 
Or combine uh both with a with one uh 
Okay . 
<laugh> And throw it  . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
One one uh very important thing I was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option . 
We were going to use that . 
Yeah . 
So um  <cough> 
Yeah um 
yeah that's one thing uh which I'm not sure uh of how to implement it uh into the remote control . 
No okay but it has to be combined with with the menu uh for functions and  
So okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
But do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ? 
For for everything , 
also for the advanced options ? Okay . 
Uh we have this  very uh basic uh trendy design . 
Everybody says it so that's what's uh  
yeah um  
Yeah 
in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . 
That's yeah obvious . 
Um yeah . 
Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control . 
And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options . 
Yeah . 
Um yeah 
design has to be very attractive 
but that's your your op your  yeah . 
 <laugh> you have to uh delete this 
but this is the the the simple uh layout . 
Uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button . 
I'm  
The back . 
Back and okay yeah . 
Uh  
What ? 
A little bit I think but not not everything w 
Okay . 
Oh <laugh> I uh didn't read that . 
But  
<laugh> But this is the the basic uh design uh for the for the m yeah for the buttons . 
Um  
I wanted to to categorise everything . 
Uh with a speech display uh yeah , sound , everything you you noted in your uh minutes . 
Um every pushbutton has uh has its own uh LED light . 
So you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people . 
And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous  so that's an a also an option . 
Um that was it . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
 . 
We're going to produce it in uh China so it's no problem . 
<laugh> 
Uh it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options uh  yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
This is the the menu I was uh looking uh at . 
Yeah . 
Arrow yeah . 
Yeah . 
S yeah . 
Yeah . 
But it has also to  
it it has also to be uh luxurous uh for for yeah rich people . 
Th this looks a little bit like like for only for children . So  
Yeah . 
The colour  
Yeah . 
Okay but the the colours , you you can make it uh make the colours with  LEDs uh beneath the the buttons . 
If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Very cheap uh cheap look . 
Yeah 
but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . 
If you have uh it have it in your hand , you you you are not only um yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons . 
Yeah . 
Something to shoot at your television  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
That's  
yeah . 
Okay . Yeah . 
That's  
the the more advanced options were uh for the for the menu . 
But you you want  
okay . You just want to hide them all ? 
The  oh . 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
That's  
but it's it's not 
it's not very uh very strong uh  yeah if you drop it one time  . 
Okay . 
But when you are left-handed , that's that's a problem . 
But that's that's very expensive uh  
Yeah . 
We we could make some some rubber uh some rubber uh yeah mouse , with which you can change uh  
and so if you  
Yeah . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Some  
yeah . 
No no no no . <laugh> 
Okay . 
 . 
Yeah . 
No the arrow's over here . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Or blue ? Dark blue or  
Yeah . 
Yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . 
If you we uh  yeah . 
If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , 
also for the for the more uh yeah for the  people . 
<laugh> 
So that's  
<laugh> 
So that's blue . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Maybe a  
Yeah . 
And which which colour should uh should I give the the display ? Uh  
Or  
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . Yeah . 
Yeah 
maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? 
Dark uh letters , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
That's adjustable . 
Yeah ? Or not . 
That's how we are going to make it uh more trendy . 
Or is it uh too expensive ? <laugh> 
Mm . 
And it it looks quite cheap , that colour I think . 
It's it's not  
Yeah . I dunno . 
It's it's trendy okay . 
But  
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
That that's a default uh setting . The the red buttons . 
Okay . Yeah 
I I was think about a red uh red LEDs and blue LEDs and  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
But we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about ? 
Yeah 
l let's just uh delete all these uh  or  
Oh , next  . 
<laugh> 
Okay . Uh  
Yeah . 
And then after that we can make the user uh inter interface . 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Oh no it's it's okay . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah but this part isn't uh functioning properly . 
<laugh> It's a bit uh large . <laugh> 
 . 
L let's make first the the the all the views . The the front view , side view and the back view . 
Yeah . 
The middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand . 
Yeah the display , 
we yeah we can put a display . 
Yeah . 
The the arrow functions . Yeah . Yeah . 
<laugh> 
No it's it's uh it's okay . 
<laugh> You can make it m larger . 
Maybe it's easier to to draw uh  
<laugh> 
Yeah that's that's the basic idea . Yeah . 
Yeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit . 
That's the question . 
Yeah . 
From the  
Yeah I'm I'm  
May maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the L_C_D_ screen just into this this bubble . 
Because it do doesn't have to flip then . 
Because we have en enough space for for making a an L_C_D . 
Because here  
But why why do we need uh the flipping uh  
Okay . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Uh the the shape is okay but 
 yeah ? 
I don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping uh mechanism . 
Because we  
Okay yeah . It's it's for for for more trendy uh  
Because we have enough space . 
H here we got uh the basic functions , 
the the arrow uh yeah button . 
Yeah 
and then h we sh mm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , then it's  
No flipping or  
 you wanted the flipping so  
But if you if you  
If you drop it it it just breaks . 
And it has to be very strong because of the  . Yeah kind of  
And it's also for the for the children , it's yeah for people not sixteen years . 
But there are more  
Yeah okay . That's true . 
Okay . Yeah ? 
Okay wi 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> The Real Remote . 
<laugh> I think uh it's the sensors . 
Okay . 
Yep . 
Okay that's the side . 
Ah it's it's okay . 
But do we want uh options on the on the side with the with the buttons ? 
Or just leave it ? 
Uh could make an uh a volume button uh scroll , volume button . 
For menu . Or  
Yeah . No , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah you are going to design it so  <laugh>
