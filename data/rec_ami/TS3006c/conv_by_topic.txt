D:  Hello . 
A:   .  . 
D:  Yes , I made it . English from now on <laugh> . <cough> 
C:  <other>  . <laugh> Just kidding . 
D:  Drawing or  
A:  Yeah just testing . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm ? English .  . 
C:  So annoying . 
A:  Break is over . 
D:  Ooh it works . 
A:  Whoo . <laugh> Spicy . 
D:  <laugh> Spicy . 


D:  Where are are all the other presentations ? 
C:  I just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be  yeah I think so . Yeah , conceptual design . What or whatever does it  
D:  The conceptual or  Ah . Because I see only my own presentation <laugh>  yeah . 
C:  No no no , can you go back one ? 
B:  <cough> 
C:  Uh 'cause it has to be PowerPoint pre yeah components design , that's it . 
D:  This ?  I'll just put it in there . 
A:  So , he's coming . 
C:   . <other> I did get a bit more done than the last time , 'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the  
D:  Or not . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  Oh okay . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Ah , I can't cut and paste it into the other folder but  
A:  Ah . She  . You can look at the final report , 'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such , so I'm trying to write it down between everything else . 
D:  Move to meeting room . 
C:  <other> Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there , and also with  I don't know how to use PowerPoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh . 
D:  Yeah me too ,  . <laugh> <cough> 
B:  <laugh> I I've got the same problem as well . <cough> 
A:  <Vocal expression> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 


A:  Here we go again . Welcome . Uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh  f the remote control has to support . So who wants go . 
C:  Thi Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yes . Me first again or  yeah . Alright . Did you open it already or  no . Ah . 
C:  Who wants to start ? 
A:  Yes ? Yeah sure . Doesn't matter . 
B:  Oh . No . Yeah . No problem 
A:  No . 
D:  Ah . Yes . 


D:  So that was the marketing uh presentation . I had only one document left . 
C:  Yeah . And shall I go first ? So I  
B:  Yeah . No . I I don't mi I don't mind . That's  
D:  So kind of this  
A:  <Vocal noise> Yeah yeah sure . No . 
C:  Yeah ? 
B:  Do you want to go first ? Okay . <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> So a k a small example . Kind of this this look . Uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours I dunno . <laugh> Just made a quick design . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Cool . 
B:  It's better than than my uh drawing . <laugh> 
D:  Alright . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah you're just the user interface hmm ? 
C:  Alright . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah okay but I have to design the  


C:  Uh components . 
A:  Yeah layout . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Alright . So <other> I'm dealing with the components design . Um let's see . I uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products . And I used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design . That's why I had to , wanted to go first . Well they gave me um an idea about what people want . We're f mainly focusing on this group , but I want to make the distinction clear . Uh I could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so I don't have examples of how it looks like . But it comes down to what you uh what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking uh type . If you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh , which looks like fruits you know , you can  and shapes that are curved and not uh solid straight lines anymore . So this basically um yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier . 
C:  So that's the end of it . 


B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Okay . Yeah . 
D:  So  
C:  Uh go ahead . 
A:  'Kay next . 
A:  Uh  Okay . Can we uh  
B:  Yeah . One one uh very important thing I was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option . We were going to use that . Yeah . So um  <cough> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah um yeah that's one thing uh which I'm not sure uh of how to implement it uh into the remote control . 
C:  Design ? 
A:  Well the visual representation is not there with speech but you can  
B:  No okay but it has to be combined with with the menu uh for functions and  
A:  Yeah . Just  yeah . I think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present . So I don't think you have to design anything else for that . 
B:  So okay . Yeah . Okay . 
D:  Yeah with the programme . 
B:  But do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ? For for everything , also for the advanced options ? Okay . Uh we have this  very uh basic uh trendy design . Everybody says it so that's what's uh  yeah um  
A:  Both . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . That's yeah obvious . Um yeah . Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control . And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options . 
D:  And and the and the buttons that you need to control it , I guess . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Um yeah design has to be very attractive but that's your your op your  yeah .  <laugh> you have to uh delete this but this is the the the simple uh layout . Uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button . I'm  
A:  <laugh> Yeah . That would be the back . 
B:  The back . 
D:  Yeah . <other> Back and okay . 
A:  Back and okay . 
B:  Back and okay yeah . Uh  
A:  You did read the minutes I wrote ? You did read the minutes I wrote ? 
B:  What ? A little bit I think but not not everything w 
C:  I  
A:  Oh okay 'cause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were . So  
B:  Okay . Oh <laugh> I uh didn't read that . But  
A:  I hate doing work for nothing . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> But this is the the basic uh design uh for the for the m yeah for the buttons . Um  I wanted to to categorise everything . Uh with a speech display uh yeah , sound , everything you you noted in your uh minutes . Um every pushbutton has uh has its own uh LED light . So you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people . And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous  so that's an a also an option . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Um that was it . 
A:  <laugh> That was it ? Okay . Uh  
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:   again . Ugh . <other> 


C:  I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost , to be able to m 
A:  Too  . Uh I didn't get any info on this . So  
D:   . 
C:  So 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five Euro a piece . That's gonna be difficult huh ? 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  The cost of making it should be twelve and a half ? 
A:  I have total here . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah yeah yeah . 
A:  Yeah I don't know . I didn't get any information about that so  
B:   . We're going to produce it in uh China so it's no problem . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  <other> Child labour man , we love it . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah , so it's cheap . 
A:  Who doesn't . Uh let's see . Is there a new thing ? 
D:  Um well the interface type supplements . 
A:  Yeah the interface , maybe can  
B:  Uh it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options uh  yeah . 
A:  Ooh . No . Uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? And could you put that in the group folder ? Of the project folder . 
C:  Um let me see . Wait a sec . 
D:  If you go to your homepage or something , you should 
C:  Yeah I'm going there now . 
D:  get your own information . 
C:  Inspiration . 
D:  I got my fresh and fyoo fruity uh picture uh also uh over there , so  
A:  <laugh> Ah you didn't draw it yourself . <laugh> Ah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Well  
D:  No . <laugh> Too less time . 
C:  Um  yeah maybe it's  
D:  Yeah , also the menu . Yeah that that w 
B:  Yeah . This is the the menu I was uh looking uh at . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah I was thinking of that also , with with a with a uh arrow . So that indicates that there's an menu under that menu . 
C:  Maybe it's easier  
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Arrow . Yeah . 
B:  Arrow yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah perfect . 
D:  So  
B:  Yeah . 
A:   . 
C:  Maybe it's easier if you guys come over here . S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form uh yeah serves the function , you know . It's like really basic . But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that . 
A:  'S the target group . 
B:  S yeah . 
D:  Oh yeah . 
A:  Yeah sure . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 


A:  Okay with  Uh  Don't mean to discourage you but  uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . Next thirty minutes to design something so  
C:  Ah , right . 
D:  Alright . 
A:  And the  You will do the evaluation . 
D:  Of the product ? Which we don't have yet . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah uh about  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> So wh how should I do that ? 
A:  Yeah I don't know . <laugh> You probably get a mail . 
D:  Oh okay . Or you you or you send it to me . Or just  because you are going to design it on this board right ? 
A:  Yeah . Once they are finished . Yeah . Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation  you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . I don't know . 
D:  Yeah . I I probably get instruction on that , how to do that , so I make another presentation I guess . I kn I know what's gonna happen in in yeah so  
A:  Yeah . Yeah . About . Yeah . You have the basic idea . 
D:  I've a basic idea . 
A:  And you two uh are going to do this . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  So we're gonna work here ? On this sketchboard ? Alright . Thanks . 
A:  Look-and-feel and  Yeah . Good luck . <laugh> So I  uh make new page and uh be creative . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . Alright so that's uh  Yeah . 
C:  Alright . 
B:  But we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ? 
A:  Yeah you have uh thirty minutes . 
C:  Thirty minutes . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  Then we have to uh see something which we can uh 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about ? 
C:  Alright . 
A:  show to the management . 
C:  Yeah . Shall we uh make a new uh  
A:  I would yeah . 
B:  Yeah l let's just uh delete all these uh  or  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Next . 
D:   . 
C:  Yeah , I just <other> make a new one . Alright . 
B:  Oh , next  . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh and save this uh board . 
C:  Huh ? Yeah I'll just I'll just keep it there . 
A:  Just save it . Yeah okay but just press save and uh  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  It'll be fine . 
D:  On the left . S so , yeah . 
C:  Uh sorry . 
A:  <laugh> You can also include clip-art . <laugh> 
C:  Okay . Current colour ? So um  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  So if you'll rather draw in paint or something  <laugh> 
B:  Okay . Uh  


C:  Shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first ? Because <other> I I  
B:  Yeah . And then after that we can make the user uh inter interface . 
A:   then look . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah 'cause I have to uh focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . So how it's gonna look . And you have to think uh how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things . So if I'm drawing and you think okay I'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct . Uh do you mind if I draw in black then ? For normal sketches . 
D:  This ? 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh pretty accurate . Oh we skip this I guess . Sound  button press . 
B:  Yep . 
A:  Yeah . You can also include it . It's not much work . 
D:  Light only button user ca user interaction . 
B:  Oh no it's it's okay . 
C:   so we kind of want the girlish 
D:  <other> Yeah . 
A:  That's included . Yeah okay . 
D:  Yeah . So the pl the plastic plastic buttons also help uh because of um they are only lit during interaction . So  
C:  figure . I'm not so good at drawing . Excuse me ? 
D:  Well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't um , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on  when when they are usable . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  No uh uh . 
D:  Maybe you should draw it very large <laugh> like this . 
B:  Yeah but this part isn't uh functioning properly . 
A:  Yeah . Sensitive . 
D:  Oh right . 
C:  How do we uh uh or insert text ? 
D:  Erase ? 
A:  I dunno . Maybe just start typing . 
C:  <other> 
B:  <laugh> It's a bit uh large . <laugh> 
C:  <other> Oh that's a bit big . Yeah . <other> 
A:  You also do the other sides . Not only on the front si uh the top side but also the the side view . 
C:  Yeah . Ex exactly . 
B:   . L let's make first the the the all the views . The the front view , side view and the back view . 
C:  Uh  
A:  <other> Uh . <laugh> <other> 
C:  Uh I thought for the side view , that the w the basic section would be rather uh a bit thicker than the middle , where you're holding it with your  'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and  
A:  Jesus . What do I write down ? <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Why can't I work here ? This is much easier . <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  Much easier , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . The middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand . 
A:  Mm . 
D:  I don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but  
C:  <other> Exactly but the uh but the upper side has to be a bit more like that I think . 
A:  No so I just work here a few minutes . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  Yeah the display , we yeah we can put a display . 
C:  Uh don't you think ? So the display we will put in here , the basic uh functions in here , where it's most reachable . The  
B:  Yeah . The the arrow functions . Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  The th Exactly . Oh . This is hard . What do   don't have to draw it exactly do we ? 
B:  <laugh> No it's it's uh it's okay . 
C:  Wait . Let me try it one more time . Maybe I've uh  it's easier if I draw it in once . Okay , of course it will become way more ugly . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> You can make it m larger . Maybe it's easier to to draw uh  
C:  <other> Yeah . This'll take forever . It's fun to work with this pen . Um so , larger . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh . <other> Wrong one . 
B:  Yeah that's that's the basic idea . Yeah . 
C:  And  yeah . So side . 
A:  Five minutes left before the meeting ends . 
C:  'Kay . Um other views ? 
A:  <cough> 
D:  Alright . 
B:  Yeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit . 
C:  Uh  Yeah . 
B:  That's the question . 
C:  <other> Let's fill i fill in the buttons later . So this is gonna be from the 
D:  But we we  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  I is it  if if this is from the side  woah . Steady . Because there the screen goes up like that right ? So then it's like this , or  that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the  it's better to have it somewhat like this . Or does it flip all the way ? 
C:  uh from <other> yeah yeah . Sorry . 
B:  From the  
C:  Yeah . Yeah ? 
B:  Yeah I'm I'm  
C:  The the idea is that it has to flip up to here . 
B:  May maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the L_C_D_ screen just into this this bubble . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  Because it do doesn't have to flip then . Because we have en enough space for for making a an L_C_D . Because here  
C:  Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . 
D:  It's better to to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this . 
C:  True . 
B:  But why why do we need uh the flipping uh  
C:   you can adjust the angle to which it flips . So it can also from this angle , it can flip all the way up to there . You can flip it up to there if you want . 
B:  Okay . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . So w yeah . But we still keep the flipping mechanism . 
C:  Think so . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah we keep the flip ? Keep the flip live . 
C:  Yeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that  I dunno . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  <other> 
B:  Uh the the shape is okay but  yeah ? I don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping uh mechanism . Because we  
C:  <other> I thought it would be cool . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Okay yeah . It's it's for for for more trendy uh  
D:  Yeah but maybe  Yeah but maybe we we should then  
B:  Because we have enough space . H here we got uh the basic functions , the the arrow uh yeah button . 
D:  Yeah there the middle  Sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ? And then like i oh th <other> doh . 
B:  Yeah and then h we sh mm . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Come on . So this is the shape . Oh . It hasn't  
C:   . It doesn't aim so well . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Okay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen . So there's a layer of rubber on the side . So no flipping but just  no . 
B:  Yeah , then it's  
C:  Yeah yeah yeah . Definitely . 
A:  <cough> 
B:  No flipping or   you wanted the flipping so  
A:  No flipping ? 
C:  Yeah I guess but uh I mean most votes count right ? 
B:  But if you if you  If you drop it it it just breaks . And it has to be very strong because of the  . Yeah kind of  
D:  Throwing and the kinetics . Oh . We better make we better make it like this . Eventually . 
A:  It's shaking . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah true true . Yeah . Yeah if you if you're going for the kinetics  
A:  Yeah just light on top . 
B:  And it's also for the for the children , it's yeah for people not sixteen years . But there are more  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Safer . Mm . Yeah okay that  the target group . 
D:  Uh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control . Yes . 
B:  Yeah okay . That's true . Okay . Yeah ? 


A:  Well . I just uh ended the meeting . You two go design . 
C:  Yeah . I'm just thinking totally different designs also . Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy . Maybe we should try something like that . But yeah . 
B:  Okay wi 
A:  Oh . By the way . Um  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  <whistles> 
A:  <whistles> I uh thought up a name for our product . Yeah . It's called uh the Real Remote . 
D:  Yeah ? 
C:  Oh right . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Ooh . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> With a copyright sign after Real . <laugh> 
C:  Alright . 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> Alright . 
B:  <laugh> The Real Remote . 
C:  Yeah . I like it . Okay . This can go . 
A:  So maybe you can include that somewhere . 
D:  Good . Yeah . We should work in our own room right ? Or not ? 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Oh yeah we have to f uh include that in our design as well . 
A:  I don't see any power cables here so  
C:  Let's see . 
D:  Yeah . Yes . 
C:  What the hell's that ? 
B:  <laugh> I think uh it's the sensors . Okay . 
A:  'Kay . 
D:  See you two in half an hour uh  
C:  Uh  
A:  Good luck . <laugh> 
B:  Yep . 


B:  Okay that's the side . Ah it's it's okay . But do we want uh options on the on the side with the with the buttons ? 
C:  Yeah . I think we do . 
B:  Or just leave it ? Uh could make an uh a volume button uh scroll , volume button . 
D:  <other> 
C:  Yeah or j or also scrolling for the m yeah . Yeah ? 
B:  For menu . Or  
C:  I dunno . We w kind of wanted to stick with the  
B:  Yeah . No , yeah . 
C:  Yeah I'm just thinking , <other> if we i we wanna make something different right ? So the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons . 
A:  <whistles> 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  I think . 
B:  Mm . Yeah you are going to design it so  <laugh>
