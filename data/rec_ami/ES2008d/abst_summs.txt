A:  we're gonna use a kinetic battery um , 
A:  we want to use a simple chip , 
A:  we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved 
A:  and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu . 
B:  we made three different prototypes 
B:  our colours not  are not fixed , 
B:  Uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . 
B:  We have our up and down buttons , 
B:  which are also gonna be our channel selectors , 
B:  and we have our little menu button here . 
B:  If you push  if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if  uh the volume buttons rather . 
B:  If you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . 
B:  That's our number one prototype . 
A:  The little lightning bolt in it , very cute . 
C:  We call that one the rhombus , 
C:  Um this one is known as the potato , 
C:  It's an ergonomic shape , 
C:  Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . Um 
C:  the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . 
C:  So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here . 
C:  Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu 
D:  Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ? 
C:  it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your T_V_ off . 
B:  And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear , either way . 
B:  Um it's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . 
B:  Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top . 
B:  <laugh> And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , 
B:  plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up . 
B:  We figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if I made the bot the bottom flat . <laugh> 
C:  in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , 
C:  then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , 
C:  and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons 
B:  normally we'd go for fruity colours , 
B:  but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , 
D:  I sort of like this one , 
D:  it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking , 
D:  But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing 
A:  Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ?

abst_sum - abstract: The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented three prototypes which differed primarily in shape.

A:  but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost . 
B:  we were we were talking about that a little bit 
B:  and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it  it's not just like another piece of technology around your house . 
B:  It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen . 
B:  So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss  
A:  Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device 
A:  that like I dunno , you tape to your to your T_V_ 
A:  um that when you press it 
A:  a little light beep goes off ? 
C:  I think it would be difficult technologically , 
C:  and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else . 
B:  There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , 
B:  but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon . 
A:  Um we  so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now . 
A:  'cause  well , the designs are very bright , 
A:  so you're right , they're gonna stick out ,

abst_sum - abstract: The team felt it was not necessary to include a feature to prevent the remote from getting lost as the prototype designs were quite bright.

A:  Um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria , 
D:  I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for . 
D:  I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do , 
D:  I have to like write something on the whiteboard , so . 
A:  It's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing , 
C:  It makes look more fruity as well . 
A:  There it could have a stem like that , 
B:  is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? 
A:  Variety of colours are nice . 
A:  I think I'm leaning towards the potato . 
B:  that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one . 
C:  Potato . 
D:  some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . 
D:  what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately 
D:  rank each of the following things 
D:  and then I'll tabulate an average 
D:  and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven 
D:  with one being really extremely true 
D:  and seven being not true at all , or false , 
D:  First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective . 
D:  in my opinion the <other>  for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle 
D:  so I'm gonna say it's like a three . 
A:  I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two . 
B:  I dunno if fancy is the word I would use . 
D:  and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? 
D:  I think it's extremely functional , 
A:  I think it'll get everything done , 
A:  then I'm gonna give it a two . 
D:  Um is it technologically innovative ? 
D:  Mm . Not really , I mean not so much , 
D:  'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen , 
A:  the kinetic battery . 
B:  How many people would notice that , though ? 
D:  And if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty cool . 
A:  Think I'm gonna go with the four as well . 
D:  Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality 
D:  and <laugh> if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I  it's spongy all the way . <laugh> 
A:  Give it a one . 
D:  and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables <laugh> ? 
D:  is it gonna be yellow ? 
B:  We might wanna keep it yellow . 
A:  I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , 
A:  but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in  and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one 
A:  and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that's more fruity . 
A:  Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something ? 
B:  it was inspired by the potato , 
B:  so I think it's pretty fruity . 
A:  I think i it's kind of mangoey too . 
B:  That's a much more trendy than a potato <laugh> 
D:  um , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? 
D:  Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons , 
D:  so I'm gonna give it a one . 
D:  also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing . 
D:  Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ? 
D:  I think I'll give it a two , 
A:  And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing , 
D:  And the ease of learning it . 
B:  The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , 
B:  but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards . 
B:  So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess . 
C:  because you have to you have to use the menu system 
C:  and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are 
C:  and that could take a bit of learning at first , 
C:  So I'd I'd give it a four . 
D:  also earlier we had something about losing it 
D:  and so now we're not addressing that at all , 
A:  I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , 
D:  I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four , 
D:  <other> how w how well does it address just being simple ? 
D:  Um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple , 
B:  I'm  give it a three I guess . 
D:  and fashionable ? 
A:  It's totally fashionable . 
D:  I think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well . 
D:  And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , that whole thing ? 
A:  if we offer in a  in at least three different colour arrangements . 
A:  So I'll give it a a two  . 
A:  we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , 
A:  so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it . 
B:  I think all of them should have an R_R_ .
