Right , 
do you wanna start ? 
Okay , 
um  
What  
We call that one the rhombus , 
uh the rhombus . 
Um this one is known as the potato , 
uh it's 
it's a <laugh> 
how can I present it ? 
It's an ergonomic shape , 
so it it fits in your hand nicely . Um 
it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand . 
Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . Um 
the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . 
So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here . 
Um the red ones are for uh changing channels , 
channel up and channel down 
and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected . 
Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu 
and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select 
and that's basically it , that's the potato . 
Uh that would be one of your channels , basically , 
so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off , 
yeah . 
Um not really , 
it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your T_V_ off . 
Yeah yeah , that that'd be one way of doing it , yeah . That'd work , yeah . 
Let's pass . 
So that's  
So that's our three prototypes . 
Um basically , 
in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , 
then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , 
and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons 
and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever . 
Would  
Yeah , 
but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy  . 
Yeah . 
I think it would be difficult technologically , 
because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee 
and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it , 
s so it's  
I'm not quite sure how it would work 
and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else . 
Uh I mean 
ho how many times do you really , seriously lose your remote control 
and would would a device like that actually help you to find it ? 
Yeah , it's possible , yeah , yeah . 
<laugh> Put an extra the button on  <laugh> . 
<laugh> Cool . 
<laugh> 
It makes look more fruity as well . 
It's like a deformed foot , 
I dunno . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
This is , it's  
the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices . 
You find the choice that you want 
and you press uh you press the right button uh . 
Yeah . Yeah , so they're used for going into and out of your submenus , yeah . 
Potato . 
I'll go for two . 
I think it's it's functional , 
it's also pretty basic , 
so I'll give it a two . 
I'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique , 
I mean it's it's just  it is just pushbuttons um , 
so I I'd give it a four . 
I'll say one . 
<laugh> 
I wonder if it bounces when you drop it . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
I'd I'd give it a one . 
Uh um <laugh> . 
Yeah . 
 
Yeah ,   
Yeah . 
Mangoey is better , yeah . 
I like mangoes <laugh> . 
Uh two . 
Uh one . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah 
I'll I'll say two . 
I think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn , 
because you have to you have to use the menu system 
and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are 
and that could take a bit of learning at first , 
but 
once you've , yeah once you'd learned how to use it , I think it is a lot easier . 
So I'd I'd give it a four . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Um I'll give it a five 
'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that , yeah . 
I'll give it a two . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Three . 
Guess it's double-curved . 
It is pretty curvy . 
Special colours , 
isn't it ? 
We've got five  . 
Oh  
six . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
What was our target price again ? 
Twelve point five . 
So we're just just about there . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> I think we've been successful 
in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set  
and we've come up with a finished project 
and we just about got  cost . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
That's cool . 
Let's all let's all go for the yellow   
Break the stem off . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> That was bound to happen 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Mm 
. Yeah 
. I think . Yeah 
. We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much 
. 
<other> Yeah 
. Uh we we worked together 
, um but we were 
making 
like we sort of made different 
shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work 
, um and how we could like improve on the on the design 
. I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time 
, and second we 
actually we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings 
. And I  
<laugh> I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided 
. But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points  at the end of the meetings 
, so that we we knew where to go on from there 
. Yeah 
. Yeah , for some of the meetings , yeah 
. Yeah 
. Yeah 
. Yeah 
. 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <other> Yeah 
. 
<laugh>
