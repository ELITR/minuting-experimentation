Right , well 
we made three different prototypes 
and I guess we'll start with with this one . 
Um we have 
our colours not  are not fixed , 
but this is the general shape . 
Um it's  
you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand 
or you switch it over 
and uh it's easily adaptable to either hand . 
You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , 
or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , 
or even  
I mean there's a whole variety , 
you can hold it like this 
and press it with your same index finger . 
Uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . 
We have our up and down buttons , 
which are also gonna be our channel selectors , 
and we have our little menu button here . 
If you push  if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if  uh the volume buttons rather . 
If you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . 
If we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your T_V_ channel choices shows up , 
and you have your five presets down here . 
Um if people wanna grab hold of that , 
see how it feels in your hand . 
That's our number one prototype . 
Um do you wanna present the potato , 
or shall I present the Martian ? 
That's the rhombus , yep . 
<laugh> 
 
If you pressed and held it maybe . 
Yeah . On off , that's a possibility , yeah . 
And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear , either way . 
Um it's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . 
Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top . 
<laugh> We have the five preset seeds <laugh> . 
<laugh> And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , 
you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle . 
So , 
that's for your consideration as well , 
plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up . 
We figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if I made the bot the bottom flat . <laugh> 
<laugh> Uh the menu select button . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
We were we were thinking that 
normally we'd go for fruity colours , 
but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , 
so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down , 
maybe with with less contrasts on it . 
Yeah , 
something still a little bright to make it hard to lose , but  
 yeah . 
Right . Well 
we were we were talking about that a little bit 
when we got that email 
and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it  it's not just like another piece of technology around your house . 
It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen . 
So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss  
I think  
Yeah . 
There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , 
but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon . 
So d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality ? Um . 
Mm yeah , 
that's good , that's good . 
Here , 
stick it on . 
<laugh> 
So 
where  
<other> 
Right . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Ooh . 
<laugh> 
Hey . 
<other> 
No , 
I kinda like it . 
That's hard to miss . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <laugh>  <laugh> 
<laugh> Like  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Interesting . 
Okay , 
is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? 
I like the idea of the  
I mean 
that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one . 
Hmm . 
Well 
that  
on the iPod , for example , you just  every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again 
and it brings you back one level . 
Good point . 
<other> Maybe  
yeah , 
maybe it can be one of those , 
if you press down and hold 
for two seconds , then it brings you back one level or something . 
The potato ? Are we leaning towards the potato ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Um I dunno if it's 
it's creative . 
I dunno if fancy is the word I would use . 
I dunno if any of them are fancy 
in  
I'd say two , 
because c unique . 
Yeah , 
one . 
<other> In the battery , that's it . 
How many people would notice that , though ? 
Yeah . 
I I would say that it's  
Yeah , 
like fancy versus creative it's it's different . 
But does that equal innovative ? 
I dunno . 
I'll give it a three . 
Okay . 
Um I'll give it a one . 
Pretty hard to mess up . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Ooh , 
that you couldn't  
it'd be harder to break , 
harder to lose . <laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
It it might be , 
'cause that's our corporate colour , 
isn't it ? 
We might wanna keep it yellow . 
Yeah . 
If we had a yellow  
Sure . 
So <other> 
it was inspired by the potato , 
so I think it's pretty fruity . 
Oh , mango 
that that <laugh>  
That's a much more trendy than a potato <laugh> 
one . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , me too . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I'll I'll say two as well . 
Because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first , 
but  
The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , 
but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards . 
So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess . 
Oh , 
good point . 
<other> 
<other> 
Um I'd say I'd give it uh a three , 
I guess it depends on how tidy you are normally . 
Simple to use or simple in design ? Do you know ? 
<other> 
Right . 
I'm  give it a three I guess . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> I dunno . 
I don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot remote 
or alien or whatever he was . 
<laugh> 
Um two . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I'll say two . 
Shall we uh  
Well 
I think all of them should have an R_R_ . 
Oh my . <laugh> 
Uh we're n using kinetic , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Single . 
Simple , simple rather . 
Uh uh uh double-curved . 
Yeah 
I never did get a picture of those 
so I don't really know . 
Our case material supplements  
oops , 
we just skipped by them . 
No , 
we we  the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed . 
The supplement is  
Oh , 
I guess it was rubber rather than latex . 
Yeah . 
Uh well  
I don't know what the se the basic colour is though . 
Well , 
are we talking about on each colour combination 
or are we , 
you know , 
we'll  
like we'll have yellow and black . 
Is that two special colours ? 
Or or is white and black , then two more or <other>  
Uh . I guess it's three , 
three 
three  . 
Alright . 
Yeah . 
Six , with the power . 
Yeah . 
No . 
Oh , 
we'll  do we wa 
Are the buttons in special colour , 
special f 
I didn't get information on  
Well , 
does it  
but if we're making multiple varieties of  this is where I'm getting confused . 
 per unit , okay , okay . 
Alright , 
and each button s 
Yeah , okay . 
No , 
I think they're fine . 
Material , we want them rubber as well probably , yeah . 
No , I don't think so . 
I think they're  
if they're all gonna be rubber then it  that's what it matters . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Oh oh . 
Okay , 
let's have our buttons all be one colour . 
<other> Alright . 
Uh . 
We have no idea . 
I dunno , 
I didn't get any pictures . 
<laugh> It's single curved . 
Why not ? 
Yeah . 
That is important . 
How did it get more expensive , 
what did you just change ? 
It was it was thirteen 
and now it's fifteen . 
<other> 
Twelve point five . 
Hey hey . 
We're all set then . 
Ish . 
Alright . 
Yes . 
Well . 
I felt very creative . <laugh> 
I enjoyed making the prototypes . 
Yeah . 
I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information , 
like what's a single-curved case , 
how many colours , 
what do colours count 
things , 
but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well . 
Um I think we worked together pretty well . 
Yeah  . 
<laugh> But the fruits and vegetables , they really  my creativity , so . 
<laugh> Do you think we could  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Can we market this as the mango remote ? 
Should we have that somewhere on the packaging ? 
I have a little R_R_ . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yes . 
Hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point 
but um it's quite a useful little gadget . 
All thanks to Iain for the design of that one . 
Mm . What did we find for new ideas ? 
People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables . 
I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them . 
That was  
I I knew you can get watches that had them , like really quite expensive watches 
that just never need a battery , 
'cause you're always moving your wrist . 
But in other things , I think it'd be really good . 
Yes . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> It started because I wanted to have it as st as a stem 
and then <laugh>  
alright , so  
<laugh> 
<laugh> Is  it started as a pear , 
but then it started looking more and more like a Martian 
when I put the  
<laugh> Take me to your leader . <laugh> 
 
Wow , 
maybe I should market it to some remote control company now . 
So are are  <laugh> 
poor little thing . <laugh> 
Oh . 
<laugh> It's really funny that you got spam in your work emails . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> <other> Let's see , 
what did I get through the corporate website ? 
It's just inspiration about circuit boards . 
Yeah , that is pretty neat . 
Yeah , 
my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit , talking about circuit boards . 
I learned a lot actually . 
I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to . 
Now I have all about circuits and chips and transponders 
and  
I wrote it all down , 
because I thought it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control , 
but then they're like , you don't actually need this  
you just need to talk about the case . 
It's really interesting though . 
Yeah . 
That was really neat how I got emails 
and  
No . 
I  
yeah . 
If I'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case , the different looks of the case , I would have probably drawn them up , 
but  
Yeah , 
we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it , 
but with only four people it doesn't really make sense . 
I think if you had a larger group  
Yeah . 
Because we're all gonna be working in different places . 
We  
if we were all gonna stay in here all the time , then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright , 
but everyone needs their own , like specific notes , I guess . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So 
it was a bit of both really , 
we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and just fooling around with it 
and I came up with that rhombus shape 
and he came up with the sort of potatoey , mangoey shape , 
and then just went from there really . 
It was fun . 
<laugh> <laugh> So 
well done with the management , I felt well managed . 
<laugh> That happened to me all the time though . 
Yeah , 
I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting  we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions , 
but we were able to do it regardless , 
so . 
I'm not usually a very decisive person , 
so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes . 
Especially last time , 
yeah . 
Yeah ,   
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Right . 
And I I felt the first two meetings , that I was coming in with no information , 
and not sort of 
made me really like , ooh I don't know <laugh> , throwing together PowerPoint out of no no information 
and then last time it was like the opposite . 
I had so much information and so much to talk about . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
 that was something 
like 
 in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and <laugh> things like  
Yeah . 
I think we were  
Yeah . 
I think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task <laugh> . 
I think we really got into it , 
I mean I got into it as the day went on 
and I got really like , ooh I'm designing a remote control , 
I dunno if that's just me , 
but  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you won't lose them . 
I dunno . I mean 
we were talking about it and like i in my household at least , there's only about two places that the remote is ever 
'cause there's only one T_V_ 
and 
there's only like three chairs . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
or like I guess what the setup of the house is too . 
But , I mean  I am notorious for losing my keys , 
I just  
I guess I've just never lost the remote . 
I put my keys in the refrigerator the other night <laugh> 
and couldn't find them . 
'Cause I was putting groceries away . 
You you're taking stuff from a bag 
and putting them in the refrigerator 
and then go back to my room . 
Can't get in , 
look all around the kitchen . 
Definitely in the vegetable drawer . 
So <laugh> . 
Mm . 
But I guess it's 'cause we don't carry remotes around that much . 
Yeah . 
Maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a  robot , alien , pear , whatever he is , have a little voice like , I am located  
Oh 
a G_P_S_ system , <laugh> internal G_P_S_ . 
Although if it's sitting still for too long . 
<laugh> Yes I  
<laugh>  
Or little  
<laugh> <other> Or just just a wheel , you know . 
Just if you  <other> 
like 
you'd have a remote for your remote , 
that'll  . 
<laugh> 
 zoom  
Yeah . 
Hmm . All kinds of possibilities . 
Yeah . 
Oh . 
Wow . 
'Cause you've had like the most typing and organising to do . 
Yeah , I guess  
How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you , 
every meeting . 
Oh . 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
I didn't even think about adding slides , 
'cause I would just get slides with titles on them 
and fill them all 
in w 
didn't even think about adding more . 
Ah yeah. . 
Right . 
No , no , definitely not . 
We <laugh>  
<laugh> No , I don't think we need to  
I think the R_ and R_ , especially if the yellow and black one . 
Or yellow and blue . 
Lemme go to the web page . 
Finish meeting now . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Yeah . 
I guess it i it sort of a grey , 
isn't it ? 
Yellow and grey , 
but then the slogan's in blue . 
Yeah . 
Well 
we don't have the right colour clay anyway . 
Well 
we're not , sadly , going to actually be producing this , so <laugh> . 
<laugh> Potato mango shaped remotes . 
<laugh> 
I can't believe a whole day is gone . 
I don't feel like it's been that long . 
Get sucked in . 
Mm I haven't gotten questionnaire eight yet .
