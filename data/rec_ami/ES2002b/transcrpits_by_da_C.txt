<other> 
<other> I'll go first . 
Alright um , 
 so this is the technical functions design . 
Um <other>  
can I st steal this from the back of your laptop ? Uh  
Right  
to do the um <other> the design I have I've had a look online , I've had a look at the homepage , 
which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products . 
Um I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer 
and um I would like to ask you guys for um <other> your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . 
Um unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so  
Um , having a look at the existing products , I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes , 
there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing . 
<other> Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad . 
Um there's an example I'll show you at the end , 
um  sh show you now . 
Uh  <other> 
 here um the button there and there . 
This one's prog . 
Sorry . 
That one's perg and that one's prog , 
and it doesn't really tell you what it does . 
Um , not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example . 
Um it's a very simple one . 
It's got only the basic functions mm 
but um <other> it's the same size as the the hard to use one . 
<other> Uh it looked a bit clunky . 
They're very big and not very much use for  buttons . 
<other> Um , <other> 
and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . 
There's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button . 
Um , my own preferences , I prefer the the clunky one . 
Um it's very easy to use . 
Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions 
which I I quite like having on the controls . 
<other> Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , 
or something like tha  from the bottom of it . 
So , <other> now I'd like to ask for your preferences . 
Um not sure of how long we've got , uh  
<other> Um , the clunky one is the one on the right . 
Um I think it's supposed to be the same size , but um it's got much fewer buttons . 
It's , you know , it's very spread out 
, I get the idea it'd be sort of about this size . 
<other>  got very few buttons on it and  
and kind of  you know 
Um , <other> do we have any functions that um we'd want on it ? 
I mean so far I've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . 
Um they're just the the very basics you could use for a T_V_ . 
Okay . 
Um , you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ? 
Would you like 
um the channels like the the numbers on thing , um  
Um  
Um , yeah . 
Uh , to start with um sort of a bit both , 
um we need to find out exactly what we have to have 
um and after that we can add things if they're possible . 
There's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . 
<other> Do you want to switch places ? 
Just just switch them . 
Think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose . 
Um  
Well , did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? 
Sort of the the older group . 
Uh f 
Yeah . 
I reckon one problem with speech recognition is 
so you end up yelling at the control for hours . 
<other> 
Channel up . 
um I've actually seen one of them used 
and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , 
Um  <other> 
I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in . 
Um . 
I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . 
Um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel . 
Ta . 
Um 
I think we include mute , 
but apart from that um I think we just  we'll go for the simpleness . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Um just about the three buckets , um what would go in the the device functions one ? 
Um
