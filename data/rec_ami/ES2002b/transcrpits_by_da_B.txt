Is that alright now ? 
<other> Okay . 
Sorry ? 
Okay , everybody all set to start the meeting ? 
Okay , we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design . 
All ready to go ? 
Okay . 
Um so hopefully you've all been working away , 
and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . 
Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time . 
Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment 
and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s 
Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , 
which is the  The first one <other> is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . 
Nobody uses teletext very much anymore , 
so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the  of the remote control . 
Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else . 
I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . 
So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . 
And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . 
Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is . 
It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere . 
Well that's the thing , I'm I'm not sure um 
<other> uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say  
Uh something  
Yeah , 
I mean do they  <other> Is that something they want actually written on it , 
'cause it's quite long . 
Um or yeah , just the idea , but I'm not sure . 
So that's something we can discuss as well . 
So those are the three things , 
just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the T_V_ , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company . 
, or do you want me to recap at all ? 
Right um , 
time for presentations then . 
Who would like to go first ? 
Um so is everybody okay with any of that 
Okay , cool . 
Oh yeah , of course , yeah . 
G go on ahead . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> Okay . 
<other> Alright  . 
Oop . 
Um . 
Well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so I think at at most . 
Just a couple of minutes anyway . 
Mm-hmm . 
Shall we sh 
well we'll stick to kind of your area for now . 
Yeah . 
Looks kind of  Yeah . 
Well I think it's a valid point . 
I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated , 
and that P_R_T_ p P_R_O_T_ thing is incredibly confusing . 
Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , 
but yeah you don't want to lose out on , you know , what it does , 
Mm-hmm . 
Uh-huh . 
so maybe you know 
you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open , 
I think that's a good idea . 
I think it's a good idea . <other> 
Uh-huh , 
and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah . 
God , I wou I would say that's required , 
I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , 
I mean would anybody disagree with that ? 
Um , what else , uh  
<other> So don't need to worry about teletext , 
don't need to worry about V_C_R_ , 
uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about , 
you know like brightness and contrast ? 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
I think  are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay , right . 
Well , do you wanna maybe just , at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this . 
Um , so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and  
Right okay . 
Um  
Mm-hmm yeah . 
Oka 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Uh well , just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section  
Have I just lost  
Oh no . 
Um , uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements , 
and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , 
maybe like a mute button , 
that sort of thing . 
Any of  you anything to add to that at all ? 
No . 
Okay , right . 
Um okay , 
if we can move on to next presentation then please . Um 
Do you wanna  
Probably not , actually . 
 
Yeah . 
<laugh>  bit complicated . 
It'd be nice if everything was wireless , wouldn't it ? 
Right . 
Oh , like overlap between what you said ? 
Oh well , for all you know that  that'll happen . 
Mm hard to know what  where your role ends , yeah . 
Okay . 
Uh pr yeah , press function and F_ eight , yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah , you wanna  
Oh oh here we go . 
There you go . 
Um  
Okay . 
Right . 
Can you um  
Right , okay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Repetitive strain injury . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
So want something that looks good and is easy to use , 
big priorities . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
So it  you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . 
That's  
I think it's a good idea . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . Right . 
<other> Well , um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um  who's our our target audience , our target market . 
Um , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? 
I mean <other>  
Yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend . 
Well i if if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine , 
well I don't  
I'm not really sure how much that will retail at . 
But you want  
it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , 
they're gonna actually go out and buy one . 
So , who do you think we're aiming this at ? 
<other> It's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , I think . 
Yeah , 
okay . 
<other> 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
yeah . 
Okay 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then ? 
<other> Yeah , okay . 
Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? 
What what do you think , Craig ? 
N yeah . 
I think we are gonna have to narrow it down , 
to say let's target these people and give them what they want 
and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . 
So um anybody  anything there to add  
Just kind of young professionals , 
uh th like <other> 
if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . 
So we could say that was our target . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . 
You know , they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . 
That that's that's a good point . 
Um okay , so um  
so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition 
if we can . 
Okay . 
Why is that ? 
Okay . 
Where you can activate it and deactivate it ? 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Uh-huh . 
Okay . 
Uh okay , 
well do you wanna um give us your presentation 
and then then we can  
I don't know  
um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , 
but this is this is how we're  
Yeah , exactly , yeah . 
Oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well 
is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well . 
Um . 
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Really ? 
Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ? 
Mm . Course not . 
There you go . 
Right . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Uh-huh . 
Hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Uh . 
Well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ? 
Are you are you all done ? 
Mm . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Right . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Oh . So this just show how we're kind of modularising the whole thing . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market , 
so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface 
and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it 
um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red , 
so we could stay with tha 
Mm-hmm 
<other> Oh , yeah . 
Yeah , mm-hmm . <cough> 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
W 
Yeah . 
W Well well we've um  
In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ , 
so that's what we should do for now I think . 
Something I was wondering about was the power . 
Um , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? 
I mean is that something we really want to go into , do you think , 
or should we just consider running on regular batteries ? 
Uh-huh . 
Uh-huh . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay , 
so  
Yeah . 
Okay , so just stick to to regular  
Okay . 
Um , right . 
So basically the um  
I'm just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start , 
was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at , 
and what exactly the product's gonna do . 
So um just to recap on  
Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? 
Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . 
Do you wanna recap on that , Craig ? 
<cough> 
Okay , right . 
Okay . 
Yeah , it's as optional functions . 
Okay . <other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Okay , right . 
Um , okay well 
I gotta kind of  got five minutes to wrap up now . 
Um next thing we're doing is having lunch . 
Whoohoo . 
Um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage . 
Um so I'll be putting the minutes of this uh this meeting into the project documents folder . 
Um so uh I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next  well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , 
um for uh our Industrial Designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . 
Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , 
and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . 
Um and you'll all get specific instructions as well . 
So um I dunno , 
just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking . 
Um , do you wanna start with David . 
Anything else to say at all ? 
No , okay . 
<other> Andrew ? 
Yeah , yeah I think that's definitely a good idea . 
Uh-huh . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay , 
so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume  hi 
Okay . 
Okay , 
and then visual  
Okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that , 
and then just actual device things , 
like what channel you're watching , turning on an off , 
stuff like that . 
Okay , um  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
<other> Okay . 
Um so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good , 
because of who we're we're , you know , targeting this at . 
Um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe . 
Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold , 
you know , things like that . 
Um , <other> 
so I guess I guess that's it . 
That's the meeting over . 
Whoohoo .
