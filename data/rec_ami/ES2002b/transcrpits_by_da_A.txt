Mm yeah . 
Nope , we're all set . 
Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. . 
Okay . 
<cough> 
<cough> 
<cough> 
No . 
I'll add it later , I guess  the presentation . 
<cough> 
No . No . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Um function F_ eight . 
Function , the blue button . Next to the control on the left . 
Yeah . 
You have to push it together . 
Yep . 
Nope . 
Try that again . 
Wait . 
Yep , there we go . 
 
Increase that 'cause we can't see the  
That's much better . 
There you go . 
Bouncing on top . <laugh> 
Is installing a new remote control something that people  
Um , I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . 
'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? 
Is that too  
is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? 
Right . 
Um so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . 
Kind of . 
You know how much ? 
I dunno 
I guess you pay , what , ten ten quid for a remote ? 
Like a simple replacement , right . 
I mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get , 
would you  
how much would you pay ? 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well 
because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology . 
Yeah . 
I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer , 
who are familiar with their  with computers in in their everyday work . 
I think people who are maybe about  I wouldn't say thirty five , 
but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that . 
So these are people who are gadgety , right ? 
People who are u growing up used to , you know in schools and in universities , 
when you go on to their working lives , 
people who would you know regular 
Yeah . Yeah . Mm . 
<cough> 
I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , 
because um , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple . 
You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use . 
Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . 
Um , 
but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , 
rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . 
So maybe we should  
I suggest that we think about speech recognition , 
anyway it's a  it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , 
but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . 
Okay , sure . 
<laugh> 
Sorry , 
do you mind passing me my notepad . 
Thanks . 
Cool , 
um . Okay . Um . 
Well this is just the working design um . 
Well this is just what  how I would go about it . 
Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , 
try to define what we're trying to get done . 
Um I think in a practical way , we kind of know what it is . 
We've used it , 
we're familiar with it , 
but we're  we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like  
Besides the basics , 
I think back  in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . 
Has to change channels , has to change volume , 
but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . 
Um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ? 
Um and I just  
the idea is just to get everybody to um  
I usually <other> have a have have a design that's there as a basic , 
so , you know , things that  to start everything going . 
But I guess everybody does have some idea , 
so I don't think um there's a need for that . 
Um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing , 
so I'll go into the diagram first . 
It just explains how the process goes through , 
from a  
from the basic technology point of view , 
the basic steps that you need 
um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . 
Um okay , 
you need some power source . 
'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going . 
Um and that power source is important 
because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . 
Um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies 
um how far you can transmit the signal 
or the complexity of the functions that you want . 
Like for example , voice recognition , right . 
That might be constrained because that  you might need to power a microphone , 
you might need to power other things , 
so that's one perhaps constraint there . 
Um 
<other> Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface 
where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever . 
You know , and that um picks up an input from a user , 
um uh a logic  
a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , 
and the device has to r you know , based on you push button A_ , so I will do something with button A_ . 
So maybe button A_ is the power button , okay . 
Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself 
which is the receiver here . 
Um and I think that's about it in terms of my design um . 
It's fairly general , 
um and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking , 
like um voice recognition , right , 
um , 
if it's something which is important then we just add more power 
rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . 
So it's not really a constraint in that sense , 
but I mean these are functionally , you know , the base , 
what the technology has to do . 
Um so I guess the rest of it  
I think we should 
maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ? 
I think that's more relevant to a discussion ? 
Yeah , w I'm done . 
More or less . 
Yeah . 
Ps Oh , it's just putting the rest of it into words , 
but it's essentially the same thing . 
Um you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , 
you know , stuff like that . 
Um  
I guess this would be  
Yep . 
Um , these these aren't technology options in that sense . 
This is just um 
a basic principles and basic components that are needed . 
For example , if you needed um if you needed to add uh a voice recognition , right , then your user interface would be split , 
broken down into more components , right , 
which you have a microphone , the V_R_ and stuff like that . 
Uh 
Yep . Yep . 
So each component represents one function , 
but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , um and the receiver , okay , 
and the power are things that you won't have to care about . 
Um and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it . 
Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example . 
Okay , um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ? 
Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . Right . 
Yep . 
There might be one other problem with the transmission , 
um in particular right now , since we're talking about voice recognition . 
Um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . 
I it  
you may not require that , 
but you know , um it's it's 
it's something very natural , I guess , you know , to hold it , to signal to the user , 
and push a button maybe to start s talking about it . 
Then you need to send the signal out , 
so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . 
So in that sense , there's not really a restriction 
but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process . 
Not so much further down . 
There's there's not much specific specific information , 
but I think that um one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices . 
Because infra-red is something which everybody has . 
<cough> 
There's a there's  
Okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , 
and you add cost to it , 
um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . 
You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge . 
Or you need to get the user to plug it in . 
Um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . 
But unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries , 
like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month , 
then I don't think rechargeable is something we should  you know , we really need to care about . 
Um . 
<cough> 
Okay , I think 
<cough> 
<other> 
Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? 
Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . 
One would be audio controls , 
one would be video controls , 
and the other one would be a device . 
Um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially , 
but I think that um from a manufacturer's point of view , from a person designing the device , 
but I think from a point of view of a person using the device , you know a T_V_ is something they see and something they hear , 
um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . 
I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , 
like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , 
and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . 
I mean it might help with the visualisation . 
And it would actually help with the component build as well . 
Mm no , not really . 
Mm . 
Um things like on off . 
Because they don't have anything to do with what you see . 
I me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value , 
you know , um so um  
And channel . 
Because the on off also goes , you know , like on off like power , not on off sound . 
Not on off video . 
Although you don't turn off the video on your T_V_ , 
but um you might wanna you know turn off the sound , 
say you wanna pick up the phone , 
there's a mute button , right , 
so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device . 
Device is basically anything which we can't categorise , right . 
We put it out . 
Yeah , 
anything to do with what you hear , right . 
You you put that into audio . 
And then video is anything that you can see . 
Um . 
Yep . 
Yep . 
Yep . 
Like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there . 
Um even even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind . 
It's easy to use , I think 
that's one thing that um  
and I guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well 
'cause things are like fixed . <laugh>
