B:  Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , 
B:  which is the  The first one <other> is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . 
B:  so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the  of the remote control . 
B:  Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else . 
B:  I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . 
B:  So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . 
B:  And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . 
B:  Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is . 
B:  It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere . 
D:  And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? 
B:  <other> uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say  
D:  'Bout putting the fashion in electronics . 
B:  I mean do they  <other> Is that something they want actually written on it , 
B:  'cause it's quite long . 
B:  So those are the three things , 
B:  just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the T_V_ , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company . 
abst_sum - abstract: The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to consider when designing the remote.

C:   so this is the technical functions design . 
C:  to do the um <other> the design I have I've had a look online , I've had a look at the homepage , 
C:  Um I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer 
C:  Um , having a look at the existing products , I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes , 
C:  there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing . 
C:  <other> Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad . 
C:   here um the button there and there . 
C:  That one's perg and that one's prog , 
C:  and it doesn't really tell you what it does . 
C:  Um , not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example . 
C:  Um it's a very simple one . 
C:  It's got only the basic functions mm 
C:  but um <other> it's the same size as the the hard to use one . 
C:  <other> Uh it looked a bit clunky . 
C:  They're very big and not very much use for  buttons . 
C:  and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . 
C:  Um , my own preferences , I prefer the the clunky one . 
C:  <other> Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , 
C:  So , <other> now I'd like to ask for your preferences . 
A:  Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. . 
C:  <other> Um , the clunky one is the one on the right . 
C:  Um I think it's supposed to be the same size , but um it's got much fewer buttons . 
D:  and then others that are concealed . 
abst_sum - abstract: The user interface designer presented two existing products and discussed what was wrong with each product.

B:  Well I think it's a valid point . 
B:  I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated , 
B:  Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , 
B:  you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open , 
C:  Um , <other> do we have any functions that um we'd want on it ? 
C:  I mean so far I've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . 
B:  and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah . 
C:  Um , you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ? 
B:  God , I wou I would say that's required , 
B:  I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , 
B:  uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about , 
D:  Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . 
D:  We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? 
C:  um we need to find out exactly what we have to have 
C:  um and after that we can add things if they're possible . 
C:  There's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . 
B:  Um , so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and  
D:  Well , one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , 
D:  so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . 
D:  Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . 
D:  For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . 
D:  Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um , 
D:  things like channel and volume um are used all the time , 
D:  so we just have them right out on top , 
D:  Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , 
D:  you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . 
B:  and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , 
B:  maybe like a mute button , 
abst_sum - abstract: The team discussed how to create a remote which did not include the problems present in the existing products presented by the interface specialist.

D:  I dunno whether this is for good or for bad 
D:  but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh <laugh> the things . 
D:  what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here 
D:  so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine , 
D:  Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that I've been  
B:  Mm hard to know what  where your role ends , yeah . 
D:  Before I bring this up what I'll just say is um what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's  now becomes a collective thing . 
D:  And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide 
D:  So what I basically got is I just looked into some information 
D:  and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it 
D:  and what kind of decisions we could take away from it 
D:  So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , 
D:  and what are issues with with um existing products . 
D:  and also about  try and connect that as you see with the company vision 
D:  So this is what I've found here , 
D:  Um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . 
D:  Most people find them ugly . 
D:  Um <other> the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , 
D:  we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . 
D:  Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . 
D:  they tend to use the most simple controls 
D:  if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know , 
D:  one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . 
D:  And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . 
D:  They get lost a lot , 
D:  Um , takes time to learn how to use them . 
D:  and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for . 
D:  uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . 
D:  Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . 
D:  if that's possible we might consider getting into it . 
D:  I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be  wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy . 
D:  You know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics . 
B:  So it  you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . 
D:  my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it . 
D:  Um I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , 
B:  <other> Well , um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um  who's our our target audience , our target market . 
B:  Um , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? 
D:  Where's the money , maybe . 
B:  Yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend . 
B:  it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , 
A:  Um , I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . 
A:  Um so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . 
A:  'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? 
A:  is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? 
D:  Mostly focused around the twenty five age group . 
D:  Sort of young professional , kind of . Mm-hmm 
B:  Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? 
D:  It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying , 
B:  I think we are gonna have to narrow it down , 
B:  and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . 
B:  if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . 
A:  I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well 
B:  Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . 
A:  So these are people who are gadgety , right ? 
B:  So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . 
B:  so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition 
A:  I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , 
A:  because um , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple . 
A:  Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . 
D:  Could it be an on off thing ? 
A:  but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , 
A:  rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . 
A:  but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . 
B:  is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well . 
D:  And also it helps in terms of people not losing this , 
C:  I reckon one problem with speech recognition is 
C:  um I've actually seen one of them used 
C:  and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , 
C:  so you end up yelling at the control for hours . 
B:  Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ? 
C:  I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in . 
abst_sum - abstract: The marketing expert presented consumer preferences and requirements and the team discussed who their target demographic should be and whether to include speech recognition in their product.

A:  Well this is just the working design um . 
A:  Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , 
A:  but we're  we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like  
A:  I think back  in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . 
A:  Has to change channels , has to change volume , 
A:  but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . 
A:  so I'll go into the diagram first . 
A:  It just explains how the process goes through , 
A:  from the basic technology point of view , 
A:  the basic steps that you need 
A:  you need some power source . 
A:  'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going . 
A:  Um and that power source is important 
A:  because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . 
A:  Like for example , voice recognition , right . 
A:  That might be constrained because that  you might need to power a microphone , 
A:  so that's one perhaps constraint there . 
A:  <other> Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface 
A:  You know , and that um picks up an input from a user , 
A:  a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , 
A:  Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself 
A:  like um voice recognition , right , 
A:  if it's something which is important then we just add more power 
A:  rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . 
A:  maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ? 
B:  Well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ? 
A:  Yeah , w I'm done . 
A:  Um you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , 
D:  Since we're on the topic of the technology , uh are there any like  what are our options ? 
D:  Is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin 
A:  Um , these these aren't technology options in that sense . 
A:  a basic principles and basic components that are needed . 
A:  So each component represents one function , 
A:  but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , um and the receiver , okay , 
A:  and the power are things that you won't have to care about . 
A:  Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example . 
A:  Okay , um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ? 
A:  Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . Right . 
B:  Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market , 
B:  so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface 
B:  um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red , 
B:  so we could stay with tha 
A:  Um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . 
A:  so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . 
D:  Uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment , 
A:  There's there's not much specific specific information , 
B:  In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ , 
B:  Um , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? 
B:  or should we just consider running on regular batteries ? 
A:  Okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , 
A:  and you add cost to it , 
A:  You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge . 
A:  Or you need to get the user to plug it in . 
A:  Um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . 
A:  then I don't think rechargeable is something we should  you know , we really need to care about . 
B:  Okay , so just stick to to regular  
abst_sum - abstract: The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the team discussed various options for components and energy sources.

B:  I'm just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start , 
B:  was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at , 
B:  Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? 
D:  Yeah , that's good . 
C:  I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . 
C:  Um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel . 
B:  Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . 
D:  And is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features , 
D:  is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under  like sort of under a door or some  
B:  Yeah , it's as optional functions . 
D:  'Cause what what I'm  I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that . 
A:  Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? 
A:  Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . 
A:  One would be audio controls , 
A:  one would be video controls , 
A:  and the other one would be a device . 
A:  I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , 
A:  and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . 
D:  Mm okay , great . 
A:  Device is basically anything which we can't categorise , right . 
D:  shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed , 
D:  where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this . 
B:  Yeah , yeah I think that's definitely a good idea . 
B:  so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume  hi 
A:  And then video is anything that you can see . 
B:  Okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that , 
D:  And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard 
B:  Um so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good , 
B:  Um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe . 
B:  Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold , 
abst_sum - abstract: The team then discussed features to include in the remote and what they could do to figure out how to categorize them.

B:  um for uh our Industrial Designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . 
abst_sum - action: The industrial designer will work on the components concept.

B:  Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , 
abst_sum - action: The user interface designer will work on the user interface.

B:  and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . 
abst_sum - action: The marketing expert will work on trend watching

B:  which is the  The first one <other> is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . 
B:  so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the  of the remote control . 
abst_sum - decisions: The team will not work with teletext.

B:  Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else . 
B:  So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will only control televisions.

B:  And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . 
abst_sum - decisions: The corporate color and design must be incorporated into the design of the remote.

C:  I mean so far I've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . 
B:  and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah . 
B:  Um , so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and  
C:  There's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . 
C:  I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . 
C:  Um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel . 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will have buttons for the following functions: on and off, channel up and down, volume up and down, and entering channel numbers.

D:  one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . 
D:  And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . 
B:  Um so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good , 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote has to look good and be easy to use.

B:  Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . 
B:  Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? 
D:  Yeah , that's good . 
abst_sum - decisions: The target demographic is people aged fifteen to thirty five.

B:  um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red , 
B:  so we could stay with tha 
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will use an infra-red sensor.

A:  then I don't think rechargeable is something we should  you know , we really need to care about . 
B:  Okay , so just stick to to regular  
abst_sum - decisions: The remote will use regular batteries.

D:  Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising .
