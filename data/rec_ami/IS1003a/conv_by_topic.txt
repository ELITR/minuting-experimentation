A:  So we can start ? 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Suppose I have to do my presentation . <other> Eh um <other> 
C:  Ah okay . 


C:  It's Ada Longmund ? 
A:  <other> So , I'll present myself , I'm Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager . So um we will have to um speak about m the project . Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly . Record . So the project method is the following . So if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other . Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . Uh . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  The tool training is to try out the white board , so  
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Maybe someone ha we have to  this whiteboard , yeah ? 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Maybe you can draw your favourite animal 
C:  <other> 
A:  and make a list of its favourite characteristics . 
D:  So right now ? 
A:  I don't know if we have to do it now , maybe later later . 
B:  So yeah I think you can do it . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , I don't know . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . <laugh> Yeah . Yeah . <other> I think it's quite good price , yeah . And uh 
B:  Twenty five Euros ? 
D:  Mm . 
C:  I it's it's reasonable , s quite  yeah . Twenty five . 
D:  It's reasonable , I think , yeah . 
B:  <other> 
C:  Is  
A:  it will uh be a an international remote control , as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . <other> So , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um  with the remote control . Um just uh maybe be imaginative with <laugh> remote const con controls , try to create something new and people would like to to buy . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  And <other> and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know  I suppose you know what you have to do . <laugh> And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . I I hope so <laugh> 
A:  And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product . So you don't have to do something really specific , as everybody everybody will have to use it , it's sor the same as keyboards . You know , you have Qwerty , Azerty , French and U_K_ keyboard , so really the remote control to be international . And not too expensive . 
B:  Okay . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Mm .
