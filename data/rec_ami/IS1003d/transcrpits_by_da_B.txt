Mm-hmm 
So , ready ? 
 
<laugh> Sorry , 
<laugh> I I um  <other> <laugh> 
I'm afraid  <laugh> 
Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype . <laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh>  <laugh> 
<other> 
Okay . 
Effectively one slide 
and maybe we can discuss everything . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Uh  
<laugh> Yeah , yeah I'm sure <other> . <laugh> 
Yeah , that's true . 
<laugh> 
Yeah  . 
Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh <other> like lemon shape , you know , 
centre <other> is yellow and t d 
To integrate , you know  yeah . 
I don't think  <laugh> 
I hope nobody will eat it  
You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , 
you know the <other> the <other> in 
Really ? 
But  
Fruit and vegetable , 
so mushroom was a kind of you know  uh  
Mushroom ? 
Oh , uh I'm not sure . <other> 
We can  
it's a veg a kind of vegetable , 
but you know we we integrated them with different colour . 
 <other> I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable  you know . 
This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know . 
And inspired colour 
and <other> and very sophisticated material , so . 
And so  <other> 
So what we w 
what I can add is that , you know <other> 
he talk about what is outside , 
so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip , 
it is a low level chip , and  
You know , we don't need to k <laugh> . 
You know wi <other> 
the low level chips inside 
and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i 
The battery it is under  . 
It is in th in  in the base , yeah . <other> 
In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and  
<laugh>  I don't think so , 
<laugh> but it it's might be okay , so . 
I it might be okay . So  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
So , four point  three point five , it means it's acceptable . 
Oops . 
I think you have nice colours . <other> 
I don't  <other> 
The sha the bowl shape people like . 
<laugh> Is it really fancy ? 
But it's  
you have the lemon aspect of this th this <laugh> this thing . <laugh> 
<laugh> Do Don't do that , please . 
<laugh> I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so  
Yeah . 
Because i 
Less button . 
 
Yeah , but you don't have any button now . 
That's uh yeah , is that  
that's a good idea . 
So that's great . <laugh> 
That's great . <laugh> 
I have no idea , so . <laugh> 
I have no idea <laugh> what  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
If it is fancy or not . 
So we can we can say t 
The colour , is the colour acceptable ? 
So the shape now . 
It's too much red ? 
In the basement ? 
<laugh> I will give  I will  
I'll gi 
I'll give two or three . 
Three , it's okay . 
Three , three . 
Three is fine for me . 
What other  
Is it easy to use ? <other> 
Ye uh  
Embedded . 
It's a micro array , okay . 
Oh yeah , yeah . 
And I think you  you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is  
I 
<laugh> W Yeah , but  
I see , you have microphone array embedded . 
You have  
That's good . 
I think technically it's acceptable , so  
Yeah . 
Two , yeah , two . It's it's fine , so . 
<laugh> Most  
Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . 
But it's just speaking . 
You just need the command . 
As a principle . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
I think maybe if you he 
If you hear some click  
Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult . 
Yeah but y how  
you need to know  I  
I think something that  
Yeah . 
And you you can  
I think you can if you have a scale , so  
<laugh> Yeah , it's a bit difficult . 
I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . 
You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so  
Uh , yeah , and y that's  yeah . 
Yeah . 
To see uh  <other> 
yeah <other> uh  
Yeah . 
<other> <laugh> 
And but I'd  
It is a turn off t turn off button , maybe . 
<laugh>  <laugh> 
Yeah , yeah yeah . That's 
that's very technologic , so . <laugh> Yeah . 
S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates 
maybe one of the  
Uh it's k  
on off , yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah , sleeping . 
<other> To compensate  . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> Easy to use , it's very relative 
but three it's fine , I think , 
it's reasonable three . <laugh> 
Three f three for me , it's o it's okay . 
<laugh> Four or three . 
Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives 
and  no and just take the mean . 
Will you give four ? 
Five ? 
Yeah , so maybe if  
Yeah but y you know   
You just push two button , zero and and one . 
And that's  <laugh> 
Are there some buttons ? Okay . 
 
<other> In fact on a flat place  
You can  <other> 
Oh ye yes , that's right . 
<laugh> Oh 
my God . 
<laugh>  <laugh> 
<laugh> yeah maybe , maybe may 
it's the next prototype , maybe we cou 
Four . Maybe four , it's okay . 
I'll put four . 
Yeah , four it's more reasonable . 
You can you can erase with this er yeah . 
Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so . 
So it's nine , 
nine over three . 
Oh yeah , it's  . 
It need maybe some wo further work , but it's  
Yeah , uh s yeah . 
Might  it might be fine . 
Yeah , b I think <other>  
Yeah , yeah . 
<laugh> 
That's the finance . 
Yeah . 
Oh yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , we have battery . 
No , 
um solar cells , yeah . 
Uh I think in each ball you have three  
three uh yeah , 
three , yeah . 
Three  three solar cells . 
S s simple , simple , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . One maybe , yeah . 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
Is it  
Is sh it  
Wooden . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Is  Yes a wooden pl I and that's  
There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think . 
Double curve , yeah , double curve . 
One , you have . 
But it's  yeah , 
a a rubber uh  
Yeah , yeah . Y y yeah , yeah . 
Five ? 
I think that this will be like a scroll wheel , actually . 
Y you tu you turn you turn it , so  
Yeah , true . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . 
Okay , yeah , yeah . Scr 
L_C_ display , maybe . Interface . 
It's okay . <laugh>  fine  . 
Yeah , it was stage one , so . 
So  
I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . 
Because uh it seems that this can be  
yeah , wood into plastic and it it should be fine . 
Yeah , red and yellow . 
Fancy . 
 
<laugh> 
One . 
I can remove 
maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have  yeah . 
Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah . 
F some  
<laugh> Single curve  . 
Single curve should be fine , so . 
Oh , what  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> It's it's a bad idea , so . <other> 
<laugh> Two ? 
One . <laugh> 
That's fine . That's fine . <laugh> 
 One s one scroll wheel , so 
 <laugh> And the vocal chord , it's fine . 
 It I th it's fine . 
<laugh> 
It's fine . 
It's under or equal . It's fine , so  
It's fine , twelve fifty uh  
The solar cells , r is i is it ? 
Yeah , to be able to si to sell it . 
Yeah , with mi 
It's  it is really really uh really very very expensive , though . 
Maybe if uh  okay . 
Yeah , yeah . 
<laugh> 
It's easy to use . It's very easy to use .  <laugh> 
No . 
We've done it with  it is under the  if it was low , high or so . 
So  
So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ? 
Okay , okay , it's fine . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to  from the beginning to the end . 
And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very <laugh> informative for  . 
Yep <other> . 
Okay , okay . 
<laugh> Yellow . 
<laugh> I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after  <other> a fruit T_V_ or I dunno . 
It can be an interesting I don't know  
Yeah , just a lemon T_V_ it'd be <laugh> yellow lemon . 
It's flat , uh  
Yeah , that's right . It's really boring , yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah , that's  that would be really interesting , actually . 
<laugh>  Device devi 
The fruit ? <laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah , it's  
But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . That's a  yeah , yeah . 
We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know . 
Yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep  
Yeah , you can keep the global appearan 
The mood of persons , the fashions uh  
We int <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah , T_V_ , yeah . 
A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter , you know , so it's  <laugh> 
So what i and do w is it <other>  Okay . 
Yeah , the pr  at  
<laugh> 
Yeah but I think f <laugh> 
it's really a celebrating object . <laugh> 
So it's yellow and very  a very ha it's very happy , so . 
Uh it's it's a pr it's like  yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah , 
right , go and sell it . 
Goo and good luck , so  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> It should be fine . 
<laugh> Wh really ? 
It should be it should be fine , you know , actually . <laugh> S 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I I think I like <laugh> the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so  
It's perfect , and  
I p is th y <other> 
the the yellow ball thing that  
Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_  
Okay yeah , yeah . That's actually good idea , so  
 
It's not a mushroom . 
<laugh> It's a pineapple remote controls . 
Yeah , pineapple remote remote control . 
<laugh> Oh , that  
Oh unid uh unidentified remote control , so  <laugh> 
That's that's pineapple remote control . I think it's fine . 
<other> 
Yeah . Yeah I will try <laugh> I'll try  <laugh> 
 . I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage  
<laugh> Yeah I always lose my  
Yeah , so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_ , so it would be  
 
<laugh> I think I would choose this one because of the colour . It's 
it's will enlight your house , your home and your T_V_ , so . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea . 
<laugh>  . 
<laugh> Yeah that's that fine . 
So we can celebrate now . 
That's our new product . 
<laugh> Yes . 
<laugh> It's it's fine . It's  
I like it <other> . 
<laugh> Next time . <laugh> 
Well , I'll buy one here . 
Yeah . No ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Final prototype , yeah , ye yeah . 
Okay . <laugh> Okay . 
S so who is going to take the remote control ?
