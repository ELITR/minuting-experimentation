It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . 
So this is a introduction of our product . 
Next a mo 
<laugh> Okay ,

So there are several key features of our pr prototype . 
The first is that it is fuzzy . 
I'm sure this would be the unique design the market . 
<laugh> Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design . 
Um , and uh 
the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . 
In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel 
but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . 
So it's quite convenient for user to use it . 
Yeah , s <laugh> 
okay . 
Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . 
Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so 
uh so it's it's um 
it's unlikely you cannot found it . 
So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel 
and there's some cute button . 
You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so  <laugh> 
Yeah , everything's mushroom . 
Mush 
Mushroom design , yeah .

Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Uh , no this our only two slides . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
So we cut it to see . <laugh> 
Okay . 
So where's the battery battery ? 
Base . 
Here ? 
<laugh> 
Okay 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah , I think so . 
Yeah , the shape is unique , 
and the colour

Yeah , I agree . 
<other> <laugh> 
Yeah , it's very easy . 
You can use this in this way . 
Yeah . 
Th this is the base . 
So you can turn to change the channel . 
You just tu turn d d 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
No , no , no . 
I  if y uh if  
it depend on the the angle you turn the  
I if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five . 
So change . 
Yeah . 
Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the  by three hundred thirteen degree . 
So you got how many degree you you  it  
No no , you don't have to y no 
it's uh when you when you stop t uh 
when you stop , the the turn , 
then the angle you stop is the angle you  is the channel you  
It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the  
Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it . 
I think so <laugh> I think so you can do it .

<laugh> 
Uh w w what do y what uh  
you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? 
I think it's easier than traditional controller . 
If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , 
you have  you just turn the turn the ball . 
There's two kind of balls , 
the smaller the the the  so you can c you can c you can control the scale . 
But in the traditional controller , how do  how can you control the scale ? 
Yeah , 
yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , 
but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here . 
Yeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Y one to ten , ten to twelve , uh ten to t uh twenty . Ten to twenty 
and this one , t one two three four five six , like this . 
Uh there's different scale , 
so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc 
Mm-hmm . 
I i this is just a base . 
You can just  
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> You use your y 
<laugh> 
<laugh> So th this is a d next generation controller . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> Okay okay , okay . 
Four . Okay . 
Okay . 
Three ? 
Trois . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah .

No . 
No no . 
No no no , it  
<laugh> Okay . 
No . 
<laugh> 
We have change the electronics to  from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . Oh . 
We have to delete the the sample sensor , I think . 
Yeah it's the one it's  
m maybe we ha we have two versions , 
the first version , the basic version . 
Advanced version we have speak .

<laugh> Okay . 
<laugh> Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Twenty five <laugh> Euro . 
<laugh> Okay . 
Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_ 
<laugh> so you need to buy one . 
Okay . <laugh> 
Traditional one ? 
Yeah . 
So this one and this one . What do you choose ? 
<laugh> What do you choose ? 
Okay .
