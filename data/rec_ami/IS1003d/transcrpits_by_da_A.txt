<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Your judgement it's  is biased . <laugh> 
<laugh> So , 
we are <laugh> 
So <other> 
let's go for our detailed design meeting . 
So I will still play the role of the secretary , 
and 
we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , 
<laugh> and our Industrial Designer , Baba . 
<laugh> So we'll have to evaluate the uh  your proposed remote control , 
and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost . <laugh> 
<laugh> And in case 
if we're  we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production . 
<other> So 
maybe I will let the  our two designers talk about so their  
You have s 
oh , sorry . 
Oops . 
Looks strange . <laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but 
<other>  keep on speaking . 
<laugh> Oh . 
Maybe , I hope so . <laugh> 
Chan 
Yeah , okay , 
but don't touch  don't destroy your prototype . <laugh> 
Everything's mushroom . 
So we can call our remote control the mushroom . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Oh . 
Fruits and vegetables . 
Vegetables . Mushroom is a vegetable . 
It's vegetable . 
So th it's something eatable . 
<other> 
Next slide . 
 
Mm-hmm . 
In the base . 
In the basement . In the basement . 
And where is the solar solar cell ? 
Where is the solar cell ? 
Oh . 
Do you think it won't be  It won't cris increase the price ? 
Okay , we'll see after . 
We will have first to  
so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ? 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Maybe if you change  if you take the buttons out , 
and maybe do things like that  
It would be bet more like a lemon ? 
Yeah . 
Looks like more fruit . 
Maybe a pineapple ? 
And you know , you have the finger here , with the buttons ? 
It looks <other> more like a pineapple . 
Sorry . 
What's the use for that ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <other> And where is the voice recognition ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Is it better like that ? 
Looks  okay , 
let's say it's a pineapple now . <laugh> 
It looks like a <other>  
now you took it . 
It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top . 
<laugh> Mm uh  
Seven is the ma the maximum ? 
Three , I will say three . 
Isn't it bitter like that  ? 
Feasible ? 
<other> You said previously that you  there's um microphone inside an 
Oh . 
Okay , 
and you have the  
there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? 
And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ? 
We have tactile buttons . 
Oh , yeah . 
Maybe two ? 
Two ? 
I would say two 
. You agree ? 
It's better like that , 
isn't it ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Oh , ok I understand . 
You take take <other> the remote , so  
and you can turn like that to change the channel ? <sound imitating the turning of a wheel> 
I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , 
but maybe it will be too fast . <laugh> 
Yeah , you have a <sound imitating repeated clicking> , like that , and so on . 
Oh yeah . 
Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , 
so you're passing through all the channels . 
So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's  you've decided to go to channel twenty , 
so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . 
But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it . 
Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ? 
Seems to be good . 
Good choice , mister David Jordan . <laugh> 
 yeah , what's what's this cherry ? 
Okay . 
Yeah , th you have the vocal commands . 
On off . 
<other> 
Most of the time you have the  
yeah it's a sleeping remote control . 
That's true . 
W that why we have the solar ti yeah . 
So 
 three . 
Do you agree ? 
Three ? 
And what's your opinion ? 
It's not what you said previously . 
Previously you said that turning this was the fine  
Fine to coarse . 
And from ten to ten channels here . 
Okay . 
Oh  
<other> Yeah , no no , no . You can't put it out . 
It's just your turning from the base . 
You need to have everything in hand . 
If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn . 
It's impossible . <laugh> 
You need to put it on and turn . <laugh> 
Yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control . 
Nobody would take it . <laugh> 
So nobody w will lost  lose it . 
<laugh> 
S maybe we can change from th 
Four ? 
Easy to use , four . 
Gonna say four . 
Trois . Three . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
So , th the project is accepted ? 
But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple . 
If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control . <laugh> 
<other> So uh mm mm . Mm . 
<other> Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation . 
So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view . 
<other> So 
we need to calculate the production cost . 
As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros . 
And if not  if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it . 
So , just have a look at the  okay here is the 
Excel sheet , so 
so it has the energy source . 
We have hand dynamo . 
No , we don't use that . 
We have battery , right ? 
Kinetic , we don't have it , I suppose , 
but we have solar cells . 
Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? 
Do you think one would be enough , or  such as 
<other> as number of branches ? 
Three ? 
So , 
electronic . 
Single simple chip on print ? 
Just one would be necessary ? 
One ? 
Zero for the others . 
And sample sensor , sample speaker . 
One ? 
As we have voice recognition , I think . 
So the case . 
<other> <laugh> Okay , 
just keep on going , just to have an idea . 
Well uh  
yeah , but what what about case ? 
Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . 
I think it's more like double curved . 
One ? 
<other> Uh wood ? 
<other> 
Uh do we need special colour ? 
Y maybe , two ? 
We have two special colours . 
Push button . 
Okay . <other> 
Scroll wheel . 
We don no . 
It it's more like integrated scor . 
Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel . 
So , no button supplements ? 
Okay . 
Okay we  I think we have problem . <laugh> 
I think we s if we keep on adding things  
so we have to  
Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ? 
Has it changed . 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
but we have  you  the the voice recognition , 
no ? 
Okay . 
Or it would be better . 
<other> So , do we need special colour ? 
Because we have red . 
Red and yellow . 
I think so we need  if we try to have a kind of 
pineapple bee . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . 
And I think this is one . 
Integrated scroll wheel push button 
. So we'll  we have only one ? 
And push button . 
So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it's uh  
Something flat . 
S uncurved . Yeah , maybe not . 
Yeah . 
Mm . Nearly . 
<laugh> Maybe don't bat no battery , only solar cells . 
<laugh> I think there's a problem with the push push button . 
We only need maybe just one . 
Just one . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
So <laugh> yeah , you will have  
So one button , and s 
scroll wheel with push button on it . 
So  
So , yeah . It think we we've done good job , as the cost is 
twelve fifty e 
<other> Yeah , but it's under or equal . 
It's not written . 
Sometimes it's under or equal . 
<other> 
Twelve fifty . 
Yeah , I think . 
I think , yeah . 
But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be  
Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . <laugh> 
So it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button . 
Easy , powerful . 
So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product . 
Yeah . 
So  
Now  
So  
So did you enjoy your clay modelling ? 
Yeah ? <laugh> Was it a nice way to create your remote control ? 
<laugh> 
And for the marketing guy ? 
And new ideas about new products , 
maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh 
and yellow . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Yes , just lemon . 
Squared ? 
<other> 
Ah , the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control . 
Oh , that's interesting . 
You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device . 
Maybe  
Yeah , maybe la next year it will be insects . 
Customable T_V_ . 
Ah such  yeah . 
You've already said mobile phones . 
Yeah , and following  
Mm . 
It's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr 
So I think the costs are within the budget . 
We're just at twelve fifty Euros . 
So 
do you think you can celebrate your creation ? 
Oh , thanks a lot . <laugh> 
Thank you , mister David Jordan . <laugh> 
The thing now is to to sell it . 
<laugh> 
It's maybe a little bit expensive . <laugh> 
<other> 
Maybe what you can do a test . Put it outside , and if bees come , <laugh> it's really fruit . <laugh> 
<laugh> But don't put sugar in it , it's not working . 
Yeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more  is most important , 
because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control . 
Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs . 
So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ . 
So we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , 
so we have the slogan too . 
Yeah 
th no , it's the it's the pineapple control  remote control . 
It's a pineapple now , it has changed . It's a pineapple . 
Pineapple . 
With cherry on top . 
Will you buy one ? 
<laugh> Try to . Okay uh  <laugh> 
<other> One thing I like is the shape , because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on uh in your jacket . 
I prefer the laser remote control . <laugh> No . 
Oh . Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd  can put light inside . 
Yeah . 
I think it it would be interesting to  just to see if we can  if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah . 
So  
Champagne  , mister Baba . <laugh> 
So  
Okay , I will close this . Mm . 
<other> So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control 
and we have a nearly final product . 
Final prototype , right . 
So , 
thank you very much . 
Very productive .
