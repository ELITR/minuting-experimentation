A:  <laugh> 
C:   
D:   
B:  Mm-hmm . So , ready ? 
D:  No not really . Just  
C:  'Kay . 
B:   
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Crap . 
B:  <laugh> Sorry , <laugh> I I um  <other> <laugh> I'm afraid  <laugh> 
D:  Okay . 
C:  It's perfect . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Your judgement it's  is biased . <laugh> 
B:  Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  'Kay , so whe where is the remote control ? 
A:  <laugh> So , we are <laugh> So <other> 
C:  Where ? <laugh> It's here . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Okay . 
topic_description:	chitchat_None


A:  let's go for our detailed design meeting . 
D:  Yep . 
A:  So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , <laugh> and our Industrial Designer , Baba . 
C:  Okay . Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> So we'll have to evaluate the uh  your proposed remote control , and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost . <laugh> 
C:  'Kay . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh>  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> And in case if we're  we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production . <other> So maybe I will let the  our two designers talk about so their  You have s oh , sorry . Oops . 
topic_description:	opening_None


B:  <other> 
C:  I have slides . 
B:  Okay . 
C:  Ah , that is  three . 
B:  Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything . 
C:  Product prod 
D:  What slides ? 
C:  Yep . Okay . Okay . <other> So , this is our product or prototype . This is made by clay . 
A:  Looks strange . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . Yellow is uh our company colour , uh red it's uh is more attractive . So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . And the shape , there's two basic shape . The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . It's  we call it a mushroom design . It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . So this is a introduction of our product . Next a mo 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . Uh  
A:  <laugh> Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but <other>  keep on speaking . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> Okay , yeah , so next slide . So there are several key features of our pr prototype . The first is that it is fuzzy . I'm sure this would be the unique design the market . <laugh> Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design . Um , and uh 
A:  <laugh> Oh . Maybe , I hope so . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah , yeah I'm sure <other> . <laugh> Yeah , that's true . 
C:  the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . So it's quite convenient for user to use it . 
A:  Chan Yeah , okay , but don't touch  don't destroy your prototype . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , s <laugh> okay . Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it . So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button . 
A:  Next slide . 
C:  Uh , no this our only two slides . <laugh> 
A:   
B:  So what we w what I can add is that , you know <other> he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip , it is a low level chip , and  
C:  Yeah . So we cut it to see . <laugh> 
B:  You know , we don't need to k <laugh> . You know wi <other> the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Okay . So where's the battery battery ? 
B:  The battery it is under  . It is in th in  in the base , yeah . <other> 
A:  In the base . In the basement . In the basement . And where is the solar solar cell ? 
C:  Base . Here ? 
D:  But we say uh we sa we said solar . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Where is the solar cell ? 
B:  In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and  <laugh>  I don't think so , <laugh> but it it's might be okay , so . I it might be okay . So  
A:  Oh . Do you think it won't be  It won't cris increase the price ? 
C:  Okay . 
D:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	other_presentation of RC prototype


C:  You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so  <laugh> 
A:  Everything's mushroom . So we can call our remote control the mushroom . 
B:  Yeah  . 
C:  Yeah , everything's mushroom . Mush 
B:  Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh <other> like lemon shape , you know , centre <other> is yellow and t d 
C:  Mushroom design , yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah , th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it . <laugh> 
B:  To integrate , you know  yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  I don't think  <laugh> I hope nobody will eat it  . You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the <other> the <other> in 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh . 
D:  Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . I mean there was fruits  yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  Really ? But  
A:  Fruits and vegetables . 
B:  Fruit and vegetable , so mushroom was a kind of you know  uh  
A:  Vegetables . Mushroom is a vegetable . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  I don't think it is . 
A:  It's vegetable . 
B:  Mushroom ? Oh , uh I'm not sure . <other> We can  it's a veg a kind of vegetable , but you know we we integrated them with different colour . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  So th it's something eatable . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  I  <other> I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable  you know . This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know . 
D:  No , I mean , yeah <other> yeah . Inspira inspiration is  
B:  And inspired colour and <other> and very sophisticated material , so . 
A:  <other> 
D:  True . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  And so  <other> 
topic_description:	other_mushroom and trendwatch


A:  Okay , we'll see after . We will have first to  so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ? 
C:  Okay . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  I mean , we gonna try to measure how 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  good it is instead of just talking about  uh we had three keys  <laugh> key points to uh for this remote control design , 
B:  So it's nine , nine over three . Oh yeah , it's  . 
D:  So , average ? Three ? 
C:  Three ? 
A:  Trois . Three . <laugh> 
C:  Trois . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Okay , so  
B:  It need maybe some wo further work , but it's  
D:  Yeah , especially on the easy to use 
B:  Yeah , uh s yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  target . 
B:  Might  it might be fine . 
A:  So , th the project is accepted ? 
D:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , b I think <other>  
A:  But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple . If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Okay . 
A:  <other> So uh mm mm . Mm . 
B:  That's the finance . 
A:  <other> Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation . 
topic_description:	other_evaluation of prototype


D:  and first one was uh 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  fancy look and feel . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , I think . Uh just let me check . 
B:  <laugh> So , four point  three point five , it means it's acceptable . 
D:  One one being true , and seven being false . Okay . Ouch . 
B:  Oops . 
D:  So 
C:  Okay . 
D:  Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ? 
C:  Yeah , I think so . 
B:  I think you have nice colours . <other> I don't  <other> The sha the bowl shape people like . 
D:  But is it  
C:  Yeah , the shape is unique , and the colour  
D:  Uh I'll agree it's unique , but is it really  
B:  <laugh> Is it really fancy ? 
C:  <laugh> So it depend on how d do you define fancy . 
D:  Yeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  But it's  you have the lemon aspect of this th this <laugh> this thing . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Maybe if you change  if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that  
B:  <laugh> Do Don't do that , please . 
D:  I dunno where the lemon is , but I mean it's not obvious . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so  
A:  It would be bet more like a lemon ? 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  If  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Because i 
D:  I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or  
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Less button . 
C:  Uh so , my mush  . 
B:   
A:  Looks like more fruit . Maybe a pineapple ? 
B:  Yeah , but you don't have any button now . 
C:  Mm . 
D:  Yeah . I dunno . 
A:  And you know , you have the finger here , with the buttons ? 
C:  Yeah . Hmm . 
B:  That's uh yeah , is that  that's a good idea . So that's great . <laugh> That's great . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , it's getting  
A:  It looks <other> more like a pineapple . Sorry . What's the use for that ? 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Uh , for turn turn the ball . If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel . 
B:  I have no idea , so . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  I have no idea <laugh> what  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> <other> And where is the voice recognition ? 
D:  Okay . 
C:  Uh . Ah , it's embedded , your microphone . Th this th th there's two two functions . This is microphone array  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , that's  
A:  Okay . 
D:  Wait th that's the second point . First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel . 
B:  If it is fancy or not . 
A:  Okay . Is it better like that ? Looks  okay , let's say it's a pineapple now . <laugh> 
D:  I mean  <cough> 
B:  So we can we can say t 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  The colour , is the colour acceptable ? 
D:  <other> No , the colour is okay , that's fine . I mean it's  but I would say there is more  too much red . 
B:  So the shape now . 
A:  It looks like a <other>  now you took it . 
B:  It's too much red ? In the basement ? 
D:  Um if 
A:  It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top . <laugh> Mm uh  
C:  <laugh> Okay . 
D:  <laugh> Right . So , from one to seven ? 
B:  <laugh> I will give  I will  
A:  Seven is the ma the maximum ? 
D:  No , seven is false and one is true . 
B:  I'll gi I'll give two or three . Three , it's okay . Three , three . Three is fine for me . 
A:  Three , I will say three . 
D:  Three ? Okay . 
C:  'Kay . 
D:  Three . 
A:  Isn't it bitter like that  ? 
C:  Yeah yeah yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Then <other> uh let me  
B:  What other  
topic_description:	other_look and feel


D:  The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative . 
B:  Is it easy to use ? <other> 
A:  Feasible ? 
B:  Ye uh  
A:  <other> You said previously that you  there's um microphone inside an 
B:  Embedded . 
C:  Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact . There four microphone . So they they they they  there's a microphone array . 
B:  It's a micro array , okay . 
A:  Oh . Okay , and you have the  there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ? 
C:  Yeah , yeah . So you can capture voice  yeah , you c 
B:  Oh yeah , yeah . 
C:  Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah . 
B:  And I think you  you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is  
D:  Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single . 
B:  I <laugh> W Yeah , but  
A:  We have tactile buttons . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  I see , you have microphone array embedded . You have  That's good . And you have , you know this ki this solar receptor that , you know  Yes . Yeah . 
D:  No , that's good . Yeah . 
A:  Oh , yeah . 
D:  Yeah , th that's another really good point . Maybe  okay . 
B:  I think technically it's acceptable , so  
A:  Maybe two ? 
D:  So using the same scale , two ? 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Two ? I would say two . You agree ? 
B:  Two , yeah , two . It's it's fine , so . 
topic_description:	other_technological innovativeness


D:  Okay . Now maybe the most critical one . 
C:  Yeah , I agree . 
A:  It's better like that , isn't it ? 
C:  <other> <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Most  
A:  Okay . 
D:  <other> L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use ? 
B:  Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . But it's just speaking . You just need the command . 
C:  Yeah , it's very easy . 
D:  Yeah but this this turning  can you can you just re explain me the  
C:  You can use this in this way . 
B:  As a principle . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Please . 
C:  Yeah . Th this is the base . So you can turn to change the channel . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ? 
C:  You just tu turn d d 
B:  I think maybe if you he 
D:  Like if you want to go from  
A:  Oh , ok I understand . You take take <other> the remote , so  and you can turn like that to change the channel ? <sound imitating the turning of a wheel> I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  If you hear some click  
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah but imagine you y 
B:  <laugh> Yeah , it would  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to  if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ? 
B:  Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  How can you go directly to twenty , for example ? <makes whooshing sound> 
C:  No , no , no . I  if y uh if  it depend on the the angle you turn the  
D:  Yeah . Yeah . I agree . I agree . But I mean if you're fro from two ? 
B:  Yeah but y how  you need to know  I  
C:  I if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five . So change . Yeah . 
B:  I think something that  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , you have a <sound imitating repeated clicking> , like that , and so on . 
B:  And you you can  
D:  Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh  
A:  Oh yeah . 
C:  Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the  by three hundred thirteen degree . So you got how many degree you you  it  
D:  We're not talking  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go  
B:  I think you can if you have a scale , so  
C:  No no , you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the the turn , 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  then the angle you stop is the angle you  is the channel you  
D:  Yeah . How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ? 
C:  It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the  
D:  So you you count  one degree , two degrees , no . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it . 
D:  I don't think so . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah , it's a bit difficult . 
C:  I think so <laugh> I think so you can do it . <laugh> I think so , you can just change . 
B:  I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so  
D:  Yeah voc vocal command is okay . But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main  
C:  There's uh also a number , you know . 
A:  Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's  you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it . Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ? 
B:  Uh , yeah , and y that's  yeah . 
D:  And this would be more for browsing , ah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . To see uh  <other> yeah <other> uh  
C:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Seems to be good . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Good choice , mister David Jordan . <laugh> 
B:  <other> <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , I mean you're famous . You  . 
B:  And but I'd  
C:  And also you can , if you i 
A:   yeah , what's what's this cherry ? 
C:  You ca you can turn this . Or you ca you can you can also turn this . For this you can tune it's for tune . You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this . If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this . It's like fine , from coarse to fine . This is coarse , this is fine . 
B:  It is a turn off t turn off button , maybe . <laugh>  <laugh> 
D:  Mm . 
B:  Yeah , yeah yeah . That's 
A:  Okay . 
C:  So it's coarse to fine design . 
B:  that's very technologic , so . <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Okay the uh th this looks better . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah is is  this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel . This is from one channel to  
B:  S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates maybe one of the  
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , th you have the vocal commands . 
B:  Uh it's k  on off , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  On off . <other> 
D:  Yeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Most of the time you have the  yeah it's a sleeping remote control . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah , sleeping . 
D:  Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah . 
A:  That's true . W that why we have the solar ti yeah . So  three . 
D:  Solar . 
B:  <other> To compensate  . <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  Okay . 
D:  So , which number ? 
B:  <laugh> Easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three . <laugh> 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Do you agree ? Three ? 
C:  Yeah , agree , agree . 
D:  So reasonably , is four , is one ? 
B:  Three f three for me , it's o it's okay . <laugh> Four or three . Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and  no and just take the mean . 
D:  So , three . 
C:   <laugh> 
A:  And what's your opinion ? 
D:  Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . I'd like  I mean this is the  just a prototype . I'm not really convinced it's so easy to use , but I don't know . 
B:  Will you give four ? Five ? Yeah , so maybe if  
C:  Uh w w what do y what uh  you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? I think it's easier than traditional controller . If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have  you just turn the turn the ball . There's two kind of balls , the smaller the the the  so you can c you can c you can control the scale . But in the traditional controller , how do  how can you control the scale ? 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah but y you know   
D:  So you have  <laugh> yeah . Uh by pushing zero after after the first one . 
B:  You just push two button , zero and and one . And that's  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Are there some buttons ? Okay . 
C:  Yeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  It's not what you said previously . Previously you said that turning this was the fine  
D:  Yeah , if you're changing your mind . 
B:   
D:  Fine to coarse . 
A:  Fine to coarse . And from ten to ten channels here . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . Y one to ten , ten to twelve , uh ten to t uh twenty . Ten to twenty and this one , t one two three four five six , like this . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  Uh there's different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc 
D:  Okay . But this this has to stay on the table , right ? This has to stay on the table . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  <other> In fact on a flat place  
C:  I i this is just a base . You can just  
B:  You can  <other> 
D:  Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh ye yes , that's right . 
A:  <other> Yeah , no no , no . You can't put it out . It's just your turning from the base . You need to have everything in hand . If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn . It's impossible . <laugh> You need to put it on and turn . <laugh> 
D:  Just  It's  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Oh my God . 
D:  Yeah . You know tha that's the weak point , because with a traditional one you just have one hand . 
C:  <laugh> You use your y 
A:  Yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control . Nobody would take it . <laugh> So nobody w will lost  lose it . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh>  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> So th this is a d next generation controller . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Sure . <laugh> Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah . 
B:  <laugh> yeah maybe , maybe may it's the next prototype , maybe we cou 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Okay okay , okay . 
A:  S maybe we can change from th 
B:  Four . Maybe four , it's okay . I'll put four . 
C:  Four . Okay . 
A:  Four ? Easy to use , four . Gonna say four . 
D:  Four . Uh it's even easier to  maybe . 
B:  Yeah , four it's more reasonable . You can you can erase with this er yeah . 
D:  Ok 
C:  Okay . 
D:  Mm . 
B:  Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so . 
topic_description:	other_ease of use


A:  So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm . Okay . 
A:  <other> So we need to calculate the production cost . As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros . And if not  if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it . So , just have a look at the  okay here is the 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
B:  Oh yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Excel sheet , so so it has the energy source . We have hand dynamo . No , we don't use that . We have battery , right ? Kinetic , we don't have it , I suppose , but we have solar cells . Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? Do you think one would be enough , or  such as 
D:  No . 
B:  Yeah , we have battery . No , um solar cells , yeah . Uh I think in each ball you have three  three uh yeah , three , yeah . Three  three solar cells . 
A:  <other> as number of branches ? Three ? So , electronic . Single simple chip on print ? Just one would be necessary ? One ? 
B:  S s simple , simple , yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Zero for the others . And sample sensor , sample speaker . One ? 
B:  Mm . One maybe , yeah . 
A:  As we have voice recognition , I think . 
B:  Yeah yeah yeah . 
A:  So the case . 
B:  Is it  
D:  <other> <cough> 
B:  Is sh it  
D:  So we are all already nineteen . 
B:  Wooden . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> <laugh> Okay , just keep on going , just to have an idea . 
C:  The solar cell is too expensive . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Is  Yes a wooden pl I and that's  There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think . 
A:  Well uh  yeah , but what what about case ? Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . I think it's more like double curved . 
D:  That's gonna be double curved , yeah . 
B:  Double curve , yeah , double curve . 
A:  One ? 
B:  One , you have . 
A:  <other> Uh wood ? <other> 
B:  But it's  yeah , a a rubber uh  
D:  Rather four buttons . Oh no , interface . 
A:  Uh do we need special colour ? Y maybe , two ? We have two special colours . Push button . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . Y y yeah , yeah . 
D:  Yeah , yeah that's special colours , sure . 
C:  Mm . Yeah , we have four . <laugh> Five . <other> 
B:  Five ? 
A:  Okay . <other> Scroll wheel . We don no . 
C:  No . 
A:  It it's more like integrated scor . 
B:  I think that this will be like a scroll wheel , actually . Y you tu you turn you turn it , so  
C:  No no . 
D:  Yeah tha that's wheel . 
C:  No no no , it  <laugh> Okay . 
A:  Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , true . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Okay , yeah , yeah . Scr 
A:  So , no button supplements ? 
D:  I think the price is okay . 
C:  No . 
D:  Um , no . 
A:  Okay . 
A:  So , yeah . It think we we've done good job , as the cost is 
C:  Cou could we have look  
A:  twelve fifty e 
C:  Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost ? 
D:  Yeah y actually it's wrong . We're not under twelve Euros and a half . 
A:  <other> Yeah , but it's under or equal . It's not written . Sometimes it's under or equal . 
B:  It's fine . It's under or equal . It's fine , so  
D:  Okay . Okay . 
C:  Okay . So let's say  
A:  <other> Twelve fifty . 
C:  Wha what  yeah . 
B:  It's fine , twelve fifty uh  
C:  Which part is the most expensive part ? <laugh> 
D:  Solar cells . 
B:  The solar cells , r is i is it ? 
A:  Yeah , I think . 
C:  Yeah , I think it's not t t 
A:  I think , yeah . But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be  
B:  Yeah , to be able to si to sell it . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Cheaper . 
D:  That's nice argument , but if it's it's still four our of twelve . 
B:  Yeah , with mi It's  it is really really uh really very very expensive , though . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Maybe if uh  okay . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . <laugh> So it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  Yeah but we just have one button . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Easy . I don't know about powerful . Yeah . 
B:  It's easy to use . It's very easy to use .  <laugh> 
A:  Easy , powerful . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm . 
A:  So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product . 
B:  No . 
D:  Uh that's what we've just done . 
B:  We've done it with  it is under the  if it was low , high or so . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Um 
A:  So  
D:  okay . 
topic_description:	other_financial evaluation


A:  Okay we  I think we have problem . <laugh> 
B:  L_C_ display , maybe . Interface . 
A:  I think we s if we keep on adding things  so we have to  
B:  It's okay . <laugh>  fine  . 
D:  Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells . 
A:  Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ? 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Has it changed . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , it was stage one , so . 
D:  No y i it did change , but just imagine we have  
A:  Okay . 
C:  We have change the electronics to  from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . Oh . 
B:  So  
C:  We have to delete the the sample sensor , I think . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , but we have  you  the the voice recognition , no ? 
D:  Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really  
C:  Yeah it's the one it's  m maybe we ha we have two versions , the first version , the basic version . Advanced version we have speak . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . Because uh it seems that this can be  yeah , wood into plastic and it it should be fine . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah , if  
A:  Or it would be better . 
C:  Plastic is free . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <other> So , do we need special colour ? 
D:  Yeah , that's one of the requirement . 
A:  Because we have red . 
B:  Yeah , red and yellow . Fancy . 
C:  Wait . 
A:  Red and yellow . 
D:  We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . Black then is a regular colour , so . 
C:  We we can we can we c <other> yellow . 
B:   
A:  I think so we need  if we try to have a kind of 
D:  Yeah , one . 
A:  pineapple bee . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . So push button then it's it's the next expensive one . 
A:  Yeah . An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . And I think this is one . Integrated scroll wheel push button . So we'll  we have only one ? 
D:  Yeah , thi this might be . 
A:  And push button . So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it's uh  
D:  Close to . 
B:  One . I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have  yeah . 
D:  Okay , so what's the bottleneck ? 
C:  How about we change the sale ? 
D:  Double curved . 
B:  Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah . F some  
A:  Something flat . 
D:  Yeah , but flat  
A:  S uncurved . Yeah , maybe not . 
B:  <laugh> Single curve  . Single curve should be fine , so . 
D:  Case , what's the ca 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh , what  <laugh> 
A:  Mm . Nearly . 
C:  Ah we have one  <laugh> 
D:  And then one Euro left . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Um . 
A:  <laugh> Maybe don't bat no battery , only solar cells . <laugh> I think there's a problem with the push push button . We only need maybe just one . Just one . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> So <laugh> yeah , you will have  So one button , and s 
B:  <laugh> It's it's a bad idea , so . <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Um  
B:  <laugh> Two ? One . <laugh> That's fine . That's fine . <laugh>  One s one scroll wheel , so  <laugh> And the vocal chord , it's fine .  It I th it's fine . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Okay . Okay . <laugh> Agree . 
D:  So we have one button , one wheel . 
A:  scroll wheel with push button on it . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  So  
D:  It's good they're not charging anything for that . <laugh>

A:  So  
D:  Well I think we have just have to discuss if  
B:  Okay , okay , it's fine . 
D:  I dunno . 
A:  So did you enjoy your clay modelling ? 
C:  Yes . Of course . This is my job . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah ? <laugh> Was it a nice way to create your remote control ? 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , it's uh it's good , to to create a control instead of a computer . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to  from the beginning to the end . And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very <laugh> informative for  . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  And for the marketing guy ? 
D:  Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff

topic_description:	other_evaluation of project


A:  And new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yellow . <laugh> I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after  <other> a fruit T_V_ or I dunno . It can be an interesting I don't know  
C:  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  <other> Yes , just lemon . 
B:  Yeah , just a lemon T_V_ it'd be <laugh> yellow lemon . 
C:  Yeah , but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um  
B:  It's flat , uh  
C:  Yeah yeah it's flat , yeah the shape is very boring . Could we come up with new T_V_ with  such as this kind of T_V_ ? So you can  <laugh> you have base , triangle base so you the T_V_ you can  
A:  Squared ? 
B:  Yeah , that's right . It's really boring , yeah . Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> Ah , the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah , that's  that would be really interesting , actually .

A:  Oh , that's interesting . You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device . 
B:  <laugh>  Device devi 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , but just don't trust too much the trends . 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh . Maybe two years it's dead . 
C:  Yeah .

A:  Maybe  Yeah , maybe la next year it will be insects . 
B:  Yeah , it's  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm . 
D:  Yeah , but this is good because it's not a long long life product . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  T_V_ is more like fifteen years , maybe , so . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . That's a  yeah , yeah . 
D:  If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for 
B:  We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know . 
D:  fifteen years  
A:  Customable T_V_ . 
B:  Yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , yeah .

C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  Hmm . Yeah . It's party party remote control . 
A:  The thing now is to to sell it .

B:  <laugh> Wh really ? It should be it should be fine , you know , actually . <laugh> S 
A:  <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Maybe what you can do a test . Put it outside , and if bees come , <laugh> it's really fruit . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  I I think I like <laugh> the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so  
C:  Okay . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> But don't put sugar in it , it's not working . 
D:  No , the colours are uh  it's perfect , yeah . 
B:  It's perfect , and  
D:  True . Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still . 
B:  I p is th y <other> the the yellow ball thing that  
A:  Yeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more  is most important , because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control . 
D:  Uh  Still that was one of the requirements we had . It's  yeah but it  I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere . 
B:  Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_  
A:  Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ . 
D:  Mm . 
B:  Okay yeah , yeah . That's actually good idea , so  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm . 
A:  So we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , so we have the slogan too . 
C:  So we have to give a  So we have give him  give it a cute name . 
B:   
D:  Cute na 
A:  Yeah th no , it's the it's the pineapple control  remote control . It's a pineapple now , it has changed . It's a pineapple . Pineapple . 
C:  Mush mushroom controller . 
D:  You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend . It's not the trend . 
B:  It's not a mushroom . <laugh> It's a pineapple remote controls . 
C:  Pa Pine apple . 
B:  Yeah , pineapple remote remote control . 
D:  Yeah , but just flying saucer , or  
A:  With cherry on top . 
B:  <laugh> Oh , that  
C:  <laugh> Okay . 
D:  I would say flying saucer . 
B:  Oh unid uh unidentified remote control , so  <laugh> 
D:  It's more appropriate , somehow . 
C:  <laugh> Okay . Okay . 
B:  That's that's pineapple remote control . I think it's fine . <other> 
D:  Mm . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Will you buy one ? 
B:  Yeah . Yeah I will try <laugh> I'll try  <laugh>  . I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage  
A:  <laugh> Try to . Okay uh  <laugh> 
C:  Twenty five <laugh> Euro . <laugh> Okay . Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_ so <laugh> so you need to buy one . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah I always lose my  Yeah , so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_ , so it would be  
C:  Okay . <laugh> 
A:  <other> One thing I like is the shape , because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on uh in your jacket . 
D:  Mm . 
B:   
C:  Traditional one ? Yeah . So this one and this one . What do you choose ? <laugh> What do you choose ? 
A:  I prefer the laser remote control . <laugh> No . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> I think I would choose this one because of the colour . It's 
C:  Okay . 
B:  it's will enlight your house , your home and your T_V_ , so . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh . Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd  can put light inside . 
B:  Yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea . 
D:  Yeah but that's going to be expensive , you know . We had some problems <laugh> going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh>  . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  I think it it would be interesting to  just to see if we can  if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah . 
D:  Yeah , afterwards , if 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  if it's a new trend . Okay . 
A:  So  
B:  <laugh> Yeah that's that fine .
