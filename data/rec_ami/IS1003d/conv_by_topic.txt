A:  <laugh> 
C:   
D:   
B:  Mm-hmm . So , ready ? 
D:  No not really . Just  
C:  'Kay . 
B:   
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Crap . 
B:  <laugh> Sorry , <laugh> I I um  <other> <laugh> I'm afraid  <laugh> 
D:  Okay . 
C:  It's perfect . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Your judgement it's  is biased . <laugh> 
B:  Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  'Kay , so whe where is the remote control ? 
A:  <laugh> So , we are <laugh> So <other> 
C:  Where ? <laugh> It's here . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Okay . 


A:  let's go for our detailed design meeting . 
D:  Yep . 
A:  So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , <laugh> and our Industrial Designer , Baba . 
C:  Okay . Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> So we'll have to evaluate the uh  your proposed remote control , and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost . <laugh> 
C:  'Kay . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh>  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> And in case if we're  we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production . <other> So maybe I will let the  our two designers talk about so their  You have s oh , sorry . Oops . 


B:  <other> 
C:  I have slides . 
B:  Okay . 
C:  Ah , that is  three . 
B:  Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything . 
C:  Product prod 
D:  What slides ? 
C:  Yep . Okay . Okay . <other> So , this is our product or prototype . This is made by clay . 
A:  Looks strange . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . Yellow is uh our company colour , uh red it's uh is more attractive . So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . And the shape , there's two basic shape . The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . It's  we call it a mushroom design . It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . So this is a introduction of our product . Next a mo 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . Uh  
A:  <laugh> Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but <other>  keep on speaking . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> Okay , yeah , so next slide . So there are several key features of our pr prototype . The first is that it is fuzzy . I'm sure this would be the unique design the market . <laugh> Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design . Um , and uh 
A:  <laugh> Oh . Maybe , I hope so . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah , yeah I'm sure <other> . <laugh> Yeah , that's true . 
C:  the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . So it's quite convenient for user to use it . 
A:  Chan Yeah , okay , but don't touch  don't destroy your prototype . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , s <laugh> okay . Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it . So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button . 
A:  Next slide . 
C:  Uh , no this our only two slides . <laugh> 
A:   
B:  So what we w what I can add is that , you know <other> he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip , it is a low level chip , and  
C:  Yeah . So we cut it to see . <laugh> 
B:  You know , we don't need to k <laugh> . You know wi <other> the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Okay . So where's the battery battery ? 
B:  The battery it is under  . It is in th in  in the base , yeah . <other> 
A:  In the base . In the basement . In the basement . And where is the solar solar cell ? 
C:  Base . Here ? 
D:  But we say uh we sa we said solar . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Where is the solar cell ? 
B:  In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and  <laugh>  I don't think so , <laugh> but it it's might be okay , so . I it might be okay . So  
A:  Oh . Do you think it won't be  It won't cris increase the price ? 
C:  Okay . 
D:  <laugh> 


A:  Okay , we'll see after . We will have first to  so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ? 
C:  Okay . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  I mean , we gonna try to measure how 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  good it is instead of just talking about  uh we had three keys  <laugh> key points to uh for this remote control design , 
B:  So it's nine , nine over three . Oh yeah , it's  . 
D:  So , average ? Three ? 
C:  Three ? 
A:  Trois . Three . <laugh> 
C:  Trois . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Okay , so  
B:  It need maybe some wo further work , but it's  
D:  Yeah , especially on the easy to use 
B:  Yeah , uh s yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  target . 
B:  Might  it might be fine . 
A:  So , th the project is accepted ? 
D:  Okay . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , b I think <other>  
A:  But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple . If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Okay . 
A:  <other> So uh mm mm . Mm . 
B:  That's the finance . 
A:  <other> Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation . 


A:  So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm . Okay . 
A:  <other> So we need to calculate the production cost . As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros . And if not  if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it . So , just have a look at the  okay here is the 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
B:  Oh yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Excel sheet , so so it has the energy source . We have hand dynamo . No , we don't use that . We have battery , right ? Kinetic , we don't have it , I suppose , but we have solar cells . Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? Do you think one would be enough , or  such as 
D:  No . 
B:  Yeah , we have battery . No , um solar cells , yeah . Uh I think in each ball you have three  three uh yeah , three , yeah . Three  three solar cells . 
A:  <other> as number of branches ? Three ? So , electronic . Single simple chip on print ? Just one would be necessary ? One ? 
B:  S s simple , simple , yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Zero for the others . And sample sensor , sample speaker . One ? 
B:  Mm . One maybe , yeah . 
A:  As we have voice recognition , I think . 
B:  Yeah yeah yeah . 
A:  So the case . 
B:  Is it  
D:  <other> <cough> 
B:  Is sh it  
D:  So we are all already nineteen . 
B:  Wooden . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> <laugh> Okay , just keep on going , just to have an idea . 
C:  The solar cell is too expensive . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Is  Yes a wooden pl I and that's  There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think . 
A:  Well uh  yeah , but what what about case ? Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . I think it's more like double curved . 
D:  That's gonna be double curved , yeah . 
B:  Double curve , yeah , double curve . 
A:  One ? 
B:  One , you have . 
A:  <other> Uh wood ? <other> 
B:  But it's  yeah , a a rubber uh  
D:  Rather four buttons . Oh no , interface . 
A:  Uh do we need special colour ? Y maybe , two ? We have two special colours . Push button . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . Y y yeah , yeah . 
D:  Yeah , yeah that's special colours , sure . 
C:  Mm . Yeah , we have four . <laugh> Five . <other> 
B:  Five ? 
A:  Okay . <other> Scroll wheel . We don no . 
C:  No . 
A:  It it's more like integrated scor . 
B:  I think that this will be like a scroll wheel , actually . Y you tu you turn you turn it , so  
C:  No no . 
D:  Yeah tha that's wheel . 
C:  No no no , it  <laugh> Okay . 
A:  Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , true . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Okay , yeah , yeah . Scr 
A:  So , no button supplements ? 
D:  I think the price is okay . 
C:  No . 
D:  Um , no . 
A:  Okay . 
A:  So , yeah . It think we we've done good job , as the cost is 
C:  Cou could we have look  
A:  twelve fifty e 
C:  Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost ? 
D:  Yeah y actually it's wrong . We're not under twelve Euros and a half . 
A:  <other> Yeah , but it's under or equal . It's not written . Sometimes it's under or equal . 
B:  It's fine . It's under or equal . It's fine , so  
D:  Okay . Okay . 
C:  Okay . So let's say  
A:  <other> Twelve fifty . 
C:  Wha what  yeah . 
B:  It's fine , twelve fifty uh  
C:  Which part is the most expensive part ? <laugh> 
D:  Solar cells . 
B:  The solar cells , r is i is it ? 
A:  Yeah , I think . 
C:  Yeah , I think it's not t t 
A:  I think , yeah . But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be  
B:  Yeah , to be able to si to sell it . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Cheaper . 
D:  That's nice argument , but if it's it's still four our of twelve . 
B:  Yeah , with mi It's  it is really really uh really very very expensive , though . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Maybe if uh  okay . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . <laugh> So it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  Yeah but we just have one button . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Easy . I don't know about powerful . Yeah . 
B:  It's easy to use . It's very easy to use .  <laugh> 
A:  Easy , powerful . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm . 
A:  So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product . 
B:  No . 
D:  Uh that's what we've just done . 
B:  We've done it with  it is under the  if it was low , high or so . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Um 
A:  So  
D:  okay . 


A:  Now  
B:  So  So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ? 
A:  So  
D:  Well I think we have just have to discuss if  
B:  Okay , okay , it's fine . 
D:  I dunno . 
A:  So did you enjoy your clay modelling ? 
C:  Yes . Of course . This is my job . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah ? <laugh> Was it a nice way to create your remote control ? 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , it's uh it's good , to to create a control instead of a computer . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to  from the beginning to the end . And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very <laugh> informative for  . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  And for the marketing guy ? 
D:  Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff 
B:  Yep <other> . 
D:  next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it  um . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  Okay , okay . 


A:  And new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yellow . <laugh> I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after  <other> a fruit T_V_ or I dunno . It can be an interesting I don't know  
C:  <laugh> <laugh> 
A:  <other> Yes , just lemon . 
B:  Yeah , just a lemon T_V_ it'd be <laugh> yellow lemon . 
C:  Yeah , but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um  
B:  It's flat , uh  
C:  Yeah yeah it's flat , yeah the shape is very boring . Could we come up with new T_V_ with  such as this kind of T_V_ ? So you can  <laugh> you have base , triangle base so you the T_V_ you can  
A:  Squared ? 
B:  Yeah , that's right . It's really boring , yeah . Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> Ah , the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah , that's  that would be really interesting , actually . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . Because the T_V_ you <other> also  
A:  Oh , that's interesting . You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device . 
B:  <laugh>  Device devi 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , but just don't trust too much the trends . 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh . Maybe two years it's dead . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  The fruit ? <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  Maybe  Yeah , maybe la next year it will be insects . 
B:  Yeah , it's  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm . 
D:  Yeah , but this is good because it's not a long long life product . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  T_V_ is more like fifteen years , maybe , so . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . That's a  yeah , yeah . 
D:  If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for 
B:  We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know . 
D:  fifteen years  
A:  Customable T_V_ . 
B:  Yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Ah such  yeah . You've already said mobile phones . Yeah , and following  
D:  Tha that would that would make it . Yeah . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah , you can keep the global appearan The mood of persons , the fashions uh  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm . 
B:  We int <laugh> 
A:  It's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr 
B:  <laugh> <laugh> Yeah , T_V_ , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter , you know , so it's  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 


B:  So what i and do w is it <other>  Okay . 
A:  So I think the costs are within the budget . We're just at twelve fifty Euros . So do you think you can celebrate your creation ? 
B:  Yeah , the pr  at  
C:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  And you can celebrate your leadership . <laugh> 
A:  Oh , thanks a lot . <laugh> Thank you , mister David Jordan . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah but I think f <laugh> it's really a celebrating object . <laugh> So it's yellow and very  a very ha it's very happy , so . Uh it's it's a pr it's like  yeah . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  Hmm . Yeah . It's party party remote control . 
A:  The thing now is to to sell it . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , it's your job . <laugh> Sell it . <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah , right , go and sell it . Goo and good luck , so  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Okay and the twelve fifty  twelve uh twelve  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh-huh . Twenty five Euros . Yeah , I think it's <laugh>  
C:  Twenty five Euros , yeah . <laugh> Twenty five Euros . <laugh> No , it's not so expensive . 
B:  <laugh> It should be fine . 
A:  It's maybe a little bit expensive . <laugh> 
D:  It's cheap , yeah . <laugh> No , I  I'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know . 
B:  <laugh> Wh really ? It should be it should be fine , you know , actually . <laugh> S 
A:  <other> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Maybe what you can do a test . Put it outside , and if bees come , <laugh> it's really fruit . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  I I think I like <laugh> the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so  
C:  Okay . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> But don't put sugar in it , it's not working . 
D:  No , the colours are uh  it's perfect , yeah . 
B:  It's perfect , and  
D:  True . Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still . 
B:  I p is th y <other> the the yellow ball thing that  
A:  Yeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more  is most important , because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control . 
D:  Uh  Still that was one of the requirements we had . It's  yeah but it  I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere . 
B:  Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_  
A:  Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ . 
D:  Mm . 
B:  Okay yeah , yeah . That's actually good idea , so  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm . 
A:  So we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , so we have the slogan too . 
C:  So we have to give a  So we have give him  give it a cute name . 
B:   
D:  Cute na 
A:  Yeah th no , it's the it's the pineapple control  remote control . It's a pineapple now , it has changed . It's a pineapple . Pineapple . 
C:  Mush mushroom controller . 
D:  You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend . It's not the trend . 
B:  It's not a mushroom . <laugh> It's a pineapple remote controls . 
C:  Pa Pine apple . 
B:  Yeah , pineapple remote remote control . 
D:  Yeah , but just flying saucer , or  
A:  With cherry on top . 
B:  <laugh> Oh , that  
C:  <laugh> Okay . 
D:  I would say flying saucer . 
B:  Oh unid uh unidentified remote control , so  <laugh> 
D:  It's more appropriate , somehow . 
C:  <laugh> Okay . Okay . 
B:  That's that's pineapple remote control . I think it's fine . <other> 
D:  Mm . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Will you buy one ? 
B:  Yeah . Yeah I will try <laugh> I'll try  <laugh>  . I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage  
A:  <laugh> Try to . Okay uh  <laugh> 
C:  Twenty five <laugh> Euro . <laugh> Okay . Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_ so <laugh> so you need to buy one . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah I always lose my  Yeah , so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_ , so it would be  
C:  Okay . <laugh> 
A:  <other> One thing I like is the shape , because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on uh in your jacket . 
D:  Mm . 
B:   
C:  Traditional one ? Yeah . So this one and this one . What do you choose ? <laugh> What do you choose ? 
A:  I prefer the laser remote control . <laugh> No . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> I think I would choose this one because of the colour . It's 
C:  Okay . 
B:  it's will enlight your house , your home and your T_V_ , so . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh . Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd  can put light inside . 
B:  Yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea . 
D:  Yeah but that's going to be expensive , you know . We had some problems <laugh> going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh>  . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  I think it it would be interesting to  just to see if we can  if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah . 
D:  Yeah , afterwards , if 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  if it's a new trend . Okay . 
A:  So  
B:  <laugh> Yeah that's that fine . 


B:  So we can celebrate now . That's our new product . 
A:  Champagne  , mister Baba . <laugh> 
D:  We should celebrate . 
B:  <laugh> Yes . <laugh> It's it's fine . It's  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  I like it <other> . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Next time . <laugh> Well , I'll buy one here . 
C:  So buy one . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  So  
D:  Mm . 
A:  Okay , I will close this . Mm . 
B:  Yeah . No ? 
A:  <other> So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control 
B:  Okay . Okay . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  and we have a nearly final product . 
D:  Our final prototype which  yeah . 
B:  Final prototype , yeah , ye yeah . 
A:  Final prototype , right . So , thank you very much . Very productive . 
C:  Prototype , yeah . Okay . 
B:  Okay . <laugh> Okay . 
C:  Okay . <laugh> Okay . Thanks . 
B:  S so who is going to take the remote control ?
