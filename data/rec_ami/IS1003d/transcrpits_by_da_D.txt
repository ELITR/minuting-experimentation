 
No not really 
Just  
Crap . 
Okay . 
'Kay , 
so whe where is the remote control ? 
<laugh> 
Yep . 
<laugh> 
What slides ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . 
I mean there was fruits  yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
I don't think it is . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine . 
No , I mean , yeah <other> yeah . 
Inspira inspiration is  
True . 
But we say uh we sa we said solar . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
I mean , we gonna try to measure how good it is 
instead of just talking about  uh 
we had three keys  <laugh> key points to uh for this remote control design , 
and first one was uh 
fancy look and feel . 
So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , 
one being uh no , I think . 
Uh just let me check . 
One one being true , and seven being false . 
Okay . 
Ouch . 
So 
Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ? 
But is it  
Uh I'll agree it's unique , 
but is it really  
Yeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
I dunno where the lemon is , but 
I mean it's not obvious . 
If  
I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or  
Yeah . 
I dunno . 
Yeah , it's getting  
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Yeah , that's  
Wait th that's the second point . 
First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel . 
I mean  <cough> 
<other> No , the colour is okay , that's fine . 
I mean it's  
but I would say there is more  too much red . 
Um if 
<laugh> Right . So , from one to seven ? 
No , seven is false and one is true . 
Three ? 
Okay . 
Three . 
Then <other> uh let me  
The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative . 
Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single . 
Mm-hmm . 
No , that's good . Yeah . 
Yeah , th that's another really good point . 
Maybe  okay . 
So using the same scale , two ? 
Okay . 
Now maybe the most critical one . 
<other> L last one w I would like to judge is 
is it easy to use ? 
Yeah but this this turning  
can you can you just re explain me the  
<laugh> Please . 
Yeah . 
Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ? 
Like if you want to go from  
Yeah but imagine you y 
Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to  if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ? 
How can you go directly to twenty , for example ? <makes whooshing sound> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . I agree . I agree . 
But I mean if you're fro from two ? 
Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh  
We're not talking  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ? 
So you you count  one degree , two degrees , no . 
I don't think so . <laugh> 
Yeah voc vocal command is okay . 
But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main  
And this would be more for browsing , ah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , I mean you're famous . You  . 
Mm . 
Okay the uh th this looks better . Yeah . 
Yeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas 
Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah . 
Solar . 
So , which number ? 
So reasonably , is four , is one ? 
So , three . 
Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , 
those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . 
Yeah . 
So you have  
<laugh> yeah . 
Uh by pushing zero after after the first one . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , if you're changing your mind . 
Fine to coarse . 
Okay . 
But this this has to stay on the table , right ? 
This has to stay on the table . 
Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it  
Just  
It's  
Yeah . 
You know tha that's the weak point , 
because with a traditional one you just have one hand . 
Sure . 
<laugh> Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Four . 
Uh it's even easier to  maybe . 
Ok 
Mm . 
So , average ? 
Three ? 
Okay , so  
Yeah , especially on the easy to use 
target . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
No . 
<other> <cough> 
So we are all already nineteen . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
That's gonna be double curved , yeah . 
Rather four buttons . 
Oh no , interface . 
Yeah , yeah that's special colours , sure . 
Yeah tha that's wheel . 
Yeah . 
I think the price is okay . 
Um , 
no . 
Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells . 
Yeah . 
No y i it did change , but 
just imagine we have  
Yeah . 
Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really  
Yeah . 
Yeah , if  
Yeah . 
Yeah , that's one of the requirement . 
We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . 
Black then is a regular colour , so . 
Yeah , one . 
Yeah . 
So push button then it's it's the next expensive one . 
Yeah , thi this might be . 
Close to . 
Okay , so what's the bottleneck ? 
Double curved . 
Yeah , but flat  
Case , what's the ca 
And then one Euro left . 
Um . 
<laugh> 
Um  
<laugh> 
So we have one button , 
one wheel . 
<laugh> 
It's good they're not charging anything for that . <laugh> 
Yeah y actually it's wrong . We're not under twelve Euros and a half . 
Okay . Okay . 
Solar cells . 
Yeah . 
That's nice argument , 
but if it's it's still four our of twelve . 
Yeah . 
Yeah but we just have one button . <laugh> 
Easy . 
I don't know about powerful . Yeah . 
Mm . 
Uh that's what we've just done . 
Yeah . 
Um 
okay . 
Well I think we have just have to discuss if  
I dunno . 
Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . 
'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff 
next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it  um . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , but just don't trust too much the trends . 
'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh . 
Maybe two years it's dead . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , but this is good because it's not a long long life product . 
T_V_ is more like fifteen years , maybe , so . 
If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for 
fifteen years  
Yeah , yeah . 
Tha that would that would make it . Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
Yeah . It's party party remote control . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Uh-huh . 
Twenty five Euros . 
Yeah , I think it's <laugh>  
It's cheap , yeah . <laugh> 
No , I  
I'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
No , the colours are uh  it's perfect , yeah . 
True . 
Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still . 
Uh  
Still that was one of the requirements we had . 
It's  yeah but it  I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Cute na 
You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend . 
It's not the trend . 
Yeah , but just flying saucer , or  
I would say flying saucer . 
It's more appropriate , somehow . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah but that's going to be expensive , you know . 
We had some problems <laugh> going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno . 
Yeah , afterwards , if 
if it's a new trend . 
Okay . 
We should celebrate . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Our final prototype which  yeah .
