Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . 
And that it controls the channels and the the volume . 
And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . 
So that you know it s it still has batteries on it  in it . 
And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working . 
And uh yeah . Uh  
Yeah , but  
No no no . 
But I  my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah well that's  that are good ideas . Uh  
Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it's working . If you push a button . Um  
Yeah . 
And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . 
So probably plastic or something . Uh  
Mm no . 
Yes .
