Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . 
We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that . 
That's not really ea easy . 
So it would be nice if we have one for all . 
And we also had a remote control for our radio set . 
But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it , 
and you didn't know which one was what . 
And it was uh uh v <other> not easy to use . 
So we n barely used it . 
Yeah . 
Yeah I think it uh  from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . 
Or you won't sell it . 
And um yeah uh 
on our website we can see what products we already have . 
And it should work with as many uh as possible of them . 
Yes . 
Okay .
