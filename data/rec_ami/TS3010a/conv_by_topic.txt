A:  Now next . The budget . The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros . And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it . 
topic_description:	project budget_None


A:  So <other> now we have to think about what we will make . First I wanna hear from you . Uh what are your experiences with remote controls . So  
C:  Uh I will start . Uh   Big one , they are uh not easy to use . Um I have one set and uh a remote control , when I dropped it , uh it broke . So that won't be uh our goal , I think . And uh g big buttons , <other> m uh that's easier to use than uh  I think . 
A:  F first  . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  No . 
C:  Not all the small buttons , you don't know  
A:  Is this positive or negative , that uh big buttons ? 
C:  Big buttons , positive . All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for . 
A:  Positive . Okay . What are your experiences ? 
B:  Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . And that it controls the channels and the the volume . 
A:  Mm . 
B:  And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . So that you know it s it still has batteries on it  in it . And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working . And uh yeah . Uh  
A:  So and do they always have that ? 
B:  Yeah , but  No no no . But I  my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that . Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  It's easy to you . Okay . 'Kay . 
D:  Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that . That's not really ea easy . So it would be nice if we have one for all . 
C:  <other> Thank you . Help also . <laugh> Thank you . 
D:  And we also had a remote control for our radio set . But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . And it was uh uh v <other> not easy to use . So we n barely used it . 
A:  Okay so they have too much . 
topic_description:	existing products_None


A:  So next . For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? <laugh> 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  So more ideas ? 
B:  Mm no . 
A:  No okay . It's only the first ideas . 
topic_description:	other_initial ideas


C:  The weight . Not not too heavy . 
A:  Not too heavy . 
C:  Not much buttons . 
A:  Yes . Yeah . 
C:  Bust-free . That when you drop it , it won't break . Like uh some kind of rubber on it . Or hard uh hard plastic . Uh buttons not too small . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


C:  Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it . When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some   uh some sort of bleep . And then you uh , hey there there's remote control . 
A:  Yes . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Like a phone . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  <sound indicating frustration> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  So , that's  . 
C:  Next . 
B:  Yeah well that's  that are good ideas . Uh  
topic_description:	how to find when misplaced_None


B:  Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it's working . If you push a button . Um  Yeah . And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . So probably plastic or something . Uh  
A:  Okay . 
C:  <cough> 
D:  Yeah I think it uh  from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . Or you won't sell it . 
A:  Yes . 
D:  And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . And it should work with as many uh as possible of them . 
A:  Okay . This is  It has to be compatible with other things . Okay . 
D:  Yes . 
C:  I have one more idea . Just popped up . 
A:  Yes ? 
C:  Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries . So you don't  won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks . 
A:  No battery use .
