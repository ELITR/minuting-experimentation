<laugh> 
Oh . 
Thank you . 
Uh I will start . 
Uh   
Big one , they are uh not easy to use . 
Um I have one set and uh a remote control , 
when I dropped it , uh it broke . 
So that won't be uh our goal , I think . 
And uh g big buttons , 
<other> m uh that's easier to use than uh  I think . 
Not all the small buttons , you don't know  
Big buttons , positive . 
All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for . 
<other> Thank you . 
Help also . <laugh> Thank you . 
The weight . Not not too heavy . 
Not much buttons . 
Bust-free . 
That when you drop it , it won't break . 
Like uh some kind of rubber on it . 
Or hard uh hard plastic . 
Uh buttons not too small . 
Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it . 
When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some   uh some sort of bleep . 
And then you uh , hey there there's remote control . 
<sound indicating frustration> 
<laugh> 
Next . 
<cough> 
I have one more idea . 
Just popped up . 
Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries . 
So you don't  won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks . 
Okay . Thank you .
