Okay , 
good morning . 
This is our first team meeting . 
I'll be your Project Manager for today , for this project . 
My name is Mark 
 will be giving this presentation for you to kick the project off . 
<other> That's my uh 
that's the agenda for today . 
Well , 
of course we're new to each other , 
so I'd like to get acquainted first . 
So let's do that first , 
I mean  
Let's start with you , 
can you introduce yourself ? 
You're our Marketing Expert . 
Okay , excellent . 
And you are User Interface  
Yeah . 
Excellent . Okay . 
What should it look like ? Okay . 
Oh , 
let's kick it off . 
Oh , there we go . 
So , 
our new project is about  
we need design a remote control for television set , 
so , 
which has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . 
I took this off our corporate website . 
 I think well it sums up what we need to do . 
It's 
We're inspired by latest fashion , not only electronics , but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design . 
That's why our product will always fit in your home . 
So apparently we need to <other> um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market . 
So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want . 
So  So 
we put the fashion in electronics . 
So that's what we need to go for . 
Anyway , we'll take this project in three steps , three pha uh three phase of design . 
First step will be the functional design . 
And that's basically what we're gonna do . 
Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards , 
so we can share information 
about  
So 
I'm gonna keep this short , 
since we had a technical problem . 
So skip through this . 
Uh . Okay . 
Every meeting we  everybody can present their uh their views and everything , 
so to help with these , you have  we have the SMARTboards here . 
We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . 
I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , 
so it's  
actually it's very easy . 
Like it says , very simple , 
you just take out the pen . 
Like you see here , I'll just take the  take  here . 
That's it , you just put it on the board . 
You see a pen here . 
You go here , 
just like using a pen . 
You can just draw whatever you want . 
It's like the eraser , 
can erase whatever you want . 
And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , 
if you wanna change the format , you just <other> either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger . 
So it should be really easy . 
This is to take the  
just take a new slide 
and back again . 
We're just gonna keep using this board all the time , 
so I think it will be  
it's very clear for everyone , I suppose . 
So 
I'll take this out . 
<other> Okay . 
We'll use that later . Anyway . 
Yeah , just just 
just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , 
like I put my presentation now . 
I'll put the the minutes of every meeting , I'll put them there too , 
so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever . 
So 
next , been here . <other> 
Well ,  
gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot . 
So 
basic idea is we have a blank sheet . 
Just try whatever you want , 
and like it says , draw your favourite animal . 
I think the creative genius should go first . <laugh> 
So , draw us your favourite animal . 
Draw us a technical animal . 
Yeah , it's still erasing . 
<laugh> So that's what we don't want . 
We want a high-responsive product . So  
It looks more like nuclear bomb . 
<laugh> 
Let's go easy on it . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Anyway , 
it should  It  
It's supposed to be a dolphin , 
you like the freedom that it  that it represents . 
What do you like ? 
Okay . Well , 
our Marketing Expert . Show us an animal . 
 Pick a  pick a  
pick a clean sheet . 
Oh . Take a clean sheet first . 
Just press next . 
That's it . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<other> 
<laugh> It's a cute elephant . 
<laugh> 
It's a nice beard . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay , so 
it's just a bee . 
So 
I suggest you make us the elephant in the market . The big and strong player in the market . 
This would be good . 
Okay , excellent . 
On to the next one . 
Press next . Yeah , 
it's up there . 
That's it . 
<laugh>

<laugh> 
What does it want ? 
Okay . 
I agree . 
, I'm supposed to draw the animal next . 
Yay 
I introduce to the world the amazing ant . 
Great team-workers . 
Do everything to 
Uh really small , 
but together they're really strong . 
So I'm gonna give it a smiley face . 
Not sure where the p  . 
Just put 'em here . Whatever . <other> 
Think it need shoes . So  
<other> 
I'm just too lazy to draw it all black , so  
<other> That's the coolest ant ever . 
I love to draw ants . It's my hobby . 
Anyway  Nah . <laugh> Just  
I think it's very representative what we drew , I guess . 
Like you take  just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us . 
Just  Yeah . 
You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have , and just make it a little distinct . 
Anyway .  
another beep to stop the meeting .

Yeah , we want  
I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . 
So <other> I think  I mean , really disabled people , yeah , <other> might be a problem ,
