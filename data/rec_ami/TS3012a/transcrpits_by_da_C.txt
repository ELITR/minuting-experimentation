Morning . 
My name is Xavier Juergens , 
I'm the Industrial Designer , 
and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today . 
First one is uh what happens inside the apparatus , 
second is what is uh the apparatus made of , 
and the third is what should it look like . 
<laugh> 
<cough> 
<other> <laugh> 
<laugh> <other> 
Uh-huh . 
Mm . 
<other> Okay . 
Okay , 
you should press next . 
<other> Okay . 
Okay , well 
the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger . 
My drawing skills are really bad , so . 
They are really bad , my drawing skills . 
I'm not sure how the legs should go , 
but  
Uh 
these are stripes . 
I've picked this animal because it's very fast . 
It is uh 
it knows exactly what it wants . 
Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources . 
Uh well , basically uh 
it hunts for prey , 
but it does it always in a very well-thought way . 
Uh it knows exactly what it wants . 
It never kills an animal uh just for the killing , 
so it's very efficient . 
And it tries to do everything as fast as possible . 
And it always goes for uh security , in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything , 
security , speed and efficiency is important . 
And I think uh those things we can use . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
<other> Oh . 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
is uh the the material it is made of , it should be something light . 
Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me 
That's  
it speaks for itself , 
but some uh  
Yeah . 
<other> Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Good luck everyone .
