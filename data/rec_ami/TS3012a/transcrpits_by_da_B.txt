Good day . 
Nick Broer , 
User Interface Designer . 
I'm going to uh look at the technical design from the uh user point of view . 
<laugh> The creative genius ? 
Thank you very much . 
<other> Well , 
I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing , 
so I'm not really good at drawing animals , 
but uh the animal which I   Oh . 
<other> Pen . 
Uh format . 
Else my animal will be like king-size . 
I pretty much like <other> a dolphin , 
because of its uh its freedom basically . 
Let's see . 
A head . 
 actually worked with this . 
It's like uh it's a very  Uh high-tech . 
Bit low-responsive though . 
Prefer pen and paper . 
It <other> <laugh> doesn't look like a nuclear bomb . 
This thing isn't doing what I'm  What I want . 
So  
<laugh> Yeah , well it does look like a nuclear bomb . 
I'll just finish up real soon , 
because I'm  
So it doesn't really look like a dolphin , 
but then again , this is all new for me . 
Like the ocean , 
like swimming . 
Do that in my spare time , 
so that's basically an  
Now we can forget this ever happened . 
It's not really that responsive , no . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
And you was making comments on my dolphin . <laugh> 
You picked a hard one , didn't you ? <laugh> 
Got it . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
You've done this before , haven't you ? <laugh> 
Well , 
I basically had a question . 
Do <other> uh  
Are we going to introduce a multi remote control ? 
Is it just the T_V_ 
or do we want to in 
Just for T_V_ remote control . 
Okay . 
Well , 
I was thinking about design remote control , with our uh motto and all . 
Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with . 
No rational changes or whatever , 'cause it  revolutionary changes , 
yes . 
<other> Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . 
So that was something I wanted to add , 
and perhaps some usability aspect . 
T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . 
Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ? 
Yeah . 
Okay , well 
that's not that much to work with . <laugh> 
Mm , good luck .
