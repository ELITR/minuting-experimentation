A:  Uh . Okay . Every meeting we  everybody can present their uh their views and everything , so to help with these , you have  we have the SMARTboards here . We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , so it's  actually it's very easy . Like it says , very simple , you just take out the pen . Like you see here , I'll just take the  take  here . That's it , you just put it on the board . You see a pen here . You go here , just like using a pen . You can just draw whatever you want . It's like the eraser , can erase whatever you want . And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you wanna change the format , you just <other> either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger . So it should be really easy . This is to take the  just take a new slide and back again . We're just gonna keep using this board all the time , so I think it will be  it's very clear for everyone , I suppose . So I'll take this out . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  <other> Okay . We'll use that later . Anyway . Yeah , just just just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , like I put my presentation now .

C:  <cough> 
A:  Draw us a technical animal . Yeah , it's still erasing . 
B:  <other> Pen . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh format . Else my animal will be like king-size . I pretty much like <other> a dolphin , because of its uh its freedom basically . Let's see . A head .  actually worked with this . It's like uh it's a very  
C:  <other> <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh high-tech . Bit low-responsive though . Prefer pen and paper . 
A:  <laugh> So that's what we don't want . We want a high-responsive product . So  It looks more like nuclear bomb . 
D:  <laugh> Very nice dolphin . 
B:  It <other> <laugh> doesn't look like a nuclear bomb . This thing isn't doing what I'm

A:  <laugh> 
C:  Uh these are stripes . 
B:  Got it . <laugh> 
C:  I've picked this animal because it's very fast . It is uh it knows exactly what it wants . Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources . 
A:  What does it want ? 
C:  Uh well , basically uh it hunts for prey , but it does it always in a very well-thought way . Uh it knows exactly what it wants . It never kills an animal uh just for the killing , so it's very efficient . And it tries to do everything as fast as possible . And it always goes for uh security , in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything , security , speed and efficiency is important . And I think uh those things we can use . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  Mm . 
A:  I agree .

B:  You've done this before , haven't you ? <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  I love to draw ants . It's my hobby . Anyway  Nah . <laugh> Just  I think it's very representative what we drew , I guess . Like you take  just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us .

D:  Uh <other>  
A:  The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control . 
B:  Just for T_V_ remote control . Okay . Well , I was thinking about design remote control , with our uh motto and all . Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with . No rational changes or whatever , 'cause it  revolutionary changes , yes . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , I guess so . 
D:  But  Yeah . 
A:  Okay , so very intuitive design , I guess . 
B:  <other> Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . So that was something I wanted to add , and perhaps some usability aspect . T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ? 
A:   Yeah , we want  I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . So <other> I think  I mean , really disabled people , yeah , <other> might be a problem , but I think it's a little  take it into consideration . Um yeah .
