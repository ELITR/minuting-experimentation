A:  Well I don't know if you've noticed , but uh we're working for Real Reaction . Uh it's a company in uh electronics . We put fashion in electronics , uh we make it work , uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . I'm Bart  the project manager so I'll direct you through the project . 
topic_description:	project specs and roles of participants_None


A:  This is our agenda . <other> Uh we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  Uh maybe I can sit down , then I can take some notes or  Let's see . 
D:  Sure . 
A:  Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while . I dunno it's not a lot of work , but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down , just write it down . Uh as you can see uh it's the opening , aquaintance tool training . Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  Um have you all seen the corporate website already ? Yeah . Have you seen any flaws in it ? I think I found one . <laugh> No ? 
D:  Yep . Visit it . 
B:  Yep . Hmm ? 
D:  Can't say I paid much attention to it , but  
A:  But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh  there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction . Real Remote is not really the company we're  we are , but it's just a little  fault . 
topic_description:	discussion_None


A:  I can 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh yeah . 
B:  Okay . Yeah . 
A:  see if it works this way . No , it doesn't work here . Okay no problem . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  Um okay , what are we going to do ? <other> Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . It has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you . <laugh> We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look . And Industrial Designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  <other> And we've got our User Interface Designer . He's also uh  
B:  Yep . 
A:  That's about the new remote control . Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through . First is functional des uh design , individual work , meetings . After the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design . <other> I had some role indications on here . But I think you know it already by yourself . The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design , uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design . Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . <other> And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project  uh product ev evaluation . So that's a bit what you're going to do . But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings . 
D:  <cough> 
topic_description:	project specs and roles of participants_None


A:  Then we've got our first tool training . <other> We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here , so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first . As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side . Here are some functions . You can save . N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little uh piece of drawing . A blank new document for each person . Uh select a pen , eraser . Capture we don't have to do anything with . Uh then we've got our pen . This pen . It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the  think it is form of . You can also select the current colour and the line width . But then first you have to select the pen function . But we're going to work with it in a minute . So okay . Uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there . 
D:  'Kay . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  <other> Uh then a short thing about documents . We've got our shared folder , uh project  project  what was it ? Project documents  I think . But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be okay . And these are available on the smart boards as well , so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder . 
B:  Okay . Yeah . 
A:  Here is a simple tool bar . It's what I just said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page . You can switch between the different drawings . And then we're going to try out the white board . 
C:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	other_introduction to tools and equipment


A:  <other> So as you can see we g all <laugh> going to draw a animal . <laugh> Just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it . <laugh> <other> Mouse wasn't running away . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  That was interesting . 
A:  Is everybody  is anybody playing with the mouse ? No . Okay . <laugh> We're going to uh draw animal . 
D:  <laugh> Innocent . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . 
A:  <laugh> Oh  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Sure . 
A:  Ah I was trying to draw a dolphin , but I think his nose has to be a little bit  But it's close . 
B:  <laugh> <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  I'm thinking about a swordfish . 
A:  So what  yeah it's  this is bit of the swordfish . Yeah , he hasn't got an eye . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Mm-hmm . 
B:   <laugh> 
A:  Woah . <laugh> Now we've got another function . We've got the eraser . <laugh> And then you can undo 
D:  <laugh> <other> . 
A:  this easily . 
D:  Meat . 
A:  Ah it's okay . And I've got to write down a few of its characteristics . Uh is  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  They've got no text tool , no . Uh . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Okay . This is typically a undo action , I think . <laugh> Pen . 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down . I think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . But I don't know , I'm just trying . <laugh> <laugh> This is not my work , okay . Maybe you have to use  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Hmm . 
A:  Oh . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh . I think it's a  it wants to draw a  another animal ? I don't know . It lives for the fun . So  It's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin . It lives for the fun . So now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you . Go ahead . 
D:  Okay . <laugh> 
B:  Okay . <laugh> 
D:  Thank you . Okay . Gonna use a different line width . And I'm gonna draw in black . There . 'Kay , I'm not much of an artist , but here we go . 
A:  Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width , I think . Because this is going a lot better than uh I did . 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  A sheep . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Okay . This is my um  Hmm .

A:  Yeah . 
D:  They're brilliant animal animals . And that's just a little me thingy . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> <laugh> 
D:  So . Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer . 
B:  Okay . Um I'm just gonna draw its uh head , but mm  
A:  Nice . 
B:  Let's see . Mm . Uh .  Okay . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Sweet . <laugh>

D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh>

A:  Ah . 
C:  The pen . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  So . 
A:  Okay . That's pretty clear . So everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? So if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask and go ahead . It's pretty uh easy . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  The pen . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	drawing exercise_None


A:  Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . Uh there's  I can start from now . I will . You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child . Because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good . 
D:  <laugh> <cough> 
B:  Okay . 
D:  'Kay . 
A:  Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow . 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up . So we choose form of current colour uh I think grey is appropriate . Then the line width . I think seven will be nice . Now you'll see my drawing capabilities . These are not very much , but uh  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh , see you have to do it real slow . 
topic_description:	other_introduction to tools and equipment


A:  <laugh> 'Kay . S  haunted white board . <laugh> So we've got the tool uh introduction . We 
D:  We're being haunted . <cough> 
A:  move along to the project finance . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  Um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five Euros . Our selling price . Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros . Uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . Uh we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . Um but that's all in the later stadium . Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros , so that's also a point we have to keep in mind , that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and stuff like that . It won't work . So just try to remember these points . Selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million um , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros . 
topic_description:	project budget_None


A:  So that's leads us to our little discussion . We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . So I'm gonna sit down , I think . It's easier . I've got a message . Five minutes . Okay , that's uh good timing . <laugh>  
D:  Yeah , you got a message . 
B:  Five minutes , okay . 
D:  So just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ? 
B:  Mm ? 
A:  Uh maybe you have to say the magic word . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . Right . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Does it do anything ? 
D:  No . 
A:  Maybe you have to just clap it down ? Mm back up again . No slide show . Hmm . 
D:  It's off now . 
A:  It's off . Now you have to put it back o Oh yeah . You'll be okay , I think . 
D:  Well , it was on , but  
A:  Well it's those laptops . <laugh> 
D:  Ah , there we are . 
A:  Nice . 
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  Okay . <other> But so mm does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls , and I mean not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? Like you can use for other ? No ? You ? 
D:  <cough> 
B:  Mm . Oh really ? Huh . 
A:  Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder . 
B:  'Kay . 
A:  Other ideas ? Quick ideas . 
C:  Nope . They were all mentioned , so  
B:  Mm . 
A:  Okay . Any questions about this uh presentation ? Kick off presentation . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Um . Nope , don't think so . 
A:  No ? 
B:   
topic_description:	discussion_None


D:  Well , we have a 
A:  <other> 
C:  No , me neither . 
B:  It's a  
D:  kind of broad T_V_ at home , and a D_V_D_ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the T_V_ , one for the video recorder , one for the D_V_D_ player . And I think it's  it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all . 
A:  Ah yeah . Yep . Yeah I've I've got one at home . And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else . And it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your T_V_ on the second floor . So that's a pretty handy um 
B:  Sure . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Okay , yeah . 
D:  Oh really . 
B:  Hmm . Oh . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  thing . <other> Um but only the I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well . It's uh  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh . 
A:  That's good to remember . 
D:  So I think you can take minutes again . 
A:  Yeah , that's nice , I think . <laugh> So we've  we want different functions 
D:  Since it's your job . Yeah . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red . But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs . So that uh that's something we have to find out , I think . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Yeah . But that would be really good if we could do that . <cough> 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


A:  And other functions for a remote control ? Maybe we can make it uh uh 
D:  Um . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Think it has to be shock proof 
B:  Sure , yeah . 
D:  'cause 
A:  Shock proof . 
D:  my remote control tends to fall a lot . 
B:  Waterproof , or uh  
A:  <laugh> Sure . 
D:  So  
B:  Uh , you never no know uh , I w I mean uh  
A:  Waterproof . Okay . So these are our um a few things we can think of . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


D:  Yeah , one other little thing . Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it . So you can see 
A:  That's a  battery stays . 
B:  Okay , yeah . 
D:  how much is left in the battery . But they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  Uh . 
D:  But maybe just a little LED , I don't know . 
A:  That's an idea as well . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


A:  Okay , then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , and then we can all work . Finish meeting now . <laugh> Okay . <laugh> And we can all work uh on our own projects . <other> 
D:  Okay . Aye sir . 
A:  Okay then I'll meet you in about a half an hour , I think . So good luck . <other> <laugh> 
D:  Half an hour . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  Okay . Yep . 
D:  Okay .
