Morning . 
Yep . 
My name's Frank . 
Thank you . 
<laugh> Hmm , that's interesting . 
<cough> 
Sure . 
Yep . Visit it . 
Can't say I paid much attention to it , 
Oh yeah . 
Okay . 
<cough> 
'Kay . 
<laugh> 
That was interesting . 
<laugh> Innocent . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <cough> 
'Kay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I'm thinking about a swordfish . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <other> . 
Meat . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
Okay . <laugh> 
Thank you . 
Okay . 
Gonna use a different line width . 
And I'm gonna draw in black . 
There . 
'Kay , 
I'm not much of an artist , 
but here we go . 
Mm . 
<laugh> Okay . 
This is my um  Hmm . 
Sheep . 
With of course 
little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts . 
There . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
'Kay . 
They are  
Come on . 
You have to go really slow when you're writing . 
They're brilliant animal animals . 
And that's just a little me thingy . 
So . 
Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer . 
Interesting . 
A rabbit ? 
Garfield . Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
And the most interesting tail . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
We're being haunted . 
<cough> 
Yeah , 
you got a message . 
So 
just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ? 
<laugh> Yeah . Right . 
No . 
It's off now . 
Well , 
it was on , 
but  
Ah , 
there we are . 
<cough> 
Well , 
we have a 
kind of broad T_V_ at home , and a D_V_D_ player , 
so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the T_V_ , one for the video recorder , one for the D_V_D_ player . 
And I think it's  it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all . 
Oh 
really . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So 
I think you can take minutes again . 
Since it's your job . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But that would be really good if we could do that . <cough> 
Um . 
Think it has to be shock proof 
'cause 
my remote control tends to fall a lot . 
So  
Yeah , 
one other little thing . 
Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it . 
So you can see 
how much is left in the battery . 
But they'll also really drag up the production costs , 
so think we'll have to see about that too . 
But maybe just a little LED , 
I don't know . 
Um . Nope , don't think so . 
Okay . 
Aye sir . 
Half an hour . 
Okay .
