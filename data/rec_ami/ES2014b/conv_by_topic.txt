B:  We have a  I guess we have a presentation each , 'cause I've got one . Um . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I've got one too . 
A:  I see , right . That's nice to know , one from each of you . Um new project requirements . Um so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to um  
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:   Uh we didn't , no . 
C:  No . 
B:  I d I didn't personally . 
D:  Hmm . 
C:  <cough> 


A:  W I I got um  or or three things basically , um relating to the remote being only for T_V_ . We discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway . So in fact it actually f we won't be forestalled <laugh> in a sense . Um we've got uh teletext outdated . Um did you get any information on that ? Right and the corporate image was the uh final thing . So I I got that in email form . Um . 


A:  Right okay . So I guess if we go ahead with the uh with the three presentations . So we'll start with yourself on the basis that uh  
B:  Okay that's fine . I'll just um I'll grab the wire out the back of this one . 
A:  Sorry , yep . 
B:   
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh . <other> 
C:  What is it ? 
B:  I'm not quite sure how it  
C:  I think you've got to do um control F_ eight . 
B:  Control   Doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment . 
C:  Shift F_ eight . <laugh>  
B:  Alt function F_ eight . <laugh> Again not doing anything . 
D:  <other> There's usually a little thing in the top right for the  Oh hang on , it's just coming on . 
B:  Oh .

A:   it going ? 
B:  Hopefully that should be it this time . Okay , I think we're there . That's good . Okay , um  


B:  Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design . Um <other> of the of the remote control . Um I've just got three sections , first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um . And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote . Um so having researched the existing models within the market , um I found my research off the internet . 
B:  . 'Kay and that's it for the moment 
D:  Okay . 


A:  Okay . So , now more design . <laugh> 
C:  Right . Thank you . Mine's not quite as complicated as all that . 
A:  <laugh> That's what we like to hear . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Did I press function ? Yeah . 
A:  Is it control function ei Oh , th there you go . 
C:  Oh . Um . Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design . I'm Louisa , the User Interface Designer , as you know . <cough> Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed . Um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that . Um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . Um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button . 
C:  Right well that's the end of my presentation . 
D:  'Kay . 


D:  I'm gonna pull this off . <laugh> 
B:  . I think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up
