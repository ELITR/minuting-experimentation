Yeah , 
I've got one too . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
<other> There's usually a little thing in the top right for the  
Oh hang on , 
it's just coming on . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Um 
I'm not sure . 
I had I've had some market information , 
but not from the company , no . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
'Kay . 
I'm gonna pull this off . 
<laugh> 
Uh-huh . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
I'll give it another go . 
Yeah , there we go . <laugh> 
Right , 
we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . 
And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_ 
and um how do people use it ? 
We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them . 
Um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , 
and what improvements would would they like to remote control . 
And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . 
And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly 
and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control 
And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they weren't used very often at all . 
People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . 
Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control . 
And young people were quite receptive to this , 
but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age  forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition . 
There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well . 
Um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls 
and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . 
And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . <other> 
Okay , so  
My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some <other> sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech  
A design which looks high-tech , basically . 
Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , 
and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said . 
Um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control . 
That's worth thinking about . 
Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , 
because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design . 
That that might be the market that we're we're looking for . 
And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to <other> speech recognition to change the channels . 
'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , 
so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . 
<laugh> Okay um , 
and that's the end of the slide show . 
That's it . 
Cool . 
Um about speech recognition ? 
Yeah . 
Youn young people pref 
Yeah , 
they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility 
and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh-huh . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well , 
which which again would probably be a bit expensive , but  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ? 
Considering  
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
So  
About five minutes . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . Yep . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
So do we need to decide on the functions now ? S 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah 
and  
Yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said , so . 
I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that , so . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
No not everyone can whistle , can they , though ? <laugh> 
No , 
clapping , I think clapping , 
yeah . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
<other> Taking out teletext , okay . 
Mm . 
I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number , 
so you can press any two 
and it'll sort of put them together . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh <other> we could possibly put an L_  a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in , 
but that again is probably an expense that  
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I s I suppose um 
if people are buying remotes , then they're probably buying it to replace another remote 
'cause all most tellies come with remotes , so . 
I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , 
so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in .  
Yeah , 
that would be a good idea , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
Uh  
I'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 
'cause one  the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one . 
So maybe next to each of the buttons , you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it , 
so you're basically pressing  
Right . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So th the  
The detailed ones would be sort of brightness , 
uh sorta  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
And probably a power one as well . 
<laugh> Dunno . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> Okay . 
Um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so . 
Um . 
Numbers is ten , 
volume is twelve , 
th Yeah si 
One up , one down . 
And a mute , yeah . 
That's sixteen isn't it , yeah . 
I don't think so , no . 
You've got brightness and contrast . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . 
So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Right . 
Okay . <other> <laugh>
