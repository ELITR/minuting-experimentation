Just trying to move mine right now . 
They want everything , but simply . 
<laugh> Okay . 
<other> 
<other> Yeah th 
<other> I I can  
I can address some of that issue , I think , with uh my presentation . 
<other> Okay . 
Mine will always read copy of something or other . 
<laugh> I I copied mine before I sent it over . 
Hmm . 
Okay , my turn . 
Whoo . 
It'll be copy of component design . 
Yeah . Th that looks like it . 
'Kay . 
So basic remote operation runs as follows , 
press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , 
chip senses the connection , 
chip produces a morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button . 
So you press the button , it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically for that button . 
Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the T_V_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . 
So that being said  
Next slide , please . 
Findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , 
so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , 
we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , 
all those basic things that make a circuit function . 
Um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself . 
An L_E_D_ , which is a light emitting diode , 
um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source , 
whatever power-source we've actually determined we want . 
Next slide , please . 
Thank you . 
Uh personal preferences , 
uh to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse . 
Um if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , L_E_D_ , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it . 
<other> Next slide , please . 
Um just talking to the um manufacturing division . 
They suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , 
so you shake it and it increases the power . 
Um I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works , 
they have yet to get back to me on that . 
So next slide , please . 
Suggested casing options . 
Okay . 
We can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , you know , 
very specific to the customer . 
Options for materials , plastic , rubber , titanium , wood . 
I don't think anyone's gonna go for a wood one , because splinters  
Yeah . 
<other> Um certain restrictions do apply here though . 
Uh latex , you can't do solar power with a latex one . 
So , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option . 
Double-curved , you can't do titanium . 
Um that would be two curvatures , 
so it would actually , if you  the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold . 
Now if you wanted that , you can't do titanium . 
And uh so you  functions what  for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves . 
I think I have one more slide . 
No , I didn't . 
Um the manufacturing division also has said that um <other> they have several types of chips 
and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise . 
Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip . 
So depends on what we decide we wanna do . 
In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we're going to have to have multiples of each type , 
like a double-curved in rubber , um you know , each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options . 
So we'll have to mix it up , make sure we produce enough of everyone . 
But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , you know , double-curved wooden remotes . 
And that's all I got . 
<other> Well , we are making the chip . 
So , I mean  
But , I guess , we have to look at w what <other> our production cost is for the chip itself anyway . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I I thought <other> offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different , you know  
I think we'd have to decide on the power options , maybe . 
So that we could reduce cost . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
I think the p 
That's true . 
If we do a voice-activated locator , though , we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip . 
So  
Honestly , I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base 
if we did do a nice small , compact  
Mm yeah . 
Yeah . 
'Kay so  
The only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash . 
<other> You know it happens . 
I've had three watches go that way too . 
Pieces everywhere . 
Well , we have lots of options . 
I don't think wood is a viable option . 
However , 
well , we only wanna sell it for twenty five Euro 
right ? 
'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium , 
make them a rarity so to speak . 
Yeah . 
Well the original  
Okay . 
Yeah . Good plan . 
Honestly I'd recommend like um  
uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex , 
because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour . 
We could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so , 
because this year is all fruit , 
God only knows why , 
um we could do f a cherry cover for this year 
and then i if next year is stripes or solids , you know  
They could come back . And buy the extra case . 
So we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could <other> give two latex covers to start . 
How complicated  
Are we gonna go with the voice activated  
Well , we could give it a specific code , you know , remote missing . 
Yeah , see that would just irritate me . 
So I think having a key-phrase is much better . 
No . 
That would be like a mid-class um  Yeah . 
So we don't actually have to go for  
Well , if they've just developed the sample sensor , sample speaker , it's a brand new chip . 
Why not introduce it in this way ? 
I think , well , we could d r do two 
or we could do one small lithium , 
'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products , right ? 
So they're more widely available now . 
And they also have a longer battery life than most batteries . 
But if you only have to replace it every five years . 
Well , how about a initial , you get one battery when you buy it , 
'cause I'm pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk . 
Yeah . 
In the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side , 
which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side , 
that could be particularly useful . 
Well , if it's just up and down  
Volume or channel . 
<laugh> I don't know . 
Mm yeah . 
We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then , 
'cause oth <other> otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , you know . 
Okay . 
<other> We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , 
so we'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo's available . 
Yeah , I don't think we should do that , because that would just be icky . 
So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea . 
For our base one ? <other> 
It'll wear off . <laugh> 
There's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual  
The only problem is we're using a latex overlay so  it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons , 
so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be . 
Yeah . 
Great . Play Doh . 
Wonderful 
Ooh .
