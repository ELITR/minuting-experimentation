A:  Okay . Hi Team . Hope you had a good lunch . <laugh> Okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting . Um let's get started . 
D:   
A:  'Kay , here is the agenda for today's meeting . Um we're gonna open it and I'm gonna keep the minutes as Project Manager . We're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . And we have forty minutes again . 'Kay , and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control . 


A:  Okay . Let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . Who would like to go first ? 
B:  Just trying to move mine right now . 
A:  Okay . Um Courtney would you mind starting us off ? Okay . 
D:  Yeah  . 
A:  Trend watching ? 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  'Kay . 
D:  Okay , so trend watching . Uh since we do put the fashion in electronics , it is kind of important how our product looks . So I guess we can go ahead and go to the next . 
D:  And , yep . And that's it . <laugh> 
A:  Hmm . Very good . I like it . <other> Okay , ready for the next slide ? Op mm 'kay . 
B:  <other> Okay . 
A:  Great . Great presentation . 


A:  Ready ? 
C:  Okay hang on . 
A:  'Kay . 
C:  See if it's there . <cough> 
A:  Which one is it ? 
C:  <other> I don't know . Hang on . Interface concepts , no ? 
A:   Interface concepts new . 
C:  Either refresh it , or it sh  Oh wait , maybe I didn't put it there . Hang on . 
A:  Y 'Kay . 
B:  Mine will always read copy of something or other . <laugh> I I copied mine before I sent it over . 
A:  Sorry ? Oh okay . 
C:  Sorry , hang on . Don't know  . 
A:  Oh there we go . 
C:  Okay . Okay , um <cough> looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . Uh if you wanna start the next slide . 
A:   Sure . 
D:  I have four of those remotes . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Good lord . <laugh> Okay . Ready ? Oh , yeah . Okay . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  That's it . 
A:  Great job . 


B:  Okay , my turn . 
D:  <laugh> Okay . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  Whoo . 
A:  What's the title ? 
B:  It'll be copy of component design . 
A:  Got it . 
B:  Yeah . Th that looks like it . 
B:  In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we're going to have to have multiples of each type , like a double-curved in rubber , um you know , each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options . So we'll have to mix it up , make sure we produce enough of everyone . But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , you know , double-curved wooden remotes . 
A:  Mm . 
D:  Right . Okay . 
A:  Hmm . Okay . Alright , well thank you for those informative presentations . Let's go back to um  Now we have to make some decisions . 
B:  And that's all I got . 
A:  Where were we ? 


C:  Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before , and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition . 
A:  Sure . 
C:  Um . 
D:  Oh this  the thing we were talking about earlier . 
C:  Right except that it's sort of odd , and I'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are , um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for  So , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , Jill , but 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme  do we program the responses and the questions . So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and can't change it in order for it to be recognised , or can it be altered in a certain way , or does the actually user program it , to say a channel means this . 
A:  Mm . Right . Right . 
D:  Yeah , like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options . So that way the remote reads it . 
C:  Right , so it's got like a limited memory and  programme it . So it's sort of iffy , but that's kind of what you'd say . 
A:  Mm . 
D:  I feel like voice recognition would be , I don't know , w it would be too hard to really  I mean we could do it , but  
A:  Hmm . Programme . If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology  
D:  Technology . 
B:  <other> Well , we are making the chip . So , I mean  
A:  Hmm . 
B:  But , I guess , we have to look at w what <other> our production cost is for the chip itself anyway . Yeah . 
D:  And it is a growing trend , the higher technological , like 
A:  Mm . 
D:  the , I mean just like the more advanced it is , 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  the better it'll sell . 
B:  I I thought <other> offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different , you know  I think we'd have to decide on the power options , maybe . So that we could reduce cost . Yeah . 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah , 'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy .  




A:  'Kay , well we're gonna wrap this up . Um next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes , and here's what we're each of us going to do . The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design , the U_I_D_ the user interface design . I think you're going to get a lot of , I mean , the final say on what buttons get put  We'll all talk about it , but I think , that's pretty much what you're gonna do , right ? 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  I guess . 'Kay . And you're gonna do some product evaluation . Okay , and right now , the I_D_ and U_I_D_ , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . 
B:  Great . Play Doh . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . Okay , and you should all be getting an email pretty soon . Alright . Well , thank you for a very productive meeting . 
C:  Fun . <laugh> 
B:  Wonderful Ooh .
