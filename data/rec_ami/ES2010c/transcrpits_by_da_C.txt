 
Okay 
hang on . 
See if it's there . 
<cough> 
<other> I don't know . 
Hang on . 
Interface concepts , 
no ? 
Either refresh it , 
or it sh  
Oh wait , 
maybe I didn't put it there . 
Hang on . 
Sorry , 
hang on . 
Don't know  . 
Okay . 
Okay , um <cough> 
looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . 
Uh if you wanna start the next slide . 
Um uh can't really see , but there's two possible ways , 
on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down , 
so you have that option right there . 
And then also there's the idea of the base . 
That's sort of like an idea there . 
And then on the right , we have what's really big trend right now , it's the iPod . 
It's becoming really  
and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons , 
and it's sort of like you have the both  kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and um and very simple , but technologically advanced . 
So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like <other> using that idea in a remote control 
then sort of look into it , 
but  Anyway , next . 
Um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight . 
You'd you know you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control . 
And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a V_ , 
and so yo you're kind of feeling a V_ like volume up . 
What it really is is a V_ and what it you think it is is down , because the down arrow . 
And so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up . 
Um but then you have  you could either do it by raised type , 
which could be you know , iffy , 
um sort of old-fashioned in a way . 
Either that or just have it by shape , 
for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow . 
And then the round ones you sort of feel by , you know , that's the second one down , that sort of thing . 
So it's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel . 
Okay . 
Um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic . 
Um this is particularly geared towards children . 
Um it's very cute , 
and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like a the for the company logo . 
Um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking . 
Um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain  
<other> channels that only these children would watch , 
so it's like they ch watch , you know , the C_ Beebies or something like that , 
uh keep them away from other channels . 
So that's like another ar Um , 
I mean , these are three examples sort of looking at it . 
You have the wider section for the main controls there . 
Uh you could see how many buttons there are . 
And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and a simpler design . 
On the bottom we probably wouldn't need that , 
because it's more for like a D_V_D_ <other> function which we are not gonna be using . Um . 
So again it's sort of like just give you ideas 
and then down at the bottom you have the logos 
and that's where you could put the R_R_ , Real Reaction . 
And then finally these are like the sort of same examples , 
but also some more , just possibilities that we could go with . 
None of them I'm particularly keen on by the way . <laugh> 
<cough> <other> But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of um , b or we'd like the the button size on this . 
Right . 
<laugh> 
That's it . 
 
Right . 
Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before , 
and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition . 
Um . 
Right 
except that it's sort of odd , 
and I'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are , 
um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for  
So , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , Jill , 
but 
I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme  do we program the responses and the questions . 
So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and can't change it in order for it to be recognised , 
or can it be altered in a certain way , 
or does the actually user program it , to say a channel means this . 
Right , 
so it's got like a limited memory and  programme it . 
So it's sort of iffy , 
but that's kind of what you'd say . 
I always feel like first I wanna know what it looks like , before  
'Cause if it's something really really small , then it's sort of harder to imagine a base for it , 
that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up  
Right . 
Well , the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons , so we want it to be bigger than this , 
'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons . 
Are you gonna lose it easier ? 
Yeah . 
So i That's the other thing , 
it's like  You know  
Are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size <other> period ? 
But like , you know , if we get more complicated then it's gonna v be  have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size . 
So we sh 
Yeah . 
I'm a away from the base . 
Yeah . 
Smaller and smaller , yeah , yeah , yeah . <laugh> 
<other> You're kidding . 
<laugh> 
Oh watches I've  but I've never washed a cell phone . <laugh> 
Well , titanium s 
I was saying that titanium , if we're being restricted then I would probably <other> lean away from that . 
Yeah . 
That'll  
Yeah , exactly . 
The selling point , yeah . 
Are we restricted by this ? 
Twenty five Euros 
 
<laugh> 
So you're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it's all gonna be cherry-coloured 
or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it ? 
Okay . 
The  
what the top face , right ? 
Yeah . 
A tracker , yeah . 
Well , my little sister got  for Christmas she got one of those key finders that's like a key-ring , and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work . 
And then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse , and you couldn't turn it off . 
So it became highly irritating . 
But then it  
Hmm . 
Okay . 
Well , that depends on what the energy is needed . 
As long as we sell it with it . 
Right , that's what I meant . 
What's it gonna  
Yeah , what's it gonna look like . 
Um . 
Well , my issue with that is if it got too big though , 
'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are , 
because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ? 
Yeah . 
But is that for   
Which ? 
Do we have both sides ? 
Well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side . 
Um what colour ? 
Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that . 
And that's at the bottom of it . 
Which button ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
I'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button . 
What's the button  
Well , w w then what's the button do , 
and how do you know that that is what the button does ? 
I guess . Just looking at examples , y you just don't ever see the logo on a button , it's always on the actual casing . 
<cough> 
But you don't  
But uh , yeah , you don't see it . 
Well , hang on . 
The other option is <other> , I don't know if you can see it but it's like if  
Yeah , 
it's like the second to last slide . 
Interface , yeah . 
Yeah . Um . 
<other> 
Okay , it's the very right one . 
You see at the bottom , 
it's kind of difficult to see , but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like , where the logo is , 
and if we have the replaceable section , it's like the top . 
It doesn't necessarily replace the entire top . 
And so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in . 
If c you envisioning it ? 
And so that stays the same when you have the logo , 
and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . Yeah , yeah . 
Right . 
That's like , you know ,  a a cellphone it's like the the screen is always just left opened . 
And so , what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the R_R_ ? 
Yellow . 
Yeah . 
Oh , that one . 
Um . Ha hang on  
<laugh> Let me catch up . 
Did we finalise what buttons we're including 
or we  just everything that we said before ? 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Fun . <laugh>
