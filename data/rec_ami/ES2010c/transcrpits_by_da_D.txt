 
Yeah  . 
Yeah . 
Okay , so trend watching . 
Uh since we do put the fashion in electronics , it is kind of important how our product looks . 
So I guess we can go ahead and go to the next . 
So what they want . 
Right now customers want fancy versus functional . 
Um basically about fifty eight percent of what they 
 like of the product that they want , describing like the  in order of how much they want , 
fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , 
and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use . 
So the customer basically is confused . 
They don't know exactly what they want . 
They want us to tell them .  
Yes . Exactly . 
So we can go to next . 
Okay . 
So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns . 
So I don't know if we want to go with that 
um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . 
I don't know really , 
I mean I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to 
rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff , you'd want like a softer touch . 
I mean do you guys know what I mean . 
Yeah . 
Um . But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , I don't know if we really want to go with that , 
because it is just a trend , 
and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months , 
because  
Yeah . 
I mean that could just be a Spring thing right now . 
Okay . Awesome . 
Um so design preferences , 
um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled 
so that , I mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem . 
Um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch , 
you said that in your design , 
with the bulb . 
Um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme . 
Uh we need the Real Reaction logo and colour scheme obviously . 
That's one of our key goals , we wanna promote our product . 
And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something . 
Actually right here . 
So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone 
like this , 
where we put the buttons around , like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle , 
I mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , 
and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape . 
'Cause then it'll appeal to older generation 
and like said retro's cool . 
So it's classically retro . 
So I mean that's just an idea if you guys like it . 
<other> And , 
yep . 
And that's it . <laugh> 
That's cute . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
I have four of those remotes . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Okay . 
That would be amazing , though , yeah . 
No , splinters would  
What is that ? 
Mm . 
Right . 
Okay . 
Oh this  the thing we were talking about earlier . 
Yeah , 
like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options . 
So that way the remote reads it . 
I feel like voice recognition would be , I don't know , w it would be too hard to really  
I mean we could do it , but  
Technology . 
And it is a growing trend , the higher technological , like 
the , I mean just like the more advanced it is , 
the better it'll sell . 
Yeah , 
'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy .  
Oh the base , yeah . 
W 
We need to decide , well so we can figure how big it's gonna be , like exactly what buttons we want 
and exactly  
It could be like this . 
Yes . 
I'd , well uh  
This one is really comfortable , 
like I like the sides whatever , 
because  
But if we have the um , the locator , then we don't have to worry about that . 
So we can make it small if we have a l locating device . 
Hmm . 
Two double A_s , for this size . 
Right . 
Yeah . 
Smaller , without  
Yeah . 
I think if we had a a locating device with the small one , I think that seems way more advanced . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
because I mean if even looking at cellphones right now , those trends the smaller the hotter it is , 
yeah  
<other> Oh . 
Yeah . 
Ouch . 
A phone , whoa , that would  wow , that would hurt . 
Yeah wood . 
Yeah , 
'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce a chip , titanium will be more expensive . 
Yeah . 
We could do that , 
because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if  
Good plan . 
Oh . 
Yeah , who knows . 
O or we could like take off this . 
Yeah . 
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah , 
because the soft latex definitely is squishy . 
That's in . 
Well I mean squishier than like , yeah , just a hard plastic . 
'Cause that uh  what it type of , yeah , 
for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like , 
because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time . 
So uh  
Ooh . 
Uh see I'm uh I'm strangely attracted to it , 
because I know that's  it's definitely gonna be big , 
because it's , I don't know , it's just so high-tech . 
Oh , 
then maybe voice 
maybe voice activation won't be good . 
Yeah , n n no , we just want it to be a finder . 
But do  can your  
can the department make  
Oh , brilliant then . 
Yeah , good point . 
I think triple A_ , it'll be lighter . 
I mean more more come in a package . 
Yeah . 
That's a good point . 
We could think about it and come back to it next meeting . 
We still have one more meeting . 
Yeah , it could be whatever , 
as long as there's something big in the middle , 
because like the old phones , there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle . 
Oh , that's true . 
Good point . 
So scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ? 
But we definitely  
If we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have 'em labelled . 
Yeah , 
like on the side of it . 
Oh if it's just up and down . 
Well , you could do some on both sides . 
Yeah . 
That's squishy . That's squishy . 
 have buttons . 
Yeah ,  that . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
or like a gun-metal grey , 
'cause then it combines the silver and the black . 
Yeah , buttons wear off . 
Hmm . 
But we want it to be seen . 
We need it to be seen . 
Right . 
Yeah . 
Some of tho 
Well , some of those buttons though are blue-based . 
Um well , a lot of those buttons are blue-based . 
Well , kind of . 
Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow . 
Like if we <other> 
like the one all the way on the left , 
uh you ca you can see it on your computer better . 
Um where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow . 
So we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons . 
Yeah . 
Mm yeah .
