Okay . 
Hi Team . 
Hope you had a good lunch . 
<laugh> Okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting . 
Um let's get started . 
'Kay , here is the agenda for today's meeting . 
Um we're gonna open it and I'm gonna keep the minutes as Project Manager . 
We're gonna have three presentations , 
one from each of you again . 
And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts 
and then we're gonna close it up . 
And we have forty minutes again . 
'Kay , and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control . 
Okay . 
Let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . 
Who would like to go first ? 
Okay . 
Um Courtney would you mind starting us off ? 
Okay . 
Trend watching ? 
'Kay . 
Mm 'kay . 
<laugh> 
Mm . Mm . 
Right . Yes . 
Right . 
Right . 
People don't buy a new remote every so often . 
Okay . 
Hmm . 
Very good . I like it . 
<other> Okay , ready for the next slide ? 
Op mm 'kay . 
Great . Great presentation . 
Ready ? 
'Kay . 
Which one is it ? 
 
Interface concepts new . 
Y 
'Kay . 
Sorry ? 
Oh okay . 
Oh there we go . 
 
Sure . 
Mm 'kay . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
 
<cough> 
Okay . 
'Kay . 
No . 
Mm . 
Or I like , you know , the black finish or the silver finish or whatever . 
<laugh> Good lord . 
<laugh> Okay . Ready ? 
Oh , yeah . Okay . 
Great job . 
Okay . 
What's the title ? 
Got it . 
Hmm . 
Interesting . 
 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
'Kay . 
No , okay . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Okay . Alright , 
well thank you for those informative presentations . 
Let's go back to um  
Now we have to make some decisions . 
Where were we ? 
Sure . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Right . 
Right . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Programme . 
If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology  
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Okay , that kind of brings us to this , 
let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . Um . 
Do we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ? 
The base , the charging base with rechargeable batteries ? 
Hmm . 
Yeah , 
and we don't have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the T_V_ . 
It's not gonna be a huge universal remote . 
What size battery and  
Right . I agree , 
it's either gonna be bigger with a base or smaller with just  
A battery like this guy . 
Alright , so what direction do you want to go in ? 
You wanna vote ? 
I'm kind of I'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of 
bigger and the base . 
That just seems so clunky and  
Okay . 
<other> 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
Okay , so what kind of material do we want to be made out of ? 
No . 
Oh what did you  
Oh sorry , 
go ahead . 
Right . 
What would you recommend ? 
Mm . 
I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm 
not sure that we'll have the time and money to <other> produce a whole array of 
remotes . 
If this was a successful remote , we might then produce a higher end version of it , I think . 
Okay , so we wanna go for plastic , 
or what would you recommend for materials ? 
Hmm . 
 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
They could buy cases , maybe , 
if they wanted . 
I think it's good to sell a basic thing and then sell options . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Right . Right . 
Okay , and what kind of chip would we need for this guy ? 
I don't think we should do voice , 
I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost , you know . 
 could we  
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
Right . 
<laugh> 
Oh dear . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Alright . But it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say , channel up , and it would work , 
right ? 
Just a  
Okay , alright . 
No . 
Mm 'kay . 
Uh and what size batteries , double A_ , triple A_ ? 
Two ? 
Could it run off of two  
They're more expensive though , too . 
Mm . 
Thoughts anybody ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . Alright . 
Okay . 
So we've covered that first category , 
User Interface Concept , 
meaning design . 
Okay . 
I ki I kind of <other> like your idea about the retro phone dial , 
and that  the central button could have , maybe our logo on it ? 
It might be the four way scroll , too . 
I mean if  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Oh , I see what you mean . 
I think so . 
Yeah , I like that . 
'Kay . 
Mm . 
Can we ? 
So that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
'Kay any other ideas ? 
Oh , yeah . Latex covers . W 
I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though , 
because if people are able to change the covers , 
I don't know , 
maybe the on-off button , something , some  the menu button , 
I don't know , 
but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get 
another one . 
Are they all gonna have our company logo on them ? 
Every cover ? 
Yeah . 
If we want it to be visible and  
Um are all those  those one that you showed where they were um s met silver-metallic looking ? 
But those are plastic , right ? 
They're not titanium . 
I kind of like that look . 
Uh but , or if it was really  
Yeah , for the base 
or if we're going for the retro look , I think , like a really shiny black would be cool . 
What are your thoughts ? 
Gun-metal gray . 
There you go , gun-metal gray . 
Why ? 
Mm . 
Right . 
On the back ? 
It d visible  
Visibility though  
'Cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery . 
I can find it again . 
Okay . 
And yours was called Interface Concept ? 
This one ? 
Well , for some reason I can't get it to just go to that slide directly . 
Mm 
Okay , yes 
yes . 
Okay . 
Like a little cut-out kind of  
Okay . 
Anybody see anything that they liked in these ones ? 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yellow , I like that idea . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
I like the yellow illumination idea , very good . 
Okay . 
Any other ideas or thoughts ? 
We all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so  
'Kay . 
I think there will be time for that later . 
I'm guessing . 
'Kay , well we're gonna wrap this up . 
Um next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes , 
and here's what we're each of us going to do . 
The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design , 
the U_I_D_ the user interface design . 
I think you're going to get a lot of , I mean , the final say on what buttons get put  
We'll all talk about it , 
but I think , that's pretty much what you're gonna do , 
right ? 
I guess . 
'Kay . And you're gonna do some product evaluation . 
Okay , and right now , the I_D_ and U_I_D_ , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Okay , and you should all be getting an email pretty soon . 
Alright . 
Well , thank you for a very productive meeting .
