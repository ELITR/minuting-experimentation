Hello <laugh> . 
'Kay . 
Newsflash ? D did I miss something ? 
Okay . 
No . 
Mm . 
I think you have to uh change your desktop uh 
size . 
 computer is uh not functioning ? 
Uh display . 
And then uh settings ? 
Mm I'm not sure I  . 
No . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> Format . <laugh> 
I made uh uh my own map . 
It's a  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah wa wa you actually  
Yeah . 
But it it's not clear what you have to to to type uh type in your presentation . 
Yeah . 
Really . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Yeah . <laugh> I was wondering uh  
But you you've got more information than  uh . 
But where did you get uh that information ? 
Okay . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
It's  
F_ five . 
Okay . 
Oh . 
What is this ? 
Oh no . <laugh> 
How do I uh  
No no no . I pressed the mouse button . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . Okay . 
Okay . 
Um if you all go stand around uh  
Computer  
Um  <laugh> 
No . 
Okay . 
I uh had uh two examples . 
Um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons . 
This the easy one 
I think we have to to combine them . And uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples . 
Um but yeah the the age is uh under forty ? 
So we  
Okay so so we have the option for more functions . 
Um  yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh yeah this this one we can remove for kids . 
It's just only for adults so uh we can uh use some advanced options . 
But  
Yeah but I prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah . 
We have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button . 
But if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else , you should use use an uh an advanced option . 
Okay one device . 
Okay . I didn't see  . 
<laugh> Okay and I also uh yeah . W yeah . 
We have to make it fashionable . Like you uh said uh before . 
Uh yeah the basic functions . 
Um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Did I uh  
did I break it ? <laugh> 
For for the advanced functions I think . 
Like searching for channels and  
Yeah . 
Okay . 
That's uh  
I'm al I'm almost finished so  
<laugh> Um the  
we have to to to watch out for the  i if we make it f very fashionable , it it the functional functionality will go down . 
So we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable 
yeah content and form . 
<laugh> Now that that was uh was the end . 
Yes . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh  
Yeah . 
But uh it's it's also for children or just uh  
Okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
We we have to  
And if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product . 
Yeah that's that's why uh I wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions . 
The the simple functions for for the the whole public , and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh  
Na 
I w I should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
L left top or right uh top ? 
Yeah , right . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah but if you are using the the normal functions , the the basic functions , you normally press them on the u yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
You broke it . <laugh> 
Yeah yeah . 
And volume control . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> And do we need a a logo on our uh remote control , or  
On the left uh top yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah may maybe because you're  
Yeah okay but  only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option , you're going to press the the menu button and then  yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay the  yeah . That's possible . 
Yeah , okay . 
Okay we put it on top . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
If we  
Yeah it it's just a remote control so  
Yeah . 
Television uh itself uh  
Mm . 
We we could make an option for it , but uh you can disable s 
Yeah . 
But uh the the television itself has also the the options  brightness and uh screen colour etcetera . So  
yeah . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
No that's  
Okay  
On the uh 
yeah can you i make a a map with with all the  
yeah 'cause it's now  there are lots and lots of documents 
and  
The the layout of the remote control ? 
Isn't that more the the u uh the user interface part ? 
Yeah . 
But do I have to to uh to yeah to make the the menu layout also ? Or  
Are you going to do that ? 
Yeah ? I I'm going to make  
yeah o okay . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Y you you are going to make a list of what functions are uh are going to to be on the the screen , the menu screen . 
And I'm going to make a a nice menu uh with with  pages and yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
W we  
Uh I think we have to to group , to make two groups . 
Um the  one group for the for the display , and one group for the basic functions , 
and  
Yeah okay 
but we we have a m 
yeah but maybe that's that's not uh  
yeah if you're if you're z zapping uh with your uh yeah remote control , you can press the the menu button , and then you are suddenly into the the yeah the display . 
Yeah . 
Yeah j just just group group the  
yeah we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions . 
So we make a yeah a line between them . 
F oh yeah . Okay yeah we swap uh  <laugh> Okay . 
Yeah . 
So we make it a  
Okay . 
Uh  
Yeah . 
So we have a a menu button and a s 
Okay . Okay and back button . 
Yeah I'm I'm not s clear about uh the the extra two buttons . 
We have a menu button and  
That's the the one with the  
yeah okay . 
Okay . 
Okay 
so that that's not uh  Yeah that  Those are 
multifunctional .
