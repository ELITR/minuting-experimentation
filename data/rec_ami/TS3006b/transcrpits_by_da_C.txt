 . 
It's  
I don't know . 
I didn't see it yet I think . 
Hey what's wrong with my computer ? 
 . 
Huh ? 
What the  
Not really . 
Sorry . 
Okay . Where do I find this ? 
I'm not so g 
display huh ? 
Appearance ? 
No 
what was it about ? 
Yeah my computer is not functioning properly . 
Yeah yeah . No but my screen is reduced in size . <other> 
Yeah . 
Feedback . 
Okay . 
This is dreadful . 
No not this , but the task . 
<laugh> Yeah . <laugh> No that's okay . 
No I just flapped it , closed it , took it here and then this happened . 
Ah . Uh  
where was it ? In settings ? 
Okay . Alright . 
Thank you . 
Do you guys like your tasks ? 
I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this I get my function you know the information that I need . 
So frustrating . 
So  
Yeah  
Yeah exactly . 
This presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause I hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so  
Really annoying . 
Yeah . 
Ts 
So they do need to be in the  
Alright . 
By the way my T_V_ doesn't have an equ equaliser but 
 okay . 
No . <laugh> Alright . 
By the way where did you guys get that newsflash from ? 
I didn't get anything . 
Alright . 
Do we have  
uh yeah  . 
Alright . 
<laugh> 
It's  th 
that's the self-destruct button . 
Alright . 
Mm-hmm . 
And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech  
alright . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Alright . 
Ah look . 
We have your uh  
oh never mind . <other> 
 . 
Okay . 
Well my presentation is a bit uh sucky . <laugh> 
Yeah a little bit . 
Uh no . 
No no . 
<other> 
Yeah I think that would be it then .  
I have no idea . 
That w  . 
Let me check . 
I know . 
Yeah . 
Alright how do I uh skip pages ? 
The keys yeah ? 
Alright . 
Um yeah well I was working on this before I got my information . 
So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls . 
And well the info on the website which came too late . 
Um so I didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet . 
So uh uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting . 
Those were my uh starting points . 
Uh I was working on a s yeah on a schedule , and I was supposed to do it like this . 
But um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow , so I was trying to organise them for myself . 
And then make the 
the design , a the actual design , 
but I never came around to do that . 
So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it . 
I mean everything speaks for itself I guess . 
Mean you press a button um <other> the it tru goes , it sends a signal to a chip , 
which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies . 
And uh or temporal fr frequencies actually . 
And then uh through a uh transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the T_V_ 
and the T_V_ will translate it into a function . 
Um  
<other> Yeah well this was actually <laugh> all I got around to do . 
I mean I dunno if I'm too slow for this stuff , but uh  
Yeah . Whatever . 
Yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust I have customised the screen functions , if you know what I mean . 
The uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions . 
But maybe elderly people don't understand it so well , so they need a simpler remote . 
And yeah that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever . 
Yeah . 
Experienced yeah . 
The remote ? 
Right top . 
Yeah definitely . 
 . 
And might be easier huh ? 
Yeah I  
Yeah exactly . 
I thought  but this is really your department , that we need just the functional display and four cursors . 
And  
Yeah okay . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Why did we wanna put the display in the bottom ? 
Okay . 
Because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display . 
Normal for logical t 
Yeah . 
On once it's on it's on . You don't need the power button . 
Yeah . 
Maybe on the top or even on the side . 
True . 
<other> But if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this , if you put it on the top on the side  
I dunno . Should be able to work . 
Never mind . 
Can we leave this up to you ? <laugh> 
Yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh and image options right ? 
<other> Like uh bass uh  
so we need kind of an equaliser . 
If you  
Yeah treble , middl middle , bass or something . 
Ah as  
 . 
 . 
<laugh> 
Yes please . 
 the mono stereo option ? 
And there there was something else also . 
And then pitch . 
The fr yeah the frequency of the tones , yeah . 
Yeah isn't that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you're watching . 
And yeah in the functionality of the 
no no of the remote 
uh do do we want uh the buttons to make sound when you press them ? As a confirmation or whatever you know ? 
I dunno . 
Under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things . 
Yeah . 
But so we have we have T_V_ options , which is all this . 
The sound , sound and image . 
And you have in that uh the indeed the remote control options . 
So we need two menus kind of thing . 
Uh-huh . 
Alright . 
Help . 
 working design . Doch . 
<other> He only has to figure out how it has to look . 
And how 
to use  
Yeah okay . 
But  
You did your homework . But um  yeah . Okay . 
No no . It should be able to do any remote . 
No . 
Thank god . 
Uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote I think are in my department . 
I have to know what it has to do , 
so if you wanna you know the changing the channels kind of s thing is , I have to integrate that in the design . 
Yeah . 
I think that's a that's a good separation . 
Mm . 
Yeah we have to kind of work together . 
If if I make the the the yeah the menu like , I have to state which function has to be in the menu , 
and then you have to decide , it's , in a in a way that b is user-friendly . 
Yeah . 
I think  yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
You wanna separate uh <other> 
I think you should . 
It's easier . 
If you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing . 
No . 
Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons ? So that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up . 
N 
Yeah and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button . 
I think not . 
Yeah keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu . 
The pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is , 
sorry 
sorry , uh is uh if you're pressing up and down , you can easily press the okay once you , when you're not already at your choice . 
You wanna close down huh ? <laugh> 
That's okay . 
Already . 
Alright . 
How m how long is the lunchbreak ? 
Okay . 
Mm . 
This is  
Yeah . 
Sorry for my uh not finished presentation uh . 
<laugh> Bring it on . 
Alright . 
<laugh> I'll try to . 
So first we have a lunchbreak now ? 
Alright . 
Mm-hmm . 
I dunno where she  .
