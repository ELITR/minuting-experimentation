You all saw the newsflash ? 
Or you got the same message ? 
<laugh> Yeah sorry . 
Yeah . 
Yeah I received an email so I thought I I can't mail you so I thought I'd just drop it in the folder , but  
Is it unlocked ? 
Woah . 
I uh kind of opened it  . 
Uh  
Okay . 
'Kay . Everybody ready ? 
No no no . Yes yes yes . 
<other> Okay . 
'Kay . Can we get started 
or is there some pressing issue ? 
Oh no pressing . 
<laugh> Did you plug in the power cable when you come back ? 
<laugh> Yeah . That's difficult . Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Format save . 
Yeah . 
Oh yeah sure . 
You have Playstation also ? 
Huh . 
Okay . So there we are again . 
Yeah . 
Okay this is the agenda . 
Um we have three presentations , I heard . 
Yeah really . 
<laugh> So who wants to start ? 
Yeah . 
Uh this is you ? 
'Kay . 
Yeah . 
<other>  often . 
<other> Next generation does . <laugh> 
N not used anymore . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Not by mail . 
I receiv the mail but you don't . So  
That's in the presentation , so  
Uh below I believe . 
Yeah below forty . 
Mm-hmm . 
Our current customers are in the age group forty plus . 
And the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty . 
That's in a newsflash . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
But it also needs to have corporate identity . 
Present and the colours . 
<other> So we can't change much of that . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
<other> 'Kay . 
It's open already so you can use  to 
find yours . 
F_ five . 
<laugh> Go Jurgen . 
<laugh> You pressed alt F_ four ? <laugh> 
Oh great . <laugh> 
<other> Yeah . 
Uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
That's nice . <laugh> 
F_ five . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
The mm yeah . 
<other> Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . So n it's very easy . 
Now yeah it's okay . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
so maybe you can hide them or something . 
Yeah you make a screen menu or something . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah 
and the other oth other uh functionality is the screen . 
What does the screen do ? 
Yeah . It's low power . 
So what does the screen do ? 
They said they needed it but what does it do ? 
What do they want with the screen ? 
Yeah that's what we make it up . 
So but what did the marketing  
No . 
Yeah okay it's handy . 
With no predefined uh  
We're back online . <laugh> 
Okay . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . Content and form . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> That was the end . 
Okay . 
Uh which one is it ? Technical functions ? 
This one ? 
Functional requirements ? 
No . 
You didn't put it in ? Or  
 it's not really English . <laugh> 
Uh kick off . 
Oh working design I got it . 
Here you go . 
Just uh press uh  
yeah . Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Design yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah decoder . 
<laugh> Blank . Yeah okay . 
<laugh> Work harder . 
Yeah . 
Uh  
'Kay . Um 
for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for T_V_ . 
Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty , 
but I don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well . 
And uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control . 
And we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let's see what was it , uh the target group . 
We have to make be clear what that is . 
Yeah users . 
Yeah so I think it's easy but  
Yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to  
Okay . 
So below forty is okay . 
But we need an  lower level which to s uh focus . 
So is it from sixteen to forty ? Is it from twenty to forty ? Is it from thirty ? 
Yeah ? 'Kay . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Design . Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> And maybe y 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
So is  you should have a menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are  
Yeah . Aye yeah . 
Shall I uh  
Yeah . It's okay . 
 no , it doesn't have line control , so  
Yeah we get the  <laugh> 
The remote , yeah ? 
Basic . 
Is on top . 
Which should be easy , easily reached with the thumb . 
T I s should said right . 
Mm-hmm . 
Do the also with the thumb . 
So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb , also reach the middle . 
Or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly . 
You you need to be able to hold it so  
Yeah . 
Yeah okay that's true . Layout . 
That's for the  
<laugh> 
I can't help it . <laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Man . <laugh> 
Yeah okay . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
You want the normal piece of paper ? And you have a pen ? 
Yeah ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Uh . 
And the for flipping up and down . 
Yeah . 
And left to right . 
And those can also be used for the menu . 
Yeah . 
Yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things  
For the menu . Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah but that depends on where you put the screen . 
But it's essential that there is a screen . 
Yeah . 
And for the speech uh recognition part , if we want to incorporate that , we need a microphone . 
Yeah . 
This would be uh  
No that's not s sure so  
uh we need a display . 
Yeah . 
Yeah they're used to it . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
Yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so  
I think that top is the best option . 
Yeah okay . 
Depends on the sensitivity of the microphone , but I think that's okay . 
Volume . 
Up . 
Channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options . 
So maybe it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the L_C_D_ screen . 
Yeah 
so sounds ? 
Yeah 
and they're  
They're not used often so  
<laugh> 
Yeah just  
Yeah sounds . 
Yeah . 
Of course . 
I'm just a <laugh> secretary . 
<laugh> Coffee ? 
Treble bass . 
Uh  
Pitch I believe , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah and mono stereo . 
Mm . 
And also the tuning part ? 
Yeah programming . 
So channel programming ? 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Contrast yeah . 
Mm . No . 
Uh , so contrast , 
bright , 
uh  
And the others were in your presentation right ? 
So I can just copy those ? 
Okay . <laugh> It's easy . <laugh> 
Yeah the button options and the L_C_D_ options . 
Indeed . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Yeah 
you have basically a button menu , which you can use directly , uh according to the old principle . 
And the L_C_D_ options are activated by some some software options , thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah . 
<cough> So you  
You have an additional processor and and software part . 
Compared to o 
Mm-hmm . 
L_ s 
Yeah . 
Colour . 
Yeah I I call it contrast . 
Yeah I make it c colour . 
Yeah . 
Yeah and automatically um  
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
Yeah so I've g channel program is autoseek ? 
<other> Uh name a channel , or  
Oh they get automatic names , okay . 
 . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
but can you also say I want f uh Veronica on the channel number uh five or  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
How do you call that ? <laugh> 
Channels ? 
Yeah . 
Ninety nine or something . Yeah . 
S swap channels ? 
Can I call it that ? 
Swap's good option . 
Okay . 
Uh other functions ? 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Okay . 
Well that's 's up to uh Mister User Interface Designer . 
<other> Also . 
That's  you're  
<other> Yeah but also , which buttons you have to press to get a certain result ? 
And the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was , as I believe . 
<laugh> 
No I don't think so . 
But I think the communication with the television is difficult . 
But that's not our part . 
We don't have to design a protocol so  
<other> 
No that's the  
Yeah . 
So but  
Um  
The User Interface Designer can design a menu for all these function 
I put them on the <other>  
 . 
Yeah . Yeah I can . 
I'll just try to reorganise uh things . 
Um  
So you design the basic function menu for the L_C_D_ screen ? 
Uh um  
I think <other> 
th I think the yeah the layout of the screen 
and I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the  
 . 
No I d I think that's more in  
 . 
Yeah . 
Okay . So he's layout and you're function . 
Form function okay . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
I think i that's your department yes , 
because w he already knows what  
Yeah . 
But we're not allowed . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result , 
because that's always the difficulty . 
Every device has its own  
Menu okay . 
Mm . 
Back . 
Yeah . 
Yeah but they're incorporated  ? 
Up and down is  
Smart ? 
Put it on top . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well  
But that's uh J Jurgen's department . 
You just make the layout . 
You  
do we do the extra two buttons or not ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah okay . That's true . 
And to , okay and back , also . 
And of course the four arrows . 
But those are still y doubly used . 
Both the L_C_D_  
Yeah . 
Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen . 
You can navigate . 
But you can also navigate the channels . And the volume . 
Those are both both  
yeah . 
Oh five minutes . 
Light uh  
Yeah sure . 
Okay . 
Um  
Anything else ? 
I've  
Volume . 
Well we have those buttons . We use all four . 
Yeah okay go ahead . 
Yeah that was already decided . 
Okay that's what we decided earlier on . 
Right okay . So  
yeah I wanna close down . 
I have to , sorry . 
it's not because I don't like you but  
yh we have lunch break , 
and then we can work for thirty minutes , 
and I have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes . 
And then uh we'll see  
I don't know . 
Nobody told me . <laugh> 
No I th believe there's first lunch break . 
Yeah . 
Or you can just  
Yeah ? 
'Kay . 
<other> 
I think you can put uh the laptop back in the room and  
<other> 'Kay . 
Yeah it's a lot of pressure . 
That's okay . 
Oh yeah . <other> 
<laugh> 
I don't know if it works but it should be saved . 
Yeah . 
It's uh  
Should be here . Smart board . 
Don't know if you can use it but  
Yeah . 
I try to organise it by these three . 
Yeah  yeah yeah . 
I don't really mind . 
I just put the minutes here and we'll see . 
Yeah that's in the functional design uh folder . 
Yeah . Yeah that's just basically what I just showed . 
Yeah . Yeah I got it by  
yeah . 
I'm gonna get kicked if I don't do it so  <laugh> 
<other> Make me proud . 
Yeah . 
I believe so . 
 just ask . <laugh>
