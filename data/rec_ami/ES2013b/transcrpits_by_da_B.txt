Oops . 
Uh I think so , 
we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well . 
<laugh> Okay . 
Oy , 
big loop under the table . 
Could  can I ask where these figures come from , 
is this market research we've  
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Um  
How d I'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . 
I expect an Industrial Designer should know that , 
but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty , um is that a lot or a little ? 
<laugh> Sh surely he's in the wrong age group . 
He must be w one of a s small population . <laugh> 
And if you want it to go into slide show mode , it's that little button there . 
I you can if you like , 
it it  that that just sets it up to do a p a p 
no 
that one , that one there . 
Left , left a bit , left a bit , 
that one , yep . 
Cheers . 
Mm , I haven't actually got a display on my screen . 
Still , I'll do without that . 
Okay um , now 
I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid 
and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work . 
<other> Um oh 
and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting . 
Um basically 
I've been doing a little bit of web-based research , 
<other> and if I had a design team , I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em . 
But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design 
that I'd like to discuss with you . 
So , 
let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . 
It's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared . 
<other> And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface 
and  
which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit 
that actually composes the message um based on what the  which buttons the user presses , 
we turn that into a message , 
um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . 
Now 
I would have hoped  
I think that's my only slide actually , 
yeah . 
I would have have hoped to um do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of um my first cut design , 
but unfortunately the technology defeated me , 
so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard . <other> 
So 
we want an energy source 
which is there . 
And we've got to think about what that might be . 
Uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing . 
Uh typically it would be a battery , 
but I'm open to suggestions . <laugh> 
then we have the the user interface . 
Oops . 
Um and 
And the main components in there are the the th the chip 
that actually has the intelligence of the machine 
that translates button presses into a message , 
which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , 
which encodes it 
and sends the message to the receiver . 
So 
those are the basic things 
that we've got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty . <other> 
Thank you . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well 
I may be wrong here , 
but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . 
We're trying to sell four million of 'em , 
um that's that's , you know , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . 
Um and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing , 
you just  
if it goes wrong you chuck it out , 
and that's why I'm a bit concerned . 
I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , 
but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need  gonna need to hit . 
<laugh> 
Um , I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna <laugh> give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , 
but  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Well 
I uh think that's a very interesting idea , 
but um I'm not a very good industrial designer 
and I don't know much about what these things cost . 
<laugh> I'll do some research for the next meeting . 
Well 
solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night , 
but  
Yeah , I guess . 
We may be talking quite heavy then . 
Mm-hmm . 
So 
do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ? 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Yeah , 
I was wondering that , 
because I ag I agree that there there're people with uh how can I put it , more money than sense 
and who are liable to buy <laugh> something new , 
but  
<laugh> Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they they may be buying um , you know , personal music devices and all that , 
are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? 
Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , 
I don't know . 
Mm . I think we've got a big hill to climb here , 
haven't we ? 
I mean we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead . 
Right , good point . Yeah , yeah okay , yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah , good point . 
Mm-hmm . 
Do you want the gizmo ? 
H how does that work ? 
How  so so how does that work , 
how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ? 
Okay , yep , mm-hmm . 
It's not getting a bit complicated ? 
Could granny do this , 
or are we just not aiming at granny ? 
<laugh> 
Mm . <laugh> 
Uh . 
How do you do that ? How do you make it do both ? 
Ah okay , 
it toggles through , 
yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
<other> Sounds good . 
Okay . 
So 
we're still in meeting , 
aren't we ? <laugh> 
Okay .
