Yes . 
Yeah , I do . 
Uh not really meant to touch those microphones . 
Oh it doesn't have any on , 
does it ? 
That's fine . 
Uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research 
on like how much more it would be 
and any , you know , existing examples , 
and what reactions to them have been , and that sort of thing . 
Yeah , press them . 
Yeah , here we go . 
Can I not just uh do each one in order ? 
That ? 
That ? 
That ? 
Right , 
technical functions design . 
Uh well 
I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah . I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . 
So 
my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . 
And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition , 
that's not something I'd thought about at all , 
but it's also something we can discuss . 
Um and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , T_V_ remote control . 
So 
these are two models of existing remote controls . 
Uh the one on the left seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control . 
It has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . 
It also has  seems to have channel up and channel down , 
which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control 
where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . 
Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , 
which has  it also has play , stop and pause and everything , 
I don't think we need them at all . 
I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down 
and I think an an enter function where you can access  it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . Uh 
not related to the internet one that you mentioned , 
because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do . 
So 
it 
really exceed the requirements , 
'cause the requirements really are just  want to be able to change channels and functions , 
which is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons 
o 
I was thinking something  some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access . 
Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech um recognition possibility . 
No . 
But we could go back to the pictures of the  uh , what're they called ? The pictures of the remote controls 
and possibly discuss what we think about them , 
but <other> maybe should hear what Kate has to say first . 
Okay then . 
Definitely less cluttered 
and  I mean 
but still it's  
Sorry 
I was just  
I'll just uh resume something else I was gonna say . 
The the style of these is terrible . 
<laugh> I I I really think we need to uh 
not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , just every e yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised . <laugh> 
But  
So 
that's that for now . 
Whoop . 
<laugh> Isn't that your job ? 
<laugh> Oh right . 
Yeah . <other> 
It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , 
the  
which is pretty much the same as these existing models , 
just maybe a little bit more inspired , 
but basically just the same . 
Although what what uh suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries 
which which is really not very efficient at all . 
Could it be possible to have uh , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an M_P_ three player does ? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . 
You could  you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , 
and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , 
and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries , 
which are  
You'd never need uh batteries 
would y uh 
yeah . 
And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa . 
<laugh> But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not . 
<laugh> 
Well 
it is just so annoying how  
No , 
but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably  I mean it might cost more to  at first to develop and to install , 
but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer 
and 
you know f 
Mm . 
Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in . 
Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
That's probably more what it is . 
<laugh> We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day , 
are we ? 
Yeah . 
Sorry , 
I was miles away . 
I was re I was reading the chart to be honest . 
<laugh> Who's got an iPod then ? <laugh> 
Yeah , 
things like screen settings and audio settings , I would generally do them on the actual television itself , 
like here you have a you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself . 
I I wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control , 
so um I would say that they are definitely less relevant . 
<laugh> 
Yes . 
We didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though . 
Alright , 
well 
that's fine then . 
Mm . 
Sorry , 
what what actually are these  
is that the yellow and black ? 
From their  
I'll just use it from their website . 
<other> Okay .
