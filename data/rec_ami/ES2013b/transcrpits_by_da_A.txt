Uh it fell off . 
One , two , three , four , 
yeah , we're ready . 
Okay . 
Welcome to this second meeting . 
Um it's now quarter after twelve 
and we're given forty minutes um for this meeting . 
This is a meeting on functional design . 
Um and I wanna welcome you all 
and thank you all for doing some research in between . 
Um I did  took the minutes from the first meeting 
and I'll show them to you in a moment . 
Um I know each of you have a presentation 
and um in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , 
um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , 
because there's  I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements 
and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have . 
Okay ? 
Is this ap 
everybody agree with this ? 
Okay . 
Um and after the meeting there'll be things to be done 
and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . 
<other> Um but uh now 
for the minutes of the first meeting . 
And go to that one . 
Um as you can see it was this earlier today . 
Um Kate , Steph , Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . 
I opened the meeting , 
the product was developed uh and reviewed , 
and we talked about the financial end of it . 
Um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . 
And we closed early 
so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting 
<other> Anybody have any questions on those minutes ? 
Are they complete , 
did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? 
'Kay . 
Did I miss something ? 
Yeah . 
I'm afraid I incorporated <laugh> that when I said who was present , 
but  yes , we did , 
and we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures , 
but I didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily . 
So um 
as a group I think we've  are  they're accepting the minutes . 
And uh  
okay . 
Yeah . 
Good . 
Um , then we'll move to the three presentations . 
Okay ? 
Okay . 
Mm we need to move this . 
Who wants to go f first ? <makes straining sound> 
That's as far as it goes . 
She said we didn't need to screw it in . 
It's doing its thing . 
There we are . 
Now 
in between , as the Project Manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be 
and the internet is coming in as important , 
but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_ 
um with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan . 
um that teletext is outdated um 
Mm . 
Hmm . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Is that a large enough target market to target it ? 
In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ? 
Or eight million . 
Hmm . 
<other> Yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> <laugh> 
Mm . 
But we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen , 
that's looking at age groups . 
Leap . <laugh> 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
Okay , 
you had the other power channel . 
Okay . 
Alright . 
And we'll turn to the next presentation . 
I think she said we don't need to screw it in , 
just stick it in . 
And then press , what ? 
F F_N_ and F_ eight . 
Next to the control button on the bottom , 
and then F_ eight at the top . 
And then w be patient . <laugh> 
Tada . 
There we are . Yay . 
Okay . 
T_V_ only . 
<other> Ugh . 
Hmm . 
Mm . 
And exceed the requirements they're expecting of us . 
Okay . 
Alright . 
Okay . 
Any uh thing else you wanna add ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . Let's hear what Kate has to say . 
Hmm . 
I think the white  that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered , <other>  
It's there 
but it's  
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
 
Okay . 
Hmm-mm . 
Hmm . <other> Okay . Right . 
But those things  as long as we can get those components , 
the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in 
of  
what what does it look like ? 
What do the buttons look like ? 
Uh what does it feel like ? 
That's where the user interface is really coming into its own . 
The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , 
but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . For example the battery energy source 
or um what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? 
Um is there any um  
because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for D_V_D_s , movies , whatever . 
Um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ? 
Mm . 
<other> Okay . 
Okay . 
<laugh> Oh . 
Mm . What they cost . 
<laugh> Okay . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
Uh yeah . 
Mm . 
It would have to sor store up the energy 
and then use it . 
Solar can do that . 
M yeah , that would be too heavy 
and it'd cost too much . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
And the dock could look very fancy 
and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ? 
Pretty much , 
so that we'd be looking for the younger end . 
Mm . 
<laugh> I I s usually put more money than brains . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? 
We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it . 
What would be a more efficient way of doing it ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . Right . 
<laugh> Probably not . 
Um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions . 
Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive . 
Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys . 
It has to have big user-friendly buttons 
and sh n <other> definitely we wanna be inspired 
that the current <other> styles are just plain awful . 
Is that agreeable to everyone ? 
Mm-hmm . 
Throw some light on that . 
Um actually we're , you know , we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes , 
so we have to get close to finishing . <other> 
Ah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Enter , power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key . 
Is that okay with you ? 
Would that  <laugh> 
uh-huh . 
Then you'd have to have an off te off key . 
Mm . 
Mm . Okay . 
Mm . 
Okay . So 
I guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do . 
As you said , you know , don't make it too hard for the granny . <laugh> 
I just joined that set last week . 
Um <laugh> first grandchild arrived . 
Um so are we agreed then of those things ? 
And let's go back to agenda 
and hook me up . 
Mm . This oughta be fun . 
It probably won't go the first time , 
it'll probably be like a g mess . 
Come on . 
Uh it lost it off here . <laugh> Uh  
No , 
it was up there , 
but I couldn't see it down here . 
Mm . This time it should be both . 
There we go . 
Um you have to keep doing the financi the the F_N_ and F_ eight to  
five minutes to finish , 
thank you a lot for telling me . 
Um right , 
we're ready to close . 
Um  will be completed q questionnaire , 
um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um 
and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together . 
Um your individual assignments are for um Kate to do the components , 
for you , Steph , to do the user interface 
and for you the trend-watching . 
Um and each of us will get help from our coach . 
Are we agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch ? 
Okay . 
Then that's the end of this meeting . 
And I hope that's good enough for her <laugh> to tell her that's the end . 
Okay ? 
Well 
I think I went over the functions 
and wrote them down 
and marked them . 
Um that's what I went over and nobody was objecting to them . 
Okay . 
Um the teletext is outdated , 
the internet is important , 
it's only to be for a T_V_ 
and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan um 
which I think is more in the user uh range , with Steph . 
It doesn't tell me . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay ?
