Hello . 
I s 
No , no , 
you you can start . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . The second one . 
Could you please show the presentation number three . 
Yeah . 
Three . 
<other> 
Yes . 
 Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second . 
Uh , n n no , it's the first one . 
The second one . 
Uh yeah . 
Okay . 
 
Okay . So I am going to talk about  a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . 
I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , 
but okay , we can discuss about it uh later . 
Um <other> generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use . 
So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , 
they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control . 
And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . 
It should be  
we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control . 
<other> Okay . So what I found out that uh as I said uh I think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . 
Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can  which should be taken easily in hand . 
It should not be completely like uh a cube . 
It should be it should have round edge , so uh then it's easier . 
And maybe uh just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . 
And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy . 
Okay . And my personal p uh preference is uh , as I said , uh just putting this buttons in a special places 
and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button , like mobile phone . 
Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , 
so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels , 
and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control . 
And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . 
Uh . And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . 
Not on remote control . 
I dunno if I can explain well . 
But uh just inside . 
For example , a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb . 
So it can be another uh preference . 
And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good . 
I know that it consumes lots of energy , 
but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . 
And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . 
So it may not be very useful but because it's new , people may buy it . 
Uh I personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something . 
Otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company , or . 
Okay . That's mine . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside . 
<laugh> 
Yeah yes  . 
<other> <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Uh . 
Yes . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Maybe this  . 
So but  
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
I think I think their being uh large or small is not important . 
The only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily . 
So let's say an average size , okay , 
and it should not be very heavy also . 
And I prefer to  is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , 
so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . 
So we c it's like like some joysticks . 
You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . 
So the general shape should be like this . 
I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large . 
So uh seven  not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's  that's my opinion . It's easier . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
 Or uh or I don't know 
but I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . 
So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers . 
Touching the screen . Something like 
 Mm like tactile . 
So  
But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better , 
because  
<other> 
A smaller s 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I think this  is not good . <laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Yeah , I think infra-red . 
Yeah , peeling of the banana . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Uh <other>  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , some  
Something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in uh digital camera . 
If you see it's like peeling . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . 
So keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover 
and uh when uh and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . 
So , something like this . <laugh> 
Yeah , yeah , yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover , so . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yes , yeah  it's a good idea . 
Magnetic  . 
Mm . Yeah or a  Yeah it can is 
it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh <other> materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely . 
And when you try to open it , it will be opened easily . 
So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yes , I think . I think so . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Thank you .
