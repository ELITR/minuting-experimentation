Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
What does it mean , spongy ? 
Like soft , or something ? 
Okay . I will see . 
<laugh> Okay . 
<laugh> 
I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature . 
<laugh> We'll see . 
Exactly . 
Uh okay , so good news from me uh uh for me from Hamed , 
but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I don't like it as   
Okay , so could you please , Fabien , open it . 
I'm person two . 
And which one , 
uh probably the first one . 
I'm not sure 
but check the first one . 
I  Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but  
Yeah , that's it . 
Just  
It's only this slide ? 
Yeah . 
This this is just uh one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just uh I just found this , 
that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers 
or I'll just  
Yeah , 
seven seven inch T_  T_F_T_ screen , 
which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . 
Uh so I I probably draw it down raw scheme . 
This is this is the stuff that I can use to  
Okay , so the  this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view . 
Uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape , 
no uh I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device . 
So there will be some circuit uh for the power . 
So , say power circuit here . 
Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries 
that we can uh uh  
And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , 
which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything . 
I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells , so . 
So no problem . 
There can be also solar cell . 
Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , 
so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . 
So at least seven to seven . 
It depends where you put your screen , 
because the screen is uh seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it . 
It doesn't matter . 
Um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere . 
So this will be T_F_T_ . 
And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone , which is somewhere , 
say here . 
Interface to the microphone . 
Then the graphical card uh for the T_F_T_ 
and the third unit is the I_R_ . 
The good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra-red unit 
because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , 
so it will be very cheap for us . 
So infra-red here . 
So the  
once again the overall requirements , 
seven to seven centimetres for the board , 
which has to be  
which can be spongy but has to be this size , 
and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches . 
Um I have to check what I wanted to  
Uh from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device . 
<other> 
A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically . 
But we have to take care of the T_F_T_ . 
Well , sponginess . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes  if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , 
I dunno . 
Well , it's maybe related to the U_I_ . 
A Yeah , that's all from me . 
Yeah ? 
Well , seven to seven inches . 
Yes . 
<laugh> 
Yeah but  
To be honest , I was  
Yeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , 
but it's seven inches . 
But I I think we can we can cut it . 
Yeah , no no problem , 
because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth . 
So <laugh>  
Yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen . 
So so for the same price we have four screens now <other> . 
Ah well this is like this is almost nothing . 
Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something . 
Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know . 
Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know . 
I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something . 
<other> 
W I I think so . 
I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow  
Well , that's that's no task for me , 
but well seven to seven at least yeah , 
but  
Oh , okay . 
Okay thanks  . 
Not  
J uh just a point to the energy th things . 
If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_ , 
so no problem in energy , I think . 
But we have to use the solar cell . 
Otherwise not . 
<other> 
Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells . 
So like three to five centimetres , 
I dunno exactly , but . 
S 
Uh d doesn't need to be sun . It it's just the daylight , you know . 
Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that uh that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but . 
Yeah from the T_ <laugh>  
I don't think it's enough , uh . 
Ah it's a it's a compromise , no ? 
Yeah , that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things . 
<laugh> 
Uh the s the screen is okay , but the board , uh that's the problem . 
Well what what would you guess as a shape ? 
Or what what would be the shape ? 
Mm . 
Okay . 
<other> Okay . 
Five to ten . 
Well that  
Yeah , right . 
Yeah , I think it's feasib 
Well one um um  
How could we do it ? 
We could put the board next to , well , under the L_C_D_ 
and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . 
Like holding something , and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . 
Well  But maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing , like one unit . 
Well fi five to ten it would be feasible . 
Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible . 
I'll make it . 
Fo Five by ten . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay , so 
Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me 
and I will work it out . 
Hmm . 
Seven to ten banana . 
Okay . 
Rather mango or something or . 
<other> 
You mean banana . 
Well , but  
If it's  <laugh>  If it  
If the banana is big enough . 
Then , yes . <laugh> 
But if you want to look at the screen  , no . 
Well  
<laugh> 
<other> Well , it can be whatever you want . 
But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . 
But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so . 
It's like more more expensive to have shape like that . 
But I don't care . You know , if we fit this requirement . 
Okay  
Yeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the c c common one . 
But  
Like modified banana , okay . 
Well it  we'll stick to banana , or ? 
Okay . 
Mm-mm . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Sure . 
Like like peeling of the banana you s <laugh> 
It would be cool , yeah . 
<laugh> Peeling of the banana , you know , 
should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden . 
<laugh> First layer obviously spo Yeah , 
w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think . 
Well is it possible to make it soft ? 
So I think if it's so then it's cool ? 
<laugh> Cool . 
Honestly speaking , I cannot imagine it , so far , 
but it will be terrible . <laugh> 
Mm . 
<other> 
Pof . 
Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape , 
we cannot b uh  
So we need that the that the peeling  
uh I dunno 
but we should we should take care of these two two things . 
So , if if uh the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know . 
So that we can reach the energy out of it  out of that . 
It is possible , but , well if it  
I dunno . 
I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or or inside . 
But then it must be some window there , you know . 
Yeah . 
I agree . 
Okay . 
Okay .
