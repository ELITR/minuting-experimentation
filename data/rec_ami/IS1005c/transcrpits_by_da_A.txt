Hello , 
uh this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . 
Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept 
and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , 
but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision . 
So , uh 
we will have again three presentation , from all of you , 
and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . 
So , who wants to start ? 
Okay . 
So start , uh 
<laugh> 
Uh .  
This one ? 
Turn . 
Hmm . 
Okay . 
<other> 
Like a sponge . <laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , uh yeah . 
Easy to use , is it uh 
a as much as important than technology or fancy thing . 
It's less important , 
right ? 
Yeah yeah . 
Okay . 
 
So , Hamed , can you  . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> Um . Number ? 
Three . 
This one ? 
<other> 
So it's not this one . 
Okay .  
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
This one , yeah . 
Oh ,  . 
Oops . 
Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? 
For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem . 
Yep . 
Okay . 
So  
Okay . 
Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around . 
 maybe after . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
No , I don't think it's seven by seven , 
I think it's seven  the diagonal is seven . 
Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> I dunno I dun I dun One each  
. But , yeah ,  . 
<laugh> Let's go . <laugh> 
<laugh> So let's cut the T_F_T_ . 
Mm . 
These technical engineers , huh . 
<other> 
What user wants . 
He wants a small remote control , 
or ? 
Uh uh with big buttons . 
It's difficult . 
<laugh> A sm 
<other> So maybe you can finish your presentation , 
and afterwards we will discuss about all this . 
That's it . Okay . 
So . <other> 
 No . 
Uh , so I think we have a lot  
We have to take decision today , 
so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions . 
Uh first I think energy it's a key problem 
because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . 
Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery , 
and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ? 
Okay . 
So  
Okay . 
Uh like  
but using how many batteries , for example ? 
Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery  
Okay . 
Uh one two  
Okay . 
The television lights . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ . 
<laugh> I dunno . 
Okay . Mm . 
At least it's new and maybe technology New technology . 
Yeah . 
Um . 
So I think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case . 
Uh what what are gonna be the size , 
because its weight drives the other  what we are going to use as features and so on . 
For example for the for the L_C_D_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this um a such a a a screen . 
Oh . 
I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible . 
Okay . 
So we are agree with a small 
L_C_D_ . <other> 
Yeah . 
Tactile or something , yeah . 
Touch screen , yeah . 
Yeah . 
The problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new . 
So let's go for a small L_C_D_ . 
Yeah okay . 
So , five by s ten . 
Um so what about , so the case we talked about . 
Um something easy to use , 
you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , 
and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? 
My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the  it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and  
<laugh> A big banana . <laugh> 
Um . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But it's just an idea . 
I dunno what you think about , but  
Yeah . 
I dunno if it can fit with the technology . 
You are the specialists of that . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> So  
Yeah , and 
The screen has to be <cough> square ? 
Or it can be like a a shape , quite , uh with curves . 
It could . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay 
okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not  doesn't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana . 
So we are agree with the banana thing ? 
Okay . 
So ,  the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess . 
Everybody's agreed . 
Uh , so that's it I think about the concepts . 
You have other thing to add to this point , or uh no ? 
So , uh about the user interface , so we are going to use L_C_D_ . 
In the last meeting we talked about uh hidden buttons . 
I don't know what we are going to do with that . 
You talked about the buttons on the side  
Mm what ? 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Okay . 
And you mean the first layer would be spongy . 
<laugh> So  <laugh> 
Is it is it possible to do that ? 
It would be a great idea , 
but is it possible technically ? 
Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , but do you see that as a rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or . 
Yeah . 
So , I dunno what you think , Bob , 
but it would be great for users I think , and very good for marketing . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
<laugh> Um . 
And setting buttons hidden in  . 
Mm , other remarks , or something , or . 
Something we didn't talk about yes yet , or . 
I think we are almost there  . 
Uh maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , I dunno how to do that technically , or . 
And how  <laugh> 
Yeah , maybe . 
Ma magnetic  oh . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ? 
Mm . Likes . Soft plastic , or  
Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
Hmm . 
And something we forgot , maybe , 
uh about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ? 
It i Yeah , it seems feasible , and it would be something very great . 
So we have the de design , the a good shape , new and so on , 
and we have also the technology thing w will be . 
And even the easy to use thing , 
so it will be perfect . 
So we add also the speech recognition device . 
So , that great . 
We have decided everything . 
And think we are on a good way . 
So , um uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes . 
Um , so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design . 
The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device . 
And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation . 
So , I hope you can do that in thirty minutes . 
<laugh> And uh , yeah , I 
uh I think you should work together , s you uh Hamed and Peter , to work uh in a in a first prototype , 
and uh more about the shape and so on 
and how you can manage to put everything together . 
And um as usual you will receive some specific instructions on . 
So thank you all everybody , 
and see you in thirty minutes .
