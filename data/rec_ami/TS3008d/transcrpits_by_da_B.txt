 
 . 
 coffee . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Uh , well the uh  all the functions are discussed uh  
I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious . 
Uh , it's a little bit . 
Uh , power button . 
Uh then the the the nine uh channels . 
Uh the volume uh uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes . 
And then we had uh just uh two buttons , we place them in the middle , uh the menu , and for the teletext 
<other>  I thought that was th 
Oh , the mute button . 
Yeah . 
<other> Well , yeah mo uh mo 
Yeah , well most of them are right-handed . 
Yeah well , I don't have time in uh anymore on the  
Oh yeah , just progr programme above , I think . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , true , yeah . 
Uh  
Uh I think so . 
Zero ? 
May maybe here ? 
Yeah . 
And then a second . 
Is it depending on television ? 
Yeah . 
True . 
But the ex 
Yeah . 
You uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait uh two uh seconds or something  
We'll discuss them in the usability lab . 
Uh eva evaluation . 
I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary . 
Yeah ? 
<sound indicating surprise> Okay . 
Ach . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Well it  
yeah , uh there's nothing  
I think it's pretty basic , 
the the  there's no fu 
there's one there's one button , 
that's wha there's there's 
there's one function and that's n the one button when you want to find it . 
You can . 
But i i i it's backwards . 
But it's it's backwards . 
It's leaning . It's leaning backwards , I think , in the in the docking station . 
That's text . <laugh> 
<other> 
 lights ? 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
No , not fronts . Different designs . Different colours maybe , yeah . 
We can make it a one . 
Mm yeah . 
I agree . 
Um , I uh I go for the positive . So I go for two . 
Okay , three . 
Yeah . 
Two . 
One . One . 
Okay yeah , I'll I'll agree . 
I'm the I'm the usability , so  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
The  
Well  
Yeah , well menu  Yeah , maybe . 
Yeah , true . Yeah , I agree . 
Mm two . 
Because we got  
<laugh> 
Well . 
Yeah . 
Uh , I will I will make it a three , 
because uh  yeah . I I th 
Yeah . True , yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
No . We're not  
well , maybe the the the  on the side . 
And the light maybe . 
But  
Well , six . 
No , six . 
Six . 
Yeah . 
  
Innovative in generally or just f original for  
A docking station is innova 
<laugh> 
Okay . <laugh> <other> 
Six . 
Yeah , a two . 
More two . 
Yes . 
Yeah , I think two , yeah . I agree . Two . 
We don't have the slogan though . 
The logo . 
Underneath it or something . 
<other> 
A three . Three . 
Yeah , a three . 
Yeah , two . 
Two . 
No . 
Okay , yeah . 
<laugh> Shoot . 
 
No . 
Well , special colour .  . 
I don't  
Mm okay . 
Whoa , 
it's a little  
<other> That's huge . 
No . 
We have <other> the simplest buttons . 
Uh , one til nine . 
Is that one or is that nine buttons ? 
Yeah . 
Is it cents , the the the fifty cents a button ? 
No way . 
<laugh> 
It's way  
No , no no . 
Yeah , uh  
That's still four . 
Yeah , that's no option , that's no option . 
<other> A special colour , why a special colour ? 
But wha what s what special ? 
Okay , yeah . 
Uh , yeah . 
Plastic . 
Plastic , I think . 
Plastic . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Se no no no . 
<other> 
And then we can get a docking station . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
But what what can we do  
But uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ? 
If if i 
Regular chip and  
because we don't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip , for example . 
Yeah . 
We'll go back uh tomorrow . <laugh> 
That's the question . If we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f 
No . 
No no , they were uh mine , yeah . 
Died . 
Yeah , it's open . 
It's circuit board . 
It's only just basics for for  
At the end circuit there is an infrared LED . 
Components design . 
Components design maybe . 
N on top . 
Working design . 
Yeah , but it's the the other one . 
Was it working design or components design ? 
Chip set . 
The display requires an advanced chip . 
Requires . 
Little lights . Yeah , but that that's just the same as the the LED . 
Yeah . 
No . 
I think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , true . 
Well , that's not too  what we want . 
<laugh> 
So , simple chip is okay . 
Yeah , lights , yeah , there's no 
category . 
<laugh> 
Can we do it wi within two two Euro ? 
Mm-hmm . 
But it's original . 
But then we could make a docking station . 
Wow , w why no li 
Look at now , we got two 
two thirty left . 
Ca can't we make a docking station of that ? 
I don't know . 
Well , we we uh  
Yeah , then we don't have any innovation things . 
<laugh> 
No , we only make less profit of it . 
<other> No . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> <other> 
<laugh> 
Cheap remote control . 
<laugh> It w it won't tell , but  
No , uh , n no 
Yeah , we just have to go all what we did today again . You have to do it over . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
 the  
No , but  no . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> No . 
Yeah ? 
<sound imitating bell ringing> 
We can do it here then . 
Can we  
can't we do it here ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah , we're doing now . 
But it's  . 
Oh , okay . 
Nice .
