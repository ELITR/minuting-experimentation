Okay , welcome to the detailed design meeting . 
Again , I'm gonna take minutes . 
Oh , we're gonna have a prototype presentation first . 
Uh , who's gonna give the prototype presentation ? 
You two guys ? 
Okay . Go ahead . 
<cough> 
Oh no , the the the mute button misses now . 
Do y do you  
did we want to have a m mute button ? 
Huh . 
<laugh> Wait , there's  was one thing I wanted to ask . 
Uh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh <other> do uh like 
uh d I call it teens and twenties . 
Uh , y th th th the two numbers . 
Yeah , 
but do we have  do we need extra buttons , 
<other> for example some uh some have to  
Yeah , but you don't you don't actually need them , 
becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds  
No , I don't think so . 
Nah , I don't think so really , 
because you have a  
I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty  uh a number in the twenty or in the ten . 
No , I think  uh I really think it's n 
because you can  
when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one , 
because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply . 
Yeah , because that's i it's for television . It's exact the same thing . 
No , 
listen listen . 
When you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . 
I in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . 
The one with dash , 
that signal gi 
and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . 
I think it works that way , really . 
<other> 
Yeah , but it's exact the same  that w would appear when you put a separate button  push a separate button . 
Yeah , but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point . 
I think it's exact the same thing when y 
No , but then they would a would also support that button , because it's the same thing . 
Listen , 
with  that that's 
that special but button  you're talking about , eh ? 
That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in  on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . 
When you don't have that separate button , and you push y one , it's exactly the same thing . 
Do y you  
the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had  
Yeah . 
But you give the input . 
You push the one . 
That's the same thing as the button with the one and it  
yes it it is . 
Think about it . 
And it's the same thing what happens 
and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one . 
Yeah , that's true . 
Yeah , but I m uh but it's  
I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works . 
But okay , we we'll impl 
No , 
we'll apply them then for now . 
Yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . 
Yeah , I think so . 
Yeah , for now , if we don't know for sure whether  <other> 
Yeah but  
okay . <other> 
What I said about uh the remote control sending another signal , that that might not be true , 
but I still think i it it  all T_V_s in some ways support it , 
I don't know . 
I think it's more c is m maybe we don't  uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works , 
but I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said . 
I do think that uh m T_V_s support mur multiple kind of remote controls . M 
Th won't work wi with uh  
to have that special button . 
Okay , well we'll see . 
But  
Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , 
because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues <laugh> still to come . 
But we have to look n I don't know . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yes . 
That's it ? 
I think added lights are gonna be a problem too . 
Okay . For now , uh this is uh is good enough . 
Yeah , what was uh on the  
Okay , 
but in the  
oh yeah , the colour , 
because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , 
isn't it ? 
Then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons . 
And they're be a   they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side . 
Okay . 
And I think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic , 
and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff  
Yeah , we'll talk about the lights later . 
'Cause I also don yeah , 
it's depends on the costs and such . 
But uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours , 
but may I dunno if that's important , 
but we'll talk about that later . 
Okay , for now this is this is okay . 
Um , the next p y 
you gonna give a presentation too ? 
Uh , I have to see the agenda . 
Detail design . 
Evaluation criteria . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Yeah , I think four maybe would be appropriate , 
because it's  
Yeah , maybe it really depends on taste . 
Uh , I mean it's kind of  , our design . 
It's  
so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly , you know , o other people find it really cool . 
I don't know or uh I don't know how you  
Casting . Yeah . 
Yeah , but we d we didn't  we're we're not planning to use fronts , I believe . 
With a colour a co a colours . Oh , okay . 
Okay , but  
Oh , maybe we should do three or something that w you know , our  
Yeah . 
Uh , I was thinking about four , so I think three is uh  
Yeah well , let that  let's make that a one . <laugh> 
That's one thing for sure . 
Yeah , two or a one , I guess . 
It's something we really put work into . 
Yeah . 
But  
Well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something . 
And telete 
Yeah , we don't know if the  uh they're necessary . 
I think a two . 
Came a long way , but not  we didn't not uh  
No , w w it can also always be more simplistic , but two is  
yeah . 
Yeah , uh a t I think a two . 
Yeah yeah , y i it's hard to say from this picture . 
But I do think it's more  
But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful . 
<other> So so I think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the  
A th a three . 
I i uh when you compare to the  
Uh uh what's the difference with  <laugh> 
Okay . 
No . 
Yeah , but we uh   
you mean the rubber stuff ? 
Yeah , but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh . 
And I don't u also it's also really not innovative , 
it's more  
No , six . 
Or seven maybe , <laugh> yeah . 
Or six . 
Yeah , mine is seven . 
Uh it's uh depends on the on the maybe  
No , I think I think actually it's a seven maybe , but there's nothing innovative about it . 
N no no , 
t  . 
Yeah , I mean the dock station , but but uh , 
I think the the docking station , <laugh> it's gonna be a  kind of a problem . 
But  
Well , let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . 
Well I i  yeah . 
No ? 
Okay , for now it's a six or a seven uh , sev 
six maybe , 
because  
Yeah , but I don't I don't know if it's very <other> inno yeah . 
Yeah , v 
Yeah , more through uh like function T_V_ functionalities and  
no no , 
you know what I mean . 
You have   
must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control stuff , not in how you find your  
yeah . 
Yeah , it's  
that's that's  
think about it la later on 
and uh  
Yeah , as a a one or a two ma uh at least . 
Yeah , it's good . 
No , I would have seen <laugh> that one before . 
Oh , you skipped one uh  
Uh , here . 
Remote control will be bought by  
Yeah . Definitely . 
Well  
Uh , just in general . 
Yeah , a two . 
Yeah , but I think I think two . 
Uh , that is not the question . It's just w it will be bought by people under forty . 
Yeah , you can  
yeah , you can be very picky about it . 
Ah yeah , just make it  we'll make it a two . 
Oh no . 
Yeah . Yeah , you have make an 
 slogan is quite obvious  . 
Oh the  oh sorry , no , not not the slogan . 
Yeah , you can put that on the side if <laugh> if we would like to . 
Yeah , and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three . 
Maybe a three this time . 
And uh  
Uh , it's a one or a two . 
Yeah , make it a two . 
It's not that bad . 
Yeah , and that's mostly the inno 
when we uh score higher on innovative technology , we would score two , 
which is uh quite a great score . 
Okay . 
Uh , this is  was uh the evaluation ? 
Because I I still think that the most important part of this meeting still has  
Yeah . 
Still opened or uh  
Yeah . 
Okay , finance . Because um 
I received uh a spreadsheet . 
Yeah , but I uh actually don't need this presentation , I guess . 
Oh . 
I'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together , 
because I didn't really fin uh I have a  . 
Didn't really finish it . 
Well , we uh  We'll see . We'll stumble upon some problems . 
 I probably have already opened it here . 
 try it again . 
First of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . 
But let's let's st start with beginning . 
We include one battery . 
I i uh I'll explain 
its  Uh , the 
the components are listed over here . 
Uh , price is given . 
We um  yeah , 
we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . 
And then uh , we'll uh calcula 
Don't watch the number yet . 
I don't know if it's filled in properly . 
Okay , we need one battery . 
One battery . I think one battery is enough . 
We don't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo . 
A s okay , this this is a p first problem . 
Uh , I think 
we should know how many simple chips , regular chips  
Okay . 
But   
Where did we find this information ? 
Was it  
I think it was uh your job in the first uh meet Uh , f your first presentation to make this clear , but then you had some t time problems . 
Maybe you can uh look it up right now . 
Okay , but  okay . 
When we don't  when we leave the uh retriever and such aside , what   
then it would be a simple chip . 
And with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip . 
Okay . 
Yeah , but it will it will it will be  cause a lot of problems . 
<laugh> The sample sensor  sample speaker . 
What is it m is that the speaker we were t 
I don't know what it is . 
Okay , we went for the double-curved case 
made out of plastic and rubber . And with a special colour . 
I guess that's what we were  
Yeah , I don't know about the special colour , 
but I think w uh  
Yeah , I think we uh we have special colours . 
Okay , then the push-button , I was just counting them . 
Uh , I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , 
isn't it ? 
Well that's bit of a problem , 
because I re but I really don't understand that , because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet . 
Yeah . 
Ah . 
Yeah , it wouldn't  
Fill in the number of components you plan to use in the  and the total cost  
I don't know . 
I 
And I count them like this . 
One two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen . 
Because  Oh , this is  
oh , this is one , okay . 
Twelve , 
okay , then it would be eighteen , because uh , I uh rated them as uh um 
as uh uh uh separate buttons . 
Yes . 
And plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it's will be uh eighteen . 
Yeah , I don't understand . 
Y I do I don't get the point , because it's would be s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons . 
Well , okay , well well let's make it just one . 
Here , now it's now it's already s 
shall we just 
give our own interpretation to , 
because else we would really have a problem . 
It would be impossible to make it  
And and less buttons than this isn't possible . 
This is the most simple  
yeah , it is possible , 
but I've never seen one before . 
<other> 
<other> 
Yeah , without the numbers . That's possible . 
Yeah , we could skip the numbers . 
Then uh , teletext would also be im impossible . 
Okay , we'll we'll just  
okay . 
But then still , <laugh> when we  there's no room for a docking station or something . 
Tha w Le 
let's see th we have uh  oh yeah , button supplements . 
We'll give the buttons special colour . 
We'll give them a special form . 
Uh , I think we should mark the special form thing , 
because it  this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , I guess . 
Because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings . 
I think that's the  what they mean by a special colour . 
I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that's what we were planning to do , 
making it  
Yeah , special material r also , 
because i has rubber . And the buttons have to be rubber . 
'Kay , but the problem now is that <other> the  There's no such thing as a docking station in this list , 
but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents . 
Separately . 
<laugh> Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah , but I do like the idea , but we  yeah . 
It uh  but it  
then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore , 
but we can  
but then you still have to use  
we have to find out what chip we u need . 
I think we can agree on this . 
I I think the special colour thing has to be uh marked . 
'Cause I think we uh  
Yeah , I think that's what what what they uh mean  
But can we find out uh about uh this chips ? 
Because when we don't need a d a docking station , then probably we also have only  we also need a simple chip . 
And maybe then we can do something extra . 
Oh , n uh oh , still  
oh , it's gonna get more expensive with  . Two . 
Then we have some money left . 
We can put then  
We can put a scroll-wheel on it or something . 
Yeah , well who knows . 
Or a little bit of tin titanium . 
Yeah , 
or we can ki do the kinetic cells . 
That's also maybe an idea . 
Yeah that's what then what he has to find out . 
Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , 
then we know  
then we exactly know what it will cost us . 
Maybe is that  
that's nice to know . 
Yeah , bu bu but when we  
yeah , but when we skip when we um  when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still  yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , 
because that was our our special feature . 
Yeah , okay , you can also do that , 
but maybe  
It still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material . 
Yeah , but for two Euros , then we have still  maybe we have to use the advanced chip , 
then two Euros isn't even possible . 
Yeah , then  
because then we'd  thirty cents left . 
Yeah , but  yeah , I don't know , 
because maybe d uh yeah , 
we have to find out with the simple chip . 
Yeah , 
and w and and we uh need f 
and what is this ? Sample sensor sample speaker . 
  
You can look at it for s presentation . 
S technical functions ? 
Oh . 
Oh , oh oh . 
Hey . 
Oh . 
Mm . 
I don't think here  it's in here already . 
It's nothing about s yeah . 
No . 
But i in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components . 
Which one was it ? 
Functional requirements ? 
Ah . 
Ah yes , it was the second one . 
Yeah , it was your second  
your first presentation . 
Sorry ? 
Uh , this is n this is not this n 
that's not the right one . 
I don't  
oh . 
No , this is the other one . 
Or maybe something is uh  
maybe there's something abo in in these  
Here . 
You know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires    
Okay , so we only need a simple chip . 
No no , that's just a simple chip . 
A scroll-wheel    
it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . 
So , we don't need any of them . 
And what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ? 
Okay . 
Back to the costs . 
So we're gonna use the simple chip . 
Nah , there is some money left to be spent . 
Okay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? 
But I mean it isn't  
it hasn't got any innovative technology , 
we aren't gonna apply any uh innovated  innovative te technology anyway , I think . 
I don't I don't see any possibility to do so , because it would  wouldn't fit our defi design philosophy . 
But what w is there some extra  
maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something . 
Instead of the rechargeable  
the rechargeable thing was something to um  know , so y so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore . 
Maybe we  if we put the kinetic thing in it  
Yeah , you leave the p yeah , I know , but still I  they will think about that . 
I mean if you u 
The uh  it's made for s people  
well , the they don't  
if it was uh uh r useless technology , they wouldn't put it uh as a possibility . 
And i it it  th th the the target 
the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking  . 
Because I think it  when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source , then it would be this one . 
Because it's one  it gets thrown around  thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot  
Hey that  maybe that's cool  that's a cool thing about it , you know . You don't use batteries . 
I've never seen it before in a remote control . 
No , we we we can't make a docking station anyway . 
Yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one  
we can still make  
<laugh> 
Yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control . 
<laugh> Yeah , 
but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the  these costs of the speaker and other stuff . 
I don't think it's realistic for you to do so . 
Oh , because we   
We  well look at all the special stuff we have . 
Colour a the colours are special , the form is special . 
It  th this is whole concept . 
Uh maybe it  with the kinetic thing , I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing . 
<laugh> Uh , no . 
Yeah , I don 
my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing 
and make it uh like a  
Uh uh I I I I still fee 
I also feel this concept of making it kinetic , 
because of the  you know , it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control . 
No , that wouldn't n no . 
Yeah , and it is also not a good  it's not  
you have to really do it only kinetic , you don't want it to think about batteries anymore . 
No no . 
Yeah , it's great . 
<laugh> No no no . 
No no , this is very sophisticated technology technology . 
When you use it  your remote like once a day , or maybe even less i i it  
It  We can make it  yeah  no . 
Becau be but a remote control gets  
why do they state that this technology can be used if it 
Yeah , m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells . 
Because I think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , 
with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and  
<laugh> Yeah , but you don't have to . 
Trust me . 
The idea of this technology is that you don't think about it , it just happens . 
Okay , then we d Okay , well y we don't have to do it , but what  that would just have a lack of key features , you know . 
You m have to put something on your box . 
You have to make people buy it and uh  
We can really can do the docking thing , 
uh it's not  
yeah , uh we can do it , but it's would be a easy way out . 
Okay , but we have to grou to agree upon something , 
because uh we only have a minute left or so . 
No no , it's not possible . 
Okay , w b we can s we can leave it on 
be well then then th it's  this is  
then then our concept is ready . 
Yeah , we make some extra profit of it . 
Huh , any ideas ? 
No no uh there's still there's still someth concept and something special left . 
I mean we're gonna  
it's gonna excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel . 
That's what it's  makes it special . 
Yeah , and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature , 
and uh I know it will work , 
but uh it's it's an  
They're they're not putting technologies on this  , but if it if it was impossible to to make it happen . 
Okay , well we leave it like this . 
Then it's c then we're  yeah . 
Okay , project e uh 
well , we were gonna what look  take a look at the last sheet . 
Yeah , we have to  Yeah , it's   <laugh> 
Uh , I don't know .
