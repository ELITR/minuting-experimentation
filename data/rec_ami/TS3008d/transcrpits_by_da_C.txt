Yes . 
<laugh>  
'Kay , we've made a prototype . 
Um , 
we've got uh <other> uh our aspects from the last meeting . 
Uh , 
especially we looked at the form , material and the colour . 
Um , 
we've uh drawn here the p prototype . 
The logo is uh is uh <laugh> is pretty uh <laugh> obvious to see on the on the remote control , 
but 
it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher . 
Um , 
<other> our interface elements , there are shown in the in the drawing . 
Maybe you can uh point them uh  The functions . 
But uh that  
It's uh here then , in the middle . 
Yes , um 
we've disc 
Most of the users 
Yes , y there there will be a p a little a little P_ on that and a little uh  yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yes . 
It's a television . 
Yes . 
Yes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it , 
uh th with the one and a double uh uh  
yes . 
Yes , you have televisions , then you have to , you know , you have to uh press  
Yes , but but a lot  uh  
Yes , but 
some televisions don't accept uh that that  
No , no , 
but s 
Yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons . 
You want  
Yes , but some television don't support it . 
No , 
a remote can  
Yes , 
so they need  no , they need  
No , 
but uh  
Yeah , it  
And the button for the SCART uh audio video uh external input . 
No , no . 
Uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press . 
Uh , some  
N some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten  
No , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals . 
When you uh press one button , you give one signal . 
And the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher . 
But  
When you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals , it could work , but  
Just a basic idea of of of the most uh  most y most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote . 
Yes . 
It's here on the  <laugh> 
<laugh> 
We came uh  
Yes . 
But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , 
because Real <other> Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls . 
So maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh M_P_ three players or or uh 
uh hearing devices . 
Yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh  
when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh  
Yes , 
but we can make  
No , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same . 
When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it . 
Just have to be big enough for the biggest  
No , when you make it large enough no it it will not . 
But then it's a little bit  
But it's just an idea . 
But it's flat it's flat as as this , 
so we can p make all the products as flat as this . 
Yes , but when you make uh uh a bit of big   
Yes , little holer  littler  Uh , little products go deeper in it . 
Yes . 
And uh uh 
the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , 
because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area . 
Then your uh left thumb of uh  your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button , 
which is the most common used uh function , 
and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb . 
So it's it's it's really good design . 
Yes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber , 
and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it . 
Yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it . 
Yes . 
But , it will also uh uh use batteries , 
and do we want to  
The  all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh  
Yes . 
Yes . 
Yes , maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights , 
so it will uh  
Yes . 
No . 
 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own  
yes , you can make it in your own uh  
more to your own personality or or house style . 
Yes . 
Or forty . 
<laugh> 
I think two or three . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
It's all about the buttons . 
Also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits , 
o they're used uh uh  
Can  
yes , three , two . 
But you can't make a remote control without them , 
because  
Yes . 
Yes . A one . 
<laugh> 
We  
we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever . 
<laugh> 
Yes . 
Yes . 
No . 
No , not L_C_D_ , so . 
But that that's not innovative . 
Lights lights are  
Six . 
Because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative , 
but it but it  
With the lights it  it's it's kind of future  
But still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone , with the  with  
Yes . <laugh> The docking station is a is a little bit innovative . 
It's a part of the remote . 
<laugh> And with the speaker on the  there's also a speaker . 
Okay . 
But the retrieval or the  
Yes , 
 how would you innovate a remote control more ? 
To put it on your head . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yes . 
Yes . 
<laugh> 
You like the buttons . <laugh> 
Yes . 
In in  
and comparing with uh people of th of the age above ? 
We don't know . 
But  
Yes , two , but only in c when you compare it with with elderly . 
This is just guessing . 
Make it a two . 
When it succeeds , uh it can get a two , 
mu 
A logo . 
Yes , uh encrypted uh with  <laugh> 
Yes . 
Yes . 
Is there something after this uh meeting ? Or  
Okay . 
Yes . 
Uh it's it's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it . 
The simple chip is e enough I I think , 
but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be uh  
No , 
uh I  
Yes , 
my my my uh  
The the email I got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like I think the advanced chip  maybe . 
Bec No , the  they didn't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it . 
Then it's a simple chip . 
Yes , 
I I I s I  
That will be enough for future uh recommendations . 
I don't know it uh either . 
Yes . 
Otherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour . 
Standard rubber . 
St <laugh> 
Yes . 
No , 
it's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . 
If you use a scroll-wheel  
Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons . 
You can have f four kind of push-buttons . 
Rubber . 
You can have uh  
Different , 
yes . 
Why is that so uh expensive . 
So , whe when you  so then it  
It's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of  
When you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton . Board . 
And then throw it  
<laugh> 
But whe 
I've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume , 
but but  
Uh , it's it's still for little children . 
They can handle that remote control , 
but but it isn't fo 
Yes , 
it's for  it's li uh it's just for a little  
Otherwise , it  
Otherwise it would be the  
Special form also , it says . 
What is the normal material ? 
<laugh> Sh yeah . 
Classic ? 
Oh , plastic . 
<laugh> But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station  
yes . 
And and  
but we don't have to tell it , 
but what we can say of  can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station . 
<laugh> 
No , but you  otherwise you can't retrieve it . 
But for two Euros and thirty cents , we uh we don't get a docking station . 
For   <laugh> 
For two Euros . 
<laugh> 
It isn't in my information , so I don't know it uh either . 
It isn't in my information , 
I uh I  
I've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or  
Uh I've got here in uh  
I will put a I will put a page on it . 
When my mouse works again . 
My mouse is uh  
Yes . 
Oh . 
Ah , I've got it . 
I will put uh my email on the the network . 
It's on it . 
Yes . 
Um  
Yes , that was mine . 
But that was my second  
Mm  
But this is the same uh  
This is o only the possibilities . 
Yeah . 
We can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip . 
Ah , okay . 
With the light . 
L_C_D_ . 
Maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down . 
<laugh> All in twelve Euros . 
Twelve Euros and fifty cents . 
And the lights . Where uh are the lights ? 
But but sometimes you put a  
Kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking . 
Uh solar cells are useless . 
<laugh> 
Fo <laugh> for a docking station . 
With a cable , with uh buttons on it , with retrieval uh device in it . 
<laugh> Wi with a button to 
wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep . 
Uh , so it's uh wireless technology . 
Look at the case , 
the case the case of of uh of uh  
No , then we have to sell it for thirty Euros . 
It's the  
Maybe we can uh can do it both . 
Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . Battery and kinetic . 
<laugh> 
Yes , but when it's  then when it  
then you have to shake it uh and all when it's when it's empty . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
You asked for three d 
No , that's n that's not true . 
Uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time . 
Yes , solar cells are also stated . 
Why don't we use solar cells then ? 
That's true . 
Oui . 
<laugh> You can do it for fifty cents . <laugh> 
The c <laugh> The case the case alone is is is uh 
the case alone for uh remote control is at least one Euro . 
Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station . 
But now  
Great  . It's great . 
Our remote control . 
Yes . 
Seventy Euros . 
Why not a hand dynamo then ? 
<laugh> 
We're done . 
Is this it ? 
Okay . 
Yes . 
Where's the champagne ? 
I don't uh hear a bell . 
<makes ringing sound> 
Bye . 
<laugh> 
Uh-huh . 
Just fill that one in .
