<laugh> 
<laugh>  . <laugh> 
<sound indicating exasperation> 
Alright , I  
Yeah . 
Alright , and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button . 
Yeah , but you you gotta make it clear on the  on  
Yeah , and a and a triangle on that . 
Yes . 
Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
All n no , that's um <other> kinda dependent on the television . 
I think  
Yeah , 
I think you should add  <other> 
A cross , or whatever . Yeah , line . 
No , that's dependent on the television . 
I do know so . 
Yeah . 
Yes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um  <other> they come with the television . 
Or actually , the other way around . 
But  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , well  but su <other> If  
No no no . So some television respond differently . 
Look , if uh i i 
Yes . 
Yes , that's true . 
No  
No , 
it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space . 
Yep . <other> True . 
No , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c 
No , that's not true . 
It's simply not true . It's simply not true . 
Uh  
No , remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds . 
Remote control is a stupid thing . 
If you push a button , it sends it immediately to to the television . 
No , definitely not . Definitely not . 
<laugh> 
Yes . 
Uh , you can access that uh via zero , and then minus , I guess . 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Okay . 
I kinda miss the docking station . 
<laugh> 
No nothing really trendy about it . 
The button . 
Yep . 
I think that's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices . 
<other> Yeah , of course . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well it it got it  it has got to fit into the shape , of course . 
The technology and the voltage can be the same . That's uh that's true . 
But uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit . 
Yeah , that's true , 
but uh  
Yes , 
but uh I I g 
Shouldn't it fall then ? It  isn't going to fall down ? 
<laugh> That's a bit uh  
yeah , I think  
No , but if if  
like this , I'll I'll point it out , 
if you got uh a a a base a base like this , 
I won't draw it really . 
If you got a base which is uh as big as this  
Yeah sure , 
but if you got if you got a tiny player , it can  <raspberry noise> 
Yeah . 
Uh , wha what you could do if you uh  from the bottom  
oh , right , help . 
Uh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh  in in the  
Yeah . That i that is possible , yep . 
Yeah , sure , you're right . 
Oh . 
I don't like the colours . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . Alright . 
The light . 
Okay . 
And other lights ? 
No , o on the on the front . 
Yeah , okay . 
Maybe the uh the logo . 
Yeah , why not ? 
Of course . 
Okay . 
Uh , in the same colour as the side . 
Yeah , I think I think that'll be good . 
Yes . 
Yep . 
Yeah . 
We will . 
Well , uh yeah , I I'm gonna do something right there , yeah . 
We gotta do that on the right <other>  the most  right-most screen , 
because the leftmost  
Yep , that's me . 
Alright . 
I will be needing that image , 
so leave it please . 
Um  
Go away . 
Right , we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points . 
<other> Um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together . 
I wanna have a colour over here , come on . 
Right , the remote <other> is not ugly , 
a bit weird sentence , 
but 
the positive things has to be on the left , so I <laugh> said not ugly instead of ugly . 
Uh , what would you say , 
we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design , 
and please forget the drawing skills of these guys . 
<laugh> The remote control is not ugly . How do you feel ? 
Yes . 
Background colour . 
How do you guys feel ? 
The different designs . 
Yes . 
Okay . 
No , not not fronts , but different designs . 
And that's still uh uh , yeah , is is uh is a little personal touch , I guess . 
What ? 
Yeah , wha wha what would you uh guys uh think ? Personally . 
Personally . 
Yes , 
but what is it ? 
<other> Guido ? 
Two or three . 
I was  
I was thinking about three , so I guess 
three is uh a bit uh  
oh , what am I doing ? 
I'll mark it . 
The remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy . 
Yeah ? 
Antek , you agree ? 
Yeah . You're not Antek . 
I totally agree . 
The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible . 
Yeah , I  yeah . 
I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant . 
<laugh> And our  oh yeah , it's a b yeah . 
Yeah ? Alright . 
That's a one ? You agree ? 
The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . 
I think we totally succeeded there . 
Oh  
Yeah , that's true . That's true . 
 the the  
yeah , m well , you d you've got a point . 
Two or three ? 
Two ? Antek . 
Nay that that that's true , that's true . They're definitely needed . 
So  
we put it on a two ? 
The remote control has got a really trendy look . 
Maarten . 
Yeah . 
Ever , yeah . 
Guido . 
Yeah , uh I agree . I agree . 
I was planning to give it a two , uh where I give the not ugly uh  
oh , yeah , that's true . 
You agree on the two ? 
Great . 
Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . 
Uh , I copied that one . 
Well , uh forget that . 
Um  
Go away . 
Remote control has got innovative technology implanted . 
Yeah , and the light . 
Well , I g 
It's not  
seven ? 
Why uh why not a seven ? 
How ? 
Yeah , you think the lights are innovative ? 
Well , it's n true . Uh , I agree , 
m but  
I'll  
Yeah , you you didn't draw the docking station . <laugh> 
Yeah , it it's  I think I think with its  
I think more m 
Uh that  that's n 
No uh , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so I think we  
It's it's a six . 
That m f 
Yeah , for the retrieval function . 
Yeah . I think that's very innovative for a remote control . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah sure , 
but  
But I d I definitely don't think it's a five , 
but  
Remote control is easy to use . 
I think a two . 
Yeah ? 
Come on . 
The remote control hasn't got uh   . 
I've just filled  uh 
Go away . 
I found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten . 
It will be bought by people under the age of forty . 
No no no . No , just if they if they buy it . 
Yeah , what do you think ? 
Antek ? 
No , that's no comparison . 
And I don't mean two people . 
W w 
Right , the rem 
The remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan . 
Oh , the slogan . 
Can we see the slogan ? 
Are we gonna do that ? 
Three ? I agree . 
Because of the slogan   
Remote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users . 
Two ? 
Two . Alright . 
We gotta add up the scores now to see our total average . 
Four , five , seven , nine . Forget that . Fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six . 
Twenty six . 
It's a two point six . 
Alright , we  
yeah . 
Yeah . True . 
<other> This was my evaluation . So  
We did a pretty nice job until now . 
Um , is this your  
Whatever . 
Well , I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire . 
<fatigued sigh> 
Yeah . 
A five . A five . 
Doesn't matter . 
We probably will . 
The amount , yeah . 
I don't know  
I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use , really . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And how do you know ? 
I mean , you got that email . Did it point out what to use them for ? 
Alright , 
well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess . 
I don't know . 
I don't know if it's very special . 
Alright , that's okay . 
No . 
I don't think so , because it says amount . 
The the the yellow row is the amount of  
To n 
that's total of four buttons . 
I think that  
Eighteen . 
One two three four five , si 
Fifty cents for one single stupid button . 
Yeah , exactly . Yeah . 
<other> I can't  
I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . Really . 
Yeah , yeah ,  <other> 
No , really . 
Yeah , but I d I wouldn't want to own that . Really . 
Yeah . 
I don't think the special form is really true . 
Is it ? 
Yeah , I dunno . 
Plastic . 
No . 
Yeah , I really don't get it . 
I mean if it's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents . 
Yeah , yep . 
I think so , too . 
Oh , I don't know . 
<laugh> Uh why ? 
I mean i i if you  
if it would cost two Euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too , 
I mean uh we're not gonna add uh a trip to Hawaii to it . 
I like the hand dynamo part . 
We can make a plain docking station for two Euros . 
I mean  
Wi wi without recharge  
Yeah , 
but but we can make a docking station for two Euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it . 
I mean , it has a shape . 
Of course it has a shape , but i i 
Why should that not be possible ? 
No , 
for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip . 
Yes . 
Dead . 
Reanimate it . 
What the hell are these ? 
Oh , whatever . 
<laugh> 
This isn't helpful . 
No , that was my presentation . 
It's already open . 
It's at the bottom . 
It's uh at your task bar . 
Oh . 
Sorry . 
Okay , sorry . 
Yeah , nice . I it doesn't say anything . 
That's not needed . 
A display uh is , of course , uh for showing letters . For showing text . 
I don't think that uh just a l a little light  
Yeah , I agree . 
Yeah , I guess so too . 
Next channel . 
No . 
Well , we might want it , but  <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Great . 
Delete . 
Yeah . 
Well , there're three , I guess . 
I think we can make a docking station . Yeah . 
No , that's true . 
M bu 
Or the hand dynamo dynamo  
Yeah . 
Yeah , but but if we ca 
I don't know if  
Five minutes . 
That's not true . 
We can make a docking station for two thirty . 
Two thirty . 
We can make a docking station . Sure . 
Sure . 
The power device is is i i is very cheap . 
That's just a regular uh power cable and whatever . 
So . 
Yeah . 
<other> Well then it's a useless project . 
<other> Can't we uh  
Can't we say fifteen Euros ? 
No , sta yeah  I mean  
No . 
You can sell for twenty seven and a half . 
Then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs . 
I don't think  
No . 
Thirteen twenty . 
And I think only  
Yeah , but only kinetic , then you gotta  
You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really . 
No . 
Yeah , it's funny for a week . 
I guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating . 
No , I I don't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously . 
Well , we've got more than fifty Cents . 
Yeah . <yawn> No , we won't , but that's um something else . 
No , this not gonna sell . No . 
Of course not . 
We come back tomorrow , okay ? 
We can't do anything else . 
Warning , finish meeting now . 
Yeah , <other> sure . 
No , we can't . 
Yes , yes . Celebration . 
I don't see why , but  
I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest . 
No , not yet . 
Alright , I'll see you guys in a minute . 
I don't think so . 
I don't know . I don't I don't think so .
