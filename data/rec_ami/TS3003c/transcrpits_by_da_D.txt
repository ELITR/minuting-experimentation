Good afternoon . 
 
Sure . 
I'll start off then . 
Doh . 
'Kay 
I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . 
Um we've done some market research . 
We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . 
And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . 
And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be . 
Um okay 
these are some overall findings . 
Um most important thing is the fancy design . 
Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . 
Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . 
By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls . 
Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . 
Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . 
'Kay 
these are some more group specific findings . 
Uh the older people prefer dark colours . 
Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . 
And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . 
Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . 
Um this leads us to some personal preferences . 
Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . 
Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . 
Just keep it simple 
and  
Well 
the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , 
because this would be the  These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . 
So this would be very important that we <other> at least include these features . 
Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . 
So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . 
This is not really  
This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . 
So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . 
So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . 
Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . 
The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . 
Uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means . 
That would be all . 
Any questions ? 
<cough> 
<laugh> 
And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? 
You just  
You use it and it works . 
Okay . 
Well 
personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it . 
And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . 
And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um 
get great popularity for our product . 
Um wel 
Yeah 
you could load up the batteries , 
you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there . 
That's true . <cough> 
I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? 
'Cause in our earlier um market research , 
if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard . 
Um so 
it was open here . 
Um we also um asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . 
Well 
you can see here , our target group would not do that . 
So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control 
I would greatly advise not to do it . 
I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the 
younger people . 
Um well 
this is 
Yeah 
but this is 
here the question was , would you prefer it . 
So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . 
And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use . 
And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use . 
Um well 
this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones . 
So pretty large . 
'Kay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well 
 <cough> And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . 
So it wouldn't actually have to be wood , 
if it's just 
wood-coloured . 
Probably . 
<laugh> 
Yeah that is true . 
Yeah . 
We would have to look carefully into the design though . 
'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . The more original one , or the more standard one . 
So that would  
Well 
I wouldn't design a telephone 
but  <laugh> 
Well 
no 
I think w we should just , we should then just design one um 
one remote , 
but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . 
So , 
but that shouldn't be too much of a problem . 
Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved . 
Could you explain that a little more ? 
Mm-hmm . 
And what would single curved and double curved mean ? 
Okay . 
So 
we can pretty much just do whatever we want . 
'Kay . 
That's good . 
No 
just to lie down . 
We'll go for that . 
Well 
or besides it . 
<cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side , 
so you could , so your thumb would be easily  
Well uh 
I think that was a very good point 
'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_ . 
So that would be great for that . 
Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side . 
For left-handed users also . 
For the volume . 
Um well 
that could 
 Yeah 
we could do that 
but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . 
But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . 
'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff . 
That is true . 
Yeah . 
<cough> 
Yeah . That is true . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
And I'd prefer the corners to be round . 
Think that would be better . 
Friendly on the eye . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Very good .
