No . 
Mm no . 
 
Um <other> 'kay um yeah . 
 uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . 
Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . 
So uh um uh 
that's w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design . 
So um 
finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . Um the uh  I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . 
So 
maybe uh we can uh use uh that . Um  
Uh and uh using a little uh display . 
So um 
findings . 
Um yeah 
just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . 
So uh 
only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . 
Um uh let's see . Um yeah and  Uh 
 we uh need some uh new a attractive functions 
uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . 
So uh 
it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . 
Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . 
Um and yeah 
overall um user-friendly . 
So uh 
using uh large large buttons . Um  
It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . 
Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . 
So uh uh yeah . 
And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off 
or  A and 
uh yeah . 
Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . Um  
Let's see . Uh yeah . 
I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , 
um just one button to keep it uh simple . 
Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . 
Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . 
So uh  Um  Yeah 
and w we have to keep uh in general buttons 
uh so um 
we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . 
Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . 
And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . 
So um 
made a little uh picture of uh it . 
Um  See . Um yeah . 
Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , 
um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . 
Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button . 
So um  
D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . 
Uh um you can put it uh on top . 
Um it's uh most uh uh place where people uh , most of  looks at . 
So uh um 
and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the  
So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . 
Um it's uh quite uh handy place . 
So um and uh 
all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh  
Uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it 
so  
And that's it . 
 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Nah . 
<laugh> 
But 
what's the function ? 
Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries 
 . 
B b 
Okay 
but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe . 
Uh it's uh just a small display 
so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . 
So I believe one battery uh is just enough . 
Uh so  
Okay . 
Yeah . That's true . Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Uh . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
 
'Kay . 
Yeah . 
But uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display , or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
No . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Uh I dunno . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . 
So um uh 
you 'cause 
uh  Yeah 
with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it . 
So 
maybe it's possible uh possibility . 
So um um 
you have just to make one um standard um remote control , 
and um yeah you can sell uh few uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
 okay . 
Mm . 
Uh we can just use the regular form of it , 
but it's um not quite uh fancy . 
So um  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
 
For uh  Uh for  
Yeah yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah 
we 
Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? And on the uh other uh <other> uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? 
Or  Or isn't it ? 
Yeah okay . 
Uh . 
Mm . 
Yeah 
but  
<other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
See um yeah . 
Or we have to make a left uh  For lefties 
and  <laugh> 
Um  
<other> 
You mean um  
Yeah 
if  
Mm no . 
Yeah . 
Um  
Yeah . 
It's just uh u using uh your thumb . 
So um 
it's  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Um  
Yeah yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
 
So um  
Do you say this 
um  S uh  Uh 
you got like uh sort of a  I believe   There ? 
So um 
you want to put a display over here ? Or not ? 
Yeah . 
Um  Yeah . Uh 
we can make it um  
Mm ? 
That's the top . 
So uh 
this top . 
This down . 
Um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like 
um  Let's see . Um  
Colour uh 
okay . 
Uh to make this side um like mm the right colour . 
Um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . 
So um  
Uh it's an  
So so 
the remote control have to um lay in your hand . 
So uh 
it's possib um yeah for s so and 
And to put uh the the buttons for um changing uh the channel uh over here uh  
Yeah . 
<other> Uh rem 
Yeah 
but this place um  
Uh it's  
Yeah 
I dunno um  
Yeah . 
 
Yeah 
so  
So  
<laugh> 
Five minutes . <other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
But um the on-off button , um still on the top uh  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 'Kay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay .
