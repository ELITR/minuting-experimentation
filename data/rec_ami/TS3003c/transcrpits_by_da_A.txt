Okay . Uh 
good afternoon . 
This is our third meeting already . 
I hope you enjoyed your lunch . <laugh> 
I did anyway . <laugh> 
Um let's see . 
Presentation three . 
Okay 
this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today . 
It's the conceptual design meeting . 
And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components . Uh conceptual specification of design . And also trend-watching . 
Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations 
you're going to show me in a few minutes . 
Um but first I'll show you the agenda . 
Uh first the opening . 
Then we have three presentations . 
Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . 
How we're going to make it . 
And then we're closing . 
We have about forty minutes . 
Uh so I suggest let's get started . 
Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? 
No ? 
Everything fine ? 
That's nice . 
Then a little uh thing about the last meeting . 
Uh these are the points um we agreed on . The requirements and the target market . 
Uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . 
And we are going to use default materials . 
Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? Maybe ? 
No ? 
These are just the the things we thought of , 
so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . 
And maybe we can uh work it out . 
And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers . 
So 
now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , 
um I suggest let's get started with the presentations . 
So 
shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ? 
Okay . 
Good luck . <laugh> 
Okay . 
Thank you . 
Any questions about the the trends ? 
Mayb 
No ? 
Okay , 
we go on to the next one . 
<cough> 
Okay . 
Uh thank you . <cough> 
Okay . 
Thank you . 
So 
that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . 
Mm . 
'Kay . So 
these are the points we have to discuss . 
Um first I think we can talk about the energy source , 
since that's um has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image . 
Uh so 
uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Okay  . <laugh> 
<other> 
Yeah . 
No . 
Yeah . Okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Uh  
Uh well 
I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place . 
And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . 
So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place . 
And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . 
But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . 
So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . 
And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels . 
That's safe . 
Yeah . That's a good point . 
Yeah , sure . Go ahead . 
No . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Easier to use ? 
No , 
I think that's a good point . 
Yeah . 
I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . 
Because it's just uh some extra information , 
and it's easy to ignore as well . 
So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it . 
And um yeah 
I think the um  
Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . 
Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . 
And I don't think the  I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well . 
So 
that brings us back to the energy . 
If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . Um  
So 
in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , 
but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . 
And much cheaper as well . 
So  
Okay 
let me just choose for the battery . 
That brings us to the chip . 
Just the advanced . 
Okay 
 , advanced chip . 
And then we get to the point of the case . 
Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . 
Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ? 
Um as we saw there is not  
Yeah 
wood is a lot more expensive to produce . 
Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , 
which they can show off to their grandkids . 
Look I've got a new remote control , and uh  
Yeah . That's right . 
But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ? 
You don't know ? 
I think so 
because  
Yeah . 
It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape . 
Yeah . 
Change the cases . Yeah . 
You can sell the cases . 
Yeah . 
I think that's a very good option . 
Because um then you can advertise as well 
with the  
Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . <laugh> 
Because that's a  it's something extra , 
it's something other remotes don't have , 
which we can get a great advantage point . 
So 
and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey , other colours as well . 
Costs . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . So 
you suggest we should design two different telephones 
on which you can apply , yeah <other> remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example . 
Remote . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
So 
everybody's okay with the changing covers ? 
I think that's a good uh good option . 
Changing case covers . 
Yeah . 
Mm . Okay . 
Uh but the form has to be um  It has to  
It's has to be possible to stand up ? 
Or just only to lie down ? 
And the the cover of the the docking station is also 
on top of the television then ? Or not ? 
And you can just yeah then click it in . 
That's okay . 
Um so 
the interface . What type of interface do we want to use ? 
Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the 
on the the board . 
Does somebody have ideas for a form 
or 
Yep . 
Mm . 
Usabili 
Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult , 
and then it's  
<other> 
But you have extra buttons . 
So people can get confused . 
Especially if they have the same writings on it . 
Can't we make uh  Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same 
functions as the normal one ? 
Then you have to  
Let's see if I ca 
A blank one . 
And then you get  
Here's a little L_C_D_ screen . 
Uh now I have to think . 
It's a plus and a min . 
No it's not very handy I think . 
Because the plus and the min will be opposite 
and all kinds of  
No that's not gonna work . I guess . 
Maybe we should  
Yeah . 
But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? 
I think the functions are 
that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel 
or  
Y yeah . Yeah . 
I think we could just uh leave it a normal shape . 
Uh but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . In one or ano another way . 
Yeah . 
Um yeah 
just  
Yeah . 
Easier ? 
'Kay . 
I suggest um the single curved , 
because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . 
Uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control 
and at the same time look easily at the screen , 
because it's a bit , it has a bit of a angle . 
Yeah . I think so . Yeah . 
But now it's  
Do you have it upside down 
or  
Do you have it 
this that's top ? Okay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
So 
get your mouse . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . That's a good one . 
But I think it's better to put the screen uh on top . 
So 
just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around 
then you get   here . 
If you can have this one , you turn it like this . 
And then flip it upside down . 
Because uh maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here . 
I think i 
On top . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
 . So 
then we get  
Here's  
That's the curve . 
Here the display , and then buttons . 
Yeah 
and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . 
Just that's for left hand and right hand users . 
And then h the rest of the buttons over here . 
Yeah still here 
jus 
That's  
Yeah . 
Should be more bit more friendly , 
yeah . 
'Kay . 
Supplements . That's okay . 
Where's my mouse ? 
Then  We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . 
So now 
for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . 
It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote . 
So check out the corporate website maybe . 
The user interface design , it's the same story . 
And product evaluation . 
So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one . 
But you're going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach . 
So 
just um I will put these um minutes on the in the folder . 
And then we're going to uh try to finish our project , 
and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , I think . 
<laugh> Which are  
Uh let's see . 
I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together 
or  
I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first . 
And then you'll get a message . 
So 
that's uh basically it . 
Maybe this one ? 
Then we can save this one in the folders group . 
Uh yes , it's here . 
<other> SMARTboard , there it it . 
So 
if you wanna have a look at it , it's over there in the projects folder . 
And then I guess we'll start in thirty minutes again . 
Thank you .
