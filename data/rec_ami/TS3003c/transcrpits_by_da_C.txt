Okay . 
About the components design . 
Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery 
or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , 
which you just shake and it produces energy . 
But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . 
So I don't think it's really an option . 
Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . 
It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . 
It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions . 
Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . 
Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . 
And the chip-set , um it says simple here , 
but it should be advanced , 
because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen . 
And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , 
but it raises the price 
and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . 
Form should follow function overall . 
Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . 
But depends on what we want . 
I think we should disc discuss that . 
Um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . 
And the chip-set uh really should be advanced 
because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . 
And that's it . 
Yes 
w 
there there are four options . 
We could use the basic normal battery . 
Uh a hand dynamo . 
But I don't think that's <laugh> really an option . 
You don't wanna swing before you can watch television . 
Uh solar cells . 
But not every room is very light 
so it's not a very good option . 
Or the kinetic energy . 
Well 
y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . That's true . 
Oh . 
Mm I don't have any information on pricing . 
So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department . 
But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . 
It's a bit higher percentage , 
but  
Okay . 
And that's the best choice . 
Well 
there isn't any choice there 
because we're using the the the the display . 
So it's gotta be advanced . 
<laugh> 
Mm I dunno . 
I'll have to uh research . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yes . 
Yes . 
Well 
the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . 
And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases . 
Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know . 
So 
it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . 
It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality . 
Pick one you like , 
yes . 
Yeah . 
I think we should start by by choosing a case . 
Because that's the basis you're building on . 
So 
I could draw them out . 
Let's look at the flat case . 
Oh . 
It's from the side 
so it's rather normal . 
The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like , but I think it's something like this . 
So 
this type should be better for you 
or better  Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit . 
And the double curved s looks something like this I guess . 
So 
th those are the three options we have . 
Yeah . 
It's more logical to have it on top as well 
because , like on your mobile phone , it's always above . 
Oh 
maybe you should just s start on a blank page . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Okay .
