A:  Okay . Uh good afternoon . This is our third meeting already . I hope you enjoyed your lunch . <laugh> I did anyway . <laugh> Um let's see . 
D:  Good afternoon . 
A:  Presentation three . Okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today . It's the conceptual design meeting . And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components . Uh conceptual specification of design . And also trend-watching . Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes . Um but first I'll show you the agenda . Uh first the opening . Then we have three presentations . Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . How we're going to make it . And then we're closing . We have about forty minutes . Uh so I suggest let's get started . Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? No ? Everything fine ? That's nice . 
B:  No . 
D:   
A:  Then a little uh thing about the last meeting . Uh these are the points um we agreed on . The requirements and the target market . Uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . And we are going to use default materials . Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? Maybe ? No ? These are just the the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . And maybe we can uh work it out . And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers . So now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , um I suggest let's get started with the presentations . So shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ? 
D:  Sure . I'll start off then . 
A:  Okay . Good luck . <laugh> 
D:  Doh . 
topic_description:	opening_None


D:  That would be all . 
A:  Okay . Thank you . Any questions about the the trends ? Mayb 
D:  Any questions ? 
B:  Mm no . 
A:  No ? 
topic_description:	marketing expert presentation_None


D:  'Kay I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . Um we've done some market research . We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be . Um okay these are some overall findings . Um most important thing is the fancy design . Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls . Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . 'Kay these are some more group specific findings . Uh the older people prefer dark colours . Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . 
topic_description:	trendwatching_None


D:  Um this leads us to some personal preferences . Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . Just keep it simple and  Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the  These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . So this would be very important that we <other> at least include these features . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


D:  Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . This is not really  This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . 
topic_description:	trendwatching_None


D:  Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . Uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


A:  Okay , we go on to the next one . 
B:   
A:  <cough> 
B:  Um <other> 'kay um yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
B:  And that's it . 
A:  Uh thank you . <cough> 
topic_description:	interface specialist presentation_None


B:   uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . So uh um uh that's w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design . So um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . Um the uh  I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . So maybe uh we can uh use uh that . Um  Uh and uh using a little uh display . So um findings . Um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . So uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . Um uh let's see . Um yeah and  Uh  we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . So uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . Um and yeah overall um user-friendly . So uh using uh large large buttons . Um  It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . So uh uh yeah . And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or  A and uh yeah . Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . Um  Let's see . Uh yeah . I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . So uh  Um  Yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . So um made a little uh picture of uh it . Um  See . Um yeah . Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button . So um  
C:  <other> 
B:  D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . Uh um you can put it uh on top . Um it's uh most uh uh place where people uh , most of  looks at . So uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the  So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . Um it's uh quite uh handy place . So um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh  Uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it so  
topic_description:	look and usability_None


C:  Okay . About the components design . Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . So I don't think it's really an option . Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions . Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . And the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen . And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . Form should follow function overall . Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . But depends on what we want . I think we should disc discuss that . Um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . And the chip-set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . And that's it . 
A:  Okay . Thank you . 
topic_description:	industrial designer presentation_None


A:  So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . Mm . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  'Kay . So these are the points we have to discuss . 
topic_description:	discussion_None


A:  Um first I think we can talk about the energy source , since that's um has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image . Uh so 
B:   
A:  uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think . 
C:  Yes w there there are four options . We could use the basic normal battery . Uh a hand dynamo . But I don't think that's <laugh> really an option . You don't wanna swing before you can watch television . Uh solar cells . But not every room is very light so it's not a very good option . Or the kinetic energy . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> Okay  . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  No . Yeah . Okay . 
D:  And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? You just  
C:  Well y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up . Yeah . 
D:  You use it and it works . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Okay . Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it . 
B:  Nah . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . That's true . 
D:  And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um 
C:  Oh . 
D:  get great popularity for our product . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  But 
D:  Um wel 
B:  what's the function ? Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries  . 
D:  Yeah you could load up the batteries , you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there . 
B:  B b Okay but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe . Uh it's uh just a small display so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . So I believe one battery uh is just enough . Uh so  
A:  Uh  Uh well I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place . And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place . 
D:  That's true . <cough> 
B:  Okay . Yeah . That's true . Yeah . 
A:  And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . Okay . 
A:  And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels . 
B:  Yeah . Uh . 
A:  That's safe . 
C:  But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . 
B:  'Kay . 
C:  It's a bit higher percentage , but  
D:  Um well this is Yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Easier to use ? No , I think that's a good point . 
B:  But uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display , or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use ? 
D:  Um well this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  So pretty large . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . Because it's just uh some extra information , and it's easy to ignore as well . So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it . 
B:  No . Yeah . 
A:  And um yeah I think the um  Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . And I don't think the  I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  So that brings us back to the energy . If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . Um  
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . And much cheaper as well . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  So  
C:  And that's the best choice . 
A:  Okay let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip . 
C:  Well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display . So it's gotta be advanced . 
A:  Just the advanced . Okay  , advanced chip . 
D:  'Kay . 
A:  And then we get to the point of the case . Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ? Um as we saw there is not  Yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce . Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . Look I've got a new remote control , and uh  
D:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Well  <cough> And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . So it wouldn't actually have to be wood , if it's just 
B:  Uh I dunno . 
A:  Yeah . That's right . 
D:  wood-coloured . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ? 
C:  Mm I dunno . I'll have to uh research . 
A:  You don't know ? I think so because  Yeah . It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape . 
D:  Probably . 
B:  Mm . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


D:  I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? 
A:  Yeah . That's a good point . 
C:  Mm I don't have any information on pricing . So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department . 
B:  Mm . 
topic_description:	project budget_None


D:  'Cause in our earlier um market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard . 
A:  Yeah , sure . Go ahead . 
D:  Um so it was open here . Um we also um asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Well you can see here , our target group would not do that . So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control 
A:  No . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  I would greatly advise not to do it . I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the 
A:  Yeah . 
B:   
A:  Yeah . 
D:  younger people . 
topic_description:	user target group_None


B:  Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . So um uh you 'cause uh  Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it . So 
A:  Yeah . Change the cases . Yeah . 
B:  maybe it's possible uh possibility . So um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh  Yeah . 
A:  You can sell the cases . Yeah . I think that's a very good option . Because um then you can advertise as well with the  Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Because that's a  it's something extra , it's something other remotes don't have , which we can get a great advantage point . So and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey , other colours as well . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah that is true . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . We would have to look carefully into the design though . 
A:  Costs . 
D:  'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . The more original one , or the more standard one . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . So you suggest we should design two different telephones 
D:  So that would  
A:  on which you can apply , yeah <other> remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example . 
D:  Well I wouldn't design a telephone but  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Well no I think w we should just , we should then just design one um 
A:  Remote . 
D:  one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . 
A:  Yeah . Okay . 
D:  So , but that shouldn't be too much of a problem . 
A:  So everybody's okay with the changing covers ? 
C:  Yes . 
A:  I think that's a good uh good option . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Changing case covers . 
topic_description:	look and usability_None


D:  Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved . Could you explain that a little more ? 
C:  Yes . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases . 
D:  Mm-hmm . And what would single curved and double curved mean ? 
C:  Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know . So it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality . 
D:  Okay . So we can pretty much just do whatever we want . 
C:  Pick one you like , yes . 
A:  Mm . Okay . 
D:  'Kay . That's good . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


A:  Uh but the form has to be um  It has to  It's has to be possible to stand up ? Or just only to lie down ? 
D:  No just to lie down . 
B:   okay . 
A:  And the the cover of the the docking station is also 
D:  We'll go for that . 
A:  on top of the television then ? Or not ? 
D:  Well or besides it . 
A:  And you can just yeah then click it in . That's okay . Um so the interface . What type of interface do we want to use ? Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the 
D:  <cough> Mm-hmm . 
A:  on the the board . Does somebody have ideas for a form or 
B:  Mm . Uh we can just use the regular form of it , but it's um not quite uh fancy . So um  Yeah . 
D:  Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily  Well uh I think that was a very good point 'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_ . So that would be great for that . Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah .  For uh  Uh for  Yeah yeah . 
D:  For left-handed users also . 
A:  Yep . 
B:  Mm . Yeah we um Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? And on the uh other uh <other> uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? Or  Or isn't it ? 
D:  For the volume . Um well that could 
A:  Mm . 
D:   Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . 
A:  Usabili Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult , and then it's  
B:  Yeah okay . Uh . 
A:  <other> 
D:  But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff . 
B:  Yeah but  
A:  But you have extra buttons . So people can get confused . 
B:  <other> Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  That is true . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Especially if they have the same writings on it . 
B:  See um yeah . Or we have to make a left uh  For lefties and  <laugh> 
A:  Can't we make uh  Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same 
B:  Um  
A:  functions as the normal one ? 
B:  <other> You mean um  
A:  Then you have to  
B:  Yeah if  
A:  Let's see if I ca A blank one . And then you get  Here's a little L_C_D_ screen . Uh now I have to think . <other> It's a plus and a min . No it's not very handy I think . Because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of  
B:  Mm no . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . <cough> 
A:  No that's not gonna work . I guess . Maybe we should  Yeah . But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? I think the functions are 
B:  Um  
A:  that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel or  
D:  Yeah . That is true . 
B:  Yeah . It's just uh u using uh your thumb . So um it's  
A:  Y yeah . Yeah . I think we could just uh leave it a normal shape . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . In one or ano another way . 
B:  Yeah . Um  
topic_description:	look and usability_None


C:  I think we should start by by choosing a case . Because that's the basis you're building on . 
B:  Yeah yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Um yeah just  
C:  So I could draw them out . Let's look at the flat case . Oh . It's from the side so it's rather normal . The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like , but I think it's something like this . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  So this type should be better for you or better  Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit . 
A:  Easier ? 
C:  And the double curved s looks something like this I guess . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  So th those are the three options we have . 
A:  'Kay . I suggest um the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . Uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it's a bit , it has a bit of a angle . 
D:  Mm . 
B:   So um  Do you say this um  S uh  Uh you got like uh sort of a  I believe   There ? 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	components, materials and energy sources_None


B:  So um you want to put a display over here ? Or not ? Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . I think so . Yeah . 
B:  Um  Yeah . Uh we can make it um  Mm ? That's the top . So uh this top . This down . Um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like um  Let's see . Um  
A:  But now it's  Do you have it upside down or  Do you have it this that's top ? Okay . 
B:  Colour uh okay . Uh to make this side um like mm the right colour . Um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . So um  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh it's an  
A:  Yeah . 
B:  So so the remote control have to um lay in your hand . So uh it's possib um yeah for s so and 
A:  So get your mouse . Yeah . 
B:  And to put uh the the buttons for um changing uh the channel uh over here uh  
A:  Yeah . That's a good one . But I think it's better to put the screen uh on top . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <other> Uh rem 
A:  So just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get   here . If you can have this one , you turn it like this . And then flip it upside down . 
B:  Yeah but this place um  Uh it's  Yeah I dunno um  
A:  Because uh maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  It's more logical to have it on top as well because , like on your mobile phone , it's always above . 
B:   
A:  I think i 
B:  Yeah so  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  On top . 
B:  So  
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page . 
A:   . So then we get  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Here's  That's the curve . 
B:  Five minutes . <other> 
A:  Here the display , and then buttons . Yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . Just that's for left hand and right hand users . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  And then h the rest of the buttons over here . 
B:  Yeah . But um the on-off button , um still on the top uh  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah still here jus 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  That's  
D:  And I'd prefer the corners to be round . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 'Kay . 
D:  Think that would be better . 
A:  Should be more bit more friendly , yeah . 
D:  Friendly on the eye . 
A:  'Kay .

A:  Supplements . That's okay . Where's my mouse ? Then  
topic_description:	agenda/equipment issues_None


A:  We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . So now for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote . So check out the corporate website maybe . The user interface design , it's the same story . And product evaluation . So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one . But you're going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach . So just um I will put these um minutes on the in the folder . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  And then we're going to uh try to finish our project , and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , I think . <laugh> Which are  Uh let's see . I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or  I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first . And then you'll get a message . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  So that's uh basically it . Maybe this one ? Then we can save this one in the folders group . Uh yes , it's here . <other> SMARTboard , there it it . So if you wanna have a look at it , it's over there in the projects folder . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  And then I guess we'll start in thirty minutes again . Thank you . 
D:  Very good . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  Okay .
