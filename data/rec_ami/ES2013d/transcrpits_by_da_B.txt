<cough> 
<other> I keep forgetting whether I've done this .  . 
Yep . 
Ta-da . 
Right . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Um well 
I don't have very much to add . 
Um the the case  
oops , 
that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype . 
The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . 
We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , 
but it can be either of those . 
We have the technology to do that . 
Um and as for the the actual components um , uh Steph just said this is a  quite a cheap device to manufacture . 
We have simple rubber push buttons 
um which provide all the functionality we need . 
Um the um <other> the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , 
it's the stalk of the banana , 
or it's just the thing at the end of this version . 
Um so 
that's for material . 
Colour , well uh Steph's the expert on colour . 
Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that . 
Yeah , 
I think that's all we've got to say really . 
A banana . 
<other> Would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ? 
Yes , 
that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it . 
And it was partly we thought the design looked better , 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
And it's a very simple design , 
there's not a lot to wrong , 
the components are cheap to make . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Yes , 
a plain , simple , clean design . 
<other> Well 
we have got s trendy further down , 
but  
Elegant , I don't know if I'd call them elegant . 
Stylish , yeah . 
<other> Yeah , 
I'd  
I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept . 
I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative . 
Very . 
Yeah . 
We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy . 
I think  
yeah . 
Yeah . 
No . 
So that's false . <laugh> 
No . 
Yeah , 
I think they're different , 
aren't they ? 
Mm . <other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well 
I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . 
We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there . 
I'd put it at one I think , 
but  
I dunno , 
what do you  
Yeah , true , 
it might be the  
yeah , yeah , true . 
True . 
Yeah , that's a good point . 
<laugh> Right . 
<other> Yeah . 
That was the crank , wind-up crank on the side . <laugh> 
Just one . 
Uh uh yeah , I think we can do it all with simple  
Just checking that . 
Yeah , simple , 
'cause we've just got push buttons , 
so we can do it all with simple 
which is the ch should be the cheapest . 
Yep . 
Yeah , that that one is single curve , 
isn't it ? 
Um do we have 
I I think you  it means you reverse the curve . 
Yeah . Yeah , I do I don't think we need that for either of them , 
you can do a banana in single curve , 
yeah . 
<other> 
Yeah , 
can we do some what ifs , 
'cause it may  
I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , 
but it depends on the cost , I guess . 
Yes . 
Yep . 
Do we need to say how many buttons , 
or 
or d is it just one ? 
'Kay . 
Uh they'll be rubber , yep . 
Actually , 
does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? 
'Cause I think they can be plastic . 
Yeah . They could be plastic , 
we don't have to have rubber buttons , 
because we haven't got a double curved case . 
It's just one , 
isn't it ? 
What , we're in . 
More profit . 
Do you do you need to double click on that to open it ? 
Yeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought . <other> 
<other> Yep . 
<other> Yeah . 
<other> Yeah , I think we're a good team actually . 
I'm not sure all the wires are really great though . 
I thought so . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
hang on , 
Oh 
we haven't heard . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Absolutely , 
and it's kept us within budget . 
And then we get the product launch party . 
Product launch party ? 
<laugh> Absolutely . <laugh>
