Yes . 
Alright . 
Well . 
Yeah , 
well you see , 
each made one , 
we didn't have enough yellow dough . 
This is the one that I made . 
It is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . 
This is like a scroll , 
but they are push buttons 
and they enter  takes you into the different menus . 
Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television  . 
I mean this is the infrared thing 
that's gonna zap at the television . 
Uh I'm not quite sure how to make that , 
but I'm sure it will work . 
Uh this is on off switch , 
'cause I think we do need that , 
and I think it gives it a nice balance . 
And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . 
Um as for what it's actually made of  
well 
the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right <other> in the different menus . 
Uh position , I presume that just means right right on it , easy to see . 
The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , 
lack of uh buttons all over the place . 
Right ? 
<other> Form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , 
makes it feel nice to hold . 
Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , 
but I think we have two different options , 
because we did make a another one , 
which wa uh is in the shape of banana , 
it's just  
if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , 
which is also nice 
and easy to hold 
and feels good 
and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , 
just a slightly different design . 
Also with on off switch and infrared  <other> 
uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . 
So like uh  well , 
I dunno , 
what's it like ? 
I guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth . 
Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one  
or mix and match , 
just we were gonna see what you thought , 
the  
uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . 
So 
we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . 
And what we 
well , 
what conclusion we reach when we discuss it . 
<other> Uh material  yeah , that's what I have to say about material . 
Can I scroll down on there and see what else  
Well 
colour , I think  I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , 
because that's the company colours , 
but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well . 
<other> So , 
it just depends what you think about these ideas 
and if I'm  
yeah , 
maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them . 
<laugh> 
I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . 
This one has n 
banana , yeah . 
This one has no obvious connections to fruit , 
but because it's round and molded , 
it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , 
it's more like  
yeah , 
you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , 
which I quite like that sort of image . 
'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly 
and 
<laugh> Hold them , 
you see , you know . 
Curvature , is it to your liking ? 
<laugh> If you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all . 
Yeah . 
 
Breaking , 
oh right . <other> 
Well you see , 
that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , 
because then it'd just be rigid . 
Yeah ,  we really like we really like that design , 
I mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . 
Like a c like a compass point , 
you know , 
just up , down , left and right , 
and we think we could make that quite a good feature . 
And it's like the the iPod scroll wheel , <other> but better . 
Yeah . Yeah , yeah , 
I mean it  
that's what it makes me think of , mobile phones , 
I was try 
I was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ? 
It's texting . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
<other> I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of  <other> I mean actually how to program the menus 
and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , 
but we do definitely think that it's a viable option . 
<other> Uh yeah , we're finished . 
Yeah , 
what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials . 
<laugh> Not that we actually know anything about it , 
but we can we can pretend . 
It depends what what you mean by fancy really , 
'cause when I think of fancy , I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like baroque curliness 
and  which 
I'd call these quite uh minimalist , 
simple and plain , 
but I mean I do see what  <other> 
it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , 
so in that respect it is quite fancy . 
I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , 
I'd say maybe aesthetic . 
 like stylish or aesthetic . 
Fancy . 
Did you just break the pen ? 
Well 
d 
we'll just call it fancy then . 
Yeah , 
I think we n we need to  
they're both yellow with black buttons , 
it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that , 
but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . 
So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two 
that isn't 
 that is more curved , like a banana , 
but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , 
so . 
So 
that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , 
is it . 
Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two . 
<laugh> 
Yes . 
Oh yes . 
Well , 
maybe only a two or a three then , 
'cause it's no 
we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific  
Yeah , I don't really think that's gonna work , 
but  
No . 
No . <laugh> 
Well 
it is quite it is quite quirky I think . 
It could be quite a good brand , like a good little object . 
Oh , 
we also need tho think about the energy . 
Is it the kinetic energy ? 
If it's  
it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . 
Yeah , 
but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet , 
so we're not completely sure about that , 
but 
yeah . 
Yeah . 
I would say maybe a two , 
'cause we still  we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things . 
I mean it's not just like  I mean it's not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different , 
whereas this one has only got the four buttons 
and they all  they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in . 
 uh we need somebody to develop that . 
Yeah . 
Just putting no excess buttons . 
As for  
see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , 
because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . 
I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition 
but but we are at the upper end of the push button market . <laugh> 
<other> 
Well , 
just kinetic then ,  . 
It's the wind-up . 
What does double curved mean , I don't understand . 
Oh 
no , we don't need that . No . 
Single-curved , I'd say . 
I 
I just wanna say plastic . 
It's just button . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well 
yeah , 
like the compass point one . 
Yeah , they could be plastic . 
Great . 
Yes . 
Yeah . 
And Play-Doh . 
Yeah well , 
'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . 
So much better just to go and , you know , this is it , this is what we want . <laugh> 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Spongy . 
And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , 
so . 
Good work as a design team , 
because we  
Oh yes . 
Yes . 
Yeah . 
And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology , 
which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works , 
so . 
Yeah . 
So we do count as I think excellent or one . 
 . 
Bring on the ice sculptures . 
Yeah . 
That's what I said , ice sculptures .
