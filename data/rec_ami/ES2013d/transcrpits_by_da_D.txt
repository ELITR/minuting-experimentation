Red . 
Agenda three . 
Mm . 
I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role . 
It's really kind of a  
Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
But it's also like texting , 
you don't  
<other> 
Yeah . 
It's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite  it looks quite different . 
You know , 
I I d I have several  four remotes , 
and they all look the same until you get up close 
and you have to  
you know , 
this is really identifiable . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
No , okay . 
Um  
shall I take your uh power ? 
Oh . 
Okay . 
This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , 
and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . 
So , 
this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers 
a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . 
So 
I'm going to go and use the whiteboard , 
and I've made a list of criteria to look at , 
and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , 
but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , 
and I'm gonna now use the um the board . 
so 
one true seven false 
Okay . So um 
fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other . 
And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , 
because these are things that um have been brought up , 
some of them seem rather close , 
like they overlap . 
Mm , yeah , price . 
We'll put price up at the top . 
<laugh> 
Um Okay , so  
Did you say  ? 
Uh okay , 
so 
wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ? 
<other> Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> I  
yeah , so 
in that respect  
I think we'll go with that respect . 
Yeah . 
Elegant . 
Yeah , 
no 
these aren't the exact terms that the um  
Yeah . 
Elegant . We're gon let's use elegant , 
although the the the people , the word on the street is is <other>  
Yeah . <laugh> 
N that  um 
yeah 
uh  the uh  is fancy . 
So 
let's let's take it to the next level . 
Well okay , so 
in terms of elegant , fancy . we'll call it E_F_ um , do we do we think that perhaps  and maybe we should say the yellow ? 
Should we go with the yellow 
in terms of  
I think that's a really superior  
they're both  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
As a banana . 
I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana . 
And of the two I really like I m I like the banana , 
but I I do like the chunk . 
No , 
but I mean in terms  
we have to evaluate one of them . 
Unless  do you guys wanna evaluate both ? 
Okay . 
So 
we say true . 
<other> technologically innovative . 
Yeah . 
So 
we'll say  we'll say uh false . 
Easy to use . 
<other> One , 
is that inappropriate ? 
Okay . 
Oh , pardon me . Um 
trendy , s <other> and I say specifically spongy fruity . 
<other> Okay , so 
two ? Um 
are there excess buttons ? 
<other> <laugh> That is false . 
Um <other> good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons . 
True . 
Ugly . 
People don't respond well to ugly . 
Sellable , uh quirky , 
you know , 
something people  
like 
oh , 
yeah . Yeah , I do too . 
Oh yeah . 
And I was I was thinking of other things 
um in terms of 
uh could we say it's cost saving ? 
With the  
Yeah , with the energy . 
It is going to be kinetic ? 
we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro . 
Yeah , 
Uh so 
yes . 
Well <other> 
you're still in the Play-Doh stage . 
Anything else ? Including price , 
do you have any idea about price or other features ? 
Okay . 
So true one 
or should I go to two or three ? 
Okay . 
Um other ? Anything else you guys can thing of ? 
And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these 
so then I'm gonna  
instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive 
and then make that true , 
so that  
'cause I have to do an average . <other> 
And then um excess buttons . 
Exactly . 
Wow we're doing really well . 
Yeah , 
be 
you know , 
so it doesn't ruin the polarity . 
Or L_C_D_ . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Well 
if you g uh 
let me know if if any of these  um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here  if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . 
If not I'll average those . 
<other> Okay . 
Mm . 
So  
Um okay , 
how about if I uh pass this back to you 
and I'll uh figure out the average here . 
Thank you for everyone's help with that . 
<laugh> 
One , two , three , four , five , six . 
Yeah . 
Sure . 
Yes . 
<other> 
Yep . 
I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I  that really opened my eyes . 
I I only speak for myself though . 
Yes . 
I can give you a number , 
um it's uh  
the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , 
so it means w 
you know , 
I can I can spell it out . 
There were six true or ones , 
four 
um pardon me , 
two s almost true or close to true , 
so that was four points , 
and then uh one false , seven points , 
so seventeen divided by nine  we're between one and two . 
I would say that's ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place . 
To maintain old technology , 
exactly . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yes . 
Okay . 
Nice . 
So 
we might have to wait . 
Yeah . 
Um I  one thing I want to do is  
oh , 
I think the meeting's done . 
Yeah . 
Um one thing I wa I wanna do is save everything in the right files , 
because I don't think everything is saved . 
The right files . Final meeting market
