Um almost , 
there's one more thing I have to get out of the  
I have to make sure that this attachment will open . 
Ah-ha . 
Okay . 
We'll open that when the time is right . 
In the meantime  
Closing things down , 
okay . 
Let's see what this thing does . 
Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? 
Ah , 
we came up together , 
we're good . 
Okay . 
Are we ready to start ? 
Okay . 
It's now quarter of four . 
This is a f another forty minute one 
so it will end at four twenty five . 
Okay . Right . 
Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , 
for us to go over the previous minutes , 
then for the two of you to present your prototype 
and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria . 
We then have a finance aspect , 
which is a spreadsheet , an Excel spreadsheet . 
And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my , 
um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . 
So we're going to make a very fast track . 
Okay . Um 
and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing . 
So the first thing I have to do is close this 
so that I can get to  
Where is it ? 
<other> 
I need to open mine . Not the agenda . 
No 
that th 
I want the minutes from the previous  minutes . 
That should be there , minutes . 
Yeah . 
Okay . Uh 
from meeting three , 
is it alright with you if I don't switch it to show , just use it as is ? 
'Cause this way I can more easily flip it . 
Okay , um 
obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , 
we reviewed the previous minutes before that , 
um each of you made your presentations . 
<other> Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . 
The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . 
Um we decided chip on print would be used . 
Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , 
powered by kinetic energy . 
There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . 
Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . 
Um looking like a scroll , 
but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use , 
that is uh behind the scenes is push button 
which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . 
Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product 
that could be suggested to management . 
Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . 
Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits 
and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints 
and we ran out of time . 
Um we had to follow that up 
and prepare for the last one . 
And uh we closed 
as it ran out of time . 
Is that a fair presentation of what happened ? 
Okay , 
back to this meeting . 
Um we're down to the prototype presentation . 
Over to you . 
Ooh , 
two . 
Ah . 
Uh-huh . 
'Kay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<cough> 
Oh I see , the on-off's in the back . 
And then you can use your thumb . <other> 
I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the 
you know  
yeah . 
Hmm . 
Okay . 
The next item is evaluation . 
Uh if that's  
if you're finished . 
Oh sorry . 
<other> Try again . 
Hmm . 
Well 
we will soon , 
unfortunately . 
Come on . 
No ,  . 
Elegant . 
Elegant . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
The chunk . 
I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true . 
It's more true than false , about a two . 
Mm-hmm . 
Trendy . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
Excess buttons . 
No . 
Better , more intuitive buttons , yes . 
No . 
I like it . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yes , the instinct says true . 
Yeah , 
that's not a cheap thing to get . 
Hmm . 
I think we're good . 
Okay . 
We're a little over halfway through the meeting 
and the next big thing is the finance . 
Okay . 
Yep . 
Right . 
Right . 
And as you can see it says the same thing , 
it had not lost itself , 
thank Goodness . 
And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet 
that they provided to me . 
Um and 
it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device . 
Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Um what's a hand dynamo ? 
Oh 
shoot , 
forget that . 
Kinetic is um  
and how many of those will we need per  
we only need one . 
Okay . 
Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those . 
Okay , 
and we only need one of those . 
Okay , 
the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . 
It looks like it  single curve , 
'cause of th the chunkiness . 
It's  
that's uh uh one . 
And that's 
uh that's the the one that goes like this . 
Right . 
No , 
single curve . 
Okay , 
case material supplements . Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour . 
We had the special colour . 
And did we say plastic ? 
Yeah . 
Okay . We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added 
at the moment , that's where we are . 
Interface button  push button interface . That's what we're using , 
isn't it ? 
Whoops , 
don't want that , not yet . Um  
No , 
it just says push button interface . 
Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black . 
And the buttons  Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ? 
So we need one of them . 
And are they any special form ? 
'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top . 
Oh . 
<other> Okay . Um 
let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement . 
Uh we only need one of them . 
Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed . 
We're in . <laugh> 
That's us . 
Okay , 
I'm going to save this into our <other> desktop , project documents . Okay . As our project document bit . 
Yeah . 
There we are . 
That's the only Excel document that will be in there , 
so it's there for all of us . 
Okay , so , 
are they under twelve fifty ? 
Yes , 
go to the project evaluation , next slide . 
Right . Um 
the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity . 
Yeah , 
leadership , 
teamwork , 
means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things . 
Uh-huh . 
<laugh> 
Okay . <other> So , 
we went over all those things 
and we're satisfied with all the above . 
Um did we find any new ideas ? 
So 
we actually worked well as a group . 
Right . 
Are the costs within the budget ? 
Yes . 
Is the project evaluated ? 
Yes . 
Uh-huh . 
Mm-hmm . 
Alright . 
And we've therefore  we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , 
I have a final report to present , 
um and then we're done . 
We done good , 
and we're finished in time . 
<laugh> 
I believe that is the end of our meeting . 
Thank you , Melissa . <laugh>
