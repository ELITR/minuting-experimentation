B:  <cough> 
A:  Um almost , there's one more thing I have to get out of the  I have to make sure that this attachment will open . 
B:  <other> I keep forgetting whether I've done this .  . 
A:  Ah-ha . Okay . We'll open that when the time is right . In the meantime  Closing things down , okay . Let's see what this thing does . Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? Ah , we came up together , we're good . Okay . 


A:  Are we ready to start ? Okay . It's now quarter of four . This is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five . Okay . Right . Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria . We then have a finance aspect , which is a spreadsheet , an Excel spreadsheet . And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my , um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . So we're going to make a very fast track . Okay . Um and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing . So the first thing I have to do is close this so that I can get to  


A:  Where is it ? <other> 
D:  Red . 
A:  I need to open mine . Not the agenda . 
D:  Agenda three . Mm . 
A:  No that th I want the minutes from the previous  minutes . That should be there , minutes . Yeah . Okay . Uh from meeting three , is it alright with you if I don't switch it to show , just use it as is ? 'Cause this way I can more easily flip it . 


A:  Okay , um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , um each of you made your presentations . <other> Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . Um we decided chip on print would be used . Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . Um looking like a scroll , but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use , that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management . Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time . Um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one . And uh we closed as it ran out of time . Is that a fair presentation of what happened ? Okay , back to this meeting . Um we're down to the prototype presentation . 
C:  Yes . 
B:  Yep . Ta-da . Right . 
C:  Alright . 
A:  Over to you . 


C:  Well . 
A:  Ooh , two . 
C:  Yeah , well you see , each made one , we didn't have enough yellow dough . This is the one 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Ah . 
C:  that I made . 
A:  Uh-huh . 
C:  Can I scroll down on there and see what else  
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  <other> So , it just depends what you think about these ideas and if I'm  yeah , maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them . <laugh> 
B:  Um well I don't have very much to add . 


A:  Okay . The next item is evaluation . 
D:  No , okay . 
A:  Uh if that's  if you're finished . 
D:  Um  
C:  <other> Uh yeah , we're finished . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  shall I take your uh power ? 
A:  Oh sorry . 
D:  Oh . 
A:  <other> Try again . 


D:  Okay . This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . So , this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . So I'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and I've made a list of criteria to look at , and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and I'm gonna now use the um the board . Okay . So um fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other . And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that um have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , like they overlap . 
C:  Yeah , what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials . 
D:  Mm , yeah , price . 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  We'll put price up at the top . 
C:  <laugh> Not that we actually know anything about it , but we can we can pretend . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Well we will soon , unfortunately . 
D:  Um Okay , so  
A:  Come on . No 
D:  Did you say  ? 
D:  Sellable , uh quirky , you know , something people  like oh , yeah . Yeah , I do too . 
B:  Yeah , I think they're different , aren't they ? 
C:  Well it is quite it is quite quirky I think . 
A:  I like it . 
C:  It could be quite a good brand , like 
D:  Oh yeah . 
C:  a good little object . 
D:  And I was I was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving ? With the  
C:  Oh , we also need tho think about the energy . Is it the kinetic energy ? If it's  it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . 
D:  Yeah , with the energy . 
B:  Mm . <other> Yeah . 
D:  It is going to be kinetic ? 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah , we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro . Uh so yes . 
C:  Yeah , but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet , so we're not completely sure about that , but yeah . 
D:  Well <other> you're still in the Play-Doh stage . Anything else ? Including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ? 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Well I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Yes , the instinct says true . 
D:  So true one or should I go to two or three ? 
B:  I'd put it at one I think , but  I dunno , what do you  
D:  Okay . 
C:  I would say maybe a two , 'cause we still  we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus 
B:  Yeah , true , it might be the  yeah , yeah , true . 
C:  and things . I mean it's not just like  I mean it's not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different , whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all  they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in .  uh we need somebody to develop that . 
A:  Yeah , that's not a cheap thing to get . 
B:  True . 
A:  Hmm . 
B:  Yeah , that's a good point . 
D:  Um other ? Anything else you guys can thing of ? And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then I'm gonna  instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , so that  'cause I have to do an average . <other> And then um excess buttons . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> Right . 
C:  Just putting no excess buttons . 
D:  Exactly . Wow we're doing really well . Yeah , be you know , so it doesn't ruin the polarity . 
C:  As for  see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  but but we are at the upper end of the push button market . <laugh> 
D:  Or L_C_D_ . Yeah . Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these  um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here  if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . If not I'll average those . 
A:  I think we're good . 
D:  <other> Okay . 


D:  Mm . 
A:  Okay . We're a little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance . 
D:  So  
A:  Okay . 
D:  Um okay , how about if I uh pass this back to you and I'll uh figure out the average here . 
A:  Yep . Right . 
D:  Thank you for everyone's help with that . 
A:  Right . 


A:  And as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself , thank Goodness . 
A:  Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed . 
B:  What , we're in . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  We're in . <laugh> That's us . 
B:  More profit . 
C:  Great . 


A:  Okay , I'm going to save this into our <other> desktop , project documents . Okay . As our project document bit . 
B:  Do you do you need to double click on that to open it ? 
A:  Yeah . There we are . 
C:  Yes . 
A:  That's the only Excel document that will be in there , so it's there for all of us . Okay , so , are they under twelve fifty ? Yes , go to the project evaluation , next slide . Right . 


A:  Um the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity . Yeah , leadership , 
D:  Sure . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  teamwork , 
D:  Yes . 
A:  means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things . 
D:  <other> 
C:  And Play-Doh . 
A:  Uh-huh . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought . <other> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah well , 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . So much better just to go and , you know , this is it , this is what we want . <laugh> 
B:  <other> Yep . 
A:  Okay . <other> So , we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above . 
D:  Yep . 
A:  Um did we find any new ideas ? 
D:  I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I  that really opened my eyes . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> Spongy . 
D:  I I only speak for myself though . 
C:  And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , so . Good work as a design team , because we  
B:  <other> Yeah . <other> Yeah , I think we're a good team actually . I'm not sure all the wires are really great though . 
A:  So we actually worked well as a group . 
B:  I thought so . 
A:  Right . Are the costs within the budget ? Yes . Is the project evaluated ? Yes . 
C:  Oh yes . 
D:  Yes . 
B:  Yes . 
C:  Yes . 
B:  Yes . Oh hang on , we haven't heard . <laugh> 
D:  I can give you a number , um it's uh  the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , so it means w you know , I can I can spell it out . There were six true or ones , four um pardon me , two s almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then uh one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine  we're between one and two . I would say that's ex excellent 
A:  Uh-huh . 
D:  in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place . 
C:  Yeah . And the the only false one is because we've chosen 
D:  To maintain old technology , exactly . 
C:  to keep a simple old technology , which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works , so . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  <other> Absolutely , and it's kept us within budget . 
D:  Yes . 
C:  Yeah . So we do count as I think excellent or one . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 


A:  Alright . And we've therefore  we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , I have a final report to present , um and then we're done . 
C:   . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  We done good , and we're finished in time . 
C:  Bring on the ice sculptures . 
D:  Nice . 


B:  And then we get the product launch party . Product launch party ? <laugh> Absolutely . <laugh> 
D:  So we might have to wait . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  That's what I said , ice sculptures . 
D:  Um I  one thing I want to do is  oh , I think the meeting's done . 
C:  Is that the end of the meeting ? 
A:  I believe that is the end of our meeting . Thank you , Melissa . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 


D:  Um one thing I wa I wanna do is save everything in the right files , because I don't think everything is saved . The right files . Final meeting market
