<other> Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them , not just that , so . 
Would  
Oh 
I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like um  
maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost . 
Uh yeah , 
 it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative . 
From uh my presentation show , so . 
Uh technologically innovative . 
Mm . 
Well , 
if you g if you if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as well . 
Because if it  if you no 
if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of  if you you know it s kind of like sticks , 
if you know what I mean , 
up like one unit , 
if you see what I mean . 
So it kinda goes up one , 
then y like you can keep rolling it up , 
but it's like like like like a cog or something . 
So you kinda take it up one at a time . 
D 
<other> Oh . 
<other> Uh you could you could <other> as l as like a mouse you could  
Yeah , 
like the shape of it almost like a mouse , 
with a  
Dep I dunno if it  
depending on the final shape of it , 
'cause you could have like , I dunno ,  it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb , 
and then you could control the buttons with your fingers . 
Oh yeah , 
yeah . 
<laugh> 
 
Here we go . 
<other> Uh yeah , 
this is my report on trend watching . 
The data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer . 
And we got reports from Paris , Milan on new fashions . 
And uh the most important aspect is the l the look 
 it has to look fancy , look and feel 
uh instead of the current functional look and feel . 
This is a st 
well 
I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect , 
which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it . 
So uh 
and the third being easy to use is probably a given , 
we have to try and incorporate , 
so uh  
<other> Uh exactly , yeah . 
<other> I s that out of sequence ? 
Uh yeah , 
sorry . 
Uh yeah , and uh 
from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera . 
Uh sorry , 
clothes , shoes and furniture 
and uh a spongy material to be used on the <laugh> on the outside . 
<other> Yeah . 
But uh I was gonna say 
um yeah , 
fruit and vegetables , uh important to  this year um important to furniture , 
I'm just gonna say 
uh <other> 
f like it's in  if if fashion  
if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through . 
But fashions do don't last very long . 
Mm . 
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah , 
we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it 
and then we can just whip that off and  
A kind of  
yeah . 
<cough> Oh  
Yeah . 
<laugh> That's  c cool . 
Um <other> you have  we could  if we could save  
depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? Instead of having a ten year guarantee ? 
With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Or  well , 
but like uh like more than just the battery , like a complete different  like you've only got 
like , you know like th uh 
this bit's the bit you keep , 
and this is the expensive bit , 
this is like the chip 
and this is the microphone . 
And then this is the power source 
and the bit everyone sees . 
And then  
<other> Yeah , you probably are right . 
Um  oh , don't worry 
it's all said , 
I was just gonna say 
uh  yeah , 
are we gonna make this as part of like like uh  a part of the f like it it  
the fashions apply to furniture , 
so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ? 
Yeah . 
This is fashionable 
with  
<laugh> 
Oh yeah . 
And make that a fashion symbol as well . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
that sounds  
Um I'm just  I'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much  how good it's gonna be to change channels 
t 
we still can just tell it to . 
I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah , 
maybe we cou 
like 
w 
like 
we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff , 
but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice . 
Mm I suppose , 
but t there is the off chance that , you know , th the brightness is wrong on your T_V_ 
or the contrast needs changing . 
Hmm yeah . 
Yeah , 
that's a good idea . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Well I mean 
on a  
onto like a mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually a button as well , 
you could press it , you could press that and have it as a menu button . 
Uh yeah . 
Hmm . 
<other> Uh can I just get some things clear just for <laugh> my sake . 
Our energy source is gonna be 
long term . 
Cool . Uh  
<other> 
And we're having a custom chip ? 
<laugh> 
And interchangeable case ? 
Mm , mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
And uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or  
Cool . 
Are we having it that it's any angle , or is it just  
As wide as possible . 
Mm-hmm .
