<laugh> 
<other> Okay . Um  
Um p there we go . 
<other> 'Kay , 
I'll just be talking about the components design . 
And  
<other> Okay , 
basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do . 
Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command 
and then this is translated uh into uh light signals 
which are then seen by the T_V_ . 
Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at  uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery 
and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator , uh two more resistors and a capacitor 
and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . Um . <makes tutting sounds> 
Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command 
and this creates a a connection within the the remote 
that allows the chip  
the chip then senses this connection 
and produces a signal in a Morse code format . 
This signal's sent to the transistor 
which amplifies it 
and then sends it on to the light emitting diode 
and uh  
which is then trai changed into a infrared light 
which is sent to the T_V_ 
and sort of seen by the T_V_ 
and which uh changes the channels . 
<other> Um . Oh . <other> Uh 
cool . 
<other> Uh so 
as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons . 
Uh y the fewer buttons you have , I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . Um 
however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult 
and uh raise the production cost . 
That's something we should think about . 
Also we have to work within the company constraints , 
and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons 
and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it . 
Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , 
so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery 
and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years 
and we could still keep that original idea . 
<other> Um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf , 
and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility 
and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon . 
Um , however that's gonna cost more , 
but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper 
and it's gonna be  allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , 
but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like uh voice activation , 
which haven't really been used much on remotes , 
so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert , 
so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip . 
<other> And that pretty much sums it up . 
Mm . Oh yep , 
sorry . <laugh> 
Yep . 
Mm . <other> Um 
I don't actually have any price information , 
no . <laugh> 
Um 
it  
a lot longer than an off the shelf chip . 
Oh w yeah , 
we did  the 
the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed , 
it's sort of still still in an ex experimental form , 
uh so it would uh  
it's hard to predict the time . <laugh> 
Mm . 
W 
just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick . 
Once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's pretty much the the world  the the sky is your limit , 
but to actually  the 
the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working . 
Uh bits of it , 
yeah . 
Yes , as well . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Uh it's fundament 
well I mean 
I guess it it's something we've discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning , 
so I th I think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental , 
but I don't know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , 
so I think you have to  
<laugh> 
Hm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm , mm . 
Mm . 
No , 
that sounds good . Mm . 
Mm . Cool . 
<laugh> Um  
Yeah , I I would say we do , yeah . 
Uh nope , 
that was it , that was it . 
Okay . 
Yeah , 
it's thinking about it . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Uh  <other> Uh 
I think they're they're about the same cost really . 
I I mean , 
I think it's just sort of  the the <other>  
there's a lot of slide buttons out there . 
I think it's pretty much the same sort of connection . Mm yeah . <laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Ye yeah , 
'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , 
so it'd be kinda good to have them be  feel completely different . 
You'd know what you were fiddling with . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Yeah , 
'cause if  
yeah , 
in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the  that for rolling , 
just the way it would  
Mm yeah , yeah , yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well 
that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things , 
like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year 
and uh whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , 
yeah . 
Yeah , 
yeah . 
Mm , yeah , 
that weird  I dunno what that is , 
but yeah . 
Mm . 
Uh <other> , yeah , it's good as well . Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
I  I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one , 
because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Oh yeah . I like that . 
That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers 
and  
yeah . 
Um . 
Uh yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Well 
that that's just it with the covers , you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product . 
So , 
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm , yeah . 
Mm . 
And that's the sort of thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very very quickly . 
Yeah , yeah , exactly , exactly . 
Yeah . 
Mm . Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow 
I kinda thought with a  you'd have like a yellow circle with the R_R_ in it somewhere on it , 
but I'd  
yellow seems a bit of a strong colour 
to make the ent like the thing  
no , 
but I mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah <other> . 
Mm <other> . 
<laugh> <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
you'd want it narrower than a mouse though 
'cause it  a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , 
you want something you can definitely grip . 
So maybe it'd be  
<other> Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
and fiddle around with it 
and press it . 
Maybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the  about the width of that end of the pen 
and then it widens up top 
and you can fiddle 
an 
yeah . 
Yeah , 
yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Yeah , cool . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
But  do you know , this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice  
'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling , 
but you can also bring it up like that 
and it's microphone-esque , 
yeah , yeah . 
Mm . 
Bu 
Mm . 
Well 
you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons . 
I mean <other> uh 
if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and  or do voice commands , 
and <other> either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness 
and and sc 
and then you can you can minimise the buttons 
and still have those , you know , brightness and tint and stuff . 
Yeah <other> 
Yeah . 
But the television would be the display 
that  
things like that usually c pop up on a televi 
like you hit menu 
and menu will come up on television 
and have like tint brightness , 
and you'd use the scroll , scroll through it yeah . 
Yeah , 
yeah , that's true . 
I never understood how that worked though , 
but yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah , mm . 
Mm , oka yeah . Yeah . 
<other> Cool . 
<other> Play with play-dough . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<other> Yeah . 
<laugh> <laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Mm , does actually , yeah , yeah . 
Mm different to feel , 
yeah , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . Yep , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Yeah . 
Mm <other> yeah . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , mm . 
Mm . 
Yep , 
sounds good .
