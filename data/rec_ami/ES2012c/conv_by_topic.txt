A:  Alright ? Alright . Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group . Um I think we uh made some definite progress at the last one um and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control . Um I'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting . Um <other> the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better . Um they've got lots of buttons on them that uh people don't use and find difficult to learn . Um and people lose them . And <other> We we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , um <other> that we're  <other> we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . That  um <other> we want to go for uh a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A_ um as uh a trendy remote control , and and B_ as uh a Real Reaction product . So that w uh when people are uh happy with that , they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us . Uh  <other> Okay . So again um , I'll  we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision . Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are um what energy source we want to use , whether i it is practical to use uh um a a a long lasting one . And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply , then basically it's uh sealed for life and uh if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . And uh it it'll be uh , you know , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it's um um , you know , for life , guaranteed for life . Um <other> now the the the internal chip um  and uh this is where I need uh uh Kate's expert advice and given that <other> th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible um d d do we go for a custom designed chip ? Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ? Uh I mean I'm I'm I'm 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  n not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify . But uh that that's uh that's your area of expertise . And then the uh , you know , the the overall design of the case uh is is is Kendra's field and uh 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those uh da today . Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface , whether we p um <other> go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both . Uh and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation . And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at . Uh so , if if we can have the the three presentations again please , and uh um p perhaps you'd like to start uh k . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <other> Okay . Um  
A:  Kate . Oh I'm sorry , oh sorry . 
B:  Um p there we go . 
A:  <cough> 


C:  Okay . Then it doesn't matter . Okay . Okay . 
A:  Cause uh I <other> must say I find it slightly surprising given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . So uh um I mean I d d for slightly different  well no , I mean , it's if you you  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , so uh bu I mean the this this information is from  is  this is the internal company information , is it ? 
B:  Uh bits of it , yeah . 
A:  So uh  
C:  Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , you know , hundred and fifty pounds or something . 
B:  Yes , as well . 
A:  <other> 
C:  As opposed to the twenty Euros , twenty five Euros . 
A:  Yeah , mm true , again but if it's without any without any uh p price informations that's uh difficult to uh 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  uh decide . 
D:  <other> Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them , not just that , so . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  Yeah , that's that's right . It's like  it's it's  you can't  'cause mobile phones are expensive , you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is . But we don't know . Um . 
C:  <other> Yeah . 
A:  <other> I mean uh I su i I mean if  given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before , um th th the double risk , uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work . Um . Thoughts ? 
C:  Well , another thought I  oh , sorry , go ahead . 
D:  Would  Oh I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like um  maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost . 
A:  <other> I mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ? 
B:  Uh it's fundament well I mean I guess it it's something we've discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning , so I th I think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental , but I don't know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , so I think you have to  
A:  I mean I think we   
C:  Oh yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:   
A:  Mm . 
B:  Hm . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Well , I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing . 
A:  Yeah , I I I I I think that's uh  
B:  Mm . 
C:  And we've been talking about it the whole time . Anyway , I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it . 
B:  Mm , mm . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . Mm , right , okay . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  Uh yeah ,  it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:   
D:  From uh my presentation show , so . Uh technologically innovative . 
A:  Yeah , it should be  Right , okay , so . 
B:  No , that sounds good . Mm . 
A:  Fine . Okay . I it will have voice recognition um uh if if that means uh if that means we can't afford buttons but I mean b b <other>  second question , do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down , <other> volume up down and on off , just as a a backup or just so that people can uh j j just sit there pressing buttons ? 
B:  Mm . Cool . 
C:  Okay . 
B:  <laugh> Um  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , I I would say we do , yeah . 
C:  I think so . 
A:  Right . 


A:  Okay . Sorry , d did you want to say anything ? No ? Okay . Shall we move rapidly on to uh Kendra ? Uh um ra rapidly move the cable over . 
B:  Uh nope , that was it , that was it . Okay . 
C:  Okay . <other> Let's see . 
A:  Mm . Oh good . 
C:  Oh . Yes . Is it gonna work ? 
B:  Yeah , it's thinking about it . 
A:  Mm yeah , it'll get there . Yep . 


D:  Here we go . <other> 




A:  Um okay , d we're all clear where we go from here . 
C:  <other> Yep . 
B:  Yep , sounds good . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Okay , so thank you very much indeed and I'll s see you all again in thirty minutes . 
B:  'Kay . 
C:  <other> Okay . 
B:  'Kay .
