That should hopefully do the trick , um . 
'Kay . 
Sorry about the small delay . 
Falling a little bit behind schedule . 
And that's uh fifteen twenty five . 
Okay . So 
just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one , um 
we're gonna go for something uh uh how was it ? 
Uh The new black , I believe . 
Um something that looks good 
'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , 
though we should never avoid functionality , of course . 
Uh many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , 
but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip 
and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display . 
Um other things were we were hoping to use rubber , 
most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . 
Okay . So um 
due to your hard work , we might as well let the uh two designers go first , 
and uh show us the prototype . 
Quite how the best way to do this is , I'm not sure , 
but  
Okay . 
I'm afraid yeah . 
We'll go into that a bit more , 
but please go on . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Okay , 
yeah . Great . Um . 
Yeah , okay  . 
Excellent work . 
Um . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , I believe so . 
So 
I mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost , 
'cause that would mean doing something about the human element , 
but I'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have . 
<laugh> 
Mm . Um 
just before we go through all of the steps here , um well what we'll do is 
um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate , 
and then we'll come back to the product evaluation 
if that's alright . 
Yeah , is that  
Um so 
is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered ? 
And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this . 
I is there any of these criteria that need any explaining ? 
Or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others ? 
Okay . 
Okay . 
No 
and which we will do very very shortly . 
Um . Okay . 
Slight problem we had 
was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . 
Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ 
which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure 
because of course we required a chip as well . 
Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_ , 
at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface ,  
require more buttons , etcetera . 
Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . 
Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs 
and we're just scraping it in , 
we've got point two of a Euro left over there . 
So we're just managing it really . 
Even then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick 
so I've used what I think's appropriate . 
With any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to . 
It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , 
for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now . Um . 
That should still be viable . 
We've got an advanced chip , 
we've got the use of the L_C_D_ . 
So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility . 
Um but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here . 
<other> We do need to try and come up with an idea 
which could be continued with other people if need be . Um . 
We can 
I can bring the excel up sheet up 
and uh show you if you wish um . 
I really think as m much as it pains me 
is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , 
possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place . 
It might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person . 
Okay . 
It very much is about making concessions , unfortunately . Um . 
Um b b b da is  you mean on the plastic , or ? 
Let's have a look . 
You now have as much information as I do . <laugh> Um . 
So 
as you can see here , for example , the battery really not very little choice in that one . 
We've gone for one of the cheaper options as well . 
Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to . 
I've said single curved . 
We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . 
Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost , 
which I've had to very much make advantage of , 
despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two Euros per unit . 
Problem comes here as you can see in the interface . Um 
if I've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button . 
That might make sense , 
because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what , four point five Euros , 
which is an awful lot , 
so that could well be wrong . 
Even if we save point five there , it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit , 
which has had to be put to one side . 
As you can see , the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well 
because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick . 
I  
that's something you'll have to take up with the bean counters . Um 
as you can see I mean that's taken up well over half of the price . 
So um 
I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go , 
but because we need to shed what was four Euros off of the um the price of for what we really desired , 
this one comes in under price as you can see , 
but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design . 
Uh no , we haven't , not  
That'll  it literally would just be a button . 
We might have to  
It looks like almost nothing  
Mm . Oh 
good call , 
I missed that . 
 that's a very valid point . 
So if we're gonna go with the L_C_ display , then that's  
I believe so , yeah . 
That would probably not be in keeping with the um the fashion statement and such , 
yeah . 
Being manipulated by the joystick , 
yeah . 
Which I'm defining as scroll wheel . Um . 
Yeah 
it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be , 
that that's what I've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation . 
If we remove the L_C_ display , we could save ourselves 
a fair amount . 
Which you could <other>  
It's a shame . 
We should possibly have  
If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to . 
Again , you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one . 
Um but for the purposes of this meeting , I'm  we're gonna have to stick with these figures . 
So , 
I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display 
'cause it's about what really separates us , <other> 
despite the cost it's gonna incur . Um 
are people maybe not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the L_C_D_ ? 
It's hard to tell . 
Um I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved , 
and even then I'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation . 
Single curved with articulation ? 
<other> But the curves all o over  hand , 
is it ? 
We wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway , 
so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation . 
Um unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal . 
Which is what we can get onto now . 
As long as  so are we gonna say   w 
we have to keep an eye on the time as well , 
but we're gonna say um single curved design <other>  
It could well be , 
but at a cost of  
Okay , 
yeah 
we'll definitely won't go with that one . 
Yeah , 
that's voice recognition , so . 
Um . So , okay yeah , 
battery definitely ,  
It looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two Euros , um . 
Maybe even slight 
well 
oh yeah , pretty much point two Euros , I'd say . 
So we'll leave that one for now . 
 we'll just have  
It's uh a case of um 
I'm uh slightly unsure . 
One  point five of a Euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right . 
So maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more . Um . 
At which point if  
Well 
you got point five there . 
It's literally a case of whether or not this is correct . 
I'm not quite sure if they're  
I don't think they mean point five Euros per button . 
So 
There we go . 
Black's probably the normal colour you'd say , 
yeah . 
I quite like that colour that you're fetching there , 
it's uh definitely for 
make it glow in the dark even better . 
<laugh> So 
will we go with that then ? 
It's not and we can see  
we'll come back to uh your evaluation 
which you're probably now going to pan us 
but there we go . 
Just to give you an idea , um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well , 
I'm not sure how much time . 
We've not hit the five minute mark warning yet , 
but . 
Ten . 
Mm mm four ? 
Three ? Mm . 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Two buttons . 
Yeah . 
I'd say we're doing well there . 
<laugh> <laugh> Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> As he models the  
<laugh> 
I'd  
Yeah . <laugh> 
Which is a shame . 
Mm . 
I'd be tempted with three , yeah . 
We'll get panned on the next one , anyway . 
Yeah , 
w 
It is , yeah . 
Don't blame them . 
Um because of the way that we've minimalised the number of buttons and such . 
Plastic , it sucks . 
But it's no worse than any of the other pl remote controls we have . 
<laugh> <laugh> <laugh> 
Like yellow , 
yeah . 
It would also help keep the the product placement 
s 
yeah . 
Is it inspired by  clothing fashion ? 
<other> Yes . 
It's kind o it 
probably  <laugh> 
<laugh> Well 
I mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg , 
so , <other> what , four ? 
Is that being too generous ? 
Oh dear ,  . 
What would you think yourself ? 
<laugh> Well , 
it's kind of curved 
and we can make it yellow , 
and that's pretty much banana like . 
Si 
it's got a curve to it . 
Am I  
do you think I'm stretching the uh the use of the banana ? 
It's not bad 
and considering the <laugh>  
don't pick the pen . Um . 
Y 
oh and you've knocked batteries out . 
<laugh> Um right okay 
it's  <laugh> 
considering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive  you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , um 
<other> it was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing out I'd say possibly , based on um the the cost features . 
Maybe it's been targeted  
Hide it in the fruit basket . 
Probably the people technologically . 
They're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . Um 
don't know how lo much longer we've got . 
At least five minutes I think . 
Um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation . Um . 
So , 
we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction . 
Does anybody want to um um do you have any opinions on any of them ? 
For example um  we'll work backwards I suppose . 
The ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with . 
Um  people made good use of the uh pen and paper ? 
I would say   
I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be . 
It must  
It does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes . 
So maybe this is literally just a way around it . 
Um I dunno . 
How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today ? 
Leadership . As much as can be leadered in this uh thing . 
Um last one we've got is room for creativity . 
Now , 
I think we got  
<laugh> Yeah 
I think of  in the end , ideas that can be used  sadly  . 
Not so much that we weren't full of ideas , but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing . 
It's a bit of a pity . 
Um I would have to agree on that . 
I think we needed a larger budget . 
If you're going to aim your a um product maybe at the technological kind of sector , then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is . 
Because they will pay outrageous cash to  
first on the market . 
Mm . 
It could even  
That's true , yeah . 
Um I suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with a at a different group at I guess . As to a  the costs involved . 
But I mean we've got a a prototype . 
<laugh> So 
I dunno , 
I I think it's gone okay today , considering the information that we've had at our disposal , and um such . 
Probably would have  
mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end , 
I would have to agree . 
It is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive . 
Always hard to tell until you know the costs . Um . 
Okay . 
Are the costs within budget ? 
Well , 
they are now 
that we have our slightly less than capable product . 
We've evaluated it , 
and we can say that we came out with a value of three . 
<other> 
It's  
yeah ? 
<laugh> 
And then the final one where you get to call it Hal . 
But we'll go into that later . 
Right um 
is there anything else that anybody would like to to add , um  
anything they think that's not been covered , 
before I quickly write up a final report . 
Um I dunno , 
I mean we've got a product . 
We maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be , 
but we've got something 
we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell . 
And of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers . 
There is a huge market . 
I mean we've briefly touched on it 
but we've no more knowledge 
then there's little we can say on that . 
Yeah . So um 
unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add , we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to 
and then we can finish up the writing and such . 
Yeah ? 
Uh thank you for your participation . 
That  a question we can ask  . <laugh>
