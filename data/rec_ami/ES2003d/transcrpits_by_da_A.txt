Okay , 
it's a  
 I think if we both step up 
and uh outline our ideas . 
Okay . Now 
do  uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . 
Um for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_ . 
As it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick , 
though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit 
for uh  
 ju just a thought . 
You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick 
that could then just be turn uh twisted round , 
so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other . 
But as you as you see with the uh <other> with holding it in the left hand , the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful , 
so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain  ergonomic design . 
Um now 
I I got your note about uh keeping the cost down . 
Yeah . 
 this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing . 
Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that 
which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well . 
As for the um as for the single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , 
but it's not absolutely necessary . 
Really the curve that's most needed is the underside 
so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this . 
Um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder . 
So . 
Any further comments ? 
Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
Yeah , I mean 
the 
uh  Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I mean with the with the rubber design it could i you know it could pretty much mould very much to the to the user's hand . 
One nice wee feature 
if we could if we could still do the rubber , I though of was to have  the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh <other> of the rigid substructure . 
So it has a wee sort of tail 
that you just drape over your wrist 
so it stays in position nicely . 
Mm . Lovely . Um . 
Okay . 
Yeah , that's still part of the design . 
Mm . 
Mm . And making it a bright colour helps 
with the  
personally I would have gone for purple  . 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
I'd say number one . 
I think w if it was just the sounder then th  I mean something I've found with uh w w 
with say tr trying to find uh a cordless phone or a m mobile , you can hear it , 
but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is . 
Bu 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h <other> is have it um circular 
and have it s <other> so that the uh the pink  actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger . Mm . 
So that uh th 
Mm . 
Mm .  yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . I think  if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings 
and we just  we could just put our branding on any other remote control . 
Mm-hmm . Um yeah  I mean 
one thing , 
I mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep I mean <other> keep the um the articulation ? 
This is what I'm wondering . 
Oh 
no , I think I I it d that it needn't require it to be double curved . 
It's uh it's just <other> it's just <other> it's just that the case would come in t <other> would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation . 
Mm . Yeah , I mean 
and <other> I mean the uh 
I mean if you look uh if you look closer at the uh at the prototype here , 
the lines here along the grip are actually quite straight . 
Um I mean  
yeah , 
on the  on the L_C_D_ I mean although we've done it with a curve it 
could just as easily be done um without curves . 
The curve that's really needed is up here , 
to put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it 
to have it rest on the top of the hand . 
Mm . 
Mm no 
that's that voice response thing that we got the email about . 
But I thought it was just completely pointless . 
Yeah . 
Alright . 
B i basically it was  saying that our labs had come up with a chip 
that you could , you know , say hello to , 
and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice  . <other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Okay , well 
l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case 
and then we at least have  make it a little harder to lose . 
Because most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour 
that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room . 
Or grey . 
Yellow . <other> 
Okay . 
Three . I think we can do three . 
<other> Th the special colour doesn't  would I think make a difference . 
It makes it stand out 
from  
you know 
it's lost in a big pile of crap , it stands out from the rest of the crap . <laugh> 
Two buttons and a joystick . 
Totally . 
It doesn't get much fancier . 
Mm . 
Mm . I'd give it a three for this  for that . 
Yeah . 
I mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote , 
but <other> you see it in a lot of other places . 
Mm-hmm . 
I'd give it a three . 
Mm-hmm . I'd s I I'd give it a six , to be honest . 
Well 
I I I would sa I would say give a s give a selection of colours . 
Um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype 
'cause we had yellow . 
If I were buying one , I'd go for purple . 
Leopard print would be cool . 
That's kinda   i 
it won't be when it's been 
budgeted . 
I I think s I I think this isn't  not particularly fruit and veggie . Um . 
<laugh> 
Mm . I'd <other> I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion . <laugh> Is the sole criterion for being um fashion  fashionable or inspired by current fashions . 
Um I'd g I'd rate I'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually . 
Mm . 
<other> 
Mm . Personally , I think given that the product um only replaces a single remote control 
that you've already got , 
are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good ? 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . I s <other> I suppose one thing is that b because it's technically innovative , 
um for someone who's sort of technophobic , the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting . 
Um . 
Yeah , 
got notes and doodles . 
Well 
I think this is a  I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh 
of the researchers studying this . 
It's all p goes into their corpus . 
Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um 
transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh computer ourselves . 
 . 
<other> Unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along , 
 squish . 
Yeah . 
Mm . I mean I th <other> I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh 
in added expense . 
Such as it is . 
Actually I want th 
one thing I would say  
I mean something that could perhaps be part of the product mm the um m product testing market research process would be to uh produce mock-ups of both versions 
and see just how much of a difference the over  going over-budget 
um m would make to sales . 
And we could even you know , market two versions . 
Wee cheapie version with the nice bio-morphic rubber . <other> 
Yes . 
Mm . 
And I can get my bus . 
Okay . 
Thank you .
