<laugh> 
Um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks , 
because it's gonna be flat on one side , 
so the L_C_D_ will be s sticking down like this , 
won't it ? 
'Cause it  you can't get it curved . 
Uh because of costs . 
And it's plastic as well , 
so it won't be as comfortable on the hand . 
Yeah ,  . <laugh> 
One . Yeah . <cough> 
What about  what if the the volume on the T_V_'s turned up massively and uh you just wanna turn down the volume  can't find remote . 
Suppose you have to go to the T_V_ and do it manually . Mm . 
Like y you wouldn't hear the speaker  . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
That's too expensive  
isn't it ? 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Fashion . 
So basically 
the only new thing is the L_C_D_ on the remote now . 
Oh , and joystick , 
yeah . 
So  
The L_C_D_ basically is the big selling point of 
the remote . 
But that's what makes it uh original though , 
isn't it ? 
It can be s 
yeah , 
it can still be single curved , 
but  
You just  . 
That's what we need for the joystick I think though . 
Costs four . 
Yeah . 
Are we going for a special colour at all ? 
Well 
I was  for a case . 
Or had you already incorporated that ? 
<cough> 
Think it's ten minutes left . <other> 
Special colour . 
Three . 
Are we going one on  ? 
I'd say we go two , 
'cause like f the fanciest would be the double curved . 
Wouldn't it ? 
With the articulators . With bells on it . 
No need for teletext . 
<laugh> 
 five ? 
Six ? 
Six ,  . 
Put a leopard print on it . <laugh> 
Yeah 
we gotta  . 
I'd say the colour of the border there world  you'd find that ,  that's that'd stand out . 
Logo , brand . 
Mm 'kay . 
Yellow courgette . 
<laugh> 
Well 
this this what we're gonna t this is their motto , like . 
And we're we're not doing well on it . 
Yeah , I'll go with five . 
<laugh> 
'S bad design , that thing . <other> 
Mm , yeah . 
Well , 
it depends who your  who's  what the target people are , 
like you'd say maybe the fashion conscious 
women would be going , oh look at that , 
's cool , 
it looks like a  
it's 
yellow , 
looks like a banana , 
it's cool 
it's gotta  look good in the sitting room . 
Rather than the L_C_D_ 
whereas uh more technical like like more uh people in with the latest technology  it's good , 
it's got an L_C_D_ screen 
's only got two buttons and a joystick . 
So , 
which which kind of people would be more likely to buy it ? 
<laugh> 
 . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Good . 
Very good . 
We're burs bursting with creativity . 
And the price was like  it was twice the w assembly cost . 
And would it have to be twice that ? 
It could be like coulda had the assembly  like maybe fifteen Euro . 
We'll still settle for twenty five <other> . 
Maybe . <cough> 
In the beginning , yeah . 
<cough>
