 . 
Right . 
Yeah 
I've got a  
if you load up my evaluation document . 
Mm . 
Uh evaluation . <other> 
Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by . 
<other> Um then we will  
it's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process . 
So um 
not seven steps , 
seven scale . 
So 
after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , 
we average that 
and that will give us some type of uh confidence in our prototype . 
And uh the criteria  based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those I put together from the user requirements phase . 
'Kay . Um 
if you flip the  
<other> So , 
those are the criteria . 
And uh perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better , 
but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned , 
which means <other> that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points . 
<laugh> Put it mildly . 
So 
we have um true ? 
One , t Seven , eight , oh . Fourth . 
Okay , so 
we have to go through each point . 
If we imagine it's actually straight , 
and just give it a a score . 
So um 
how well would you say the prototype is 
uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost . 
I mean , uh is the homing thing still  the locator , is that still  
Sure . 
And Adam , we can keep that in ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> Sure . 
T 
Sure . 
Mm . Bright colour . 
So 
we still have that noise thing , 
yeah ? 
Os 
on a scale of one to seven , how would you guys rate it for finding  finding it once it's lost ? 
Number one ? 
Okay . 
Number number one for the first criteria . 
Yeah 
you can tell what room the mobile is  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
You wanna say something ? 
That's fine . 
Oh that's that's fine . 
What do you mean cr is there anything I wanna  
Um , a few . <other> 
Something I neglected from my initial research 
is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion , and clothing fashion . 
That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important 
and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion . 
So they say we put the fashion in electronics , 
well 
they really mean it they they're very big on fashion , 
so . 
That's this bit right here . 
And uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ? 
I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface , 
so it's kinda condensed into one . 
And we can come back to it , you said . 
So . 
Different languages ? 
Yeah . <other> 
Mm . 
Do you have any data on how much um different prints cost ? 
I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um ? 
 . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together ? 
That's quite significantly expensive . 
 . 
Yeah . 
We don't even have uh speakers here . 
The  
like uh 
we 
uh  what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ? Have we factored that in ? 
Transmitter , receiver , speakers . Plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a T_V_ . 
Is that gonna be a button , or  
Yeah . 
I I mean it's not on here , 
but um . 
Did they s 
do we have to use an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ ? 
Okay . 
Well 
that's  yeah . 
What's a hand dyna dynamo ? 
You have to wind it up ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Technology . Yeah . 
Okay . 
And we couldn't replace the joystick , 
right ? 
Because we would need four extra buttons to replace it , up down left and right , 
and that would be more expensive 
than a  
but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward ? 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Um . Uh 
k 
Does this does this bear in mind that  
I mean it's a bit ridiculous 
that they're gonna charge us what is it , like this much money for three million if we're gonna buy three million components , 
you know . 
Mm . 
'Kay . 
I think so . 
Yeah . 
Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness 
and focus on the menu being the best interface ? 
'Cause like we  
do we have re restrictions on software ? 
Oh 
but there has to be  
 joystick . 
Okay . Sure . 
Okay , 
my bad . 
So 
I think the product is not gonna perform so well for my criteria . 
Oh , 
wait a minute . 
Sample speaker ? What is a sample speaker ? 
Is that somewhat similar to what we want ? 
Yeah . 
You got a email about voice response ? 
I did not , 
so . 
We won't go with that one , did you say ? 
I mean I  we  
Okay , okay . 
So 
it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca <other> locator thing . 
<laugh> Okay . <laugh> Okay . 
Oh , special colour for the case . 
Mm-hmm . 
W what's the default colour ? 
White or black ? 
Right . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Sure . 
Okay . Okay . 
So uh <laugh> 
Right okay . Okay . 
'Kay . 
Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost . 
Um . Okay . 
Special colour . 
Uh uh four . 
Three if we're being generous , I feel . 
Think we're being generous here with three . 
Mm . 
Yeah . <laugh> Okay . 
Reduce the number of unused buttons . 
We're down to t two buttons , 
is it ? 
Okay , 
so that's a one . 
You know , 
where that's  
Okay , 
that was good . 
Easy to use interface , buttons menu , menus  
that's 
yeah 
that's good . <laugh> 
'Kay 
that's  
we're not doing so badly . 
Um <other> easy to use  
oh okay , 
let's forget that one . 
Fancy looking . <other> 
Sure . 
And we could do whatever we like with the L_ L_C_D_ . 
Yeah 
let's just assume it's a good L_C_D_ display . 
Maybe I was panicking for no reason . 
<laugh> Yeah , 
w 
maybe you'd be a bit too  
yeah . There we go . Yeah , 
that's m 
that's that's better too . More accurate numbers . 
Technologically innovative . 
Well , 
we're getting rid of the locator thing 
which which 
yeah <other>  
 . 
'Kay . 
Yeah , 
mobile phones . 
And y what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control , 
so it's  
You say three ? 
I might go as far as two on that . 
Three . 
Three . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Materials that people find pleasing . 
Sponginess is what they really would have wanted , apparently . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
That's true . 
It's not a step backwards . 
<laugh> Yeah , okay let's give it a six . 
<laugh> Okay , 
that's totally thrown everything off balance . 
Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion . 
W we could . 
What colour were we gonna make it ? 
<laugh> I know , 
but  
But um by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg ,  
<other> Yeah . 
Mm . 
But  Th th they're referring to the fruit and veg thing . 
Is this like a banana type colour ? 
Could we stretch  
no still , 
it's not shaped like a banana is  
Oh 
is that 'cause it's flat ? 
What is  what fruit or veg is flat ? 
Yeah . 
Or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well . <laugh> 
Four ? 
Oh that's it's very ambitious , 
yeah , um . 
Sure . 
Inspired by  . 
Yeah . 
This is their strategy . 
I m imagine we actually had some money invested in this 
and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks . 
Might  we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about this one . 
I would say  
I mean it's it's not at all , right ? <laugh> In any way or shape or form . 
We didn't m 
Okay , the the yellow banana like thing is I think is okay . 
Right 
five . 
Is that <other> sound reasonable ? 
Five . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
'Kay , so 
we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven . 
So five , seven , ten , sixteen , twenty one . 
Which gives us an average of three . 
It's  
well 
this would be in the middle . 
So we 
it's it's not bad . 
It's in the good section . 
<other> Oops . 
Sorry . <laugh> I'm I'm sorry . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven , we were to go down a grade to to four , 
we would have to do  I mean we didn't 
we weren't that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic . 
You know like 
we didn't we didn't add 
we didn't subtract a whole seven points from these things , 
so I think we're definitely on the good bit . 
Even if we gave this one seven and this one seven , that's still only three extra points over seven . 
You know , 
it's  
yeah , 
we did it w 
it was okay . It was good . 
Mm-hmm . 
I think so . 
I mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone , 
and she's had it for a long time , 
you know . 
She uses it to make phone calls and that's it . 
Yeah . So 
I think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick , I mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy , 
you know . 
She'd be like is this a remote control , 
I don't  
how do you use it , and stuff like that . 
So even if it is really user friendly to us , but we're used to using menus all the time . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
I think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons , 
yeah . 
But like radical good , maybe . 
<other> Wrote nearly a page , 
but not  . 
I think tracking . 
Yeah , that woulda been pretty good . 
I'd  
yeah I liked it , 
yeah . 
I li 
yeah , 
top marks . 
<other> Well <laugh> 
yeah . <laugh> 
We we're not lacking in ideas , 
you know 
it's  
that was not the problem . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more  Yeah , to begin with . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
And like response from consumers  . 
<other> 
<other> Sure . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Okay , let's  
Thank you . 
<laugh> I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget , and that we had to cut a lot of stuff . 
It's like man , we we can't have the locator thing . 
And s 
yeah that's just bad . 
Do you think maybe  the prices were were made ?
