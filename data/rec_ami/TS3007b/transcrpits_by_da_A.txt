Hello . 
Hi . 
Yeah . 
It's too beautiful . 
<laugh> 
A minute please , 
my uh laptop is uh  
oh , 
there it is , 
thank you . 
So 
welcome back . <other> At the functional design meeting um 
the plan is uh that uh each one of you , so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour . 
I will uh take minutes 
and will put uh the minutes that I have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder . 
<other> Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , 
so you can read that uh now or afterwards . Um 
<other> uh I had an email from the from the management board 
uh , I don't know if you a al also uh received it , 
but there were four points 
uh which uh I think are very important . 
First one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated 
uh and internet will be the the main uh focus . 
<other> Uh second one is also important 
uh , because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session . 
Uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , 
so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control , 
so uh that's one thing to keep in mind . 
Uh second , and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert , 
uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older , 
but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh  would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty . 
Uh and uh 
I think to keep in mind , but not really uh for now 
is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote . 
So , 
we have uh forty minutes , 
so I think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per presentation uh each , 
and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have either SMARTboards , the the Word files , what you uh  whatever you want . 
So uh 
Tim , can you start ? 
Yeah ? 
Mm-hmm . 
But it's strange that the the manage board  the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet . 
So that that's strange . 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
that's a cool idea . 
Yeah . 
Thank you , Tim . 
<other> Janus , can you uh  
Okay , 
thank you Janus . 
You do ? 
The last presentation . 
You have plenty of time , 
Tim and uh Janus don't uh talk to ten minutes , 
so uh 
take your time . 
If you take your time too long I will uh eventually uh 
warn you . 
<cough> 
Uh 
you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one , 
so uh 
you you want to keep it simple , 
but I think that if you want to do that , then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give s uh more options than one . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen . 
Jirun ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
Okay , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
But let's not uh go too wide about the  those things , 
that's that why we're here . 
It's it's a nice idea , 
but I think that's we wel <other> later in the stage . 
I've one little question about um a total touch screen 
or uh um a p 
yeah , a partial , 
uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen , 
so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , um uh to be uh , yeah , kinda traditionals 
uh and uh <other> the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen , 
but to keep this as uh normal as possible , to keep it accessible . 
Yeah . Yeah , that's true , that's true . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , that's true , yeah . 
Yeah , yeah yeah , yeah , that's a good point . Yep . 
Mm-hmm . 
They like the fancy stuff , yeah . That's true . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm  Yeah . Okay , 
as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are uh <laugh> are done . 
Uh I've uh added the  this uh four things from the management board just to keep in mind . 
Um each time I uh I had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think . 
Uh so that can be uh can be read out . 
Uh a f a few things I uh I noticed uh were um  
Moment . 
Ooh . 
Uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is I think uh how uh it's going to look 
uh with uh  
we must keep it simple , 
but have the opportunity to uh have more options 
and have them uh hidden or something , 
so they don't  uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons 
or uh  um and uh 
the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically <other> each television , 
so you must uh the the the 
the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the  done by the remote control and not by the television . 
I think that's the point what uh 
we discussed . 
Yeah , 
but you have uh uh an  
yeah , 
but you have an international market range , 
so you have I think a big range of  
Yeah . 
Okay . 
And it's not too complex to do it . 
Yeah . 
Just build it in . 
Yep . 
Okay . 
We have five minutes to go . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
N yeah . 
It's very sensitive . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Okay well uh

<laugh> 
Failure . 
Uh <laugh> uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will  all will receive uh at the uh the the email . 
I don't think I can uh say much about it , 
so uh uh wait for your email

and I w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes .
