A:  Hello . 
D:  Hey guys . 
C:  Hi . I see my bunny is still standing . No one drawing it . <laugh> Uh I figured uh that much . <laugh> 
B:  Hi . 
A:  Hi . Yeah . It's too beautiful . 
B:  Yeah , true . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Too wicked . 
B:  Mm . 
D:  <laugh> <laugh> <loud inhale> 
A:  A minute please , my uh laptop is uh  oh , there it is , thank you . So welcome back . <other> At the functional design meeting um the plan is uh that uh each one of you , so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour . I will uh take minutes and will put uh the minutes that I have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder . <other> Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that uh now or afterwards . Um <other> uh I had an email from the from the management board uh , I don't know if you a al also uh received it , but there were four points uh which uh I think are very important . First one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated uh and internet will be the the main uh focus . <other> Uh second one is also important uh , because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session . Uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control , so uh that's one thing to keep in mind . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh second , and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert , uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older , but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh  would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty . Uh and uh I think to keep in mind , but not really uh for now is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote . So , we have uh forty minutes , so I think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per presentation uh each , and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have either SMARTboards , the the Word files , what you uh  whatever you want . So uh 
D:  <laugh> 


A:  Tim , can you start ? 
D:  Okay . 
A:  Yeah ? 
D:  <cough> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah ? 'Kay , that's it . 
A:  Thank you , Tim . 


A:  <other> Janus , can you uh  
C:  Uh yeah yeah , I'll go , sure . Right uh , I'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project . Well uh what I did was I dissected uh uh current remote controls and um I viewed how how they w looked , how they worked , uh what kind of components are involved , and how they are connected together . And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds . And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build one and why I think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . 
C:  So that was my uh my personal opinion . And that was my uh my presentation uh  
D:  Huh . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  Okay , thank you Janus . 


B:  Yes , I can go ahead . Last presentation . Okay . 
A:  You do ? The last presentation . You have plenty of time , Tim and uh Janus don't uh talk to ten minutes , so uh take your time . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:   
A:  If you take your time too long I will uh eventually uh 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  warn you . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Well , I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions . 


D:  Yeah . Yeah . Uh , I think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good . Um , because recently uh I saw news item on T_V_ um about uh new telephones uh for elder people . Um , they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up , um and that's a big ad advantage I think , because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something . It's uh 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  very visual intended . <laugh> What was I to say more ? 
B:  Maybe that's an option . Um keep the primary buttons visible . Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues uh well , put a logo on it and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form . But uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen , or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible . Um  
D:  Yeah okay , but but if you pick the the idea , the left idea 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ? 
C:  The extra functions . 
B:  The extra functions , you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , and then all all the options will become available and you just c s yeah t scroll through them . 
D:  Yeah , but l like menu functions or  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Ah okay . 
C:  <other> Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet and uh I'll just make um  uh let's say fifteen buttons on it , and uh we have three of those , uh actually just uh menus with sub-menus , with  or sub-items , sub-functions . 
D:  Yeah , I think so . Yeah . 
B:  Well um then I'd like to make a proposal . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  If you make one big touch screen , 
C:  Yes . 
B:  use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , like like the iPod idea that that we just saw . You just have a f a few selected buttons and uh a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make uh several  you can also improve uh later on . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . <other> Yes . 
C:  Uh uh I think that will be great . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen . 
D:  Yeah , I think so . 
C:  Yeah , I wou I would actually go for the  
A:  Jirun ? 
B:  Okay , I agree , but I think it's very important that they always um make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen . 
D:  Yeah , of course . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  And so um an elder designer picks up th the  of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions . 
A:  Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I had another uh idea about maybe parental control . Um , 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  like building in uh some kind of PIN code uh which allows uh parents to switch to all channels , uh but children uh  if children don't don't know the PIN code , they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or  
B:  Yeah . Yeah wh Is that possible to use or no ? 
C:  That is possible , that  well that actually depends on the television , but I think  I figure that would be  
D:  Th there's just  
B:  Well , yeah well , does it have to depend on the television ? 
D:  Ju just a simple log-in , something like that . 
C:  Well , y you s you see the fi uh thing is when you buy a remote , you you set the uh channels , the the channels are different on each te television , they aren't set in a preset order , so uh if you uh lock on a remote , uh let's say channel fifteen , well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television , so that would be uh that would be actually the main concern . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah , okay . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Well , I think that he means that um maybe by some option uh  make sure that um remote control and the T_V_ match , and then after that you can um use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this uh  change the settings of the T_V_ , like colour and then volume and uh  
D:  Yeah . Yeah , th that kind of stuff , but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um , you address the the channels and like uh oh , that's channel fifteen , that's uh 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yes . 
D:  vi violent channel , uh m my ki my kids uh  I don't want my kids to watch that , then you set the priority to only parents , 
B:  Oh , something like that . 
C:  Yes . Yeah . <other> Yeah . Yeah , that would b 
A:  Okay , yeah . 
B:  Well b but make it a separate option in the menu , so that it's it's dif dis displayed from uh  displayed here , so uh parents uh  
D:  for example . But  
C:  <other> Yeah , that . 
D:  Yeah okay , but but  yeah , that's just that's an a an added feature . 
A:  Yeah . Okay . But let's not uh go too wide about the  those things , that's that why we're here . It's it's a nice idea , but I think that's we wel <other> later in the stage . I've one little question about um a total touch screen or uh um a p yeah , a partial , uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen , so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , um uh to be uh , yeah , kinda traditionals uh and uh <other> the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen , but to keep this as uh normal as possible , to keep it accessible . 
D:  Yeah , <laugh> th th those things are nice . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Partial . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah , but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers 
B:  Yeah , you can de display it on the on the old style . You can display actual buttons on the touch screens . 
D:  that's just as e just as easy . 
C:  Uh . I I do  
A:  Yeah . Yeah , that's true , that's true . 
C:  Uh I do agree , because well , it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen or when you touch a button , but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience . W we are aiming for younger people and they they chose  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , okay . 
D:  Yeah , it's different . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah , that's true , yeah . Yeah , yeah yeah , yeah , that's a good point . Yep . 
D:  Yeah , age b below forty . 
C:  So that's that's probably uh a  
D:  And th those young people , yeah . Y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy stuff , so  
A:  Mm-hmm . They like the fancy stuff , yeah . That's true . 
D:  A touch screen , like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications . 
A:  Mm-hmm . Mm  
D:  I th I think we can do that too . 
A:  Yeah . Okay , as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are uh <laugh> are done . 
D:  <laugh> Done . <laugh> 
A:  Uh I've uh added the  this uh four things from the management board just to keep in mind . Um each time I uh I had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think . Uh so that can be uh can be read out . Uh a f a few things I uh I noticed uh were um  
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Moment . Ooh . Uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is I think uh how uh it's going to look uh with uh  we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to uh have more options and have them uh hidden or something , so they don't  uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons or uh  um and uh the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically <other> each television , so you must uh the the the the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the  done by the remote control and not by the television . I think that's the point what uh 
B:  Mm-hmm . Yes . 
A:  we discussed . 
D:  Yeah , yeah , some of them . The menus uh are not identical for all th for all T_V_s , so you have to display it on one uh T_V_ . 
B:  Well you can use um  when you  <other> uh how do you call it , s um synchronized , the um remote and the T_V_ , then there's always , there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is , from  ah , it's a Philips , this and this and that , and then give the options that are capable  the <other> capable from the t 
D:  Yeah , but that's not possible . Mm-hmm , mm yeah . 
A:  Yeah , but you have uh uh an  yeah , but you have an international market range , so you have I think a big range of  
D:  Add th that that's an opportunity  . 
B:  Well there are universal d um um remotes and they all have a functionality for all the T_V_s , uh so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Okay . 
C:  But they  
D:  But  
A:  And it's not too complex to do it . 
B:   
C:  Well they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your T_V_ and that that is bit of a tricky job . I actually use one of those when  They are they are kinda kinda troublesome , but but the thing is whe when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh t into the remotes , because uh in order for the remote to process something from the T_V_ , like uh to synchronise and you have to send and receive , and that's well  
D:  No . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . Well  Yeah . Mm-hmm . Oh um mo no , you can just say uh the c 
D:  No no no . <other> He he he he me he means just just one other thing . Uh , with the current remote controls , the universal ones , um you have to press  yeah , you have to press a code for T_V_ . 
A:  Just build it in . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Yes . 
B:  In codes , y you you get a b a book with codes . You look up , I have a Philips H_ fifty five and it says press code four five five and you press code four five five on the  uh in the remote and it displays all your uh menu options . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh , okay , yeah , sure , uh  Yeah yeah yeah . Oh , yeah yeah , sure , that would be possible , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Now we uh just connect uh the T_V_ type uh to a set of options , in  just just in the memory , so that if you  yeah , like profile , so that if you uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of T_V_ uh 
B:  Memory in the in the remote . 
A:  Yep . 
C:  Profiles . Yeah . 
D:  the memory uh pops up the options . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , that would be possible . Yeah , sure . 
A:  Okay . 
D:  I th don't think that's uh  that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables . 
C:  No , that wouldn't be uh  Yeah , a few variables . 
B:  Yeah , well um if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes , there are maybe um three four hundreds T_V_s at maximum . If you have all of them , all the old and new T_V_s summed up , so uh I think uh it is possible  . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Ah it is . It is definitely po 
D:  But , on the other hand on the other hand , uh if you have a remote and buy a new T_V_ that isn't incorporated in the remote  
A:  We have five minutes to go . 
B:  Yeah . Well then you have to buy a new one , it's very good for marketing 
D:  New remote ? 
B:  Maybe , or an update , software update . 
D:  A firmware upgrade or something , but from where ? 
B:  Firmware update , you say . 
C:  Yeah , firmware upgrade . 
D:  Ah . Maybe w 
C:  That's maybe the cup holder . <other> Yeah . 
D:  No m may no , maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh U_S_B_ or a firewire connection , so that you can uh connect it to the P_C_ and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Well , not everybody has uh has uh a P_C_ at home . Well the most most people have , but not not everybody and  
B:  Well , at  uh you can go back to the shop and uh they <other>  
D:  Yeah , like a s kind of service centre . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , ser o and they can download it for you . 
C:  Yeah , maybe something like service cen Or you could  well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier , and you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . Well already digital information is sent t to the the standards , T_V_ uh connections , you can see what's uh programme is on on the new uh channels , so maybe j they  we can send that information along with standard T_V_ uh  
C:  Yeah . Well then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh  well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in , we could actually look at  into it , but  I dunno , it it would be uh bringing more costs  uh with with it and  
B:  Receiving . Oh yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Difficult . Yeah . 
C:  <other> 
D:  I I think it's uh most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates uh at the service centre or at the shop . 
C:  Yeah , that would be probably best , yeah . 
B:  Yeah yeah , uh s I think some  I think it's good idea , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Like when you when you buy a T_V_ you just ask  well I'll  
D:  It's it's it's not a lot of work , just one uh docking station where you put it in , press start , bling bling , updated . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , that would be best , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> You don't buy a T_V_ every week , new teev so . 
B:  Okay , let's uh save this in the meanwhile uh  
C:  No no . Exactly , so  
B:  Um m for which one are we going ?  My mistake . 
D:  Let's vote . 
B:  That one or uh  
C:  Yeah , my vote goes out to the right  . 
B:  Your vote and your  Okay . 
D:  My vote too . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  And your vote ? 
B:  Well , I was uh doubting about which one to take , but uh you've convinced me that uh if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal um remote all elderly people will know what to do . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  And also like a clapping uh li like device that uh pops open . 
B:  Opens up is too difficult or uh  
C:  Flips open . 
D:  Uh too difficult , um maybe uh it's easier to break it . 
A:  N yeah . 
B:  Break it , I don't get  
D:  Yeah , th th th that i uh  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  It's very sensitive . 
B:  Oh so  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Like my telephone , it's uh it's sensitive too . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 


A:  Okay well uh it's almost at the end . So we have now a lunch break , finally , yeah . <other> Uh after the lunch break uh it's back to uh individual work , once again uh thirty minutes . Uh I will put my minutes  uh I have updated them so uh s they're updated in the shared folder too . 
D:  Ah . Thirty minutes ? 
A:  Thirty minutes , the  
D:  How minutes ? <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Failure . Uh <laugh> uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will  all will receive uh at the uh the the email . I don't think I can uh say much about it , so uh uh wait for your email and uh hopefully you get it done uh in the in the thirty minutes , and I w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes . Yeah ? 
D:  One question , uh how late do we have to get back  be back here ? 
A:  Uh well uh thirty minutes . 
B:  A quarter to one maybe ? 
A:  Uh , yeah . 
D:  Thirty minutes lunch break ? 
A:  Thirty minutes lunch break , yeah . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  I thought forty five . Yeah . 
A:  Oh . Forty five ? Uh then would it be uh one o'clock . Or we we ask our personal coach . Okay . <other> Thank you . Thank you , uh that was a very uh good session I think , we uh we  
D:  Yeah . Okay . Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  <whistling> 
C:   
B:  Yeah , is it possible to store this on the share documents or what  
D:  Yeah , me too . 
A:  Uh ye well  
D:  Save as . 
A:  Yeah , because uh all uh things are uh stored in smart board dot uh X_D_K_ and that's in  
D:  Yeah , v But but you can open a  from your pr from your laptop . Yeah , maybe . Save as . 
B:  'Kay , save it as an image on the res 
C:  Export . Maybe not export function . 
D:  No . 
A:  No . 
D:  Export . 
A:  Well I can I can uh  
D:  Export H_T_M_L_ . 
B:  No , and use an image if possible . 
D:  Huh , image ? 
B:  J_ PEG . 
C:  <other> G_  yeah , J_ PEG . 
B:  J_ PEG . Yeah , it's better 
D:  Paper size A_ four . Uh screen size . In this directory . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  N oh . 
B:  Oh yeah , it's not connected to the 
A:  You all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work . 
B:  to our P_C_s . 
D:  No ? Yeah , it is connected . 
B:  It's connected ? 
D:  Yeah , I think so . 
C:  To room . 
A:  Deskt Huh . No . 
C:  I'll just uh saved in my documents . 
D:  Oh . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah <other> in my own uh  in my own messenger . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Project documents , yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  It gives the na Oh . Yes . 
C:  Okay , nice . 
A:  Okay , thank you . 
B:  The questionnaire , fill in  uh we fill out d after lunch or uh  
A:  Uh well , it's it's simply filling  oh no , it's uh it's also filling out  no , I'd do it after lunch I think . <laugh> I'm hungry , so do it after lunch . <laugh> Thank you all . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Okay . 
C:  <laugh> Aye , cheers . 
B:  Yes . 
D:  Thank you . 
A:  You're welcome . 
B:  We can leave the P_C_ on I think , yeah and return to the  
D:  Yeah , of course . 
A:  Yeah . Well I bring it to my uh personal room . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah , bring to  I gotta bring it home . 
D:  To my exave executive  
C:   
A:  My executive uh big room with the with the panting . <laugh>
