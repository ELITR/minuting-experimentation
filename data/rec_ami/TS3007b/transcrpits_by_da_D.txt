Hey guys . 
Too wicked . 
<laugh> <laugh> <loud inhale> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
<cough> 
'Kay , 
welcome . 
I have some uh new findings on uh Marketing Expert level , 
which I will show you . 
<other> The method I used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire . 
Um <other> one hundred respondents were involved 
and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results . 
Um , these were a couple of findings , first page of three . 
Um , we have three audiences of  
two audiences , <laugh> 
I'm sorry . 
Uh the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five  age . 
Uh the second one is from sixty four  uh forty six to sixty five . 
Um , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent  um sixty five . 
Uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent . 
Mm <other> and some interests from the from the age groups , 
uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff , like uh an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control , um speech recognition . 
I don't think that's uh really appropriate . 
Um , <other> and when you see uh the audience , the age is going up uh  Yeah , they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . 
Second findings <cough> out of the questionnaire um are the opinion <other> the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls . 
First point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , 
uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . 
So that's maybe something for the User Interface uh Designer . 
Okay , 
third findings . 
According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , um <other> following buttons are most important . 
Um , I will tell something about the way this uh this test was , yeah , done . 
Um , <other> persons were asked uh what the buttons were uh they use most , how much an hour , 
and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons . 
Um , when you multiply them , you get the  these three points . 
Switching channels , um yeah , 
that's pretty uh pretty normal , 
that's what you do with a remote control . 
Um the second , teletext , 
uh and the third , uh volume controls . 
Um , I think it's good uh that we know what the user want  wants , 
uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear . 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah , okay , 
but uh at the moment uh teletext is  Yeah , th the best thing you can get uh on T_V_ , like getting information . 
So uh , 
when you ask people , what do they use , 
<other> they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . 
That's ridiculous . <laugh> 
That's a ne i it  
It's a new technology , 
but it's not incorporated right now . 
Okay , 
my personal preferences . Um , 
I think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five . 
<dental fricative> 
Mm , first of all um it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . 
Uh second , I think you will get the most revenue from i from it . 
Um , yeah , 
people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of T_V_ , more than uh people who are el uh elder . 
Um <other> second point , <other> 
we have to impro improve the most used functions , as I said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . 
Third point um that came out of the uh  of the questionnaire , 
uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller , 
so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the , yeah , of the T_V_ 
where you can put the the remote control in . 
<other> Um , that's about it , I think . Yeah . 
Uh not not the r not the functions , 
but uh it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used uh on a remote control . 
So you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds hundreds of buttons , 
but if you don't use them , yeah it's  
Yeah , 
they have to be on it 
j just to t to get it done if necessary , 
but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or  
Yeah , perhaps . 
Just for the minor functions perhaps . 
Just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn . 
Yeah ? 
'Kay , 
that's it . 
What do you think about uh incorporating Bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the T_V_ , connected to the T_V_ ? 
So it's in the wrong product . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Um , yeah , 
maybe another problem uh , 
I think current T_V_s can even send infrared . 
Huh . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
Hmm . 
<laugh> <laugh> 
Hmm  
it's maybe an option uh if you use an L_C_D_ <other> or a touch screen um , 
that in the middle are the the main keys , 
like displayed on the  
Uh yeah . 
<other>  . 
Yeah , this ? 
No ? 
Yeah . <laugh> Something like that . 
Okay , 
just uh in the middle the general functions , like play , uh channel switching , 
and then uh at the top or at the bottom , some menus like uh settings or  that you can drop down . 
Mm . 
Nah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I think so too , 
but  <other> 
and that's partly because um uh a lot of T_V_s have different menus , 
and when you have a particular menu uh at your device , uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_ . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Uh , 
I think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good . 
Um , because recently uh I saw news item on T_V_ um about uh new telephones uh for elder people . 
Um , they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up , 
um and that's a big ad advantage I think , 
because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something . 
It's uh 
very visual intended . 
<laugh> What was I to say more ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah okay , 
but but if you pick the the idea , the left idea 
then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ? 
Yeah , 
but l like menu functions or  
Ah okay . 
Yeah , I think so . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , I think so . 
Yeah , of course . 
Yeah , 
I had another uh idea about maybe parental control . Um , 
like building in uh some kind of PIN code 
uh which allows uh parents to switch to all channels , uh 
but children 
uh  if children don't don't know the PIN code , they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or  
Th there's just  
Ju just a simple log-in , something like that . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , okay . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , th that kind of stuff , 
but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um , you address the the channels 
and like uh oh , that's channel fifteen , 
that's uh 
vi violent channel , 
uh m my ki my kids uh  
I don't want my kids to watch that , 
then you set the priority to only parents , 
for example . 
But  
Yeah okay , 
but but  yeah , that's just 
that's an a an added feature . 
Yeah , <laugh> 
th th those things are nice . <laugh> 
Partial . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , 
but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers 
that's just as e just as easy . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , it's different . 
Yeah , 
age b below forty . 
And th those young people , yeah . Y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy stuff , 
so  
A touch screen , like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications . 
I th I think we can do that too . 
<laugh> Done . <laugh> 
Yeah , yeah , some of them . 
The menus uh are not identical for all th for all T_V_s , 
so you have to display it on one uh T_V_ . 
Yeah , 
but that's not possible . 
Mm-hmm , mm yeah . 
Add th that that's an opportunity  . 
Yeah . 
But  
No . 
No no no . 
<other> He he he he me he means just just one other thing . 
Uh , with the current remote controls , the universal ones , um you have to press  yeah , you have to press a code for T_V_ . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Now we uh just connect uh the T_V_ type uh to a set of options , in  just just in the memory , 
so that if you  
yeah , like profile , 
so that if you uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of T_V_ uh 
the memory uh pops up the options . 
I th don't think that's uh  that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
But , on the other hand on the other hand , uh if you have a remote and buy a new T_V_ that isn't incorporated in the remote  
New remote ? 
A firmware upgrade or something , 
but from where ? 
Ah . 
Maybe w 
No m may no , 
maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh U_S_B_ or a firewire connection , 
so that you can uh connect it to the P_C_ 
and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet . 
Yeah , 
like a s kind of service centre . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I I think it's uh most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates uh at the service centre or at the shop . 
It's it's it's not a lot of work , 
just one uh docking station where you put it in , 
press start , bling bling , updated . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
You don't buy a T_V_ every week , new teev so . 
Let's vote . 
My vote too . 
And your vote ? 
Yeah . 
And also like a clapping uh li like device that uh pops open . 
Uh too difficult , 
um maybe uh it's easier to break it . 
Yeah , 
th th th that i uh  
<laugh> Yeah . 
Like my telephone , it's uh it's sensitive too . 
Ah . 
Thirty minutes ? 
How minutes ? <laugh> 
One question , 
uh how late do we have to get back  be back here ? 
Thirty minutes lunch break ? 
I thought forty five . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Okay . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah , me too . 
Save as . 
Yeah , 
v 
But but you can open a  from your pr from your laptop . 
Yeah , maybe . Save as . 
No . 
Export . 
Export H_T_M_L_ . 
Huh , image ? 
Paper size A_ four . Uh screen size . In this directory . 
No ? 
Yeah , it is connected . 
Yeah , I think so . 
Oh . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Thank you . 
Yeah , of course . 
To my exave executive  
<laugh> 
Aye . Yeah . Okay .
