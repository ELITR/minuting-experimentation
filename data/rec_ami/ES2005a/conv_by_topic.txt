B:  <other> Uh yeah uh , being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market ? What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ? What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market . 
C:   Okay . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  So before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things , like

C:  Uh , making a profit of fifty million Euros . <laugh> So , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . <other> 
A:  Alright so twenty five . 
D:  Mm 'kay . 
A:  So yeah , I've  The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . So uh  <other> 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah , I was thinking that as well , I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're , yeah . So presumably that might be an idea to 
D:  Yeah the universal ones . Yeah . 
A:  Mm . But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . For sure . 
C:  put into . 
B:  Slim . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . Uh 'cause I mean , what  uh twenty five Euros , that's about I dunno , fifteen Pounds or so ? 
D:  Mm-hmm , it's about that . 
C:  And that's quite a lot for a remote control . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  Mm . Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . As you said they come with the T_V_ so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control  functions , so maybe we could think about colour ? Make  that might make it a bit different from the rest at least . Um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , you know those things ? 
B:  <other> 
C:  Uh-huh . Mm-hmm . Okay . <laugh> The the keyrings , yeah yeah . Okay , that's cool . 
D:  Because we always lose our remote control . 
A:  Right .

A:  What do we think a good size would be for this ?  
B:   
C:  Sorry , carry on . <laugh> 
D:  <other> 
A:  'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it , or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily . <other> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah . Then you lose it , yeah . <other> Kind of um , maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of , just hand held , like , 'cause  
C:  Okay . For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty . <laugh>
