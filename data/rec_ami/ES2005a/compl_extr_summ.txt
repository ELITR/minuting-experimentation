C:  Uh , making a profit of fifty million Euros . <laugh> 

A:  so twenty five . 

C:  So , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . <other> 

C:  I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things 

D:  Yeah the universal ones . Yeah . 

C:  So presumably that might be an idea to put into . 

A:  But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . For sure . 

D:  my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . 

D:  so maybe we could think about colour ? 

D:  Um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , 

B:  being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product 

B:  What speciality other remote controls are having 

B:  They really want to have something good , having a good design in their hands , 

A:  What do we think a good size would be for this ?  

D:  Kind of um , maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of , just hand held , 

C:  So you do the looking around at other remote controls . 

C:  and you could look into um <other> basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one , how  what sort of materials are available to you whatever . 

D:  So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? 

C:  Shapes and colours and  um basically how to make it attractive .
