Mm 'kay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah the universal ones . Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm , it's about that . 
Mm . 
Um well 
my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . 
As you said they come with the T_V_ 
so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control  functions , 
so maybe we could think about colour ? 
Make  
that might make it a bit different from the rest at least . 
Um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , 
so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , 
you know those things ? 
Because we always lose our remote control . 
Okay . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Then you lose it , yeah . <other> 
Kind of um , maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of , just hand held , 
like , 
'cause  
Yeah . 
No , I wasn't , no 
sorry 
I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a P_D_A_ 
but 
Okay . 
So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? 
Yep . Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Oh no ,  . 
Sorry 
it's okay . 
Okay , cool .
