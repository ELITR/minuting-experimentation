Mm . 
S 
And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , 
just kind of a light <other> non-descript grey 
so that people'll wanna buy the covers 
and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers , 
so they kinda just stretch over . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , well 
I I didn't know that 
but yeah they're kind of  
it's just kind of a rubbery  
and that way  
you know 
spongy like is something that people wanted 
and it just sort of stretches over 
and that way I think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well 
and  
just kinda stretch it over 
and it'll just stay on 
and then the buttons come through 
and so  and then the  
each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ . 
Yeah . 
Like that . 
<other> Oh . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
just kind of  
Or just make it little . 
Somewhere like that 
so it just sort of  
Yeah . 
Bu 
 . 
 fall over . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
 . 
'S a little longer . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I think it is yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
I think it made  we met all of the consumer 
wants . 
No . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
I think so . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
I think just the simplicity of it 
and 
not having to learn to programme 
and not having you know a million buttons . 
<laugh> 
Under the cost . 
<laugh> 
Yeah , <laugh> . 
I mixed up the colours a little bit . 
<other> I think I  all wrong . 
Mm . 
Ps 
I don't think so , 
I mean 
I think we worked well together 
and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make 
and you know , 
seemed to discuss things pretty well 
and come to group consensus 
and  
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Alright . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Okay .
