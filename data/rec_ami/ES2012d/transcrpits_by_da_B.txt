<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Uh okay 
we basically have the same kinda lay-out here 
it's just um 
you hold it like this 
and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . 
Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , 
on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda  
so you can hold it and scroll , 
or you can hold it and and push . 
Uh this is the power key , 
um it's kinda like the biggest 
so you know how to turn on . 
Uh that's the little menu key . 
This is the infra-red section 
so you g 
it'll be sending rays 
and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it , 
or if you hold it up like that it'll send it . 
Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands 
so you can you know talk to it like that 
and it'll still understand . 
Um the logo is down down there um 
and  has the cover on it 
and you can see like it just kinda goes  
the red bit's the cover 
and it kinda goes over everything 
and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . Um . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers 
you actually have to screw them on and stuff 
and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . 
This is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself 
and it'll be fine . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Li 
that'll be  the covers as well , yeah yeah . 
Yeah it could stand , yeah . 
Well 
we could broaden the  broaden it out a bit 
so it would stand like that . 
Yeah ,  standing . 
Yeah , 
we could just widen it out uh 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm , yeah , yeah . 
Have to  
if we just lengthen it I guess 
so it comes down to the base of the hand 
and then flatten it out 
and could sit there . 
Yeah , <laugh> mm . 
Yeah . Yeah . 
We might  have to lengthen it 
so it kinda  your hand still holds it 
and have it there , 
yeah , yeah , yeah like that , like that  . Yeah . 
Mm . 
<laugh> The final product would actually stand up , yeah <laugh> . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Wee <laugh>  
Mm . 
<other> 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh>

Yeah , defi yeah , yeah 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah definitely . 
Yeah . 
Yeah definitely . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . Yeah , mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
No , not at all . 
Uh  
Yeah 
 it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well . 
 yeah . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups 
just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus 
and the younger people tend to  would be more conscious of that aspect of it , 
but um I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody , yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Mm .
