<other> 
Right well . 
Welcome to the  what should be the last of these meetings 
and uh it looks like we've uh done a good job here 
and uh we'll just go through the the final uh the final details . 
Um okay , 
oh 
the um th the the minutes of the last meeting uh I think we'll take those as read , um  
Okay 
the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes 
and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance 
and then uh uh just tidy up with production 
and um and then we can close . Um 
So f if if you'd like to uh present your your proposals . 
<other> 
Uh-huh . 
Yep , 
yeah , 
good , good . 
Uh-huh . 
Yep , 
right . 
Uh-huh . 
Yep , 
yep , 
mm-hmm . 
Uh-huh . 
Yep yep . 
Yep . 
 showing me age , 
I don't know what i c iPod covers are like . 
Yeah  yeah . 
Uh-huh . 
Okay , 
yep , 
right . 
Okay . 
Yep . 
Okay , 
good yeah . 
Yep , right . 
Yeah , yeah . 
I mean tha it's it's a detailed point , 
I just wondered  I mean h how will people put these down I wonder ? 
Right . 
Okay 
 for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically 
but uh uh  
<other> Yeah , uh no 
because  particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item 
uh I mean it it's uh it it's just I mean it's just a minor detailed point , 
but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger 
and uh  
Yeah 
and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all 
it gives gives people the option 
and if if say if they've got them um  
because  actually have several  upon the uh  
Yeah , well . 
<cough> Yeah 
but that that's uh  but uh 
no 
the the the overall uh the overall concept is uh  
yeah yeah , 
no no , 
I mean that's  these uh  
Yeah . 
But uh yeah  but no th but the  yeah the the the  
Yeah , yeah , yeah , 
I mean it it's uh  wouldn't 
wouldn't do that , indeed yeah . 
But th th but th yeah th b the 
these were all minor minor uh minor details , 
I think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on 
and the  i 
it certainly meets our criteria of being uh  of you know looking different . 
Um , so 
good that's that that's excellent . 
Um right 
let us um 
What's on the next one ? 
Oh right yes , 
let's have a look at the um f finance . 
Um , now 
we're given a a clear design brief , uh 
if I  get the uh spreadsheet up . 
Oh . 
 . 
Oh right . Ah . 
Good , 
this is why we need to make these things simple 
so that the uh the the the boss can understand . 
Now 
I've um <other> 
this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design 
and I I I've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us , 
um I wouldn't know for in 
for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , 
that's a that's a standard colour . 
Uh , so 
we're just simply on batteries , 
the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that um 
we're <other> we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with 
and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around 
so , um 
that I don't think is a a serious problem . 
The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive 
but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design 
so that that has to stay . 
Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves 
but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets . 
Um it's simply made of plastic 
so th that's uh that's no problem 
and uh um 
just because the whole  the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh there's some cost there . 
Um and uh 
we haven't actually got a scroll wheel 
we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um <other> slider 
so um 
and the and the the buttons are 
uh uh well 
I do don't know that they're special colour . 
Anyway 
the the costings uh come in at  exactly on target at twelve point five 
uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different 
that um <other> any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers 
so uh um you know 
the  if if 
if the management expect us to be techno  again  fail again  technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give , 
so uh 
we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward 
and uh uh 
I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . Um . 
Okay , uh . So um . 
Does anybody want to uh  
uh 
Andrew do you want  what do you want to say about um the uh yeah the evaluation 
where where you know well where where we're where where we're at ? 
The the the well the  I meant the product . 
Yeah . 
Oh 
sorry 
yeah um , mm . 
<other> Mm . More loud clicks in the microphone . 
<other> 
<other> Seven being a nice round number to work to . 
Tr 
On for true and seven for flase . 
Yes . 
Well 
I think most definitely . 
Yes 
the voice technology indeed . 
I don't see we could've made it any easier . 
Totally . 
No . 
Yeah . 
 found easily . 
 yeah 
I mean that's that's  
Yeah . 
Does it take long to learn to use ? 
Shouldn't . 
<other> Less buttons 
so it must be . 
So yeah , um um . 
I think it will 
because I mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so  
And it's it's it's  <other> 
well 
I don't think we're actually charging a particular premium anyway , in the end , so  
Yeah . Yeah . 
It will appeal f for dif for different reasons 
but it's it's uh  
yeah yeah 
so I I  yeah I  
Yeah , 
so 
I think we can reasonably say it's another another one , 
why not ? 
 in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement 
is t it's television only , 
it's it's simple to use , 
um it's it's it's within budget , 
um I  it's uh  yes an an any minor points we we we argue . 
So uh 
I I think we've done an amazing job 
in uh 
<other> coming up with what  
 Need a need a calculator for that . 
Okay , 
 nick the cable back then . 
<other> Ooh . 
Right 
do um 
either of you want to uh say anything ? 
Mm . 
Before I uh  
No . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well 
that's right , 
I mean 
th this this slide here I mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity , 
I mean 
I think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows . 
Um I won't comment on leadership , 
uh teamwork I think we've uh  I think everybody's uh worked pretty well together . 
Um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens , 
uh I think the results speak for itself 
and new ideas found , um , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh 
uh a new approach . 
Um are the costs within budget ? 
Yes . 
Is the project evaluated ? 
We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria , um 
Thank you very much indeed , 
I think that  I think that's uh <laugh> 
I think we can go f for an early bath . 
So I call the meeting closed . 
Not sure how far ahead of schedule we were there .
