A:  <other> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Right well . Welcome to the  what should be the last of these meetings and uh it looks like we've uh done a good job here and uh we'll just go through the the final uh the final details . Um okay , oh the um th the the minutes of the last meeting uh I think we'll take those as read , um  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Okay the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance and then uh uh just tidy up with production and um and then we can close . Um So f if if you'd like to uh present your your proposals . 


B:  Uh okay we basically have the same kinda lay-out here it's just um you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda  so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . Uh this is the power key , um it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on . 
A:  <other> Uh-huh . 
B:  Uh that's the little menu key . This is the infra-red section so you g it'll be sending rays and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it , or if you hold it up like that it'll send it . Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that and it'll still understand . Um the logo is down down there um and  has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes  the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . Um . 
A:  Yep , yeah , good , good . Uh-huh . Yep , right . Uh-huh . 
C:  Mm . S 
A:  Yep , yep , mm-hmm . 
C:  And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , just kind of a light <other> non-descript grey so that people'll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers , so they kinda just stretch over . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  Uh-huh . Yep yep . Yep .  showing me age , I don't know what i c iPod covers are like . Yeah  yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , well I I didn't know that but yeah they're kind of  it's just kind of a rubbery  and that way  you know spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over and that way I think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well and  
A:  Uh-huh . Okay , yep , right . 
B:  Yeah . Mm-hmm . But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . This is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and it'll be fine . 
A:  Okay . Yep . 
C:  just kinda stretch it over 
A:  Okay , good yeah . 
C:  and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so  and then the  each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Yep , right . 
B:  Li that'll be  the covers as well , yeah yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . I mean tha it's it's a detailed point , I just wondered  I mean h how will people put these down I wonder ? Right . 
C:  Like that . 
A:  Okay  for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically but uh uh  
B:  Yeah it could stand , yeah . Well we could broaden the  broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that . 
C:  <other> Oh . 
A:  <other> Yeah , uh no because  particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item uh I mean it it's uh it it's just I mean it's just a minor detailed point , but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and uh  
B:  Yeah ,  standing . Yeah , we could just widen it out uh 
A:  Yeah and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option and if if say if they've got them um  because  actually have several  upon the uh  
B:  Mm . Mm . 
D:  Could have one for your stereo , one for your  D_V_ player . 
B:  Mm , yeah , yeah . Have to  if we just lengthen it I guess so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there . 
A:  Yeah , well . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <cough> Yeah but that that's uh  but uh no the the the overall uh the overall concept is uh  yeah yeah , no no , I mean that's  these uh  
C:  Yeah , just kind of  Or just make it little . 
B:  Yeah , <laugh> mm . Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Somewhere like that so it just sort of  
B:  We might  have to lengthen it so it kinda  your hand still holds it and have it there , yeah , yeah , yeah like that , like that  . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah I kinda had a a kinda  a natural kind of a idea where it's like more of a kind of  like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner , yeah , kinda like that kinda  like a flower or a plant for the more natural kinda  
C:  Yeah . Bu 
A:  Yeah . But uh yeah  but no th but the  yeah the the the  
B:  Mm . 
C:   . 
B:  <laugh> The final product would actually stand up , yeah <laugh> . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah , I mean it it's uh  wouldn't wouldn't do that , indeed yeah . But th th but th yeah th b the these were all minor minor uh minor details , I think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on and the  i it certainly meets our criteria of being uh  of you know looking different . Um , so good that's that that's excellent . Um right let us um 
C:   fall over . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  Yeah .  . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  'S a little longer . 
B:  Wee <laugh>  Mm . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <other> 
A:  What's on the next one ? Oh right yes , let's have a look at the um f finance . Um , now we're given a a clear design brief , uh if I  get the uh spreadsheet up . Oh . 
D:  Uh yeah , <other> just click there . 
A:   . 
D:  Uh the the maximise button . 
A:  Oh right . Ah . Good , this is why we need to make these things simple so that the uh the the the boss can understand . Now I've um <other> this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design and I I I've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us , um I wouldn't know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , that's a that's a standard colour . Uh , so we're just simply on batteries , the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that um 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  we're <other> we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around so , um that I don't think is a a serious problem . The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay . Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets . Um it's simply made of plastic so th that's uh that's no problem and uh um just because the whole  the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh there's some cost there . Um and uh we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um <other> slider so um and the and the the buttons are uh uh well I do don't know that they're special colour . Anyway the the costings uh come in at  exactly on target at twelve point five uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um <other> any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers so uh um you know the  if if if the management expect us to be techno  again  fail again  technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give , so uh we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward and uh uh I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . Um . 
B:  Mm . Mm . 
A:  Okay , uh . So um . 


A:  Does anybody want to uh  uh Andrew do you want  what do you want to say about um the uh yeah the evaluation where where you know well where where we're where where we're at ? 
D:  Evaluation . The <other> the product or the project ? <laugh> 
A:  The the the well the  I meant the product . 
D:  Um , well well my presentation just now ? Sure , uh can I get the  
A:  Yeah . Oh sorry yeah um , mm . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Cheers . 
A:  <other> Mm . More loud clicks in the microphone . 
D:  <other> There we go , oh . Method of evaluation <other> testing the product was to just  if it met all the criteria  all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management . So what I've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard 
A:  <other> 
D:  um gauge our team response to these questions . So , on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false . 
A:  <other> Seven being a nice round number to work to . 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . And then at the end just take an average 
A:  Tr On for true and seven for flase . 
D:  Yes <laugh> . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yes . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  So uh . <other> So , look at these questions . Is the device f flashy and fashionable ? 
A:  Well I think most definitely . 
B:  Yeah I'd say definitely a one yeah . 
C:  I think it is yeah . 
D:  So uh  and also uh technologically innovative ? 
A:  Yes the voice technology indeed . 
B:  Yeah , defi yeah , yeah 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Easy to use ? 
A:  I don't see we could've made it any easier . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Uh suitable for the consumer ? That was um <other>  
A:  Totally . 
B:  Yeah definitely . 
C:  Yeah I think it made  we met all of the consumer 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  wants . 
D:  Uh is it complicated ? 
A:  No . 
C:  No . 
D:  Doing pretty well so far aren't we ? <laugh> Uh functional ? 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah definitely . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Um . <other> Where are we ? 
A:   found easily .  yeah I mean that's that's  
D:  We've b built in the the speech , where are you , function . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , mm-hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh-huh . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Does it take long to learn to use ? Shouldn't . 
B:  No , not at all . 
D:  Mm-hmm . And uh , what else ? <other> The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards , well . 
A:  <other> Less buttons so it must be . 
B:  Uh  
D:  We we uh yeah it was our  it was a  we made an actual effort to  
B:  Yeah  it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:   yeah . 
A:  So yeah , um um . 
D:  <laugh> Um will device appeal to all age groups ? 
A:  I think it will because I mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so  
B:  Mm . 
C:  I think so . 
D:  Yeah , uh that's a good call , yeah . Well we had the we had the data  saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , <other> the e ease of use of the device might make up for that . 
B:  Mm . Mm . 
A:  And it's it's it's  <other> well I don't think we're actually charging a particular premium anyway , in the end , so  
B:  I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to  would be more conscious of that aspect of it , but um I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody , yeah . 
D:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . It will appeal f for dif for different reasons but it's it's uh  yeah yeah so I I  yeah I  
C:  Yeah I think just the simplicity of it and 
B:  Yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah . 
C:  not having to learn to programme and not having you know a million buttons . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , so I think we can reasonably say it's another another one , why not ? 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page ? Uh , yeah and what h did we make the management's  
A:   in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement is t it's television only , it's it's simple to use , um it's it's it's within budget , um I  it's uh  yes an an any minor points we we we argue . 
B:  <laugh> <laugh> Yep . Mm-hmm . 
C:  Under the cost . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Yep . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Um . 
A:  So uh I I think we've done an amazing job in uh 
B:  Yep . 
D:  <laugh> Okay . 
B:  <other> Well done us <laugh> . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> coming up with what  
D:  <laugh> So uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven . Eleven divided by <other> eleven's one so <laugh> equals average of one . 
C:  Yeah , <laugh> . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:   Need a need a calculator for that . 
D:  And that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product . 
B:  Excellent . 
A:  Okay ,  nick the cable back then . <other> Ooh . Right do um 
C:  I mixed up the colours a little bit . 
B:  <laugh> Oh no that's   
C:  <other> I think I  all wrong . 


A:  either of you want to uh say anything ? 
B:  Uh . 
A:  Mm . 
C:  Mm . 
A:  Before I uh  
B:  <other> 
C:  Ps I don't think so , I mean I think we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make and you know , seemed to discuss things pretty well and come to group consensus and  
A:  No . 
B:   . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Well that's right , I mean th this this slide here I mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity , I mean I think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows . Um I won't comment on leadership , uh teamwork I think we've uh  I think everybody's uh worked pretty well together . Um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens , uh I think the results speak for itself and new ideas found , um , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh 
B:  Mm . Yeah , definitely . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Mm . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yep . 
A:  uh a new approach . Um are the costs within budget ? Yes . Is the project evaluated ? We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria , um 
B:  Yep . 


A:  Thank you very much indeed , I think that  I think that's uh <laugh> I think we can go f for an early bath . So I call the meeting closed . 
B:  Cool , thank you <laugh> , 
C:  Alright . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Not sure how far ahead of schedule we were there .
