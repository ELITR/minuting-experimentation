B:  It's just that I need uh some some white paper . 
A:  Are you gonna take the minutes ? 
B:  Uh yes . 
D:  <other> Yep . Um  
A:  Good . 
D:  So hello everybody . So uh you  everybody had the a agenda for today , you received it or  
A:  Hello . 
C:  Hello . 
B:  Um , hello ? 
A:  Um I don't , do you have an extra copy ? Thanks . 
D:  Yep . So the goal for today is to decide for a movie to project at the end of the month , so for this month of of April , and also discuss the content for an adver advertising posters and um <other> I I will present you three des different design , we'll discuss it . So first we have to decide for um a movie . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Okay . <cough> 
D:  So I think we all prepared documents . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Yes , I did . 
D:  So I propose that we start with uh presentation Agnes uh sent . 
A:  Sure . 


A:  <other> Okay , so the previous movies that we've done this year were Lawrence of Arabia , Apop Apocalypse Now and Amadeus , which were all historical , serious , dramatic and somewhat actiony movies . So for this month I propose doing something different , preferably something set in the present , um something maybe dramatic but slightly less serious . So what I'd propose is actually a thriller or a mystery . And while these days people are so jaded by general movies that they tend not to be surprised by the endings in mysteries , some movies in the nineties did actually have twists that people came out saying , never saw that coming , I didn't know that that was gonna happen . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  And so what I'm gonna do is present you two of those movies , and before anyone says that , well , if you know th how the movie ends , you're not gonna wanna see it again , that's not necessarily the case , because a lot of people like to re-watch movies um to see where the clues were , what they missed , things they didn't pay attention to the first time around . Um so if you can go to the next slide . What I'd propose is either The Usual Suspects or The Sixth Sense . 
A:  <laugh> Good . Um so those would be my two choices . 
D:  <other> 
B:  Have you seen it ? 
D:  Yep . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  So what was you criteria for selecting this movie or  
A:  Let  it's a sort of different style from the other movies we've seen , and they have a twist , so it's not your general movie where you just kind of sit through it and go , oh okay , get up and leave . It's  at least out of those two movies I came out thinking , oh cool , okay . 
D:  But then it's only at the at the end that it it becomes a good movie . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah , but I mean that's a good thing , right ? 
D:  Only because of the of the end . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  I I've heard some people in the in the theatre saying , oh now we have to see it again . 
A:  Yes . 
C:  <cough> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Ah . 
A:  Which is a good marketing ploy , if you think about it . <laugh> 
D:  But then if you asked them five minutes ago  <laugh> okay . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  If we show it twice . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Okay . So is Bruce Willis the child psychologist ? Ah . Great . 
A:  Yeah , Bruce Willis is  and the kid is really good , who plays the the main character . 
C:   . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . It's the guy who then played in uh Artificial Intelligence or something like this , mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  <other> Great . 
A:  Same guy . <laugh> 


D:  Okay , so uh I think , Mirek , you prepared a presentation also . We can have a look . 
C:  Yeah . So my presentation is not that detailed , I just uh put there seven uh highly uh ranked movies , and we can just try to g uh go very quickly through all of them , just to re remind you them , and then we can perhaps consider another p uh potential candidates . 
D:  <other> Sorry , it's control L_ 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Okay , so the movies that I have selected as as very good uh good ranked movies uh are uh uh are on the screen so uh Shaw The Shawshank Redemption , Schindler's List , Usual Suspects , Pulp Fiction , Goodfellas , Silence of the Lambs and American Beauty . 


D:  Okay , so uh I think we should decide for a movie now . <other> 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  <other> Yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  So maybe each of us can s can select two movies or  
B:  Yeah , let's nominate first . 
C:  <other> Let's nominate , okay . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  And then we vote  we choose from the list . 
C:  So I will take basically two extremes , I will take Schindler's List and I will take uh The Big Lebowski . One of the one of them is really just funny and from the nineties , uh I mean  the story is from the nineties , while the second one is about the Second War and is uh serious . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Well I'll nominate the one I proposed , Saving Private Ryan , so history , war , drem drama . And I haven't seen it , but I would like to see it and I think American Beauty . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  If you  if you think that our series  okay , it's not about America , but uh still Apocalypse  well , yeah . It's about countries . <laugh> So , Agnes , Denis ? 
A:  Um I'd go for Sixth Sense , just because it's different from all the other ones and maybe Shawshank Redemption , just because we haven't seen it . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  So Denis , are you happy with our choices or would you like to add something ? 
D:  <other> Um no , actually I'm happy with the choices , because I really  I would really push uh American Beauty , because I think it's uh it's an easy movie to watch and and still there are a lot of things to think afterward . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  And it's representative of the nineties , I think . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  So what if we voted , say , like for first and second choice and then we count ? You can give two points to one and one point to another one ? <laugh> Would you like this strange way to vote ? 
D:  Okay . <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Okay , that's  
D:  Okay , start , Andrei . <laugh> No  
B:  Um okay so uh  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> I don't want to finish  I think I'm going to  
B:  Oh yeah , um well it's <other> uh well if I nominated two and I was the only one , I'll give two points to Saving Private Ryan and one to American Beauty . 
A:  <laugh> Okay , um  
B:  You don't want to finish , Denis . Then you'd better hurry . 
C:  Yeah , but then each of us will will uh but then each of us will vote for uh our nominees , so I would propose to to to vote for s sun uh to to give the points to the to the movies that were not nominated by you . 
D:  <other> No . 
B:  Okay . Okay . <laugh> That makes the vote more complicated . Um <other> okay , so I'll give um uh b um 
D:  Yeah , maybe it makes more sense , yeah . 
A:  <laugh> Okay . 
C:  So then it's it's more complicated but  yeah , okay , let's  Mm-hmm , okay . 
B:  okay , two to The Sixth Sense and one to The Big Lebowski . 
C:  Sixth Sense . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Okay , me I put two to American Beauty <other> and uh one to Saving Private Ryan . 
A:  Okay , um 
C:  'Kay . 
B:  I note that you didn't nominate a film , so <laugh> you are sort of freer than us . Agnes ? Okay , oh . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> So I'll  
C:  Seconds . 
D:  No , Big Lebowski , I nominate  . 
A:  I'll give two to American Beauty and mm one to The Big Lebowski . 
C:   okay , and I wi I will give one to The Big Lebowski and two to The uh uh Shawshank Redemption . 
A:  Okay , so it's pretty clear . 
C:  So now try to sum it up . 
B:  <other> American Beauty four , Big Lebowski three . So you have to redo the posters , uh ? 
A:  American Beauty . 
D:  So do we have something ? 
C:  American Beauty . Uh three . Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yeah , that's the only thing that's worrying me , but it should be okay . Yeah , yeah . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Well you can keep the format , I mean th you didn't have that many graphics in the first one . <other> 
D:  <other> So you select  you wanted actually me to select the  this design ? That takes a bit more time , but if you c if all of you can send me one image , I can make something on the left . Select one image from the movie and uh  
B:  Mm-hmm . You mean the first poster , yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . Okay . 
C:  But I would say these images are very nice and they are really representative perhaps . 
B:  Maybe you can leave those . 
A:  Yes , but of the wrong movie . <laugh> That's the real twist . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  <laugh> With a different title ? Okay . No but I'll make something . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> I'm  <other> Yeah , sure , sorry . <laugh> Sorry . <laugh>
