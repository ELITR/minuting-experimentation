topic_description:	opening


A:  <other> Okay , so the previous movies that we've done this year were Lawrence of Arabia , Apop Apocalypse Now and Amadeus , which were all historical , serious , dramatic and somewhat actiony movies . So for this month I propose doing something different , preferably something set in the present , um something maybe dramatic but slightly less serious . So what I'd propose is actually a thriller or a mystery . And while these days people are so jaded by general movies that they tend not to be surprised by the endings in mysteries , some movies in the nineties did actually have twists that people came out saying , never saw that coming , I didn't know that that was gonna happen . 
B:  Mm . 
A:  And so what I'm gonna do is present you two of those movies , and before anyone says that , well , if you know th how the movie ends , you're not gonna wanna see it again , that's not necessarily the case , because a lot of people like to re-watch movies um to see where the clues were , what they missed , things they didn't pay attention to the first time around . Um so if you can go to the next slide . What I'd propose is either The Usual Suspects or The Sixth Sense . 
A:  <laugh> Good . Um so those would be my two choices . 
D:  <other> 
B:  Have you seen it ? 
D:  Yep . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  So what was you criteria for selecting this movie or  
A:  Let  it's a sort of different style from the other movies we've seen , and they have a twist , so it's not your general movie where you just kind of sit through it and go , oh okay , get up and leave . It's  at least out of those two movies I came out thinking , oh cool , okay . 
D:  But then it's only at the at the end that it it becomes a good movie . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah , but I mean that's a good thing , right ? 
D:  Only because of the of the end . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  I I've heard some people in the in the theatre saying , oh now we have to see it again . 
A:  Yes . 
C:  <cough> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Ah . 
A:  Which is a good marketing ploy , if you think about it . <laugh> 
D:  But then if you asked them five minutes ago  <laugh> okay . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  If we show it twice . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Okay . So is Bruce Willis the child psychologist ? Ah . Great . 
A:  Yeah , Bruce Willis is  and the kid is really good , who plays the the main character . 
C:   . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Yeah . It's the guy who then played in uh Artificial Intelligence or something like this , mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  <other> Great . 
A:  Same guy . <laugh> 
topic_description:	First Movie Presentation


A:  Um The Usual Suspects is slightly less mainstream . Um is has a fairly large cast , notably Kevin Spacey , Gabriel Byrne , um and it was directed by Bryan Singer , it's one of his earlier movies I think . It was written by Quist Christopher McQuarrie . Um and according to Rolling Stone it's the freshest , funniest and scariest crime thril thriller to come along since Pulp Fiction . Uh The Sixth Sense on the other hand is a more commercial movie with its famous line , I see dead people . Um it was written and directed by M_ Night uh Shyamalan and stars Bruce Willis , Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette , and it's about a little boy who sees dead people and i he sees a child psychologist to try to get him to understand why he sees the dead people , what it means . 
B:  Ah . 
C:  Hmm . 
D:  And actually the psychologist is dead . 
A:  Now that you've given away the twist , yes . <laugh> Um  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  No , but we're the clubbers , but  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <other> 
B:  Agnes , uh I was just wondering , uh I see uh I have here Denis's table , and when they say that it's the freshest whatever since Pulp Fiction , well that's probably not a very long time , because Pulp Fiction is ninety four and Usual Suspects is ninety five . <laugh> Okay . <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yep . Mm . 
A:  <other> Send your complaints to Rolling Stone . <laugh> So on the next couple of slides I'll just go through some of um more detailed stuff that we might need for administrative purposes . Um the length for The Usual Suspects um is a hundred and five minutes . Uh as you can s well , as Andrei already said , it's n nineteen ninety five . It has an R_ rating , which means that at least in the  in North America it was not recommended for people under eighteen , 'cause it's fairly violent , but not so violent as other movies . Um plot outline uh five villains in New York are rounded up by the police in an unconventional manner that worries them . After release they get together for a spot of revenge , but someone else is controlling events . And the big mystery of the movie is who's controlling the events . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Um it got an eight point seven out of ten user rating on the Internet Movie Database , it's sixteenth in the top two hundred and fifty movies of all time , forth in Denis's list of the top movies of the nineteen nineties , which I think was also taken from I_M_D_B_ . Um it won several Academy Awards , including best supporting actor and best writing , um best film for the British equivalent of the Academy Awards , it was nominated for a Cesar for best foreign film . So it got a fair bit of recognition despite not being 
B:  <other> 
D:  Yep . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
A:  um a very mainstream , high budget movie , or maybe because it wasn't a mainstream , high budget movie . 
D:  So wha what will be your argument for projecting this movie ? 
A:  I don't think a lot of people have seen it , in fact , other than  
C:  I haven't see it . 
A:  <other> you haven't seen it , you haven't seen it , you've seen it . 
B:  I haven't seen it . 
C:  <cough> 
D:  Yep . 
A:  And don't think a lot of people have seen it , it's not a very very well known movie . What ? 
D:  It's very well known . Yeah . 
A:  Is it ? 
C:   it's a  
B:  Really ? 
A:  See ? 
D:  I think , yeah . It's one of the most well known thriller . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:   . 
A:  Really ? That surprises me , I always got the impression that it was  
B:  Oh . It's it's hard to tell . So that's your impression . Yeah . That's  mine , but uh  
D:  Yeah . That's my impression , yeah . But it's it's rated four fourth in uh in the list and one hundred one hundred thousand 
A:  Yeah . Well , it's a good movie . 
B:  Yeah . How many people voted for it , yeah ? That's true . 
D:  seen it . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  One hundred thousand . One hundred and two . For for voted for it , yeah . 
D:  Voted for it . Voted for it , and I think only two other mov uh no , f three other movies uh have uh have more votes . 
C:  More votes ? Yeah , it's it seems to be quite popular . 
A:  Yeah . So  but I think the main thing is it's got a good twist at the end and 
C:  Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
A:  it's it's an interesting movie to watch . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Okay . 
topic_description:	The Usual Suspects specs


A:  Um so if you go to the next slide . More or less the same thing for The Sixth Sense . It's slightly newer , nineteen ninety nine , more or less the same amount of time . It has a lower rating , 'cause it's less violent , but it depends what audience we are gonna have at the showings . 
B:  Yeah . Isn't violent at all in fact , or it's more like scary or  
A:  It has  it's scary and I think it has some sort of slight violence , but  . 
B:  Uh-huh . 
D:  But the kid is seeing dead people , I mean is uh it's quite uh  
A:  Yeah , but they're not violently dead . 
D:  No , but it's quite uh morbid you can say that ? Yeah , morbid . 
B:  Scary or  yeah , mm-hmm . Creepy or  
A:  It's it's morbid and it's creepy , but it's not violent as in people being sliced in half or anything like that . Um <laugh> um it's nineteenth in the top movies of the nineties , hundred first in the top two hundred fifty , it was nominated for a lot of awards , it didn't win 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  as many . Might have won more sort of minor awards , but at least the Academy Awards , it was nominated for five of them , um but didn't win . Nevertheless still a good movie , still a good twist at the end , which Denis already gave away . <laugh> 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  <laugh> They don't remember . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
topic_description:	The Sixth Sense specs


D:  Okay , so uh I think , Mirek , you prepared a presentation also . We can have a look . 
C:  Yeah . So my presentation is not that detailed , I just uh put there seven uh highly uh ranked movies , and we can just try to g uh go very quickly through all of them , just to re remind you them , and then we can perhaps consider another p uh potential candidates . 
D:  <other> Sorry , it's control L_ 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Okay , so the movies that I have selected as as very good uh good ranked movies uh are uh uh are on the screen so uh Shaw The Shawshank Redemption , Schindler's List , Usual Suspects , Pulp Fiction , Goodfellas , Silence of the Lambs and American Beauty . 
topic_description:	Second Movie Presentation


C:  <cough> <other> 
D:  Um so <other> what will be your favou <other> your preferred one on  in this list ? 
C:  And I think that's the last <other>  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  If  would like to go for something what is really serious I would definitely uh go for Schindler's List , and if not uh then  Hmm . I would like to see this uh Shawshank Redemption , because it receive i yeah , it it  none of us seen this movie unfortunately , but uh <other> as you can see from the from your from your table , there is a plenty of votes . It's actually  I think it's a movie with highest number of the votes , yeah , it is . 
D:  The first one , yeah . Probably  yeah , you received so yeah . Yeah , yeah . 
B:  Yeah , that's true . 
D:  And it's uh Tim Robbins and uh  who is the the guy behi Morgan Freeman . Yeah . Yeah , great actors . 
A:  Morgan Freeman . 
C:  Morgan Freeman , yeah . 
B:  Yeah , but didn't  I mean I see this name of the the director on the slide , but I don't really know him . Frank Darabont ? <other> 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Darabont . Me neither , me neither . 
D:  Mm yeah . 
B:  Never heard of this guy . 
C:  Yeah , but really I would like to highlight that it's a it's a movie with highest number of the votes and the highest ranking at the same time . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Yep . Okay . Yep , it tells something . Okay , it's just a <other> do we want to have  to display the most popular movie or or we're  
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  So . 
B:  Yeah , I'm not sure . Yeah . 
A:  Well let's go through the other suggestions . 
C:  And actually I don't think it's it's it's that popular in Europe at least , because I really <other> you see , none of us have seen it , so . 
D:  Yeah . That's right , yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Yeah , maybe . But it's true , yeah , we shouldn't stick to only very highly rated movies on this table . Though it's a very useful table , but um  okay , do you want me to  yeah . 
D:  Okay , Andrei , yeah , can can you comment your  
B:  So yeah , uh I wrote some notes on um <other> on Saving Private Ryan , which is my candidate . If you can display them it's perfect . Uh do you all have a copy of them ? I have some paper copies . Uh you're welcome . So actually given that more or less our theme since the beginning of the year was um history , drama , action , and given also that , well , we decided to to present this month a movie from the the nineties , um I thought that among these movies , who look quite popular , uh Saving Private Ryan would be a very good candidate . Um <other> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  I do . 
D:  Um yeah , I w thank you . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  actually it's a movie I've seen . Have you seen it before ? Okay , so you've all seen it , so maybe everyone has seen it , I'm not very sure . Um but I think it's a very novel treatment of of war , it's uh it's no longer the b glorification of uh , whatever , combat and victory , but the plot is quite different , it's about saving one person who has a special special value in the in the movie um if only because his brothers actually were all killed , so uh the government believes that they should save at least one person from the family , and saving means actually removing from the the front , if you if re if you remember the plot . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  So in fact this guy , the Private Ryan is not at all the main actor , the the main a well , the main character is uh played by Tom Hanks and it's  actually you can see his picture on the second page of my my notes  uh Captain John Miller . So he is sent with this rather strange mission , which is not a combat mission , but they uh they want just to to get this guy back , which is in fact this guy is I think behind enemy lines or something like this . So it happens in in Europe , just after the the Normandy landing , and it's very very striking the way they they filmed all the the combat scenes and uh it's it's very dramatic , it's uh it's not , you know , like in the movies from the fifties or the sixties where people just fall and die anonymously , but here they  well , you see everything and you see how many people die on that day . It's  actually  
C:  <cough> 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  And you e 
A:  Up close . 
D:  And you enjoyed that , the fact the you see clo I  
B:  Well it's very strange , you could s ask this for any sad movie , did you enjoy it . Well I didn't really enjoy to see bad things , but uh I think it was satisfying to see that , well , how dramatic things are . Yeah . Exactly , yeah . I it's very moving , I  it's true , it's not very it's not very , well , happy . I don't know how it would compare with Apocalypse Now , if it's darker or  maybe  
D:  To realise how it wa  how it was exactly . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . It's very different , I don't think you can compare them . 
D:  Yeah , it's very different , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . So yeah , so I think this would continue a bit our our theme . So the the movie is ranked quite high , if I if I refer back to your table it's number uh , what actually , um fourteen . Quite a lot of votes , so um  also one of the the mainstream movies . Um on the second page uh of my notes I <other> well I quoted some uh well some facts about the movie that I found interesting , we we could use them for either a poster or uh or a presentation . Um especially I enjoyed the story about the the colour saturation . It's true that the movie is not really black and white , uh but uh the colours are grey-ish , dark-ish , it it prov it makes a very moving effect . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  <cough> To make it like uh an historical movie or  
B:  Yeah , I think also to show the um  yeah , I think it's the reference to history and also this dark  yeah the mood and uh things are  actually well most of the things are quite grey , you know , the uniforms , weapons , things and things like that . 
A:  Also sets the mood a little bit . 
D:  Yeah , mm . 
A:  Darker and  Yeah , but you'd get a different impression if you had bright blue sky and bright sunshine behind it . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Exactly . 
C:  But if I read your first point in the in this uh trivias , I am just surprised because it says that all the principle actors uh underwent several days of uh cruel army training except for the Man Matt Damon , and the reason was that they wan uh that the that the director wanted that uh the other actors would resent him . Why this was uh wanted actually ? 
B:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Well I think Matt Damon is the guy who must be saved , if I remember well , and in fact the die  
A:  Yeah , he's private Ryan . 
C:  Yeah . And they didn't like it , they didn't like the mission ? 
B:  Well yeah , the people didn't understand why they should save one person . 
A:  Well  They're being sent to the front behind enemy lines to retrieve one soldier only because all of his other brothers died . 
D:  <other> Oh . 
B:  So and they are quite resentful , because they <other> I mean they feel they should fight , they shouldn't just go there and uh just get someone and get back . And in fact some of them d get killed for this guy . Actually most of them , yeah , I think so . 
C:  Mm-hmm mm-hmm . Yeah , and it  okay . 
A:  Most of them get killed , don't they ? Yeah . 
C:  Yes . Most of them . So there is actually several people dying because of one single single soldier , mm-hmm . 
B:  So  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . It's a very  I think some people compare it with uh , whatever , Christian message or  I dunno , but um I think it's quite quite universal and it's uh  I think it's a modern , very modern  
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
D:  What kind of message ? <laugh> Sorry , I'm not getting your  
B:  Well this uh value of one individual , it looks like a Christian message , you know , the value of one  is compared to others  I I don't know I th I think I heard this at that point , but maybe I'm just wrong . So yeah , I <other> I think it would make a coherent choice . It's probably a bit long and we might want something that is lighter and funnier , but uh if we want to keep this this idea of history and conflict and also to show some some kind of modern treatment of it , it it would make for a good choice . But if you see in my notes at the bottom of the first page I put some other candidate movies . 
D:  Okay . 
C:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
B:  Uh La Vita e Bella is an Italian one , but it's also about history and it happens at t the same period as Schindler's List . And I also quoted Pulp Fiction and Silence of the Lambs , um a bit more remote from the themes , but quite well known movies and enjoyable I would say . <other> So do you have any questions about this , or should we just move to the next candidate maybe ? 
C:  Hmm . 
D:  Yep . Or or we have  you have  
B:  Okay . 
C:  I have no comments , no no , it's  
A:  Mm-mm . 
D:  Okay . So actually I don't know if uh y any of you have uh read the document I prepared on The Big Lebowski . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  It's just below the table , so since we all refer to the table  
D:  It's below the table , yeah . I wanted  
C:  Yeah , but I really appreciate your table , because I found this table really useful . <laugh> It's a very nice summary . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah , yeah , I wanted to say that uh it's quite open , there are many choices possible . But then my proposal is The Big Lebowski from um the two brothers uh Coen , Coen brothers . And it's a actually Joel Co Coen who uh directed the movie . Um 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  <other> 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  the plot is quite hard to to make , but maybe you you read it al already you understood something from the plot or  
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  <laugh> I tried to . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . No , I think the summary is i is quite good , and especially I think it uh  well mm when you read it you just want to go to see the movie . I think it looks funny for me . I haven't seen the movie , but uh the summary looks funny . 
D:   . I am ? <laugh> Yeah , it's it's it's a bit like the f in my opinion like um American Beauty , because it's it's a funny movie but uh it critiques a lot the American society . And the the the hero , the the Dude , the mm Big Lebowksi , it's actually his name , is a a kind of non-hero , but he's representative of the of uh a normal uh L_A_ L_A_ guy . And uh he has a friend comi veter veteran from Vietnam and uh another friend who is never speaking . And they all are together in a bowling club where they meet and they discuss about uh everything . They seems to have no job , I not know , we never seen i them working . Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Mm-hmm . <other> 
B:  <laugh> Mm-hmm . 
C:  So doing nothing , just uh take it easy in the life , yeah . 
D:  And actually he's uh taking part to a kind of um <other> uh 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  <other> uh s some some killers come to his apartment uh because they think he's someone else , and uh the whole story is about uh  he wants to to to get some money out of this story , and he's going to see the other Lebowski to ask him money , because he he  because the killers actually uh damage some stuff in his apartment . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
B:  <other> Mm-hmm . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Actually , who are the two characters on the the p the poster , on the on the image that  
D:  It's uh Jeff Bridges and uh John Goodman . John Goodman , you have probably seen him in in a series ? 
B:  Uh-huh . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  And w and which one is the Big Lebowski on the picture ? 
D:  <other> On the right , the guy on the right , Jeff Bridges . 
B:  Okay , so the guy with the glasses . 
C:  Mm-hmm . And the one on the left is his friend ? 
D:  Yeah . He's the one coming uh from from Vietnam . He's kind of uh 
A:  Or is that the other Lebowski ? 
B:  The Vietnam guy . 
A:  Oh , okay . 
C:  Aha , yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  he is still equipped for for war . Okay so uh  
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Hmm . <laugh> 
C:  But this movie is is supposed to happen in uh what time , I mean it's uh  
D:  It's f a movie from the nineties actually , yep . 
C:  Which ca From the nineties ? And he's still uh still uh prepared from or or still  as he he would come from the Vietnam . 
D:  Yep , yeah , yeah , that's a problem . I'm going to  actually I want to show you some posters I prepared for this movie , so we actually can discuss at the same time the poster design . 
C:  Okay . <laugh> There i <laugh> 
B:  Well , sort of  . 
C:  Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
B:  Oh . 
D:  So on the left you see the main characters of the movie , so <other> the the hero at the top left . Then it's the guy coming back from Vietnam . Afterward it's uh uh a guy who  John Turturro , they are competing with him on a bowling uh contest , 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  and um <other> Julianne Moore and the last one is Buscemi or something like that . Buscemi ? He's never speaking in the movie . Each time he's trying to speak , the other one are are stopping him . 
A:  Buscemi , yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Really ? <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh . 
D:  So it's qu 
C:  And this one is supposed to be the second Lebowski ? Or who  
D:  No , he's not on the on the picture , the second Lebowski . 
C:  Okay , okay . 
D:  <other> So uh my proposition was to add um the title of course , some information abo about the pricing on the right  
B:  Yeah , you cannot read it very well because  
C:  <cough> 
D:  Uh yeah , but when it will be printed it will be okay , I think . 
C:  But actually I'm I'm little bit missing th some information about our movie club , I think uh there should be some more information . 
D:  Ah , you mean  Okay , so I prepared a second one <other> where th th th there's there is some information . At the bottom we can see that um , do you know Mondre Montreux English Movie Club ? Uh  <other> I said that people can contact us to to get  to the committee and select movies . 
B:  Mm . 
C:  Yeah I like this , mm-hmm . <cough> 
A:  Mm-hmm , yeah . 
B:  Uh-huh . Yeah , the text on this one is very good . 
D:  So um . 
A:  I think it looks too much like a C_D_ cover , though . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Okay . 
B:  Oh because it's square . 
A:  I like the layout of the first one and the content of this one . 
B:  Uh-huh . 
C:  So perhaps we can somehow combine them . 
D:  But there is a th there is a third one . Um actually I I prefer it because it's more colourful also . 
A:  It looks like two different posters though . 
B:  Yeah , I don't like the black one . The f the first poster is I think much uh much too dark . 
C:  I think there is too many colours , <laugh> too many colours . Nowadays , you know , if you see some advertisements on the s yeah , but nowadays if you see some advertisement on the on the street , this is typical typical uh poster I wouldn't wouldn't look at . 
B:  No , that's nice . 
D:  But it's it can catch the eyes actually but um  
B:  Yeah . 
A:  It's hard to read . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  But then the problem  I preferred the first one , because I think it's important to have the plot of  movie , e especially for uh a movie people don't  n never heard about it . But uh I don't know . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Yeah , maybe two or three sentences , because I guess they won't stop in front of the poster . 
C:  Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  The paragraph I think was a little bit long . 
D:  <other> Okay , so what do you propose , what should I do for these posters ? In terms of content . 
B:  Yep . So layout of the first one 
A:  I would <other> and content of the second one . 
B:  and colours of the third one . 
D:  <laugh> Okay , I'll try to do something , but first anyway we have to select a movie . So I'll put all the information and you want me to put the  at the bottom , all the information about the committee and the the Montreux Club , okay . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Mm-hmm . 
C:  Exactly . 
A:  Yeah , like what you have there . 
D:  <other> Okay . 
A:  And then maybe replace the paragraph that you had on the first poster with either shorter sort of descriptions , not even of the whole plot , but just descriptions of the movie or  'cause I think that paragraph is too long , people don't r generally just stand there and then read the whole thing . 
D:  Okay . <other> Okay . Okay , so just to conti to finish with The Big Lebowski , it's um  I think those two images are pretty representative , so the  on the first  on on the top you see the hero with a a cowboy that i introduces the movie , and on the bottom it's uh he is  he keeps dreaming in th in this movie , because uh uh the killer's um uh put it d put it  or he is drinking too much also , so each time he's uh drinking he's having some dreams , very very weird , but interesting . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  <other> 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
B:  Oh okay . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  So the woman on the second picture , that's Julianne Moore or  oh . 
D:  <other> Yep . Yeah , yeah . <other> Actually , she wants him to  she wants to make kids and she's using the Big Lebowski to have kids with him , but he doesn't know . So maybe he's making strange uh  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Ah . 
C:  Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
B:  <laugh> Interesting . So it's not really violent or  I mean the movie is quite for general audiences . Okay . 
D:  Okay . <other> Yeah , yeah , it's very very sweet and it's like a it's like a dream actually . 
B:   okay . 
C:  How is it actually r ranked , because I cannot see it here in your table .

topic_description:	Silence of the Lambs specs


D:  Okay . And last choice . 
C:  And the last choice that um I think it's it's not a bad movie , it's uh American Beauty . Uh 
A:  That's a good movie . 
D:  Yep , that's a good one . 
C:  it's basically about the about the people in America , each of them is uh I would say psychotic in his uh his own way , but uh normally they appear to be uh s normal people , as as we can see them ev every day . Uh so  and it's really it's uh  the user comments say it's a deep , wonderful , penetrating uh film , extraordinary uh irony uh in a psychological drama about American life , and I can fully agree with this user comment . Uh  
D:  <other> And Kevin Spacey ? It's  no , Kevin Spacey , he received something , no ? 
C:  <other> 
A:  <other> Yeah , it's Kevin Spacey .

topic_description:	American Beauty specs

C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  <other> Yeah . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  So maybe each of us can s can select two movies or  
B:  Yeah , let's nominate first . 
C:  <other> Let's nominate , okay . 
D:  Okay . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  And then we vote  we choose from the list . 
C:  So I will take basically two extremes , I will take Schindler's List and I will take uh The Big Lebowski . One of the one of them is really just funny and from the nineties , uh I mean  the story is from the nineties , while the second one is about the Second War and is uh serious . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Well I'll nominate the one I proposed , Saving Private Ryan , so history , war , drem drama . And I haven't seen it , but I would like to see it and I think American Beauty . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  If you  if you think that our series  okay , it's not about America , but uh still Apocalypse  well , yeah . It's about countries . <laugh> So , Agnes , Denis ? 
A:  Um I'd go for Sixth Sense , just because it's different from all the other ones and maybe Shawshank Redemption , just because we haven't seen it . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  So Denis , are you happy with our choices or would you like to add something ? 
D:  <other> Um no , actually I'm happy with the choices , because I really  I would really push uh American Beauty , because I think it's uh it's an easy movie to watch and and still there are a lot of things to think afterward . 
A:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  And it's representative of the nineties , I think . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Okay . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  So what if we voted , say , like for first and second choice and then we count ? You can give two points to one and one point to another one ? <laugh> Would you like this strange way to vote ? 
D:  Okay . <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Okay , that's  
D:  Okay , start , Andrei . <laugh> No  
B:  Um okay so uh  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> I don't want to finish  I think I'm going to  
B:  Oh yeah , um well it's <other> uh well if I nominated two and I was the only one , I'll give two points to Saving Private Ryan and one to American Beauty . 
A:  <laugh> Okay , um  
B:  You don't want to finish , Denis . Then you'd better hurry . 
C:  Yeah , but then each of us will will uh but then each of us will vote for uh our nominees , so I would propose to to to vote for s sun uh to to give the points to the to the movies that were not nominated by you . 
D:  <other> No . 
B:  Okay . Okay . <laugh> That makes the vote more complicated . Um <other> okay , so I'll give um uh b um 
D:  Yeah , maybe it makes more sense , yeah . 
A:  <laugh> Okay . 
C:  So then it's it's more complicated but  yeah , okay , let's  Mm-hmm , okay . 
B:  okay , two to The Sixth Sense and one to The Big Lebowski . 
C:  Sixth Sense . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Okay , me I put two to American Beauty <other> and uh one to Saving Private Ryan . 
A:  Okay , um 
C:  'Kay . 
B:  I note that you didn't nominate a film , so <laugh> you are sort of freer than us . Agnes ? Okay , oh . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> So I'll  
C:  Seconds . 
D:  No , Big Lebowski , I nominate  . 
A:  I'll give two to American Beauty and mm one to The Big Lebowski . 
C:   okay , and I wi I will give one to The Big Lebowski and two to The uh uh Shawshank Redemption . 
A:  Okay , so it's pretty clear .

B:  <other> American Beauty four , Big Lebowski three . So you have to redo the posters , uh ? 
A:  American Beauty . 
D:  So do we have something ?

A:  Well you can keep the format , I mean th you didn't have that many graphics in the first one . <other> 
D:  <other> So you select  you wanted actually me to select the  this design ? That takes a bit more time , but if you c if all of you can send me one image , I can make something on the left . Select one image from the movie and uh  
B:  Mm-hmm . You mean the first poster , yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Yeah . Okay . 
C:  But I would say these images are very nice and they are really representative perhaps . 
B:  Maybe you can leave those . 
A:  Yes , but of the wrong movie . <laugh> That's the real twist . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  <laugh> With a different title ? Okay . No but I'll make something .
