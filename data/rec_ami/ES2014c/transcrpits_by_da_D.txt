Yeah . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
'Kay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
So are we going for the w are we going for the simple one , are we ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
 
Mm . 
I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we  m make a decision . 
Oh yeah , I suppose so , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Just  
Just just for the call and find thing . 
'Cause it's s it's separate isn't it , 
it's not part of the  
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah and ours is quite a cheap device , 
so I don't know how much we'll be able to put into it . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
I've I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching . 
Cool . 
Right , um I've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market 
the the one  that's the one I talked about last time , 
that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . 
And we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment . 
So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the uh fashion trends . 
<laugh> So  <laugh> 
So just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation . 
The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional . 
And second , there should be some technological innovation . 
And then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well . 
And apparently , the fashion trends <laugh> are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme . 
<laugh> Um but um the feel of the material should be spongy , 
which is contrary to last year , apparently . 
I presume it must have been not not spongy last year . 
<laugh> So 
we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else . 
And then also try and add in technological informat innovation 
which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap . 
And then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority , 
so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed . 
And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations . 
So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , 
or the the buttons could be spongy , uh somehow . 
Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic . 
And then sort of even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote , 
say in the shape of a banana or something like that . <other> 
Right , so that'll be it . 
Maybe a banana or courgette or something . <laugh> 
How how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends , 
do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , 
or or you know , do they not matter that much ? 
Yeah . 
<laugh> Maybe yeah . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah yeah . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , 
I'm not  
Yeah . 
I'm not I'm not sure what what what the sort of timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is . 
I don't know . 
Yeah , yeah . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
That's possibly it . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
I mean it's people say that it's the look , they want the fancy looking thing 
but I'm  
Yeah . 
I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into . 
I think with the mobiles , it's the , you know it's a communication device , 
people see you with it all about and 
i if it 
Yeah . 
I think  
Mm-hmm . 
Well , it was different last year . 
The trend was different last year apparently . 
It was not not spongy feel . 
But  
I don't know whether the trend will change . 
I don't know whether it's one of those things that like sort of having all fruit shaped keys , that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly , 
whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year , you know . 
Yeah . 
Mm . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
When you say d when you say double-curved , what what exactly does that mean ? 
Okay . 
No 
you're not connected to me anymore . <laugh>  
 
That should come up . 
Mm  . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Right . 
<laugh> That's what I was trying to work out . 
Shall we 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Yeah I think that think that's a good idea . 
Rubber  
Rubber buttons and case . 
Yeah . 
Yeah yeah . 
Okay . 
And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit . <laugh> Or veg . 
Don't know , 
maybe just 
Yeah . 
That's ru rubber buttons , yeah . 
Yeah . <other> 
Reasonably spongy I guess , yeah . 
Yeah okay . 
<laugh> 
Yeah  . 
Apple ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Apple apple 
a a qu Quite a big one , as well . 
<laugh> A big apple . Uh  
Could be a red apple , yeah . 
Either , don't mind . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
<laugh> 
Looks like it . <laugh>
