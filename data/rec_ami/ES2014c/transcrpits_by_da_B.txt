I think we all have a presentation again , 
so if we go through those and then um 
 . 
Shall I go first again ?  
I see  this a little more smoothly than the last one . 
<cough> 
Okay right , let's get started . Um 
basically the uh for the  
Um I'll  back actually . 
For the components design , um next step is 
basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . 
We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . 
Then there is a chip 
and still the sender . 
So um yes  including the power s supply as well . 
Um I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . 
Uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , 
um . <other> 
There's a dynamo . 
Any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up  
um . 
There's a kinetic option , 
which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around , um it just requires a small amount of movement 
which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . 
Um that's one option , 
but I think that was gonna cost a little more . 
And then there's solar cells . Um as a final option . 
For the buttons , we have um an integrated push button , 
which is  
Oh just to say all all these are um supplied by Real Reaction . 
So I guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options . 
Um so for the buttons there's an integrated push button , 
which I guess is just the same as the standard ones . 
This says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal  for like uh like modern computer . 
Um there's a scroll wheel which is  you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , 
which may be for the volume . 
You could do do that . 
Um one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , 
if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , 
so we have to take that into consideration . 
Um moving on to the printed s 
Um that's on the next  
I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons , 
but it does affect the printed circuit board . 
Um which is the next section . 
Basically for the circuit board which is the middle , it's just  see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual um of the remote . 
The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board . 
And there's different prices according to each . 
So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button . 
Um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . 
There's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost , 
but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much . 
Um and I guess that would require a more advanced circuit board , 
so there is an extra price in that sense . 
There is th sorry an extra cost in that sense . 
Um going to my personal preferences , um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic 
um which is the idea of the watches um that you move 
you move the remote around to power it up . 
And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . 
Um for the buttons , I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . 
Um and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . 
So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board . 
And that's it . 
Um i it kind of depends um 
if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . I'm guessing . 
Uh but I don't know , 
so that is something I'll have to look into . 
Um that's a that's a decision for all of us . Um . 
Yeah yeah . 
We decide . Yeah . 
Um . Maybe w 
Um . 
Yes . 
Is there  
Um . 
We could do , yeah . 
Um yeah we should  . 
As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel , 
it didn't  
The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information . Um . 
Yeah 
if if you  down um . It's just this bit at the bottom which I've highlighted , 
but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip , 
which is in the higher price range . 
Also the display's for something else which we decided against . 
Um but that bit  
And note that the push button just requires a simple chip , 
so that would keep the price down . 
'Kay . 
So maybe just a simple push button , 
and that would cut costs on the  
 Did everyone get this on the speech recognition ? 
The um 
it was basically what we said before , 
the idea that you record in a set message , 
and then it picks up that message um and replies to you . 
So it is basically the concept we discussed before . 
Um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board . 
I'm guessing it would , 
but  got like the definite information . 
Maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than  
Um if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board . 
So maybe that would be something separate , yeah . 
Okay , 
so we'd have a simple circuit board 
and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it . 
Oh that makes sense . 
Okay . 
Yeah that makes sense , 
so we'd stick with the simple circuit board 
and then think of the speech recognition as an extra an extra possibility . 
Okay . Um . 
Um yeah 
I I thought so just for  just for ease of not having to replace the batteries . 
Um . 
It's um I think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside . 
It's um it's some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up . 
Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement . 
So you'd you'd move the remote around a little bit 
and then that powers it up to use it . 
Uh yeah I think  
did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board , it just affected  
It was just  
Oh no 
th that's what that's what I thought , 
but maybe maybe it doesn't  . 
Um I think I might have got that wrong . 
It's it's just an addition thing 
it's um 
yeah . 
'Kay . 
'Kay shall I pass on to you now ? 
I assume it would cost extra , 
but  Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later . 
If you right click 
and then go onto a previous slide . 
Okay , right . 
Yeah , yeah . 
On the price , yeah . 
'Kay . 
I guess I guess we're going for the biggest market ,  maybe not , 
but  Was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ? 
So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step , 
but maybe I dunno for ours , maybe we should  
Yeah . 
So you also said for going for the international market um that some some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition . 
S s so um  
Yeah , yeah . 
It w it would make it quite complicated , 
where um ours at least keeps it fairly simple 
and then the  
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yes yes . 
So maybe we could have like  
Yeah . 
Yeah I I know what you mean . 
So maybe we could have volume written on the side 
and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves . 
Possible . 
Mm . 
Yeah yeah  . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
we got it down to not too many . 
Um  
Are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , 
or are we gonna t 
Yeah , maybe we should see yours first . 
<laugh> 
'Kay . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Well I dunno 
I I guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment , 
but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are , 
maybe  
I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends . 
 to something which is maybe more universal . 
We c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly . 
Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about , um . 
Maybe still with a rubber design we could  
Um . 
Oh yeah yeah 
one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case . 
Um oh no no no 
sorry 
it's if you use the uh rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons . 
That's the way round . 
If you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it . 
Which makes sense . 
Um . 
Yeah . 
I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual  
 would or not . 
Yeah . 
Yes yes . 
Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions 
like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . 
But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production , 
whether that would just increase the costs , 
make it more complicated . 
Yeah 
the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside , 
so where the buttons would stay the same , 
and the general function of the remote would stay the same , 
but you could change the the way it looked . 
Yeah , that's true . 
Yeah . 
So it is a possibility , um . 
Oh okay yes 
that is  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider . 
Yeah . 
Yeah I suppose , 
where you you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time . 
Yeah , less likely to  
So then th th that would  
Yeah . 
 it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case , 
and then have the standard rubber buttons as well . 
Um . 
Um . 
Mayb 
Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? 
But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah yeah . 
So shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on , 
if we have to kind of  
 
'Kay , 
so shall we quickly  
We'll go for single curve , yeah . 
Single curve . 
So did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply ? 
The one you move around ? 
Okay . 
Um  
 
Oh we ca 
Yeah yeah , 
we'll still have the  
Are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down ? 
I th I think we can by by not having anything too complicated  . 
<other> Um . 
And see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to  that we seemed to leave out . 
Yeah , 
it was just  
'Kay . 
 
We will go for the a a a apples apples . 
Okay . 
And then we're gonna  
are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple ? 
Just like the  
Just working out what we're gonna do for the next time . 
Um . 
Yeah . 
'Kay . 
And j yeah , just keeping the sort of the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as well . 
Fairly sort of self explanatory . 
Okay . 
Is that the end ? 
Okay .
