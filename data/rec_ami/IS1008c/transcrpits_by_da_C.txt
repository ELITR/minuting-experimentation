Okay . 
So uh , if you could open the PowerPoint presentation . 
I'm number two . 
<other> Components design , 
there we go . 
So uh can we put it in slide show mode ? 
Yeah . 
Right here , 
is that little  
that one , 
yes please . 
Thank you . 
I'll take the mouse . 
<other> 
So uh 
we were looking he specifically at the components uh  the following components , 
uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set . 
In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , 
you have to have microphone  
well no you don't actually I haven't  have to have microphone in the device , 
but um 
maybe you do have it a a way  
it has to it has to hear the speaker 
and um , 
so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , 
but somewhere you have to put the microphone , 
um 
and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . 
Um so the other w thing that we  So . 
Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't 
and then we also um  we wanted to evaluate some new materials 
and we contacted manufacturing for their input 
because , course , we m might <other> come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , 
so uh 
this is the approach that we took during our um  our research . 
So um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . 
Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , 
but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh  we can really seriously explore , 
<other> so then we were thinking about um rubber , 
but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor 
and th um there might be some <other> problems with the m uh how it's  <other> uh goes with the board . 
<other> Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle  it gets brittle after a while , 
so um we still had titanium and and wood available , 
but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh , 
the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , 
although how <other> Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure 
but uh 
nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood . 
<other> So , <other> this is our finding . 
And a as she said , it's an environmentally friendly uh material , 
so we're  we're <other> currently uh proposing , 
uh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . 
So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board , 
 uh these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . 
And um then there was the regular which <other> 
I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one . 
Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print , 
<other> and uh we liked th we 
we found that it it includes this infrared sender , 
which w 'member the beam was  that was an important component of finding the right chip . 
And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , 
so uh we we uh 
now jumping right to our personal preferences 
um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um , 
you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . 
I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , 
you see , they could do sort of a  this um three-dimensional design on the internet , 
and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , 
and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , 
and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . 
So this is the findings of our research 
and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . 
Do you have any problems with that ? 
I'm not sure , how do I  
Oh , I know , let's see . 
Let's go back up here . 
I think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um <other> 
and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board . 
Uh I could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting . 
<other> 
I don't know , 
but I'll find out more at our next meeting . 
Sounds good . 
Because um it gets brittle , cracks  
Um 
We want  
we expect these um <other> uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . 
So . <laugh> 
Good ex <laugh>  Good expression . <laugh> 
I don't know , speak for yourself , I'm planning to be around for a while . <laugh> 
<other> 
<other> <laugh> 
<laugh>  you're what ? 
<laugh> You think ? 
<other> And you could  you could sell oils with it , to take care of it . 
<laugh> Well I'm glad you  
<other> 
Okay , good . 
<laugh> Sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face . <laugh> 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
She works in the cubicle next to me so she's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this <laugh> . 
Luckily Ed was not . <laugh> 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , 
you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your  
<other> It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it <laugh>  for teething . 
Yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah . 
Oh , I'm sorry . 
<other> Right , 
my hand is uh different size than yours for example . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
A hinge . 
Be like a copper hinge or you know . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> Sure . 
No , 
f go to findings . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in . 
<laugh> 
You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um <other> a uh <other> uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball , 
and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand . 
<other> To t <other> an 
and then you would know like <other> um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh  
<laugh> Yes <laugh> 
you'd know what kind of wood to get . 
<other> That's right , that's right , you wouldn't wanna go too far down that . 
Oh that  that actually would uh increase the um  the revenues we could expect , yeah . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
Right , mm . 
We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , 
we might wanna um learn about um <other> labour laws . 
You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , 
but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries . 
So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device . 
Cost of living is low . 
<other> Good , 
well th that'd be something that manufacturing would have to um explore more 
and to where  
Yeah 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> What do you think Ed ? 
Do you  
he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , 
um , 
do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ? 
<other> 
Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ? 
Okay . 
<laugh> Sorry about that . 
<other> 
<other> 
<other> 
So the <other> the advanced chip on print is what um what we've <other> we've deci we've determined 
and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , 
and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case . 
A customisable and  
<laugh> 
Uh I don't think so , no , 
I think they could be rubber like they are now , 
so you have that tactile experience of  
So um 
are we done with this meeting ? 
<other> 
And a marketing strategy . 
<laugh> 
<other>
