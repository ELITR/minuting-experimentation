Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , 
is it means it's on the  yeah 
is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh  
Okay , tha that would be great , 
so if you find out from the technology background , okay , 
so that would be good . 
So  so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes . 
Yeah , so it it's looks good the the design the functional design uh , 
what about yo you ? 
Yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first

Yeah . 
<other> 
Yeah , but we can get a production in , uh <other> , countries like , uh , India 
 yes , yes , 
countries like India or China or Malaysia , 
so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more . 
So  
Yeah , <other> yeah , so 
Yes . 
So  
Yeah , so  
<other> Yes uh , 
but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay . 
So we don't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something , 
so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different uh electronics items , 
then we can have a business tie-up and to get  to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . 
So , 
but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , 
if is acceptable for both of you , what uh Ed was talking . 
And your design <other> whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Yes . 
<other> 
<other> 
I don't think so . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
Don't looks nice uh . 
Yeah , so uh 
what we'll do is , uh , we will stick with the the simple design for time being 
until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display . 
Okay . So 
maybe what you can do is uh , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model . 
Okay ? 
<other> 
<other> 
Yeah , I hope , 
if  
is it okay if uh they will come up with the prototype design , okay . 
Then they can show you how it looks like , 
and then we can uh submit to the <other>  
I will submit to the management . 
Okay ? 
Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for uh the display . 
An and the marketing strategy , that's very important , okay . 
Yes . 
How much you can  
how mu how much how much you can sell extra . 
Of course you'll make money too , 
so it it's not only pay-out , you make money too , your commission . 
Okay , so , any questions ? 
So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay , 
then uh , then we can proceed from there .
