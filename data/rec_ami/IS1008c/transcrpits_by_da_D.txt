Wow , 
<laugh> good expression . 
Well after us . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
Actually , I'm ready to sell it . 
I'm ready to sell it . 
No y <other> no no no , 
the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , 
but there are some very pretty woods out there <laugh> . 
That's actually very innovative idea . 
<laugh> 
Well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood . 
<other> I mean it's  each person is gonna have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that's not on the market . 
<other> 
<other> In turns of wow . <laugh> 
<other> <laugh> 
Wood ? <laugh> 
<other> 
<other> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , 
so <laugh> , and chew 'em up . 
And chew 'em up . 
<other> 
<other> 
<other> 
<other> 
<other> 
No . <other> 
Hmm . 
Simple design . 
It's what consumers want . 
It's almost like , Houston , we have a product here . <laugh> 
Problem is obviously gonna be cost . 
Okay , 
I also have a f <other> very simple presentation , 
because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want . 
<other> I also have uh copied a different type of remote . 
If you can find me , where I'm at . <laugh> 
There should only be one in here . 
 trend watch . 
It's being modified . 
<laugh> They're stealing our product . 
<other> We've been giving simple <other> questionnaires in different areas 
because th  obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 
'cause uh trends change very very quickly . 
In six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act . 
Uh they already erased the rest of mine , huh . 
No no , no no . 
<other> 'Cause I had another comment there . 
Uh the market trend . This is what we know from the last uh  from the <other> questionnaires from the the  all the p surveys we've done , 
fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for , 
something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use . 
Looking for next generation of innovation , 
because all the remotes out there now , they're all very similar , they all do the same thing , 
we have to have something completely different . 
Okay ? 
Easy to use , has always has become  has become another major interest that uh , 
with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use . 
And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . 
So even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they  look  it looks and feels good and has technology . 
The second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . <other> 
The second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use . 
The first one , I see <other> that they put in a display . 
Now there's something else uh with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in , 
but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked . 
Maybe the display also makes it easier to use , 
because sometimes when you're looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display  
<other> Okay 
Because I've seen  mostly the standard ones , 
yeah . 
Now you have it  now you have one with the very simple also . 
The idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you're doing . 
So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good , <laugh> uh with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours 
, we might've  
Mm-hmm . 
How hard they squeeze ? 
<laugh> Resistance resistance , right . <laugh> 
No , but incorporating the three uh obviously it'd be something totally new on the market , totally different 
and from  
<cough> 
Although , what it  was it uh  
it was uh Nokia that came out with this changeable colours . 
Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face 
and then they sold millions , millions . 
So . 
So say with the f with the findings , with the research , easy to use something totally new . 
We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market . 
<other> 
Where w Where it would be manufactured is is another step . 
We're here to design , come up with a nice product . <other> 
<other> 
No . No 
 no p spec <other> 
It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it . 
Um , no that's no problem . 
I'm here for the <other> pushing it after it's made . <laugh> 
I will market it . <laugh> 
Once we get a price on it then we can market it . 
<other> 
Nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case . <laugh> 
And marketing strategy , thank you . 
Fired . <laugh>
