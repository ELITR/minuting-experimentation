Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
<other> 
<other> 
<other> 
<other> 
<laugh> At least it's environmentally friendly . <laugh> 
<other> 
<other> 
Thank you . Yeah . 
<other> 
Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> Whic 
<other> Which  
<other> 
Although I think  <laugh> 
I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , 
wouldn't you , 
I mean it chips , it if you drop it , 
uh it's  I'm not su <laugh> 
<laugh> 
I think <other> if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , 
but you can't just use  
Yeah , exactly , yeah . 
<other> 
<other> 
The stain . 
<other> 
<other> Um , 
in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own  
<laugh> 
Y yeah . 
<laugh> 
<other> I think we can get the quality materials then <other> it shouldn't influence the design principles too much , which you'll see with my presentation . 
One thing we'd have to check though is what the users  whether  how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh <other> 
 Yeah , for example . 
<other> So , 
have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that , 
but  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Sure . 
<other> 
One point three , yeah 
Uh , yeah . 
I think so , yeah . 
Yeah , that's the one . 
So , it's a very short presentation , 
'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board 
so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , 
um , which basically shows , sort of  
I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , 
which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . 
And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , 
so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control . 
<other> So , that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . 
Um , one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , 
so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , 
especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . 
And also <other> um you had issues with the batteries running out , 
so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is  starts to die . 
And in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . 
So , in terms of what this thing would actually look like  
Despite working in interface design , I'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you'll have to forgive me . <other> 
<other> 
You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , 
sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . 
And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , 
so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . 
And then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad . 
<other> And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_ 
and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . 
So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . 
<other> 
Um , so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip <other> thing and  
Have I forgotten anything ? 
I don't think so . 
So , as you can see , it's a very very simple design , 
which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . 
Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , 
although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . 
Yeah . 
But you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 
'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy . 
But that's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . 
As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control 
and if you do it customisably , <other> you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences . 
So , that's pretty much <other> all I had to say , 
I mean , everything else in terms of design issues . 
Um the centering of the key pad and <other> the channel is just depending on where your thumb is 
and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad , 
so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , 
the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently . 
So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , 
but more or less I think it should go along those lines . 
<laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
No , no . 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Right . 
Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
<other> Oh yeah . 
Yeah , so it's really molded to to your specific  
<laugh> 
But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if  unless everyone has their own personal remote . 
The sales , yeah . <laugh> 
<other> 
Yeah . 
Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And that took off , yeah , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> I think it depends , 
I mean I think it's a good idea , 
but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be 
because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display <other> right in front of you . 
So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . 
I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for  
very specifically what it would be used for , 
'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , 
but that's just sort of speculation , I mean . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> 
What about the buttons , would  Would the buttons be wood too , or  
Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Sure . 
<other> 
<other> 
<other> 
<laugh> 
<other> 
<other> 
No . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Okay .
