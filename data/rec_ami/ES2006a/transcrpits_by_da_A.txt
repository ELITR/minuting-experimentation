Mm-hmm . 
<other>  so sh 
 <other>  . 
I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? 
Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ? 
Right . 
 
How how it will be done . 
So 
whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? 
Uh 
I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the  
it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? 
Okay . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
<laugh>

<laugh>

Thank you . 
Okay <other> um <other> I'll do some  
I'll rub the features 
and let the drawing stay . <other> 
'Kay 
um my name is Gaurav . 
Um <other> 
my favourite animal  
one of my favourite animals is a cow . 
I've got no idea how to draw a cow . 
<laugh> 
Uh this is going to be  
Yeah , that'll do . 
Okay , so let let me draw the body first . 
Big , round body , really skinny legs <laugh> 
and they've got a long tail 
and a long face . <laugh> 
And there is some grass there . 
<laugh> <other> So this is what I like about <laugh> cows <laugh> 
that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , 
they do not disturb anybody um 
they're kind of Buddhist in a way . <laugh> 
So yeah , I like cows . 
<other> Um <other> 
my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , 
so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um 
ho how it works 
and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , 
what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , 
what are the various components of it 
and um finally , 
I'm not too sure what was the last part . 
Um the detailed design , 
I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other . 
Um I'm from India . 
Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , 
I sit at the Department of Psychology . 
<other> Yeah . 
Thank you . 
That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? <laugh>

Uh-huh . 
<laugh> 
Mm . 
Thank you . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<other> I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was  that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original 
so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , 
that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . 
Mm . 
Alright . 
Mm . 
<other> 
Yeah . 
<other> There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , 
but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah . 
Yep . 
And then use the  
Mm . 
 
Mm . 
<other> Uh we can aim for  
I mean we can think about all these little things , 
but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , 
although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , 
uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . 
Um  
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
A big learning curve , yeah . 
Yeah . 
So , i it should kind of fit in as well , 
and the stereotype of a  
yeah . 
<other> Alright . 
<other> . 
Hmm .
