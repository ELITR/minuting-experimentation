Is that a lizard ? 
Is there a difference ? 
<laugh> 
If you right click on it you can  
<laugh> 
Yeah , I was looking at the website , 
and the other things that they've made 
and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . 
So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics 
and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? 
So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . 
You know , so something heading towards that , 
so it's not overly  
I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , 
so I figure how many do you need , you know ? 
Okay . 
Something that's a little less crowded than this , 
like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? 
But what do most people do ? 
They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . 
Sometimes they play a movie . 
Yeah , 
so 
there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , 
maybe to do  
Yeah . 
So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine 
and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . <other> 
Hmm . 
'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , 
the train on the website 
and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing 
um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , 
but it looks really pretty too . 
Mm-hmm .
