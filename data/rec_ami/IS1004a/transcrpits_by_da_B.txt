Uh almost . 
Ready . 
I'm uh Michael . I'm the user interface designer . 
Ah well if no one else wants to , yeah . 
Okay so , want me to draw my favourite animal . 
<other> Let's see . 
Well , I don't really have a favourite animal , but um 
uh I think I have one in mind , so uh  
<other> I'm gonna <other>  about the uh spider 
because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board . 
The spider has a  
spider lives in a web 
<laugh> and uh it has eight legs , 
and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions . 
Unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes . 
There are some spiders that live in like  that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web . 
And uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly 
like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material 
but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh  build a new web somewhere else . 
So I think they did this in uh in Charlotte's Web that movie 
that little uh 
 well it's actually a book first 
but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away . 
So , that's my animal . 
<laugh> 
Maybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
So you don't like pink panthers ? <laugh> 
So is this uh an Indian or an African elephant , 
'cause you haven't drawn the ears ? 
Okay . 
We can discuss that off-line . 
<laugh> 
So could I just ask one question , um 
is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ? 
So it's gonna be you already have a T_V_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something ? 
Okay , alright . 
Okay well , 
so , it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make , 
which seems to  a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet , 
but I guess if that's  if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket 
so , I guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually  you know , what people ar are willing to pay for  
um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty-five Euro 
because it seems quite a lot for a remote control , 
so it's  
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Alright .
