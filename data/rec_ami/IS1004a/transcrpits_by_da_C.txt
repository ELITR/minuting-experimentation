Good morning . 
And I am Hemant , the industrial designer . 
But don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther ? 
So bad I don't like it . 
<other> <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Um sure . 
Oh yeah . 
Thanks . 
This lapel is coming out once in a while . 
It's not very strong . 
Okay . 
So , not the favourite animal , but I think I'll draw elephant . 
I'll try to draw elephant <laugh> . 
It's a problem . 
Okay , thanks . 
Okay so , elephant goes like this ,  
and then it has four feet <other> . 
I don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not , but 
I think this is the easiest . 
And then we have it's trunk . 
And 
yep something like this <laugh> . 
An eye , 
cute <laugh> . 
Yeah , so  
<laugh> and sometimes they have a hump . 
It seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly 
and they they have one very important way  a different way of walking . 
So when they walk , wherever they are going to put their first feet , the second feet will always be . 
When they'll come to that position the second , the third feet will be there . 
That's the way they walk . 
And that's very peculiar about them . 
None of the other animals walk like this . 
And they are very useful to human beings . 
At least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something , or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another , elephants were very useful . 
And they are found in um usually the warm countries . 
And um they are the biggest terrestrial animal . 
That's what I know about them . 
So , that's what I wanted to tell about elephants . 
There are two kind of uh 
yeah , they are very different , Indian and African elephants . 
So Indian elephant is having one bump , I think , and the African have two . 
And then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals , 
these elephants who are Indian and  
So at some  
for some elephants it's  the trunk is having one  
Do we have some message there ? 
Wind up 
? Okay , some other time . 
Thank you . 
<laugh> 
Thanks . 
Marketing person . 
Mm-hmm . 
Thanks .
