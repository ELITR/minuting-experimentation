Uh-oh . 
This is it ? <laugh> 
Um , there are a few changes we've made . 
Um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside , 
so instead we've um  
this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , um just a a very very basic one , 
very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm 
um button . 
Uh , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time . 
<other> 
You know , 
just like right inside there . 
<other> Well <other> we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger 
so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand .  
Well I'm  
We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button . 
Um  
But um <other> 
this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh  it can be the power button 
if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal . 
Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen 
and you use this as a jog-dial . 
I don't know . 
<other> 
Didn't put five centimetres . 
Um . 
Something by there . 
Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons . 
Um , were gonna have the volume control here , 
but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume . 
Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and  
Um yeah . 
Um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , 
um we didn't actually go through and specify the  
Uh what can a T_V_ do ? 
Um . 
 the the balance hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Um I think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing . 
Um we have um got some push buttons as well . 
'Kay . 
So I reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber . 
I'm not sure if that counts but  
You can see we're we're all very far beyond the  
<laugh> 
Well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits . 
That is one . 
That's fair enough , yeah . 
That's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so  
Yeah w 
Um  
<laugh> 
<other> So I reckon  
Reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons . 
I think  there's just one button so 
handy <laugh> . 
Yeah . 
You see I envision it as being um quite deep 
sort of <other> deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat . 
<laugh> 
Yeah it works , yeah . 
See , about that thick . 
<other> Yeah . 
<other> <laugh> 
Is it ? 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
I'm seeing five then . 
One's high-ish isn't it ? 
Ah , okay 
so yeah , two or three . 
<laugh> 
Eight 
three . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Yeah  one . 
Yeah I think it's about five . 
<other> Yeah well we have to use uh plastic 
so it's probably gonna be  
I think I'd probably increase the cost . 
We've only got <other> like what , ten cents left so  
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
My leg . <laugh> 
Um I agree with his point 
it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money . 
Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . 
If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier . 
Not just yet . 
Yeah . 
Oh they're a bit clunky . 
<laugh> 
Good point . 
Yeah . 
Is this for the project or  
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Oh yeah . 
Do we know what the other ones are ? 
Oh wow . <laugh> 
Hey yeah , 
I said Ninja Homer . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Guess I'd forgot how good s Play-Doh smells . 
I think they're all non-toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two-year-olds . 
<laugh> 
Yeah 
it's not very tangible .
