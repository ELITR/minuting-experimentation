Mm 'kay . 
Where are they ? 
Ah , right . 
Great . 
Right . 
Okay . 
Right . 
Right , 'kay . 
Okay 
Mm-hmm , 
and what is this here ? 
Okay so the number pad is  
'Kay , great . 
Mm . 
Yep . 
Looks good . 
Yep . 
<cough> Mm-hmm . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
About nine in total . 
That sounds good . Yeah . 
Yep . 
That'd be good , 
in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually , 
so that would be  
that sounds like a really good size , if you see it there . 
Mm . 
Is it possible  
uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours . 
Is these are these the colours that  of production , or is this just what we had available ? 
Right . 
Mm-hmm . 
How high is it ? 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Sure . 
Three and a half . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm , 
mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm , 
probably colour or sharpness . 
Mm-hmm . 
Audio . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm 'kay . 
Mm . 
Or even clear . 
Uh how mm-hmm  
how are we going to achieve this high-end product if  
We only have very sparse  
Two point three ? 
Four point three 
no ? 
And then where is the  
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
Yeah 
we could just go with um  
Hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
<laugh> 
How about with embossing the logo , isn't that going to cost us some money ? 
Yeah . 
That's a freebie . 
Was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ? 
<other> Sort of flat as possible . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
that's what I was thinking , to 
Sure , okay . 
Yeah alright yeah fair enough . 
Okay , just thought I'd ask . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
Two's not very high at all though . 
Maybe a bit higher ? 
<other> Yeah . 
Maybe closer to three even or two and a half . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Um it's probably just  
I dunno if it's worth getting into , 
but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid , 
because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid , and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that  
Yeah . 
Sure , okay . 
Yeah , alright . 
Okay , sure . 
What about button shape ? 
Square buttons ? 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
Sure . 
Yeah . 
Mm 'kay . 
Do you want me to d um  
<cough> Do you want me to do my um design evaluation last ? 
Or  
Evaluation . 
Okay . 
Sure . 
Um , alright so the way this works , I'm gonna need to plug into PowerPoint , 
I'll try and do it as quick as possible . 
Um , this is um  
I'll just go over your head 
if that's okay . 
<other> 
What's that ? 
I don't need the PowerPoint ? 
Oh  course , 
yeah that's true . 
Let me get that . 
A bit more . 
Okay , 
so what this is is a set-up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a  
The idea is that I've set up  
I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning , 
and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan , 
and uh so we can review that . 
Uh I think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary 
because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but  
Doesn't seem like it's going , does it ? 
Yeah , okay great . 
Uh and I'm gonna write up our results on the board , 
so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um  sort of review where we stand with it . 
Okay , so um  
So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , 
uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , 
okay . 
So these i these i th are the  
and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this , 
so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so 
we just come to an agreement . 
Okay ? 
So the first one uh , stylish look and feel . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it's the company's colour , 
and I don't know if yellow's gonna really be a hit . 
But  <other> 
What do you guys think ? 
Okay . 
Okay let's go with five then . 
Fi oh uh just actually the opposite . 
The  
So it meant three , 
okay . 
Yeah , one is high . 
'Kay <other> 
Let's go with two point five then . 
Okay , um <other> 
control  
high tech innovation . 
We had to remove  
Yeah , 
so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted , 
but jog-dial 
's good . 
Okay , 
three ? 
Okay , um  
Style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design . 
I shouldn't have said colour , but just  
Sorta . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
Right . Yeah , could be . Yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay 
so we'll go two . 
Yeah ? 
Okay , 
and um design is simple to use , simple in features . 
F f yeah f fairly basic , 
you guys think ? 
Yeah , one ? 
Okay . <other> 
Um , <other> soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? 
We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price . 
Five ? 
That's  
Um 
could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ? 
Was that an option ? 
It would cost more than plastic . 
Okay , 
logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ? 
Huh . 
And um it's within budget , yep . 
It is , isn't it ? 
Okay , 
so we can say then that uh out of a possible  
or what would be our goal here ? 
Yeah , 
out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . 
We are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five . 
So it's pretty good . 
Translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal . 
Right ? 
I think 'cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about 
about thirty one , 
and then invert that , it's  
Oh right , about seventy , yeah seventy percent . 
Okay , good . 
That was just a little formality for us to go through . 
Yep , oh 
hundred pound pen . <laugh> 
Sorry <laugh> 
<other> alright . 
<laugh> No . 
Hmm . 
Yeah that's that's me . 
I did have one other um one other frame I thought , 
I mean I I d not knowing how we would deal with this information , 
I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals . 
It's not something I need to p push through , 
but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um  
Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the , I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant , 
I dunno the   
Whatever 
just some theme and then we have different tones , lime green , lemon . 
It's just discussion . 
I mean obviously we can just abandon this , 
it's fine . 
I'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do . 
Um , yep 
so there . That's all . 
Um , I think to record it and uh I haven't been asked to submit it yet . 
Yeah . 
I will , yeah . 
Huh . 
 
Yep . 
I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that . 
It's really quick . 
To use . 
Sure , 
um so what is it you're asking of me now ? 
Or sort of our work on setting this up . 
Yeah . 
Well , is it  
uh okay I'll just go through your system then . 
The the room uh is fairly institutional , 
but um the main thing is , I think um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive 
and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion , you know , 
as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity , 
whereas in reality as we've gone through this , it's not really the centre point of creativity , it's more just a 
d debating  
Yeah , yeah 
but that's just 
the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room , 
it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know . 
Oh , 
oh right right , oh right okay room for creativ 
Oh right I just looked up and saw okay whiteboard , digital pens , the room . 
No , of course , yeah . 
Sorry . 
Huh . 
Yeah . 
Yeah 
I th okay on th um yeah dif 
answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity 
because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , 
but then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours . 
So what do we do . 
We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , 
so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual  
Yeah within the constraints 
the  
Yeah . 
<other> Yeah , yeah . 
So  
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm , 
mm-hmm . 
<other> Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , sure . 
Yeah . 
New creativity . 
Yep . 
Right . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , well well I mean 
my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction , encouragement  
Yeah from  
and you as well I think , just sort of acting as team leader . 
Um yeah I think I think it's 
I think it's good . 
I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation , 
but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and 
you know , innovative thought with . 
In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your  the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a <other> quite a con confining framework to work within . 
And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so  
But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know . 
It turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism , as opposed to a sort of a free  
Yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt . 
Yeah maybe not co confining . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Um did , you wanna comment Craig ? 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Fully agree . 
<other> Yeah . 
<laugh> 
Yeah . 
Yeah , got the email . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , 
in it  
Mm-hmm , 
mm-hmm , 
mm-hmm , 
exactly . 
Yeah , 
I mean if you  
Yeah , 
I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork 
because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation 
I I don't know what you guys did while you were together , maybe that was a bit different , 
but um 
yeah , 
but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay , first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept , 
and we sit here together and do it , 
well that's what teamwork is . 
To s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other , it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork . 
Um not that we haven't done I think the best we could have done . 
I'm not dissatisfied with it . 
Mm-hmm . 
I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time , 
but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , 
maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text . 
Um , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that . 
I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype 
and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss 
and and 
and in a way everybody's  as we discuss things in the  in theoretically and out of our notebooks , 
we're just  
we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds . 
It wasn't until we had this here , you know , 
like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like , now I know what he's thinking 'cause I saw his book . 
But the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um  
Think could be , yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah , 
because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare , 
whereas I can imagine if I'd been encouraged to use Paintbrush , for example , or whatever , I would've actually used it , 
um 'ca you know , 
just 'cause that's sorta how we  what we were set up to to use while we had our time . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
No , 
not quite . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> Sure , yeah . 
Yeah . <laugh> 
Yep . 
Mm . 
Mm . 
<other> Yeah . 
Hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
Mm-hmm , 
mm-hmm , 
mm-hmm . 
<laugh> 
And o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files . 
It just occurred to me that they all  
We only actually needed one computer . 
If there had been a fifth , that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
<other> 
Mm-hmm . 
Yep . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well 
, the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other . 
So , 
that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea , 
well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team . 
Oh yeah . 
Yeah , 
yeah . 
Mm-hmm , 
mm-hmm , 
mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
Great . 
So it  
So now we  
I I don't know . 
Hmm . 
What did you call it ? 
Huh , huh . 
Logo . 
Huh . 
Mm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Fashion technology or something . 
Hmm , hmm , hmm . 
Hmm . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Hmm . 
<laugh> 
Huh . 
Huh . 
<other> Yeah . 
Yeah . 
No , it's true , yeah . 
Hmm . 
And some Play-Dohs are actually I think edible 
aren't they ? 
Wow , hmm . 
Huh . 
Yep . 
Taste . <laugh> 
<laugh> Yeah . 
Mm-hmm , 
yep . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm , 
mm-hmm , 
mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Do we retreat to our , to continue our 
r reporting or what i
