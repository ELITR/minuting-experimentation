B:  Okay we all all set ? Right . Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting . Um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . So um just from from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons , maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing , um hopefully a jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well . Anything I've missed ? Okay um so uh if you want to present your prototype go ahead . 


A:  No . 
D:  Uh-oh . This is it ? <laugh> Um , there are a few changes we've made . Um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside , so instead we've um  this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , um just a a very very basic one , very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm 
A:  Ninja Homer , made in Japan . <laugh> 
B:  Okay . Mm . Mm-hmm . 
D:  um button . Uh , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time . 
C:  Mm 'kay . 
A:  And there isn't uh d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions ? So the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use . 
C:  Where are they ? 
A:  Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ? Okay 'cause  
C:  Ah , right . Great . 
B:  So w what kind of thing uh is gonna be  
D:  <other> 
A:  The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing . If you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say  You know it's like it only has four columns , it's a very simple L_C_D_ like , whereas many  the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast . 
C:  Right . Okay . Right . 
B:  Mm-hmm . Okay cool . 
C:  Right , 'kay . 
A:  It might even be one , a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions . 
C:  Okay . Mm-hmm , and what is this here ? 
B:  Oh right okay . Cool . 
A:  That's a number pad . 
C:  Okay so the number pad is  'Kay , great . 
B:  Where are we gonna have the slogan ? 
A:  Um they're al along this  Yeah . 
D:  You know , just like right inside there . 
B:  Okay cool . 
A:  You have this space here , and then you have this thing on the side as well , or at the bottom . 
B:  <other> Okay . 
A:  'Cause slogans are usually quite small , right , they're not like huge so they're s 
C:  Mm . Yep . 
A:  Say a button's about say a button's about this size , right , so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan , say even for that . 
B:  Okay . 
C:  Looks good . Yep . <cough> Mm-hmm . 
B:  So if this isn't to scale , what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here ? 
D:  <other> Well <other> we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand .  
B:  Mm-hmm . 
C:  Okay . 
A:  Yep so that would be about a centimetre for a button , so one two three four centimetres . Plus maybe half o five 
C:  Mm-hmm . About nine in total . 
A:  six seven eight , about yeah nine total . 
B:  Six , seven , eight , nine , ten . So we're talking about ten centimetres . That would be good . So ten centimetres in height . Okay um <other> . 
C:  That sounds good . Yeah . Yep . 
A:  Nine , ten . Yep . 
C:  That'd be good , in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually , so that would be  that sounds like a really good size , if you see it there . 
B:  Yeah . That's great and it's very bright as well . So um okay . 
C:  Mm . Is it possible  uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours . Is these are these the colours that  of production , or is this just what we had available ? 
D:  Well I'm  We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button . 
C:  Right . 
D:  Um  
B:  Okay so just  could you just list all the things that it does s so I can write them in the report . 
D:  But um <other> this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh  it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal . Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen and you use this as a jog-dial . 
A:  <cough> Excuse me . 
B:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Sure . 
B:  Okay . Okay so that's like an okay button , right . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ? <laugh> 
D:  I don't know . <other> 
B:  Okay . 
C:  How high is it ? 
A:  No as in the height , but what about the width ? 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Didn't put five centimetres . 
B:  Oh oh like depth of the actual thing . 
A:  Do we need five ? I don't think five is  be about th three and a half . 
D:  Um . 
C:  Okay . 
D:  Something by there . 
B:  Oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay . So you can power on and off , what else can you do ? 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  Sure . Three and a half . 
D:  Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons . 
B:  Okay . 
D:  Um , were gonna have the volume control here , but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume . 
B:  Okay jog-dial for volume . And what else do you do with the jog-dial ? 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
D:  Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and  
B:  Contrast , brightness , yeah , and anything else ? 
D:  Um yeah . Um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , um we didn't actually go through and specify the  
B:  Well of the designers what are they ? 
D:  Uh what can a T_V_ do ? 
A:  Okay things like um brightness , contrast , um maybe tuning the channels . 
B:  Uh-huh . Okay channel tuning . That's a good one . 
A:  Um . What else ? Um the various inputs . Are you having a V_C_R_ , are you having  you know which input do you have ? 
C:  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
B:  Okay auxiliary inputs . 
C:  Mm-hmm , probably colour or sharpness . 
A:  Um . Yep , colour , sharpness . Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them . 
B:  Sharpness . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Okay what about uh sound settings ? Uh d can you change any of those at all ? 
C:  Audio . 
A:  Audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range . 
D:  Um .  the the balance hmm . 
A:  Um . Yep , left-right balance , um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes , like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes , and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting . 
B:  Okay . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  Okay , is there anything else at all it can do ? 
C:  Mm 'kay . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  That  'cause that's that's fine . Just need to know so I can write it down . Okay um right I g I guess that's it , 




B:  Um right , uh well next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation . 
A:  'Kay I'm I'm listening I'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing , so I'm playing with the Play-Doh as well . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh right , okay . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Just in case you're wondering <laugh> , why is he still playing with the Play-Doh ? <laugh> 
C:  Huh . 
A:  Just about right L_E_G_O_ Lego <laugh> .  
D:  <laugh> My leg . <laugh> 
B:  Right , okay . Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and <other>  or not those four points , my four points , sorry , forgotten that . <other> You got a different uh  
C:   
A:  <other> 
B:   
C:  Yep . I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that . It's really quick . 
B:  Oh yeah , they're good aren't they , yeah . 


B:  Um so in closing , I haven't got my five minutes to go . Thin Oh there it i Five minutes to go . <other> <laugh> Wonderful . Okay um are the costs within the budget , yes they are . And is the project evaluated , yes it is . So now celebrate <sound imitating celebratory noise> . 
D:  <laugh> <laugh> 
C:  Great . So it  
A:  And we have Ninja Homer . 
C:  So now we  
D:  Oh yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Well apparently now I write the final report . What are you guys doing now ? 
D:  Do we know what the other ones are ? 
C:  I I don't know . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  You dunno ? 
D:  Oh wow . <laugh> 
C:  Hmm . 
B:  That is lovely . <laugh> 
D:  Hey yeah , I said Ninja Homer . <laugh> 
C:  What did you call it ? 
A:  Ninja Homer . See it looks like Homer Simpson 
C:  Huh , huh . Logo . 
A:  but it's electronic so it's made in Japan . <laugh> Yeah it's just a logo . 
B:  So is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything ? Just a logo and then like Ninja Homer , right okay . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Huh . 
A:  Ninja Homer . <laugh> 
C:  Mm . 
A:  The the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
B:  I think it's quite nice . 
C:  Fashion technology or something . 
B:   
A:  You can wear Homer , you can throw Homer when you're frustrated , doh . <laugh> 
C:  Hmm , hmm , hmm . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh no , that's cool , it's got  I'm kind of  I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber , I think that would have been nice . 
C:  Hmm . 
A:  It's clunky . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  <other> Ah well , maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money . 
C:  Mm-hmm . 
A:  Oh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful . No it is it is . It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative . 'Cause like you say , it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for . Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else . You might wanna write that down . It's just , I'm just fiddling with the Play-Doh , and I'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool . 
C:  Hmm . <laugh> 
B:  Play-Doh s 
C:  Huh . Huh . 
B:  Really ? 
C:  <other> Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Did they ? 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Okay . Play-Doh . 
C:  No , it's true , yeah .

C:  Hmm . 
B:  Yeah , it smells funny doesn't it . Um  
C:  And some Play-Dohs are actually I think edible aren't they ? 
A:  No , all Play-Doh is edible . 
B:  Yeah like the stuff for   I think it has to be , yeah . 
D:  I think they're all non-toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two-year-olds . 
A:  It's just wheat , it's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh  
C:  Wow , hmm . 
B:  Yeah um so to wha what are your summarising words about Play-Doh ? 
A:  It's helpful to the creative process . Um it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch . And it helps you to understand 
C:  Huh . 
B:  Okay . 
C:  Yep . Taste . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> dimension as well . I think that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up , whereas on a piece of paper , on a computer , on a board , um even with a three D_ graphic thing it still , it requires a lot of yeah  tangible , that's a nice word . It becomes tangible . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Mm-hmm , yep . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah it's not very tangible . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm-hmm .

A:  I think we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate . 
B:  Um  
C:  r reporting or what i 
B:  Well I dunno . Um I'm sure the little uh the little thing'll pop up any minute now .
