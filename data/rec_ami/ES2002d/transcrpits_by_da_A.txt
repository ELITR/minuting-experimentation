No . 
Ninja Homer , made in Japan . <laugh> 
And there isn't uh d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions ? 
the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use . 
Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ? 
Okay 'cause  
The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing . 
If you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say  
You know it's like 
it only has four columns , it's a very simple L_C_D_ like , 
whereas many  the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast . 
It might even be one , a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions . 
That's a number pad . 
Um they're al along this  
Yeah . 
You have this space here , 
and then you have this thing on the side as well , or at the bottom . 
'Cause slogans are usually quite small , right , 
they're not like huge 
so they're s 
Say a button's about 
say a button's about this size , right , 
so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan , say even for that . 
Yep 
so that would be about a centimetre for a button , 
so one two three four centimetres . 
Plus maybe half o five 
six seven eight , 
about yeah nine total . 
Nine , ten . 
Yep . 
<cough> Excuse me . 
Sure . 
Oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ? <laugh> 
No as in the height , but what about the width ? 
Do we need five ? 
I don't think five is  
be about th three and a half . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Okay things like um brightness , contrast , 
um maybe tuning the channels . 
Um . 
What else ? 
Um the various inputs . 
Are you having a V_C_R_ , are you having  you know which input do you have ? 
Um . 
Yep , 
colour , sharpness . 
Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them . 
Audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range . 
Um . 
Yep , 
left-right balance , 
um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes , 
like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes , 
and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting . 
Yeah . 
The battery . 
No . 
Um . 
We need an  
Yep . 
Yeah advanced chip . 
We need an advanced chip I think , yep . 
Let me just confirm that . 
Yes I think so . 
Yep . 
Yeah . 
Yep . 
Plastic . 
I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber . 
Um . 
Yep . 
For the case itself , one colour . It's one special colour . 
'Cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it . 
Yes . 
One and the L_C_ display . 
How many  
We've got push buttons as well . 
Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one . 
Okay um 
and maybe a special colour for the buttons , so maybe four again . 
'Cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons . 
So we're just estimating that yeah it would be less . 
No . 
Yep . 
Yep . 
<laugh> 
How much would that save us ? 
That will only save you one . 
The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together , 
um because when you 
do something on the T_V_ , the T_V_ responds and reacts as well , 
so the user could be looking at the T_V_ and pushing his thing 
so we may not need to  
so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond , 
which I think is a technically doable thing so  
<other> 
Yep . 
And the advanced chip goes away as well . 
Regular chip . 
Yep . 
So what that means is that um  
The twelve buttons that you see there <laugh> . 
Functionally you're gonna have to intercept  
So four is a good estimate for  
Yeah , 
so you can't actually cut <laugh>  
It's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve . 
It  It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel . 
We just report that it has to be over budget <laugh> , 
or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons . 
Normal coloured buttons . 
No that's not the button we're talking about . 
That's  
the buttons only refer to the pad so  
Should we take that off uh ? 
Hey it's back to the original . 
Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons , 
so that might be some some way of cutting the cost . 
Yeah . 
<laugh> 
What do you mean by profile ? 
No . 
We didn't have enough Play-Doh to make it three D_ . <laugh> 
So there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add , 
and you might want to add in the report , 
length , width , and height . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Two . 
This is about this is about two . 
Slightly more than two , so  
Okay . 
I think that's something that's very hard to catch , 
so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something . 
The the look and the colour is something which is cool , 
but I think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar 
then um  because when you put it on the shelf  
Yeah 
button shape might be a good idea to change , rather than rather than positioning , 
'cause I think positioning is  we're kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of 
pad . 
Maybe we should do the design evaluation first . 
I don't think you need the power , 
so  <laugh> 
No , that's okay that's okay . 
No , the power cord itself . 
Yeah , 
so then you have a bit more freedom to  
You you still have your blue fingers . 
You killed a monster . 
I rate that pretty highly . 
Yep I'm fine with that . 
It's one to seven , right ? 
Wait , 
what's the scale , one to seven , right ? 
Okay , 
it's upside-down . 
<laugh> 
Say it's more 
medium , 
but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing . 
Yep . 
<laugh> 
Lemon . 
Okay , the blue the blue colours and  don't re don't actually represent the colour , 
except for the b the the red button , 
they  because for want of a  
Yeah , 
the the yellow is more representative of the colour , 
but the button itself , the blue can be anything else . 
Yep , that's fine . 
Yeah , 
company logo . 
I think it'll be cost prohibitive , 
yeah . 
Yep . 
<other> The cameras did . <laugh> 
Yep . 
It keeps getting too big . 
'Kay I'm I'm listening 
I'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing , so I'm playing with the Play-Doh as well . 
Just in case you're wondering <laugh> , why is he still playing with the Play-Doh ? <laugh> 
Just about right 
L_E_G_O_ Lego <laugh> .  
<other> 
You feel like you're caged within whatever y 
It's like a balloon in a cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side . 
The constraints do come in very fast . 
Yeah . 
I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , 
so time is also a very s um strong factor , and structure . 
Because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to  allows ideas to get tossed , um to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back . 
And I guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that , I think that's a very big thing , 
and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts  
I feel it 'cause I wear m my glasses , right , and that but that irritates me right 
it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate . 
I feel like I'm hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and you know . 
Not not so much an atmosphere , 
the atmosphere is very relaxed , 
but the the gear 
yeah 
you know that creates boundaries to that um 
and and the time the time given also restricts  
<other> 
<cough> 
<cough> Excuse me . 
<cough> 
<cough> 
I think controlling is not the right word , 
I think the interactions are very structured . 
I think structure is probably what you're saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling . 
I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it , 
but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way . 
It doesn't tell you , you know , some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know , not the  
I think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate , 
but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email 
um it it doesn't have a , you know , a messenger will go <sound imitating an alarm> . 
Yeah . 
Okay . 
I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word . 
They don't support the team working together , you know , 
they're still very individual tools . 
We had Play-Doh fun <laugh> . 
No , not really . 
I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard , 
and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think . 
It will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the PowerPoint , 
or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place , 
you know in the centre of the  
I think that there were too many PowerPoints in the meetings <laugh> . 
'Cause the plug-in and the plugging spent  we spent a lot of time doing that . 
And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually  it could have , we could have gone through it  verbally , 
especially my slides , 
I felt that they just you know  
as opposed to having to present them . 
<laugh> Yep clunky . 
Agreed . <laugh> 
Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well , 
'cause you're half way through a thought , and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump . 
But I think the pen is v is very intuitive , 
everybody knows how to use it , 
we don't  have to worry . 
So I think the pen's good . 
It's about the best thing . <laugh> 
Yeah 
we only needed one computer and  
And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , you know , 
it's useful but  
I think too many computers are just distracting . 
Um  
Yep . 
And we have Ninja Homer . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Ninja Homer . 
See it looks like Homer Simpson 
but it's electronic so it's made in Japan . 
<laugh> Yeah it's just a logo . 
Ninja Homer . <laugh> 
The the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it . 
You can wear Homer , 
you can throw Homer when you're frustrated , doh . <laugh> 
It's clunky . 
Oh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful . 
No it is it is . 
It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative . 
'Cause like you say , it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for . 
Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else . 
You might wanna write that down . 
It's just , I'm just fiddling with the Play-Doh , and I'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool . 
No , all Play-Doh is edible . 
It's just wheat , 
it's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh  
It's helpful to the creative process . 
Um it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch . 
And it helps you to understand 
<other> 
dimension as well . 
I think that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up , 
whereas on a piece of paper , on a computer , on a board , um even with a three D_ graphic thing it still , it requires a lot of 
yeah  tangible , that's a nice word . 
It becomes tangible . 
<other> 
Nope . 
I think we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate . 
Can we turn off the microphones ?
