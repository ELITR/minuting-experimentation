B:  batteries ? 
B:  Ah . 
B:  Ah , yeah . 
B:  Uh , do you want @ @ . 
B:  Yes , I can s 
B:  I would like to say that , for example , um , mmm , if we doesn't use the delta - delta , uh we have an improve when we use s some combination . 
B:  But when 
B:  w Yeah , this  Yeah , this number recognition acc 
B:  Yes , and the baseline  the baseline have  i is eighty - two . 
B:  Yeah 
B:  Yeah , by the moment . 
B:  And first in the experiment - one I  I do  I  I use different MLP , 
B:  and is obviously that the multi - English MLP is the better . 
B:  Um . for the ne  rest of experiment I use multi - English , 
B:  only multi - English . 
B:  And I try to combine different type of feature , 
B:  but the result is that the MSG - three feature doesn't work for the Italian database 
B:  because never help to increase the accuracy . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  The train the training of the HTK ? 
B:  Yes . 
B:  Ah yes ! 
B:  This h 
B:  Yes . 
B:  Th - Yes . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Uh  yes ? 
B:  Another table . 
B:  No . 
B:  Eighty . 
B:  Eighty . 
B:  It 's plus six . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , 
B:  yeah yeah yeah yeah , 
B:  at the first  and the  
B:  Yeah . 

B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yes , better . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Nnn , we don't know exactly . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  We select these  these  these tasks 
B:  because it 's the more difficult . 
B:  You have here the information . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  The Spanish . 
B:  Maybe for that . 
B:  Um . 
B:  Mmm , with the experiment type - two , 
B:  I  first I tried to to combine , nnn , some feature from the MLP and other feature  
B:  another feature . 
B:  And we s we can  
B:  first the feature are without delta and delta - delta , 
B:  and we can see that in the situation , uh , the MSG - three , the same help nothing . 
B:  And then I do the same 
B:  but with the delta and delta - delta  PLP delta and delta - delta . 
B:  And they all p but they all put off the MLP is it without delta and delta - delta . 
B:  And we have a l little bit less result than the  the  the baseline PLP with delta and delta - delta . 
B:  Maybe if  when we have the new  the new  neural network trained with PLP delta and delta - delta , 
B:  maybe the final result must be better . 
B:  I don't know . 
B:  Uh  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yes . 
B:  No , but they  they feature @ @ without  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  But  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  But  I don't know  
B:  but maybe if we have the neural network trained with the PLP  delta and delta - delta , maybe tha this can help . 
B:  And , with this type of configuration which I do on experiment using the new neural net with name broad klatt s twenty - seven , 
B:  uh , d I have found more or less the same result . 
B:  Little bit better ? 
B:  Slightly bet better . 
B:  Yes , is better . 
B:  Yeah , maybe . Maybe . Maybe . 
B:  Oh , yeah . 

B:  Oh , yeah . 
B:  i 
B:  Yeah , 
B:  and we have only forty  forty feature 
B:  because in this situation we have one hundred and three feature . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  And then w with the first configuration , I f I am found that work , uh , doesn't work  
B:  uh , well , work , 
B:  but is better , the second configuration . 
B:  Because I  for the del Engli - PLP delta and delta - delta , here I have eighty - five point three accuracy , 
B:  and with the second configuration I have eighty - seven point one . 
B:  Maybe . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  so this is what we decided to do . 
B:  do ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Ah , yes . 
B:  I say this morning that @ @ thought it was the  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Maybe , may  
B:  No ? 
B:  With the better  
B:  No ? 
B:  Oh ! 
B:  Yeah , yeah , yeah ! 
B:  With " two " , with " on - line - two " . 
B:  Yeah , yeah , 
B:  yeah . Yep , 
B:  it 's a good . 
B:  Well , actually , it 's good with the ch with the good . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Um . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm , no . 
B:  Yeah . 

B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Sunil ? 
B:  I  I don't re I didn't remember . 
B:  Maybe he 's working with  neural network . 
B:  Yeah , I think so . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 

B:  Yeah . 
B:  to work 
B:  Some problems with the  
B:  You know . 
B:  batteries ?
