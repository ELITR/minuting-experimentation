D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . 
D:  And , one of the things that last week , 
D:  eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff 
D:  because the signal have different level of energy . 
D:  And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to  to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS . 
D:  But then <breath-laugh> we decided that that 's  it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise . 
D:  And  
D:  Well , thinking about that , we  we then  we decide that maybe is a good idea . 
D:  We don't know . 
D:  I don't hav 
D:  I don't  
D:  this is  
D:  I didn't  do the experiment yet  to apply VTS in cepstral domain . 
D:  Uh . 
D:  Well , we s decide to m to  to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . 
D:  And  
D:  Well . I am working in that now , 
D:  but <laugh> I 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful . 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  It 's k it 's k 
D:  It 's quite a lot  It 's a lot of work . 
D:  Well , it 's not too much , 
D:  but this  it 's work . 
D:  And I want to know if  if we have some  feeling that  the result  
D:  I  I would like to know if  
D:  I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel  in filter bank domain . 
D:  I r I 'm not sure . 
D:  I don't  I don't know absolutely nothing . 
D:  Yeah ? 
D:  To have better  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Ye 
D:  Yea 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  We  
D:  I was thinking to  to  to estimate the noise  with the first frames 
D:  and then apply the VAD , 
D:  before the on - line normalization . 
D:  We  we see  
D:  Well , 
D:  I am thinking <laugh> about that and working about that , 
D:  but I don't have result this week . 
D:  Mm - hmm .
