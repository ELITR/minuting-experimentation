F:  That 's  
F:  Well , better hurry up then ! 
F:  OK . 
F:  Oh , you 've got the parser done . 
F:  Sorry .

F:  Oh really . 
F:  Interesting . 
F:  Oh , it 's pretty slow . 
F:  The system breaking . 
F:  Yeah , that looks familiar . 
F:  Oh ! Oh boy ! 
F:  That 's brilliant ! 
F:  Hhh . 
F:  And everybody gets a trampoline in their office . 
F:  Alright , let 's stop talking about this . 
F:  You might want to , uh , double - check the spellings of the authors ' names on your references , 
F:  you had a few , uh , misspells in your slides , there . 
F:  Like I believe you had " Jackendorf " . 
F:  Uh , unless there 's a person called " Jackendorf " , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  But that 's the only thing I noticed in there . 
F:  In the presentation . 
F:  Yeah .

F:  He slipped on the wet floor . 
F:  Depends . 
F:  Sudden surprising contact , 
F:  right ? 
F:  But of course , no ,

F:  It 's sort of partially inspired by the spatial  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . Right . 
F:  In other news . 
F:  Out of  out of film , in particular . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  It 's  
F:  yeah , I mean , 
F:  but  
F:  and plus the fact that there 's also s 
F:  I mean , can you say , like , " The film ran out " 
F:  you know , 
F:  or , maybe you could say something like " The film is out " 
F:  so like the  the film went away from where it should be , 
F:  namely with you , or something , 
F:  right ? 
F:  You know . 
F:  The  the film  the film is gone , 
F:  right ? 
F:  Um , 
F:  I never really knew what was going on , 
F:  I mean I  I find it sort of a little bit farfetched to say that  that " I 'm out of film " means that I have left the state of having film or something like that , 
F:  but . 
F:  Yeah . Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  You got there . 
F:  You got to out of it .

F:  figuring that out is what this is about . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  O 
F:  Uh , yeah . 
F:  Like what side were they on , 
F:  or  ? 
F:  I mean , there 's also things like  I mean , s 
F:  um , 
F:  I guess I could ask something like " Where can I find out about blah - blah - blah " 
F:  in a sort of  
F:  doesn't nece I don't necessarily have to care about the spatial location , 
F:  just give me a phone number 
F:  and I 'll call them or something like that ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah .
