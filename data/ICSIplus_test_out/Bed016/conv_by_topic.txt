E:  I , uh , had some communications with him 
A:  Ah , so comfortable . 
F:  Smooth . 
E:  yesterday or the day before . So , he doesn't plan on coming real soon , but he is taking 
F:  <breath> 
E:  sabbatical <door slams> this year and so he 'll probably come for six weeks at some point . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Good . 
A:  I know that he 's going to like , Taiwan and other places to eat . So . 
E:  @ @ Right . 
G:  Everyone  So are your microphones on ? Make sure to turn the batteries  the switch on . Everybody ? 
D:  On ? Am I on ? I think I 'm on ? Good . Good .  
A:  Yep . Yep . Bye . 
B:  Yeah . 
G:  OK . Great . Thanks very much . 
B:  Actually  
A:  <long breath in and out> 
F:  I just had one of the most frustrating meetings of my career . <laugh> 
A:  It 's definitely not the most frustrating meeting I 've ever had . <laugh> 
D:  You a 
D:  You 're  you remember you 're being recorded at this point . 
F:  Yeah . <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh , yeah , so , w we didn't yet specify with whom . But um . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Right . 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  Uh , right . Uh . 
A:  So that 's why Keith and I are going to be a little dazed for the first half m the meeting . 
F:  Huh . 
F:  Yeah , I 'm just gonna sit here and 
E:  Right . Yeah , I  
F:  growl . 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  I  I avoided that as long as I could for you guys , but , uh  
F:  <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm . <sigh> 
F:  For which we thank you , by the way . <laugh> I know you were  you were doing that , but , anyway . 
A:  Are very appreciative , yeah .  
E:  Right . 
D:  Oh yeah , how di how d exactly did , uh , that paper lead to anti - lock brakes ? 
F:  Oh , I could tell you had a rough day , man ! <laugh> 
D:  Nah . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  What ? 
D:  <laugh> I love that story . <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , <laugh> it 's a great story . 
C:  OK . 
F:  <clears throat> 
F:  Oh my goodness .  
C:  Oh yeah , um , Liz suggested we could start off by uh , doing the digits all at the same time . 
A:  What ? 
D:  All at the same time . I don't know if  I would get distracted and confused , probably . 
E:  e 
A:  Really ? Do we have to like , synchronize ? 
E:  Well , I think you 're supposed to  OK . We can do this . Everybody 's got different digits , right ? 
F:  Are you being silly ? 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh wait do we have t 
F:  Uh .  
C:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah , do we have to time them at the same time or just overlapping  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  You 're kidding . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  No . 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  No , no , just  just start whenever you want . 
A:  <laugh> And any rate ? 
E:  e yeah , the 
F:  Alright . 
E:  Well , they  they have s they have the close talking microphones for each of us , so  
A:  Yeah , that 's true . <outbreath> 
F:  Alright . 
E:  yeah , there 's separate channels . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
E:  So when I say 
F:  Just plug one ear . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  You lose . <laugh> 
E:  OK . 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  OK , bye ! <laugh> That was a great meeting ! 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Right .  
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> So - <laugh> 
F:  Now , uh , why ? <laugh>  
D:  Alright . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Just to save time . 
F:  OK . 
C:  Does matter for them . 
F:  <cough> 
A:  Are we gonna start all our meetings out that way from now on ? <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  No . 
A:  Oh . Too bad . I kinda like it . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  Well , could we ? <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  It 's strangely satisfying . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . It 's a ritual .

D:  Are we to r Just to make sure I know what 's going on , we 're talking about Robert 's thesis proposal today ? Is that  
C:  We could . 
D:  true ? 
B:  <clears throat> 
A:  We are ? 
C:  We might . 
E:  Well , you  you had s you said there were two things that you might wanna do . One was rehearse your i i talk  
A:  OK . 
D:  Is  
D:  Oh yes , and that too . 
C:  Not  not rehearse , I mean , I have just not spent any time on it , so I can show you what I 've got , get your input on it , and maybe some suggestions , that would be great . 
C:  And the same is true for the proposal . 
C:  I will have time to do some revision and some additional stuff on various airplanes and trains . So , 
C:  um . 
C:  I don't know how 
C:  much of a chance you had to actually read it because  
B:  <sneeze> 
A:  I haven't looked at it 
A:  yet , 
C:  but you could always send me comments per electronic mail 
A:  but I will . 
A:  <clears throat> 
B:  <cough> 
C:  and they will be incorporated . 
A:  OK . 
C:  Um , <clears throat> the  
F:  <breath> 
A:  <mouth> <breath> 
D:  <breath> 
E:  Anyway ! Enough of that , let 's talk about your thesis proposal . 
C:  Yeah , if somebody has something to say . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  anything else you want to ask us about 
C:  <inbreath> <clears throat> Well , 
E:  the thesis proposal , you got  
E:  We could look at a particular thing and give you feedback on it . 
C:  Well there  actually  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  OK . So why don't we plan to give you feedback electronically . 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Wish you a good trip . 
E:  All success . 


C:  It basically says , well 
C:  " this is construal " , and then it continues to say that one could potentially build a probabilistic relational model that has some general , domain - general rules 
A:  <clears throat> 
C:  how things are construed , and then the idea is to use ontology , situation , user , and 
A:  <clears throat> 
C:  discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational model  to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what 
B:  <cough> 
A:  Hmm . 
C:  in our beloved tourism domain . 
C:  But , with a focus on @ @  


A:  Can I s  
C:  <laugh> 
F:  I think I need a copy of this , yes . <laugh> I is there an extra copy around ? 
A:  Sorry . 
C:  Hmm ? 
D:  OK , we can  we can  we can pass  pass my , uh  we can pass my extra copy around . Er , actually , my only copy , now that I think about it , but . I already read half of it , so it 's OK . 
A:  Uh . He sent it . 
A:  OK . You can keep it . 
F:  Alrigh - 
C:  Um , I don't  I , uh  I don't need it . Um , actually this is the  the newest version after your comments , and  
A:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
E:  Yeah , no I s I s I see this has got the castle in it , and stuff like that . Yep . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh , maybe the version I didn't have 
D:  that I  mine  the w did the one you sent on the email 
D:  have the  
E:  Yeah . 
D:  That was the most recent one ? 
E:  Uh , yeah , I think so . 
D:  OK . 
C:  Yep . 
D:  Cuz I read halfway but I didn't see a castle thing . 
A:  I 'm changing this .  
A:  Just so you know .  But , anyway . 
C:  Yeah , um , if you would have checked your email you may have received a note from Yees asking you to send me the , uh , up - to - d 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Oh , sorry . 
A:  OK .  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Sorry . 
C:  current formalism thing that you presented . 
A:  OK . I will . OK . OK . 
A:  OK . 
C:  But for this it doesn't matter . But , uh  
C:  <pages turning> Hmm !  
A:  <inbreath> We can talk about it later . <mike noise> 
A:  That 's not even ready , so . Um , OK ! Go on t to , uh , whatever . 
C:  And  
A:  I 'm making changes . " Don't worry about that . " OK . Mmm - mmm .  
A:  Oh ! OK , sorry , go on . <clears throat> 
C:  And any type of comment whether it 's a spelling or a syntax or 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  There 's only one " S " in " interesting " . 
C:  readability  
F:  <laugh> There 's only one " S " in " interesting " . On page five . 
C:  Hmm ? 
C:  Interesting . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Anyway . 
A:  And y uh , email any time , but most usefully before   
D:  The twenty - first I 'm assuming .  
A:  The twenty - first ? 
C:  Twenty - ninth . 
E:  No , this is the twenty - first . 
F:  That 's  
D:  What , today 's the twenty - first ? Oh , man ! 
F:  Well , better hurry up then ! 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  The twenty - ninth . 
A:  Before the twenty - ninth , OK . 
D:  OK . 
C:  That 's when I 'm meeting with Wolfgang Wahlster to 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  sell him this idea . 
A:  OK . 
C:  OK ? 


C:  Then I 'm also going to present a little talk at EML , 
A:  <clears throat> 
C:  about 
C:  what we have done here 
C:  and 
C:  so 
C:  of course , I 'm  I 'm gonna start out with this slide , so the most relevant aspects of our stay here , and um , 
A:  <clears throat> 
F:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  then I 'm 
C:  asking them to imagine that they 're standing somewhere in Heidelberg and someone asks them 
C:  in the morning  The Cave Forty - Five is a  is a well - known discotheque which is certainly not open at that  that time . 
F:  OK . 
C:  And so 
C:  they 're supposed to imagine that , you know , 
A:  <clears throat> 
C:  do they think the person wants to go there , or just know where it is ? Uh , 
C:  which is probably not , uh , the case 
C:  in that discotheque example , or in the Bavaria example , you just want to know where it is . 
C:  And so forth . So basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge but if it 's nine  nine PM in the evening then the discotheque question would be , for example , 
A:  <clears throat> 
C:  one that might ask for directions instead of just location . 
C:  <long inbreath> 
C:  Um , <outbreath> and so forth and so forth . That 's sort of motivating it . 
C:  Then what have we done so far ? We had our little bit of , um , 
C:  um , SmartKom stuff , that we did ,  
C:  um , everth 
F:  Oh , you 've got the parser done . <laugh> 
F:  Sorry . <laugh> 
C:  That 's the  not the construction parser . That 's the , uh , tablet - based parser , and 
F:  OK . 
A:  Easy parser . 
F:  OK . 
C:  the generation outputter . <tongue click>  
D:  Halfway done ? Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  That 's done . You have to change those strategies , right ? That 's , ten words ? 
A:  Mmm . <clears throat> <sniff> 
D:  OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , i it , you know . 
D:  Maybe twelve . 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  Twelve ? OK . 
C:  <inbreath> And , um , and Fey is doing the synthesis stuff as we speak . 
A:  <clears throat> 
C:  Um , I will talk about our problems with the rephrasing , and how we solved it , and some preliminary observations , also , um , 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  <sniff> 
C:  I 'm not gonna put in the figures from Liz , but I thought it would interesting to , uh , 
C:  um , point out that it 's basically the same . 
C:  Um , as in every human - human telephone conversation , and the human - computer telephone conversation is of course quite d 
C:  quite different from , uh , some first , uh , 
C:  observations . 
C:  Then 
C:  sort of feed you back to our original problem cuz , uh  
C:  how to get there , what 
C:  actually is happening 
C:  there today , 
C:  and then maybe talk about the big picture here , e tell a little bit  as much as I  can about the NTL story . 
C:  I  I wa I do wanna , um  
C:  I 'm not quite sure about this , whether I should put this in , 
C:  um , that , you know , you have these two sort of different ideas that are  or two different camps 
C:  of people envisioning how language understanding works , 
C:  and then , <outbreath> 
C:  talk a bit about the embodied and simulation approach favored here and as a prelude , 
C:  I 'll talk about monkeys in Italy . 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  And , um , Srini was gonna send me some slides but he didn't do it , so from  but I have the paper , I can 
C:  make a resume of that , and then I stole an X - schema from one of your talks I think . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  I was like , " where 'd you get that ? " OK . <laugh> " Looks familiar . " 
F:  Yeah , that looks familiar . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  I think that 's Bergen , Chang , something , or the other . 
A:  Uh . 
E:  Whatever . 
A:  OK . 
C:  Um , and that 's  now I 'm not going to bring that . So that 's basically what I have , so far , and the rest is for airplanes . 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  So X - schemas , then , I would like to do  talk about the construction aspect and then at the end about our Bayes - net . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  End of story . 


C:  That 's all about that . Then I 'm going to talk about the data , you know these things about  uh , actually I have an example , 
C:  probably . 
H:   Where is a nightclub ? 
C:  Two s 
C:  Can you hear that ? Or should I turn the l volume on . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  I could hear it . 
D:  I I can hear it . 
F:  I heard it . 
D:  They might not hear it in the  
D:  well maybe they will . I don't know . 
H:  Where is a nightclub ? 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  This was an actual , um , subject ? Ah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Sounds like Fey . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  But they 're  they 're mimicking the synthesis when they speak to the computer , the  you can observe that all the time , they 're trying to match their prosody onto the 
F:  Oh , OK . 
F:  Oh really . 
F:  Interesting . 
C:  machine . 
J:  A popular disco is the Young Ganz . 
F:  Oh , it 's pretty slow . 
H:  Where is it ? 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , you have to  
J:  In order to get there take bus number forty - two towards the @ @ and exit at the birdband . 
H:  OK . 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  Wh - 
F:  The system breaking . 
A:  What is the s ? Oh ! 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
H:  Hello ? Hello ? 
I:  I 'm sorry . Something seems to have gone wrong with our system . So , I 'm going to have to take over from here . What can I help you with ? 
H:  Uh . I 'm looking for the University . 
I:  OK . @ @ I can get the address , or if you know where you are , I can tell you how to get there . 
H:  The address would be fine . 
A:  <sniff> 
I:  It 's at the Hauptstrasse and @ @ gasse . 
H:  Is that anywhere near the castle ? @ @ 
C:  OK . And so forth and so forth . 


C:  Anything I forgot that we should mention ? 
A:  <clears throat> <sniff> 
C:  <breath> 
D:  <breath> 
E:  <tongue click>  
E:   <mouth> <inbreath> 
E:  central . What 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  It 's  it 's certainly related , um , 


C:  Oh , maybe the FMRI stuff . Should I mention the fact that , um , we 're also actually started  going to start to look at people 's brains in a more direct way ? 
E:  You certainly can . I mean I y I you know , I don't know  
A:  You might just wanna like , tack that on , as a comment , 
E:  Right , um . 
A:  to something . 
C:  " Future activities " something . 
E:  Well , the time to mention it , if you mention it , is when you talk about mirror neurons , 
E:  then you should talk about the more recent stuff , about the kicking and , you know , the  yeah , yeah  and  that the plan is to see to what extent 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  the  you 'll get the same phenomena with stories about this , so that  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  and that we 're planning to do this , um , 
E:  which , we are . 
E:  So that 's one thing . Um . 


E:  Depends . I mean , there is 
E:  a , um , whole language learning story , 
E:  OK ?  which , 
C:  Yeah . <outbreath> 
E:  uh , actually , i i 
E:  even on your five - layer slide , you  you 've got an old one that  that leaves that off . 
C:  Yeah , I  I  I do have it here . 
A:  Hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  Um . 
C:  And , of course , you know , the  the big picture is this bit . But , you know , it would  
E:  Right . 
C:  But I don't think I  I am capable of  of do pulling this off and doing justice to the matter . 
C:  I mean , there is interesting stuff in her terms of how language works , so the emergentism 
C:  story would be nice to be  you know , it would be nice to tell people how  what 's happening there , plus how the , uh , language learning 
A:  <clears throat> <sniff> 
C:  stuff works , but  
E:  OK , so , so anyway , I  I agree that 's not 


E:  you might wanna do 
E:  is , um , 
E:  and may not , but you might wanna  this is  rip off a bunch of the slides on the 
E:  anal there  the  there  we 've got various i generations of slides that show language analysis , and matching to the underlying image schemas , and , 
E:  um , how the construction and simulation  that ho that whole th 
C:  Yeah , th that  that 's c that comes up to the X - schema slide , so basically I 'm gonna steal that from Nancy , one of Nancy 's st 
A:  OK , right . 
A:  OK , I can give you a more recent  if you want  well , that might have enough . 
C:  Uh , I  yeah , but I also have stuff you  trash you left over , your quals and your triple - AI . 
E:  OK . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  The quals w the  the  the quals slides would be fine . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  You could get it out of there , or some 
A:  Which I can even email you then , you know , like there probably was a little  few changes , not a big deal . 
A:  Yeah , you could steal anything you want , I don't care . 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  Which you 've already done , obviously . So . <laugh>  
C:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> <mike noise> 
A:  Sorry  
C:  Well , I  I don't feel bad about it at all because  because you are on the , uh , title . I mean on the  the , you 're  that 's  see , that 's you . 
A:  No , you shouldn't . 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh , that 's great , that 's great . I 'm glad to see propagation . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Hmm ? 
A:  Mmm . 
C:  Propagated ?  
A:  Yes . <laugh> That 's great . <clears throat> 


C:  I mean I might even mention that this work you 're doing is sort of also with the MPI in Leipzig , so . 
C:  Uh , as a model . 
A:  They are w now building it ? 
A:  Hmm . 
C:  But I th 
E:  So , yeah , I think that 's  that 's a good point , th th that the date , the , uh , 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  a lot of the  this is interacting with , 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  uh , people in Italy but also definitely the people in Leipzig 
A:  <clears throat> 
E:  and 
E:  the  
E:  the b the combination of the biology and the Leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys , yeah . 
E:  OK .  
E:  OK . 


C:  Because , um , EML is building up a huge thing in Leipzig . 
A:  might wanna say . 
A:  <sniff> 
A:  <sniff> 
A:  Is it ? 
C:  So it  
C:  It 's on biocomputation . Would  
E:  Yeah , it 's different , this is the , uh , DNA building , or someth the double helix building . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Kind of a different level of analysis . <laugh>  
E:  The  yeah it was  it turns out that if  if you have multiple billions of dollars , 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  y you can do 
E:  all sorts of weird things , and  
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Wait , they 're building a 
A:  What ? 
D:  building in the shape of DNA , is that what you said ? 
E:  Roughly , yeah . 
F:  Oh ! Oh boy !  
E:  Including cr cross - bridges , and 
A:  O 
A:  What ? 
F:  That 's brilliant !  
A:  Oh my god !  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  Hhh .   Oy .  
E:  You d you really  now I I spent  the last time I was there I spent maybe two hours hearing this story 
E:  which is , um  
A:  Of 
D:  Y You definitely wanna w don't wanna waste that money on research , you know ? 
A:  what the building ? 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Right . 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  That 's horrible . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  Right . 
E:  Well , no , no , y 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  i there 's infinite money . See you th you th you then fill it with researchers . 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  And give them more money . They just want a fun place for them to  to work . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Right . 
F:  And everybody gets a trampoline in their office . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Well , the  the offices are actually a little  the , think of um , ramps , coming out of the double helix and then you have these half - domes , glass half - domes , and the offices are in  in the glass half - dome . 
F:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  Really ? 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <cough-laugh> 
F:  Alright , let 's stop talking about this . <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  Does it exist yet ? 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 


F:  You might want to , uh , double - check the spellings of the authors ' names on your references , you had a few , uh , 
F:  misspells in your slides , there . Like I believe you had " Jackendorf " . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Um . 
F:  Uh , unless there 's a person called " Jackendorf " , yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  No , no , no . 
A:  On that one ? 
F:  But that 's the only thing I noticed in there . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  In the presentation ? 
F:  In the presentation . 
A:  I 'll probably  I c might have  I 'll probably have comments for you separately , not important . Anyway . 
C:  Oh , in the presentation here . I was ac actually worried about bibtex . Uh . No , that 's quite possible . 
A:  Yeah , that 's what he was talking about . 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  That 's copy and paste from 
C:  something . 
F:  <yawn> 
A:  <sniff> 


E:  So I did note i i it looks like the , uh , metaphor didn't get in yet . 
A:  <clears throat> 
C:  <clears throat> Uh , it did , there is a reference to Srini  
E:  Well , s reference is one thing , the question is is there any place  Oh , did you put in something about , 
A:  Metonymy and metaphor here , right ? 
E:  uh , the individual , 
E:  we 'd talked about putting in something 
E:  about people had , 
E:  uh  Oh yeah , OK . 
E:  Good . I see where you have it . 
E:  So the top of the second  of pa page two you have a sentence . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  But , 
E:  what I meant is , 
F:  <sniff> 
E:  I think even before you give this , 
A:  <clears throat> 
E:  to Wahlster , 
E:  uh , you should , 
F:  <series of tongue clicks>  
A:  <click> 
E:  unless you put it in the text , and I don't think it 's there yet ,  about  we talked about is the , um , scalability that you get by , um , 
F:  <sniff> 
E:  combining the constructions with the general construal mechanism . Is that in there ? 
F:  <sniff> 
C:  Yeah , mmm . Um . 
E:  Uh , OK , so where  where is it , cuz I 'll have to take a look . 
C:  Um , but I  I did not focus on that aspect but , um  
C:  Ehhh ,  
C:  um , it 's just underneath , uh , 
C:  um , 
C:  that reference to metaphor . So it 's the last paragraph 
C:  before two . So on page two , 
C:  um , the main focus  
E:  Uh , OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  <sniff> 
A:  <clears throat> 
C:  But that 's really  
F:  <sniff> 
A:  That 's not about that , @ @ is it ? 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  No , it  it  
E:  it s says it but it doesn't say  it doesn't  it d it d yeah , it doesn't give the punch line . 
C:  Why .  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <clears throat> 
E:  Right . 
E:  So 's it 's  it  
E:  it 's a very big deal , i i in this framework , and the 
E:  thesis proposal as it stands doesn't , 
E:  um , I don't think , say that as clearly as it could . 
A:  <clears throat> 
C:  No , it doesn't say it at all . No . 
C:  Even though  <clears throat> 


E:  Cuz let me tell the gang what I think the punch line is , because it 's actually important , 
E:  which is , that , 
E:  the 
E:  constructions , that , uh , Nancy and Keith and friends are doing , 
E:  uh , are , 
E:  in a way , quite general 
E:  but 
E:  cover only base cases . And 
E:  to make them apply 
E:  to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , 
E:  of construal . And the punch line is , he claimed , 
E:  that 
A:  <clears throat> 
E:  if you do this right , you can get 
E:  essentially orthogonality , that 
E:  if you introduce a new construction 
E:  at  at the base level , it should com uh , interact with all the metonymies and metaphors so that all of the projections of it also should work . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And , similarly , if you introduce a new metaphor , 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  it should then 
E:  uh , compose with all of the constructions . 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  And it  to the extent that that 's true then  then 
E:  it 's a big win over anything that exists . 


D:  So does that mean instead of having tons and tons of rules in your 
D:  context - free grammar 
A:  <clears throat> 
D:  you just have 
D:  these base constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them . 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  So that , you know , for example , 
E:  uh , in the metaphor case , that you have a kind of direct 
E:  idea of a source , path , and goal 
E:  and any metaphorical one  and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff   you 
E:  can do the same grammar . 
E:  And it is the same grammar . 
D:  Mmm . 
E:  But , 
E:  um , the trick is that the  
E:  the way the construction 's written 
E:  it requires that the object of the preposition for example be a container . 
E:  Well , " trouble " isn't a container , but it gets constr construed as a c container . 
D:  Right . 
E:  Et cetera . So that 's  
E:  that 's where this , um , 
D:  So with construal you don't have to have a construction for every possible thing that can fill the rule . 


C:  One could argue what  if there are basic cases , even . 
C:  I mean , it seems like nothing is context - free . 
E:  Oh , nothing is context - free , 
E:  but there are basic cases . That is , 
E:  um , there are physical containers , there are physical paths , there  you know , et cetera . 
A:  <clears throat> 
C:  But " walked into the cafe and ordered a drink , " and " walked into the cafe and broke his nose , " that 's sort of  
E:  Oh , it doesn't mean that they 're unambiguous . I mean , a cafe can be construed as a container , or it can be construed 
C:  Mmm . Yeah . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
E:  you know as  as a obstacle , or as some physical object . So there are multiple construals . 
A:  <sniff> 
E:  And in fact that 's part of what has to be done . This is why there 's this interaction between the analysis 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  and the construal . 
C:  Yep . 
E:  The b the  the double arrow . 
C:  Yep . 
E:  So , uh , yeah , I mean , it doesn't magically make 
A:  <clears throat> 
E:  ambiguity go away . 
C:  No . 
E:  But it does say that , 
E:  uh , if 
E:  you walked into the cafe and broke your nose , then you are construing the cafe 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  as an obstacle . 
E:  And if that 's not consistent with 
E:  other things , then 
E:  you 've gotta reject that reading . 
C:  Yep . 
D:  You con  you conditioned me with your first sentence , and so I thought , " Why would he walk into the cafe and then 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  somehow break his nose ? " uh , 
F:  He slipped on the wet floor . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  oh , uh  <laugh> 
E:  Right . 
A:  <laugh> 


C:  You don't find that usage , uh  uh , I checked for it in the Brown national corpus . The " walk into it " never really means , w as in walked smack  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  But " run into " does . 
C:  Yeah , but , y y if you find " walked smacked into the cafe " or " slammed into the wall "  
E:  Yeah , no , 
E:  but " run into " does . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Because you will find " run into , " 
E:  uh , 
D:  Cars run into telephone poles all the time . 
E:  well , or " into the cafe " for that m you know  " His car ran into the cafe . " 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . Or you can run into an old friend , or run . <laugh> 
E:  Well , you can " run into " in that sense too . 
F:  <laugh> No !  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
E:  But , uh , 
A:  Yeah , " run into " might even be more impact sense than , 
A:  you know , 
A:  container sense . 
E:  Right . 
F:  Depends . 
C:  <cough-laugh> 
E:  But  Like , " run into an old friend " , 
E:  it 
E:  probably needs its own construction . 
E:  I mean , uh , you know , George would have I 'm sure some exa 
E:  complicated ex reason why it really was an instance of 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
E:  something else and maybe it is , but , 
E:  um , there are idioms and my guess is that 's one of them , but , um  I don't know . 
A:  All contact . 
A:  I mean , there there 's contact that doesn't  social contact , whatever . I mean . 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  Uh . 
F:  Sudden surprising contact , right ? <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah , but it 's  it 's  it 's  it 's  Right . i Yeah , it 's more  
A:  Forceful . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  But of course , no , i i I mean it has a life of its own . It 's sort of partially inspired by the spatial  
E:  Well , this is this motivated  but yeah  oh yeah , mo for sure , motivated , but then 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  you can't parse on motivated . 


F:  Yeah . Right . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <sigh> Too bad .  
E:  Uh , 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  You should get a T - shirt that says that . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  OK .  
A:  There 's  there 's lots of things you could make T - shirts out of ,  but , uh , 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  this has gotten   
D:  <laugh> 
A:  @ @ 
A:  I mean wh <laugh> 
C:  <inbreath> Pro - probably not your marks in the kitchen , today . Not  not your marks . <laugh> 
A:  We don't need the words to that . 
A:  What ? 
A:  Oh , no no no no no no no no no , we 're not going there . 
A:  OK . 
A:  <clears throat> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  In other news . <laugh> 
E:  OK , so , um , 
A:  <laugh> 


C:  the  i what would have been really nice is to find an example for 
A:  <yawn> 
C:  all of this , 
C:  uh , 
C:  from our domain . 
C:  So maybe if we w if we can make one up  now , that would be c incredibly helpful . 
A:  So , w where it should illustrate  
E:  OK . 
C:  How  
A:  uh  wh when you say all this , do you mean , like , I don't know , the related work stuff , as well as , 
E:  Right  right  r 
A:  mappings ? 
C:  w Well we have , for example , a canonical use of something and y it 's , you know , we have some constructions and then it 's construed as something , and then we  we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use 
C:  that 's also relevant to the  to the domain . 
C:  on the wagon . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  like " under the bus , " or something , where  
C:  But it 's  it 's  unfortunately , this is not really something a tourist would ever say . 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  So . 
E:  Well , unless he was repairing it or something , but yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  But um . 
E:  Uh , but OK . 
A:  It 's not one of the y it 's more straightforward ones  forward ones to defend , so you probably don't want to use it for the purposes  th these are  you 're addressing like , computational linguists , right . Or  are you ? 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Right . 
E:  OK . 
C:  There 's gonna be four 
C:  computational linguists , 
A:  OK . But more 
C:  computer 
A:  emphasis on the computational ? Or emphasis on the linguist ? 
C:  it 's  
C:  More  there 's going to be the  just four computational linguists , by coincidence , but the rest is , whatever , biocomputing people and physicists . 
E:  No no no , but not for your talk . I 'm - we 're worrying about the th the thes it 's just for one guy . 
A:  Oh , OK . 
C:  Oh , the thesis ! That 's  that 's computa should be very computational , and , uh , someth 
A:  Oh , I meant this , you know , like  
A:  OK . So I would try to  I would stay away from one that involves weird construal stuff . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
A:  You know , it 's an obvious one  but , uh  
F:  Totally weird stuff . 
E:  uh  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  <mouth> Well , I  I  I  
D:  I love Van Gogh . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Ah ! 
A:  " I wanna go see the Van Gogh . " 
C:  <clears throat> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> Oh geez . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Anyway , I 'm sorry .  
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Right . 
E:  s See you . 
C:  and deal with . 
E:  OK , well . 
E:  I guess if anybody has additional suggestions , w Yeah . 
C:  I mean maybe the " where is something " question as a whole , you know , can be construed as , u i locational versus instructional request . 
C:  So , if we 're not talk about the lexic 
A:  Location versus what ? 
C:  instruction . 
A:  Instruction . Oh , directions ? Yeah . Oh , I thought that was  
E:  Sure . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  definitely treated as an example of construal . 
A:  Right ? @ @ 
C:  Yeah but then you 're not on the lexical level , that 's sort of one level higher . 
A:  Oh , you want a lexical example .  
C:  But I don't need it . 
E:  Well , you might want both . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Also it would be nice to get  ultimately to get a nice mental space example , so , even temporal references are  
E:  We  
C:  just in the spatial domain are rare . 
E:  But it 's  it 's easy to make up plausible ones . 
E:  You know . 
C:  When  when you 're getting information on objects . So , I mean  
E:  Right , you know  you know , where r Yeah . 
E:  What color was this in  in 
E:  in the nain nineteenth century . What was this p instead of  wh what  you know  how was this painted , what color was this painted , um , 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  <clears throat> 
E:  was this alleyway open . 
C:  Yeah , maybe we can include that also in our second , uh , data run . We c we can show people pictures of objects and then 
E:  Uh . 
C:  have then ask the system about the objects and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth . 


E:  OK , f let 's  let 's suppose you use " in " and " on " . 
E:  I mean , that 's what you started with . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  So " in the bus " and " on the bus , " um , that 's actually a little tricky in English because to some extent they 're synonyms . 
E:  OK . 
C:  I had two hours w with George on this , so it , um  
E:  OK , what did he say . 
A:  Did you ? <laugh> Join the club .  
F:  <laugh> 
E:  Right . Oh , h that 's  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Um . 
C:  " On the bus " is a m is a metaphorical metonymy 
C:  that relates some meta path metaphorically and you 're on  on that path and 
A:  <yawn> 
C:  th w I mean it 's  he  there 's a platform notion , right ? " he 's on the  standing on the bus waving to me . " But th the regular as we speak " J Johno was on the bus to New York , " um , uh , he 's  
E:  Yeah , I  I believe all that , it 's just  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  that 's , uh , what did I call it here , the transportation schema , something , where you can be on the first flight , on the second flight , and you can be , you know , 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . So  so that  that may or may not be what you  what you want to do . I mean you could do something much simpler 


C:  So in terms of the  this  We had  we had  initially we 'd  started discussing the " out of film . " 
A:  I see . 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  Right . 
C:  And there 's a lot of " out of " analysis , so , um , 
E:  Right . 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  could we capture that with a different construal of  
A:  Yeah , it 's a little  it 's , uh  we 've thought about it before , uh t uh  to use the examples in other papers , and it 's  it 's a little complicated . 
F:  Out of  out of film , in particular . 
A:  Cuz you 're like , it 's a state of  there 's resource , right , and like , 
F:  Yeah . 
A:  what is film , the state  you know . You 're out of the state of having film , right ? and somehow film is standing for the re the resour the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource . 
F:  It 's  yeah , I mean , but  and plus the fact that there 's also s I mean , can you say , like , 
A:  I mean . 
A:  It 's a little bit  
F:  " The film ran out " you know , or , maybe you could say something like " The film is out " so like the  the film went away from where it should be , namely with you , or something , right ? You know . 
A:  Yeah , is film the trajector ? <laugh> 
A:  <clears throat> 
A:  <sniff> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  The  the film  the film is gone , right ? Um , 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  I never really knew what was going on , I mean I  I find it sort of a little bit farfetched to say that  that " I 'm out of film " means that I have left the state of having film or something like that , but . 
A:  It 's weird . 
A:  That  
E:  Uh . 
A:  Or , " having " is also , um , associated with location , right ? so if the film left , you know  state is being near film . 
F:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  So running  running out of something is different from being out of somewhere . 
E:  Or being out of something as , uh  as well . 
E:  So " running out of it " definitely has a process aspect to it . 
A:  Mm - hmm . But that 's from run , yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  So , 
E:  b that 's OK , I mean  b but the difference 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Is the d the final state of running out of something is being out of it .  
E:  is  
F:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . So th 
F:  You got there . <laugh> You got to out of it . Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  That part is fine . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  But , uh  
F:  Hmm ! 
E:  Yeah , so  so nob so no one has in  in  of the , 
E:  uh , 
E:  So , 
E:  um  


E:  professional linguists , they haven't  there was this whole thesis on " out of " . 
A:  Uh . 
A:  There was ? Who ? 
E:  Well , there  I thought  or there was a paper on it . Huh ? 
F:  Out . 
F:  There was one on  on " out " or " out of " ? 
E:  There was a 
E:  Well , it may be just " out " . Yeah . 
F:  OK . 
E:  I think there was " over " but there was also a paper on " out " . 
F:  Yeah , Lind - Susan Lindner , right ? The  the  " the syrup spread out " ? That kind of thing ? 
E:  Or something . 
A:  Oh , yeah , you 're right . Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , and all that sort of stuff . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  And undoubtably there 's been reams of work about it in cognitive linguistics , but . 
E:  OK . But anyway . We 're not gonna do that between now and next week . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 


C:  I mean the  the old bakery example might be nice , " Is there a bakery around here " . So if you c we really just construe it as a  
F:  Yeah . 
A:  Around ? 
C:  No , it 's the bakery itself  is it a building ? uh , that you want to go to ? or is it something to eat that you want to buy ? 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Oh , oh yeah . Yeah , we 've thought about that . Right . Right . 
C:  And then  
A:  Nnn .  
A:  No . What ? " Bakery " can't be something you 're gonna eat . 
E:  No , no . The question is d do you wanna  do you wanna construe  do you wanna constr - strue   
F:  Sh - 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  It 's a speech - act . 
E:  r Exactly . It 's because do you wanna c do you want to view 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  the bakery as a p a place that  that  i for example , if  y 
A:  Where you can get baked goods . 
E:  Well th well , that 's one . You want to buy something . 
E:  But the other is , 
E:  uh , yo you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there 'd be a bakery in the neighborhood , or , 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  um , pfff  
E:  you know , you wonder how people here make their living , and  there 're all sorts of reasons why you might 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  be asking about the existence of a bakery that doesn't mean , " I want to buy some baked goods . " 
A:  OK . 
E:  But 
E:  <swallow> 
E:  um , those are interesting examples but it 's not clear that they 're mainly 
E:  construal examples . 
F:  Yeah . 
A:  So it 's a lot of pragmatics , there , that 
C:  Mmm . 
E:  There 's all sorts of stuff going on . So 
A:  might be beyond what you want to do . 


E:  let 's  so let 's think about this from the point of view 
E:  of construal . So let 's first do 
E:  a  So the metonymy thing 
E:  is 
E:  probably the easiest and a and actually the  
E:  Though , the one you have isn't quite  
A:  You mean the s 
A:  You mean " the steak wants to pay " ? 
E:  N no not that one , that 's  that 's a  the sort of 
E:  background . This is the t uh , page five . 
D:  About Plato and the book ? 
E:  No . 
A:  Oh . Um . 
C:  No . 
F:  Onward . 
E:  Just beyond that . 
A:  How much does it cost ? 
C:  Where is the castle ? How old is it ? How much does it cost ? 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  A castle . 
D:  Oh . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  To go in , that 's like  
F:  Two hundred million dollars .  
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Right .  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  It 's not for sale . 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  Uh . 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  So 
F:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , I think that 's a good example , actually . <sniff> 
C:  S 
A:  Yeah , that 's good . u 
C:  But as Nancy just su suggested it 's probably ellipticus . Huh . 
A:  <voiced outbreath> <clears throat> 
A:  Ellipsis . 
A:  Like , " it " doesn't refer to " thing , " it refers to acti you know , j thing standing for activ most relevant activity for a tourist  you could think of it that way , but . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  Well , shoot , isn't that  I mean , that 's what  
C:  Well , I mean , my argument here is  it 's  it 's  it 's the same thing as " Plato 's on the top shelf , " I 'm con you know , th that you can refer to 
F:  figuring that out is what this is about . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , no , I I agree . 
C:  a book of Plato by using " Plato , " and you can 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  No no , I  I 'm agreeing that this is a good , um  
C:  refer back to it , and so you can  Castles have  as tourist sites , have admission fees , so you can say " Where is the castle , how much does it cost ? " 
C:  Um . 
C:  " How far is it 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  from here ? " So , 
C:  You 're also not 
C:  referring to the 
A:  Hmm . 
C:  width of the object , or so , www .  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mmm . 


E:  OK . Can we think of a nice 
E:  metaphorical use of " where " 
E:  in the tourist 's domain ? 
E:  Um . 
F:  Hmm . 
E:  So you know it 's  
E:  you  you can sometimes use " where " f for " when " 
F:  O 
E:  in the sense of , you know , 
E:  um , 
E:  where  wh where  where was , um , 
E:  " where was Heidelberg , um , in the Thirty Years ' War ? " 
E:  Or something . 
F:  Uh , yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  You know , or some such thing . 
F:  Like what side were they on , or  ?  
E:  Um . 
A:  <laugh> What ? 
E:  Yeah . Essentially , yeah . 
A:  OK . I was like , " Huh ? It was here . " Like   Um . 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  But anyway th so there are  there are cases like that . Um , 
A:  Ah ! 
A:  Or like its developmental state or something like that , you could  I guess you could get that . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Um . 
A:  Um . 
A:  <noise> 
F:  I mean , there 's also things like  I mean , s um , I guess 
F:  I could ask something like " Where can I find out about blah - blah - blah " in a sort of  
F:  doesn't nece I don't necessarily have to care about the spatial location , just give me a phone number and I 'll call them or something like that ? 
E:  Yeah . There certainly is that , yeah . 
F:  <cough> 
E:  You know , " Where could I learn its opening hours , " or something . 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  But that 's 
A:  Hmm . 
E:  not metaphorical . 
E:  It 's another  
F:  Yeah . 
E:  So we 're thinking about , um , 
E:  or we could also think about , 


E:  How about " I 'm in a hurry " ? 
A:  State . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  It i But it 's a state  and the  the issue is , 
F:  Hmm ? 
E:  is that  it may be just a usage , 
E:  you know , that it 's not particularly metaphorical , I don't know . 
F:  Mmm . 
A:  Right . 
F:  Oh . <whistle> 
A:  So you want a more exotic one  version of that . <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . Yeah , right . 
A:  <outbreath> I 'm really into  
E:  Ah ! How about 
E:  I  I  I  you know , " I 'm in  I 'm in a state of exhaustion " ? 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  or something like that , which a tourist w Huh ? 
A:  Do you really say that ? 
A:  Would you really say that ? 
E:  A st uh , well , you can certainly say , um , you know , " I 'm in overload . " 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  I I 'm really into art . Uh  
E:  Tu - stur tourists will often say that . 
A:  Yeah , I was gonna say , like  
F:  <laugh> 
E:  Oh , you can do that ? 
E:  Really ? Of course that 's  that  that 's definitely a , uh  
F:  Fixed .  
A:  A fixed expression , yeah .  
E:  that 's a , uh  
E:  Right . But .  
A:  There 're too  there 're all sorts of fixed expressions I don't  like uh 
F:  <exhales noisily> 
A:  " I 'm out of sorts now ! "  
E:  Right . 
A:  Like  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  " I 'm in trouble ! "  
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 


C:  Well I  when , uh  just f u the data that I 've looked at so far that rec I mean , there 's tons of cases for polysemy . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
C:  So , you know , mak re making reference to buildings as institutions , as containers , as build you know , whatever . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Right . 
C:  Um , so ib in mus for example , in museums , you know , as a building or as something where pictures hang versus , you know , 
C:  ev something that puts on exhibits , so forth . But  
E:  Right . As an institution , yeah . 
C:  Um . 
A:  Why don't you want to use any of those ? 
C:  Hmm ? 
A:  So y you don't wanna use one that 's  
C:  Yeah , well  No , but this  that 's what I have , you know , started doing . 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  The castle  the  that old castle one is sort of  
C:  Metonymy , polysemy . 


C:  But I think the argument should be  
A:  <clears throat> 
C:  uh , can be made that , 
C:  you know , despite the fact that this is not the most met metaphorical domain , because people interacting with HTI systems try to be straightforward and less lyrical , 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  construal still is , uh , you know , completely , 
C:  um , key in terms of finding out any of these things , so , 
E:  Right . 
C:  um . 
E:  So that 's  that 's  that 's a  that 's a reasonable point , that it  in this domain you 're gonna get less metaphor and more metonymy . 
C:  We , uh  I  with a  I looked  with a student I looked at the entire database that we have on Heidelberg for cases of metonymy . 
E:  And polysemy , and stuff like that . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  Hardly anything . So not even in descriptions 
C:  w did we find anything , um , 
C:  relevant . 
A:  <clears throat> 
F:  I have to go . 
F:  <mike noise as he takes mike off> 
E:  Alright . Yeah . 
C:  But OK this is just something we 'll  we 'll see , um , 


D:  <inbreath> For some reason when you said " feedback electronically " I thought of that  you ever see the Simpsons where they 're  like the family 's got the buzzers 
D:  and they buzz each other when they don't like what the other one is saying ? 
A:  Yeah . That 's the  
A:  first one , I think . The very very first one . 
D:  It was a very early one . I don't know if it 's the first one . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  Mmm .
