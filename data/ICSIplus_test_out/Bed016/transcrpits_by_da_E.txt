E:  All success . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Uh , right . 
E:  Uh . 
E:  Right . Yeah , I  I  I avoided that as long as I could for you guys , 
E:  but , uh  
E:  Right . 
E:  e 
E:  Well , I think you 're supposed to  
E:  OK . We can do this . 
E:  Everybody 's got different digits , 
E:  right ? 
E:  No . 
E:  e 
E:  yeah , the 
E:  Well , they  they have s they have the close talking microphones for each of us , 
E:  so  
E:  yeah , there 's separate channels . 
E:  So when I say 
E:  OK . 
E:  Right . 
E:  No . 
E:  Well , you  you had s you said there were two things that you might wanna do . 
E:  One was rehearse your i i talk  
E:  Yeah , no I s I s I see this has got the castle in it , and stuff like that . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Uh , yeah , I think so . 
E:  No , this is the twenty - first . 
E:  Whatever . 
E:  You certainly can . 
E:  I mean I y I you know , I don't know  
E:  Right , 
E:  um . 
E:  Well , the time to mention it , if you mention it , is when you talk about mirror neurons , 
E:  then you should talk about the more recent stuff , about the kicking 
E:  and , you know , the  
E:  yeah , yeah  
E:  and  that the plan is to see to what extent the  you 'll get the same phenomena with stories about this , 
E:  so that  
E:  and that we 're planning to do this , 
E:  um , 
E:  which , we are . 
E:  So that 's one thing . 
E:  Um . 
E:  Depends . I mean , there is a , um , whole language learning story , 
E:  OK ? 
E:  which , 
E:  uh , actually , i i 
E:  even on your five - layer slide , you  you 've got an old one that  that leaves that off . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
E:  OK , so , so anyway , I  I agree that 's not central . 
E:  What you might wanna do is , 
E:  um , 
E:  and may not , 
E:  but you might wanna  this is  rip off a bunch of the slides on the 
E:  anal 
E:  there  the  there  we 've got various i generations of slides that show language analysis , and matching to the underlying image schemas , 
E:  and , 
E:  um , how the construction and simulation  
E:  that ho that whole th 
E:  OK . 
E:  The quals w the  the  the quals slides would be fine . 
E:  You could get it out of there , or some 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , it 's different , 
E:  this is the , uh , DNA building , or someth the double helix building . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  The  yeah it was  it turns out that if  if you have multiple billions of dollars , y you can do all sorts of weird things , 
E:  and  
E:  Roughly , yeah . 
E:  Including cr cross - bridges , 
E:  and 
E:  You d you really  now I I spent  the last time I was there I spent maybe two hours hearing this story 
E:  which is , um  
E:  Right . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Well , no , no , y i there 's infinite money . 
E:  See 
E:  you th you th you then fill it with researchers . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So , yeah , I think that 's  that 's a good point , 
E:  th th that the date , the , uh , 
E:  a lot of the  this is interacting with , uh , people in Italy 
E:  but also definitely the people in Leipzig 
E:  and 
E:  the  
E:  the b the combination of the biology and the Leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys , 
E:  yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Anyway ! Enough of that , 
E:  let 's talk about your thesis proposal . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Um . 
E:  No , no , no . 
E:  So I did note 
E:  i i it looks like the , uh , metaphor didn't get in yet . 
E:  Well , s reference is one thing , 
E:  the question is is there any place  
E:  Oh , did you put in something about , 
E:  uh , the individual , 
E:  we 'd talked about putting in something about people had , 
E:  uh  
E:  Oh yeah , OK . 
E:  Good . I see where you have it . 
E:  So the top of the second  of pa page two you have a sentence . 
E:  But , what I meant is , I think even before you give this , to Wahlster , uh , you should , 
E:  unless you put it in the text , 
E:  and I don't think it 's there yet , 
E:  about  we talked about is the , um , scalability that you get by , um , combining the constructions with the general construal mechanism . 
E:  Is that in there ? 
E:  Uh , OK , so where  where is it , 
E:  cuz I 'll have to take a look . 
E:  Uh , OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  No , it  it  it s says it 
E:  but it doesn't say  it doesn't  it d it d 
E:  yeah , it doesn't give the punch line . 
E:  Cuz let me tell the gang what I think the punch line is , 
E:  because it 's actually important , 
E:  which is , that , the constructions , that , uh , Nancy and Keith and friends are doing , uh , are , in a way , quite general 
E:  but cover only base cases . 
E:  And to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal . 
E:  And the punch line is , he claimed , that if you do this right , you can get essentially orthogonality , 
E:  that if you introduce a new construction at  at the base level , it should com uh , interact with all the metonymies and metaphors 
E:  so that all of the projections of it also should work . 
E:  And , similarly , if you introduce a new metaphor , it should then uh , compose with all of the constructions . 
E:  And it  to the extent that that 's true then  then it 's a big win over anything that exists . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  So that , you know , for example , uh , in the metaphor case , that you have a kind of direct idea of a source , path , and goal 
E:  and any metaphorical one  and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff   you can do the same grammar . 
E:  And it is the same grammar . 
E:  But , um , 
E:  the trick is that the  
E:  the way the construction 's written it requires that the object of the preposition for example be a container . 
E:  Well , " trouble " isn't a container , 
E:  but it gets constr construed as a c container . 
E:  Et cetera . 
E:  So that 's  that 's where this , um , 
E:  Right . 
E:  So 's it 's  it  it 's a very big deal , i i in this framework , 
E:  and the thesis proposal as it stands doesn't , 
E:  um , I don't think , say that as clearly as it could . 
E:  Oh , nothing is context - free , 
E:  but there are basic cases . 
E:  That is , um , there are physical containers , 
E:  there are physical paths , 
E:  there  
E:  you know , 
E:  et cetera . 
E:  Oh , it doesn't mean that they 're unambiguous . 
E:  I mean , a cafe can be construed as a container , or it can be construed you know as  as a obstacle , 
E:  or as some physical object . 
E:  So there are multiple construals . 
E:  And in fact that 's part of what has to be done . 
E:  This is why there 's this interaction between the analysis and the construal . 
E:  The b the  the double arrow . 
E:  So , uh , yeah , I mean , it doesn't magically make ambiguity go away . 
E:  But it does say that , uh , if you walked into the cafe and broke your nose , then you are construing the cafe as an obstacle . 
E:  And if that 's not consistent with other things , then you 've gotta reject that reading . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  But " run into " does . 
E:  Yeah , no , but " run into " does . 
E:  Because you will find " run into , " 
E:  uh , 
E:  well , or " into the cafe " for that m 
E:  you know  
E:  " His car ran into the cafe . " 
E:  Well , you can " run into " in that sense too . 
E:  But , uh , 
E:  Right . 
E:  But  Like , " run into an old friend " , it probably needs its own construction . 
E:  I mean , uh , you know , George would have I 'm sure some exa complicated ex reason why it really was an instance of something else 
E:  and maybe it is , 
E:  but , um , 
E:  there are idioms 
E:  and my guess is that 's one of them , 
E:  but , um  I don't know . 
E:  Uh . 
E:  Yeah , but it 's  it 's  it 's  it 's  Right . i Yeah , it 's more  
E:  Well , this is this motivated  
E:  but yeah  
E:  oh yeah , mo for sure , 
E:  motivated , 
E:  but then you can't parse on motivated . 
E:  Uh , 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK , so , um , 
E:  anything else you want to ask us about 
E:  the thesis proposal , you got  
E:  We could look at a particular thing and give you feedback on it . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Right  right  r 
E:  OK , f let 's  let 's suppose you use " in " and " on " . 
E:  I mean , that 's what you started with . 
E:  So " in the bus " and " on the bus , " 
E:  um , that 's actually a little tricky in English 
E:  because to some extent they 're synonyms . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK , what did he say . 
E:  Right . Oh , h that 's  
E:  Yeah , I  I believe all that , 
E:  it 's just  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . So  so that  that may or may not be what you  what you want to do . 
E:  I mean you could do something much simpler 
E:  like " under the bus , " or something , 
E:  where  
E:  Well , unless he was repairing it or something , 
E:  but yeah . 
E:  Uh , but OK . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Uh . 
E:  Or being out of something as , uh  as well . 
E:  So " running out of it " definitely has a process aspect to it . 
E:  So , 
E:  b that 's OK , 
E:  I mean  b but the difference 
E:  is  
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  But , uh  
E:  Yeah , so  so nob so no one has in  in  of the , 
E:  uh , 
E:  professional linguists , 
E:  they haven't  
E:  there was this whole thesis on " out of " . 
E:  Well , there  I thought  or there was a paper on it . 
E:  Huh ? 
E:  There was a 
E:  Well , it may be just " out " . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I think there was " over " 
E:  but there was also a paper on " out " . 
E:  Or something . 
E:  Yeah , and all that sort of stuff . 
E:  OK . But anyway . We 're not gonna do that between now and next week . 
E:  OK . 
E:  So , um  
E:  Right . 
E:  OK . 
E:  No no no , but not for your talk . 
E:  I 'm - we 're worrying about the th the thes 
E:  it 's just for one guy . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
E:  No , no . The question is d do you wanna  do you wanna construe  do you wanna constr - strue 
E:  r 
E:  Exactly . It 's because do you wanna c do you want to view the bakery as a p a place that  that  i for example , if  y 
E:  Well th well , that 's one . 
E:  You want to buy something . 
E:  But the other is , 
E:  uh , yo you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there 'd be a bakery in the neighborhood , 
E:  or , 
E:  um , pfff 
E:  you know , you wonder how people here make their living , 
E:  and  there 're all sorts of reasons why you might be asking about the existence of a bakery 
E:  that doesn't mean , " I want to buy some baked goods . " 
E:  But <swallow> um , 
E:  those are interesting examples 
E:  but it 's not clear that they 're mainly construal examples . 
E:  There 's all sorts of stuff going on . 
E:  So 
E:  let 's  so let 's think about this from the point of view of construal . 
E:  So let 's first do a  
E:  So the metonymy thing is probably the easiest 
E:  and a and actually the  
E:  Though , the one you have isn't quite  
E:  N no not that one , 
E:  that 's  that 's a  the sort of background . 
E:  This is the t uh , page five . 
E:  No . 
E:  Just beyond that . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
E:  It 's not for sale . 
E:  Uh . So 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . Can we think of a nice metaphorical use of " where " in the tourist 's domain ? 
E:  Um . 
E:  So you know it 's  
E:  you  you can sometimes use " where " f for " when " 
E:  in the sense of , you know , 
E:  um , 
E:  where  wh where  where was , um , 
E:  " where was Heidelberg , um , in the Thirty Years ' War ? " 
E:  Or something . 
E:  You know , or some such thing . 
E:  Um . 
E:  Yeah . Essentially , yeah . 
E:  But anyway th so there are  there are cases like that . 
E:  Um , 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Um . 
E:  Yeah . There certainly is that , yeah . 
E:  You know , " Where could I learn its opening hours , " or something . 
E:  But that 's not metaphorical . 
E:  It 's another  
E:  So we 're thinking about , um , 
E:  or we could also think about , 
E:  uh  
E:  How about " I 'm in a hurry " ? 
E:  It i But it 's a state  and the  the issue is , is that  it may be just a usage , 
E:  you know , that it 's not particularly metaphorical , 
E:  I don't know . 
E:  Yeah . Yeah , right . 
E:  Ah ! 
E:  How about 
E:  I  I  I  you know , " I 'm in  I 'm in a state of exhaustion " ? 
E:  or something like that , 
E:  which a tourist w 
E:  Huh ? 
E:  A st uh , well , you can certainly say , um , you know , " I 'm in overload . " 
E:  Tu - stur tourists will often say that . 
E:  Oh , you can do that ? 
E:  Really ? 
E:  Of course that 's  that  that 's definitely a , uh  
E:  that 's a , uh  
E:  Right . But .  
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Right . As an institution , 
E:  yeah . 
E:  The castle  the  that old castle one is sort of  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Ah ! 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
E:  So that 's  that 's  that 's a  that 's a reasonable point , 
E:  that it  in this domain you 're gonna get less metaphor and more metonymy . 
E:  And polysemy , and stuff like that . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Alright . Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
E:  s See you . 
E:  OK , well . I guess if anybody has additional suggestions , 
E:  w 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Sure . 
E:  Well , you might want both . 
E:  We  
E:  But it 's  it 's easy to make up plausible ones . 
E:  You know . 
E:  Right , 
E:  you know  you know , where r 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  What color was this in  in in the nain nineteenth century . 
E:  What was this p 
E:  instead of  wh what  you know  how was this painted , 
E:  what color was this painted , 
E:  um , 
E:  was this alleyway open . 
E:  Uh . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  OK . So why don't we plan to give you feedback electronically . 
E:  Wish you a good trip . 
E:  All success .
