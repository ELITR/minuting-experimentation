C:  Then I 'm also going to present a little talk at EML , about what we have done here 
E:  let 's talk about your thesis proposal . 
abst_sum - abstract: The meeting was taken up by discussion about a thesis proposal and a talk about to take place at EML.

C:  Then I 'm also going to present a little talk at EML , about what we have done here 
C:  Then I 'm going to talk about the data , 
abst_sum - abstract: The latter will present the work that is currently being done at ICSI including examples of inference of user intentions and of the recordings of the on-going data collection.

C:  e tell a little bit  as much as I  can about the NTL story . 
C:  and then maybe talk about the big picture here , 
C:  So X - schemas , then , I would like to do  
C:  and then at the end about our Bayes - net . 
abst_sum - abstract: The talk will also outline the theoretical (X-schemas, image schemas, Bayes-nets) and neural background.

C:  It basically says , well " this is construal " , 
C:  and then it continues to say that one could potentially build a probabilistic relational model that has some general , domain - general rules 
C:  and then the idea is to use ontology , situation , user , and discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational model  to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what 
abst_sum - abstract: The thesis proposal, on the other hand, presents the idea of "construal" and makes claims as to how inferences are drawn in a probabilistic relational model by using information from the ontology, situation, user and discourse models.

None
abst_sum - abstract: It was advised that more emphasis should be put on the role of construal in the understanding of metaphor and metonymy.

E:  And to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal . 
E:  but cover only base cases . 
E:  but there are basic cases . 
C:  w Well we have , for example , a canonical use of something 
C:  and y it 's , you know , we have some constructions 
C:  and then it 's construed as something , 
C:  and then we  we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use that 's also relevant to the  to the domain . 
abst_sum - abstract: Base constructions deal with the norm, while further general domain mechanisms determine how the constructions are invoked depending on the context.

C:  But " walked into the cafe and ordered a drink , " and " walked into the cafe and broke his nose , " 
E:  But " run into " does . 
E:  So " in the bus " and " on the bus , " 
C:  We had  we had  initially we 'd  started discussing the " out of film . " 
C:  Where is the castle ? 
C:  I mean maybe the " where is something " question as a whole , you know , can be construed as , u i locational versus instructional request . 
abst_sum - abstract: Several potential examples of polysemy were discussed in detail: "walk/run into", "on the bus", "out of film", "where is X?".

C:  But I think the argument should be  uh , can be made that , you know , despite the fact that this is not the most met metaphorical domain , 
abst_sum - abstract: However, none of them was an example of lexical polysemy resolved by construal straightforward enough to include in the proposal; the tourist domain is not metaphor rich.

C:  e tell a little bit  as much as I  can about the NTL story . 
C:  and then maybe talk about the big picture here , 
C:  Oh , maybe the FMRI stuff . 
E:  Well , the time to mention it , if you mention it , is when you talk about mirror neurons , 
abst_sum - decisions: As the talk at EML will also refer to a theoretical framework, it was suggested that along with presenting NTL and the piece on mirror neurons, it also alludes to relevant fMRI work.

E:  the b the combination of the biology and the Leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys , 
abst_sum - decisions: The neural side of the research could be of interest to various groups.

E:  there  the  there  we 've got various i generations of slides that show language analysis , and matching to the underlying image schemas , 
abst_sum - decisions: The language analysis itself will be introduced in terms of image schemas.

E:  OK . So why don't we plan to give you feedback electronically . 
abst_sum - decisions: On the other hand, it was arranged for more feedback on the thesis proposal to be sent by email.

C:  current formalism thing that you presented . 
abst_sum - decisions: The latest version of the construction formalism will also be needed to complete the presentation.

E:  i i it looks like the , uh , metaphor didn't get in yet . 
E:  but cover only base cases . 
E:  And to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal . 
C:  w Well we have , for example , a canonical use of something 
C:  and y it 's , you know , we have some constructions 
C:  and then it 's construed as something , 
C:  and then we  we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use that 's also relevant to the  to the domain . 
abst_sum - problems: It was noted that the thesis proposal did not put any emphasis on metaphor or on the scalability achieved by combining constructions with general construal mechanisms: constructions cover base cases, while metaphoric and metonymic cases are resolved with the extra help provided by construal.

None
abst_sum - problems: During this discussion, however, the suggested examples of polysemy, which is tackled by the proposed framework, were not straightforward enough.

C:  But I think the argument should be  uh , can be made that , you know , despite the fact that this is not the most met metaphorical domain , 
abst_sum - problems: It was agreed that metaphors are not abundant in the spatial domain.

E:  So " in the bus " and " on the bus , " 
C:  We had  we had  initially we 'd  started discussing the " out of film . " 
E:  OK . Can we think of a nice metaphorical use of " where " in the tourist 's domain ? 
A:  A fixed expression , yeah . 
abst_sum - problems: Some of the candidates discussed were phrases like "on the bus", "out of film", non-spatial uses of "where" or other fixed expressions.
