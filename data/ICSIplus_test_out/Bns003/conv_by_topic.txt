H:  Testing . 
G:  Is this a virtual meeting , or  ?   
H:  Uh , they 're partici  
H:  O K . 
H:  Are we on ? 
H:  Yep . 
H:  OK , thanks again . 
D:  OK , we can start ? 
H:  Yep . 
D:  OK . Thank you , Adam . I will call you then when we are ready . I believe , maybe one hour , in that sense . 
H:  Just give me a call . 
H:  OK . Thanks .  


D:  OK , welcome to our next meeting . 
D:  Um  I have couple of points we should discussed . 
F:  <blowing into microphone> 
D:  One is related to the proposal , 
D:  Michael , please can you 
F:  Yep . 
D:  close the door ? 
D:  Thank you . 
D:  And , um 
F:  <door close> 
D:  furthermore , as most of you know I will leave in 
D:  tenth of December , I think we should discuss how we proceed in the meantime , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  because I get , 
D:  I would like to say , different signals from Siemens , 
D:  I believe , in the meantime it 's a higher probability that I will return , 
D:  but based on the pro uh , procedure to get a J - one visa and the IP six six 
D:  it will be  
D:  I would like to say , earliest stage will be end of January , 
D:  so that means  we have to get over six weeks and  
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Then furthermore I would  like to know the status of everybody . I know for sure , OK , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  um  Miguel , you will  have your plans 
D:  for this , uh , ongoing process , uh , 
D:  concerning your work . 
D:  OK , from you it 's 
D:  definitely clear , in principle . 
E:  <cough> 
D:  OK , for Michael , 
E:  <cough> 
E:  <cough> 
D:  what are your current plans and 
D:  Dietmar , maybe you then , also . 
D:  What we have discussed , in principle , concerning the ongoing process with U  
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  USAIA and also this , uh , your current work , 
D:  and from my point , it seems to be clear that I will go back 
D:  definitely at tenth of December , 
D:  and , as I mentioned before , 
D:  probably will be  
D:  more than fifty percent , I would like to say , that I will be come back 
D:  to 
D:  get  the freedom 
D:  to launch here the project in the sense in whatever kind of form 
D:  and get , in principle , paid 
D:  by another project within Siemens . 
D:  So  the point is how long I will stay . I believe , a couple of months definitely 
D:  and based on the success , I think that 's always an ongoing process to go back to  
D:  uh , to Germany for a couple of weeks and then come here and  and go on with  with this work and  <sniff> 
D:  so that is  my current opinion , concerning how Siemens deal with  with my , uh , ongoing effort . 
D:  <inbreath> 


D:  And , furthermore , I would like to  First of all , thanks to 
D:  uh  Dietmar because he started to use a 
D:  testbed . 
B:  Oh . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Eh 
D:  in principle , in his spare time . 
D:  Yeah ! 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh I will  So  so the first , <laugh> uh 
D:  uh , 
D:  box , this morning . 
D:  I will set up , definitely , in my spare time , in the evenings and the weekends the second box , 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  and I 'm looking for  two other volunteers 
D:  who are setting the third and the fourth box . 
C:  <inbreath> <mouth> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  But wh wh wh what are the box ? 
D:  A box is a  s P C . 
B:  P Cs . P Cs . 
C:  But what w 
D:  Equipped with  with  we should equipped it with  with Linux or maybe too with Free BSD ,  I doubt  I don't know 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Well the first 
B:  stop ,  the first thing  the most , eh , complicated is to fit them with the 
D:  and we 'll  
B:  removal  
B:  removable  um , hard disk . 
B:  <inbreath> 
D:  And now we have an expert . 
B:  But it 's  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  So the first computer I had to  
B:  um  
B:  <outbreath> 
B:  the 
B:  Oh , 
B:  what 's the right word ? 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  I had to 
B:  put everything out 
B:  to  to put the  removable hard disk in and  and it 's  
D:  Yeah , to remov 
D:  So that you can pull eh the  plug in the removable hard disk to the ID bus and  and OK , maybe it 's a little bit  
C:  OK . 
B:  Yeah , it 's  
B:  but i but it 's not  not , um  very , uh  difficult or something like that . 
D:  Uh - huh , 
B:  So you just have to  
D:  And  
D:  Why you are laughing ? 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> I ju 
D:  I don't know , I cou I s I didn't see him , 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  so I don't know what he did .  
B:  <inbreath> 
D:  I know in the meantime it 's running , and I will definitely set up the next one . 
B:  Uh ! 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  So Wilbert will set up the second computer . 
D:  Yeah , though my idea  maybe you eh can equip it with a 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  I don't know what your time constrain whether the time constraint allows you to set up one with  with Free BSD , for instance . Yeah . 
C:  You know , I  I can  
C:  I can build , eh , any computer uh you n  installing whatever . 
D:  OK , uh - huh . 
C:  It 's needed , I mean , I 
C:  will enjoy doing it . So . 
D:  Do you find the time ? 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  That 's OK for me . 
E:  Mmm . 
D:  Maybe also to uh support your  
E:  No promises . 
D:  No promises ?  
E:  No . 
D:  and even maybe to  to , uh  put your I G M P stuff on it . 
D:  Eh 
E:  No promises . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  No promises . 
E:  <clear throat> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  No . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Ah , he 's very hard to sell . <laugh> 
B:  So it 's about one hour to put this , uh  hard disk in and 
B:  a further hour to , uh   Well , 
B:  two or three hours 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  to install the operating systems . 
D:  Nee , because then the network is still running then . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Could we wait until the network is running ? Because currently it 's not possible , 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  At the moment . 
D:  uh , based on certain fire wall constraints . I believe David is , uh , currently working on that . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  to 
D:  set up the fire wall , and he 's not an expert for that 
D:  and when I get the signal I will ask one more time . 
D:  Nah , but nevertheless thanks to Dietmar that he @ @ . 
E:  Did the networks have internet connectivity ? 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yes , we have , eh , for  for secure socket , 
D:  and , uh  for web access , 
D:  the fire wall is open . That 's all . 
D:  And  But currently it 's not working , right ? 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Right , um  On Friday when I installed , um  
B:  uh  
B:  Linux the first time 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  I 
B:  got access to the local network here , 
B:  um , but not to any machines outside of , uh , ICSI . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  And , till Monday there 's no access at all to any machines , 
B:  also not to inside machines . 
B:  <inbreath> 
D:  But then , 
D:  uh  
B:  So , I think it 's related to the work , um  they 've done on Sunday here and I sent  
E:  But normally you should have access to th 
E:  all the internet , r 
E:  to outside . 
D:  Yes . 
D:  Yeah , 
D:  You have 
E:  Full . 
D:  internet outside access , 
D:  but no telnet and not R - login or whatever kind of things , you know . 
E:  A restricted in . 
E:  Not .  
E:  Huh .  
E:  Not a  no FTP . 
D:  Yeah , FTP yes . 
E:  H 
D:  But no telnet . 
E:  Hmm . 
D:  Uh  because you can  
D:  The  the  the point is that we will use it , as it is uh described several times , that we will use it as a local network , in principle , 
D:  but it doesn't make sense to use certain kinds of 
D:  uh , media transportation f to put some stuff you need 
D:  from your PC or your LS  to this , uh  uh , 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  uh , to this testbed , you know . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  So 
D:  you download it , if that s must be possible from the network , but normally 
D:  it should be used as um  
D:  uh 
D:  for demonstrations or to figure out if you have a scenario where you have to use more than , 
D:  uh , one box 
D:  which you have on your desktop , 
D:  cuz that is the primary , uh uh  reason for this testbed . 
D:  So , definitely you have to have 
D:  web access 
D:  to download the necessary files . 
C:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 


D:  So and then furthermore , one more thanks to Claudia . 
D:  He  did a lot  of work and I could only 
A:  Right . 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  Ah , the messages . Oh . 
D:  pass her some advices and some discussions with her concerning the web pages . 
D:  And now we are , in principle , in the state we have to do it with a project 
D:  area . But they 're also some contributions from you guys requested . 
D:  Um 
D:  and the alumni page , in principle , we have to , 
D:  you know , 
D:  but it 's primarily my job , I believe , 
D:  uh , to set up so that it is , uh adjusted really to the people 
D:  who are worth to be 
D:  alumnis  alumnis ,  yeah . 
D:  Is it " alumni "  " alumni " ?  
D:  I 'm  
A:  " Alumni " . 
D:  " Alumni " . 
D:  <tsk> 
D:  I 'm not sure how to pronounce this word . 
F:  Aber das wird jetzt geaendert . 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  Huh ? 
F:  Das wird geaendert . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  And , um  
D:  But , um 
D:  I think everybody should 
D:  take a look to the web pages , 
D:  and inform Claudia if something , uh , has to be 
D:  improved or if there 's some comments or 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  uh 
D:  He 's laughing all the time . Why ? 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh because it is  you know , that 's very important 
D:  maybe now not for us 
D:  but maybe for our successors and maybe somebody will come back once a day or send some students or some colleagues or whatever . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  So , my point of view  I will 
D:  doc I will 
D:  documented everything 
D:  when I will leave here in the sense that 
D:  potential successor as a group leader 
D:  can hook in with these things 
D:  and that 
D:  these web pages will be updated every time when it is necessary . We tried to do it , 
D:  so that it must be at least updated only when really major changes happen . 
D:  So that means somebody 's leaving the group , 
D:  uh , somebody is joining the group , a new project is started , 
D:  but , uh , the effort should be minimized as possible . 
D:  And , so please 
D:  take a look to the web pages 
D:  and 
D:  I have announced in the project area 
D:  the major headlines . 
D:  And especially , Wilbert , maybe you can write something 
D:  about 
D:  yours ? 
D:  I call it , I believe , " Multicast " and then " Development deployment " , 
D:  eh , for  for source specific multicas maybe a few lines , maybe a picture . 
D:  And something like that should be added to USAIA ? OK , that 's my stuff . 


D:  And 
D:  um 
D:  then 
D:  the 
D:  next point is then this 
D:  active routing stuff ? 
D:  <page turning> 
D:  Um 
D:  I would like to discuss it before , but 
D:  you were busy . 
C:  Yeah , OK . 
D:  And so  
D:  um , I believe , it must be adjusted 
D:  to the current activities 
D:  a little bit more . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And , um 
D:  I  I think it doesn't  
D:  It is not worth to discuss it now because nobody raised it before . 
C:  Yeah , I think so . 
D:  And , uh , so l let us have a bilateral discussion afterwards . 
D:  I would  what I would like to have is 
D:  that 
D:  um , 
D:  your contributions is related to certain kind of things happened here . 
D:  And that means really to the project proposal itself 
D:  and also maybe to the USAIA architecture , in that sense , 
D:  that at certain stages , 
D:  cuz it 's a general architecture , certain stages maybe to future 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  mobile 
D:  core networks , 
D:  that it is related 
D:  to these kind of things . 
D:  Um , having  uh , I  what I have in mind is 
D:  that things should not be started from the end system . 
D:  That 's my principle concern , 
D:  because that will never be happen , from my point of view . 
D:  It should be started as the edge device , 
D:  so that it cu certain kind of mechanism , whatever , 
D:  is enabled between the 
D:  ingress edge device and the outgress a edge device , 
D:  because it will be at the certain stage 
D:  IP based in the future generation telecommunication networks 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  That 's OK . 
D:  before its goal . 
D:  Fuel it to the  over the internet , and b between these both boxes , 
D:  I can assume 
D:  uh because the mobility happens there 
D:  as a normal natural thing 
D:  and the forwarding process and the routing process should be no more separated , from my point of view . 
D:  And to have there a certain kind of intelligent mechanism , 
D:  that the packets can be used 
D:  to set up the routes because they have all the information . 
D:  They know where they have to go because IP addresses are still there 
C:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
D:  and  within the packet . I mean , how can this use , 
D:  uh , within this area , and how this area is then aligned 
D:  to the more traditional routing within the 
D:  internet backbone itself . 
D:  That 's my question . 
D:  And I think that is good a research area , then I think there 's a lot of  
D:  I 'm not a e xpert at all for this . 
D:  But I  I  I believe , there 's a lot of potential for that . 
D:  And we should discuss it maybe 
C:  OK . 
D:  bilateral afterwards . 
C:  OK . 
D:  Yeah ? 


D:  So , one more time , everybody 
D:  should take a look to the web pages 
D:  and from Claudia , at the general remarks 
D:  and should write 
D:  based on the , uh , 
D:  headlines in the project proposal 
D:  the 
D:  um 
D:  things what still happened , 
D:  the things what they have still in mind 
D:  uh  so that we can update these last @ @ you know @ @ present the last major 
D:  part of the web pages . 
B:  The pages are already on the web ? 
C:  OK . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  Yes , 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  It is . 
D:  you can now access it normally with maybe WWW ICSI Berkeley EDU , 
A:  So there are some gaps . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  and 
D:  so . 
B:  OK . 
A:  Yeah , so there are some gaps left and , 
A:  I don't know , 
A:  you  Maybe you can also read through the  all the text which is on the web pages cuz I 'd like to change the text a bit 
A:  cuz 
A:  sometimes it 's too long , sometimes it 's too short , 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  maybe the English is not that good , 
A:  so 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  um , 
A:  but anyways  
A:  So I tried to do this today 
A:  and 
A:  if you could do it afterwards it would be really nice cuz I 'm quite sure that I can't find every , 
A:  like , orthographic 
A:  mistake in it or something . 
C:  Uh , there  there  there are couple of comments I  I have about the web pages . 
C:  <inbreath> 
A:  Good . 
C:  One is  is the , uh , I think it 's Joe 's , uh , graphic , I think it should be better . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah , the graphics are too bad . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Maybe you are working at it . 
A:  I know . 
D:  You are definitely right . 
D:  It was in a good shape , but 
E:  <sniff> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  OK , 
C:  And then maybe the  
B:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  it , uh , then we disturbed . 
C:  the ICSI logo could be  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  could be  
A:  I can't change 
C:  <inbreath> 
A:  something with a logo . 
C:  could be , uh  
C:  No , it is just , uh  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Maybe we can  we can , 
C:  uh , 
C:  translate the white color into transparent color 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  so it will  get more natural . 
A:  Yeah , OK . 
A:  Good , 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  yeah I ju 
C:  It 's just a suggestion . 
A:  an 
A:  another thing is I 'd want to 
A:  get a link on the logo so that you can 
A:  come from the logo to the  
C:  To the  home page . 
A:  ICSI web p home page  
C:  OK . 
C:  That 's  that 's OK . 
A:  back . 
A:  So . 
A:  That 's  these are th 
A:  some things I have to do . 
A:  Yeah , and if you have something which I should 
A:  put on the web page for you , so 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  yeah , some pictures will be nice , a few sentences will be nice , and 
A:  yeah , it 
A:  depends on how much time you have . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  And then 
A:  the page for inf about  


A:  So , some information for 
A:  people who are 
A:  new comers or , 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  I don't know a good word for it , should we use uh 
A:  " new comers " or  
A:  So , with somebody who is new , arriving here , 
A:  or 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  wants to  
A:  to , uh , send an application ? 
E:  Newbies . 
A:  S 
A:  Huh ? 
E:  Newbies . 
A:  Newbies ? 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , OK . 
A:  So , there I have to add some information , I don't know , I t 
A:  I tried to set up everything by today 
A:  for this page cuz I 've started with this , 
A:  um , if you have any kind of ideas what was important for you 
A:  then just let m 
A:  cuz I have some 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  points like 
A:  um  
A:  I don't know 
A:  f yeah , like Pacific Bell , like uh , long - distance carriers , then like uh , cars and car insurances , 
A:  health insurances  
A:  So , health insurance is k something I can only say for German 
E:  <sniff> 
A:  people . 
C:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
A:  So maybe 
A:  I don't know if this is different in Spain . 
A:  That would be 
A:  fine too , 
A:  to have some information , or in D 
C:  OK . 
A:  nnn 
A:  <inbreath> 
C:  I 
A:  Holland . I don't know . 
C:  I will take a look and I will tell you something . 
A:  Yeah , so how  maybe how you did it or 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  whatsoever . 
D:  OK , I will send you some because I have something in mind . 
A:  So 
A:  yeah , 
A:  then what else 
E:  <cough> 
A:  did I have ? 
E:  <clear throat> 
A:  Then 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  another point 's like , uh , what about the bank , 
F:  <long outbreath> 
A:  uh , so , transferring your money from Europe t 
A:  over here , what is the cheapest way or what could you recommend or something . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  um  
A:  another point  
A:  yeah , and then 
A:  there 's  
A:  there 's another point like going out in Berkeley or what to do in Berkeley or in 
A:  the 
A:  neighborhood . 
E:  This  a lot of this stuff is not networking group  NSA , 
E:  uh , restricted . 
A:  No , I know . 
D:  Yeah , but nobody do that , you know . 
A:  I know . 
A:  But there 's nothing like this on the  
A:  on the 
A:  ICSI page as far as I know . 
D:  So , 
D:  that 's the point . We discussed it still a couple of weeks or months ago . 
D:  Uh , the point is normally it is an ICSI task anyway . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  M 
D:  But 
E:  Yeah , but a at least then it should be  
D:  Right . 
D:  @ @ 
E:  mmm , I think be , uh , ICSI part ,  and not network restricted . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Well , th they have uh , a  a white booklet , 
C:  you know , probably  
D:  Yeah , that is from nineteen ninety - one or nineteen ninety - two , you know . 
A:  Yeah , but it 's not in the  
A:  This is not on the web . 
D:  A  
D:  And this is not on the web , and the  the  the  
C:  No , no , no . 
C:  I  I just  I 
D:  people 
D:  normally  
D:  that 's was my  my , uh  
C:  In fact the Pacific Bell phone was not working , for example 
C:  when I tried the  
C:  the phone on this booklet it was not working . 
D:  Hmm . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  But the thing is that maybe 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  this could be on a starting point or  or  if  digest  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I don't know , maybe I talk with Jane about this . If we can 
A:  use this information , 
A:  I don't know , 
A:  somewhere 
A:  on the ICSI home page too . 
E:  M move it on the normal ICSI , 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  ICSI . 
A:  Maybe . 
E:  Maybe every group has somewhere hidden , uh  
D:  We can do that . 
E:  a gro uh 
E:  deep  
E:  outgoing  
D:  Yeah , but the point is that nobody feel responsible for that . 
D:  And if it 's  
E:  Yeah , but eh  but my point is that it should not be under the networking group 
C:  It 's a common  
E:  thing . eh  But  
D:  Yes , 
D:  Uh , yes , I see there your point . 
E:  OK . 
D:  That 's right . But if it is under the networking points , the group leader is responsible to 
D:  get up to date information . I believe , we are the group , 
D:  where the people are , 
D:  uh , changing 
D:  much more faster to join the group and to leave the group as other groups . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And , so , the most problem 
D:  as  as of , 
D:  uh , it 's likely that uh , the people here in this group needs this information 
D:  um , much more  f uh , often as  as other groups . 
E:  But  
E:  b 
E:  But that could still be 
E:  applicable if you put it under the ICSI site if you take the responsibility for that . 
D:  Yes , I see th 
A:  Yeah , I talk to Jane about this . 
E:  Uh , 
D:  Yeah , but we  we can do that . 
E:  So I think th I think both arguments are not an ar 
E:  are arguments against having this under the normal ICSI page . 
E:  Or only the networking , uh , page . 
F:  But the problem is , are you allowed to change anything on the 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  general ICSI server ? 
A:  No , this is why I have to talk to Jane . 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , that 's  
D:  yeah , that 's a  
F:  So you may need just a link from the main ICSI page to the NSA page . 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  We have the  we have the directory structure , 
D:  of the real UNIX tree . 
D:  in compliance and in accordance 
D:  with what you  
D:  with the structure of the web pages . 
D:  And , um , that means , uh , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  the group leader normally do not have access to the general web pages . 
D:  He has access to the N S A pages . 
D:  And , um , 
D:  but I think that 's an administration problem and that everybody agrees that the information 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  page must be 
D:  on the general , on the highest level . 
D:  OK , I have no problem with that . 
B:  But , uh 
D:  But  
D:  but I think we discuss if still  
B:  your argument is , uh , I think it 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  we have to 
B:  have the right to change it . 
B:  So if there 's anything changing in 
B:  insurances or something  
B:  something like that , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  that we have access 
B:  to this 
B:  page further on  
E:  Yeah . 
B:  to chan to make any changes . 
A:  Yeah , but this is not a problem at all , I  
A:  I mean , if y you are coming from Germany and you know that there is something changed with the health insurance , then you send Jane an email like " Could you please change this , blah - blah - blah . " 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah , but it 's much more complicated . 
F:  Yeah , but that 's  that 's 
F:  effort . 
F:  That 's the whole problem , that nobody wants to do it . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , OK . 
D:  You know how it  you know the process here within the NSA group . 
D:  You know <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yes . 
D:  And  and that was a reason I  we finally decided 
D:  here 
D:  that we put it  information on the N S A page , we have discuss dis this discussed still a couple of months ago  ago . 
B:  I think 
B:  the best solution is really to put a link on the 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  ICSI page 
F:  Yep . 
B:  to this 
B:  stuff . 
B:  And the stuff itself is , uh , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  located at our server . 
D:  In our directory . 
B:  Yeah , 
B:  in our directory , 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  yeah . 
D:  Yeah , we can do that . We then create a link and then we have to ask with Jane , OK ? 
A:  Yes , also fine . 


A:  Yeah . Another point is I want  I want to  would like to add 
A:  a another button , something which is called like " events " or , 
A:  I don't know , 
A:  yeah , I guess I call it " events " like 
C:  Hmm ? 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  where we could s 
A:  uh , 
A:  announce talks which are , 
A:  you know , 
A:  future  talks for the future , or  and where we could also have a link on  
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  for instance the two workshops which have going on , 
A:  uh , 
A:  last summer , 
A:  so , 
A:  Hannes ' workshop and then the workshop from Oliver , 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  that there might be a link behind these workshops and  or former talks we have , 
A:  so like from people who have been here before 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  and he wants to , uh , publish their slides , or an article , or whatsoever , behind there . 
A:  So , that we have like a button for events which are  where 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  workshops can be announced or old workshops could  could be , um , 
A:  shown or 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  whatever . 
D:  Of course that is a living thing . I think it 's a good idea , 
D:  not only that the workshop was a talk announce because they are still announce it is a broader sense . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Eh , but I think the idea from Claudia is very good , 
D:  that 
D:  the slides 
D:  from the talks here , if it 's worth to have it on the web , anyway 
D:  um , should be published in that way that the people can access it . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  For instance I have my USAIA slides . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  maybe 
C:  Yeah , that 's OK , too . 
D:  if 
D:  some 
D:  things and  is going on maybe you have some Multicast slides concerning your work at IGMP and 
D:  uh 
D:  and if we have some talks from EXTERM , 
D:  and we had some in the past , 
D:  we can also put the slides on  on 
D:  these things  because then they 're still cau 
D:  still a growing context for us , opportunity for the people you know there , 
D:  " Oh , this guy did something there , 
D:  maybe I can contact him and ask him 
D:  would you like to do something , contribute , whatever . " 
C:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
D:  Uh , so 
D:  that 's  and I think it 's a great idea from Claudia to  
D:  to have this event page because 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  it 's not 
D:  a big deal , 
D:  you know .  
A:  No , it 's easy to  to add it , 
D:  It 's  it 's  
A:  I mean . 
D:  Yeah , and then it 's  
D:  Nah , OK . If there are no events , then there are no events . But we still have a few which happened in the last year 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  and OK , then it is a growing thing but it 's done automatically that the group leader 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  or the group , uh , put some things eh , also on the web . 
D:  Something in the center pipe . 
D:  Yeah ? 
D:  Everybody agree ? 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Um , I don't know .  Maybe it could be a good thing 
C:  OK . 
B:  if we have such an event button 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  that , um , 
B:  somewhere beneath this button or 
B:  wherever , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  that there 's a date , 
B:  when the last update was . 
B:  So that you know 
B:  it 's worth to 
B:  click this button 
B:  to see there 's a new , um , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  announcement or not . 
A:  Yeah , OK . 
B:  S So otherwise , you are 
B:  often clicking this button and you 
B:  get your old information or even an  uh empty page . 
B:  <inbreath> 
D:  Maybe there 's  
A:  Yeah but this will be then 
A:  down on the button of the page anyways . 
D:  Yeah , maybe we can have " updated on " , 
B:  So 
D:  you know the button itself ? 
B:  Yeah , something like that . 
D:  And then , " updated " 
B:  " Last updated " , 
D:  and the current date , 
B:  yeah . 
D:  when  when something happened . 
D:  I don't know how we deal with that . 
A:  Yep . 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  Is it another thing we have to ? 
A:  Yep . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  So it 's just a su suggestion I don't know how 
B:  easy it is to  to implement something like that . 
B:  <inbreath> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Huh !  OK . 
D:  OK you Well . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Let 's consider 
D:  <outbreath> 
D:  <stretching sound> 
D:  " update event button " .  
D:  <pen clicks closed> 
D:  OK . 


D:  So , and then the next point 
D:  and , I believe , yeah , 
D:  <page turning> 
D:  So ,  
F:  <mike noise> 
D:  not the last one , 
D:  @ @ 
D:  is one that I would like to know the status as far it is possible from everybody 
D:  concerning his 
D:  future intention here 
D:  at ICSI or whether e when he will leave whether he can 
D:  contri or will he consider currently , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  uh , contribute here to the proposal 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  because you know , I 've  I 'm facing the problem , 
D:  if I go back to Siemens and I say " OK , there 's a potential . " 
D:  " There are potential contacts . " 
D:  currently , maybe no money , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  but if we go in one direction 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  it  
D:   it is worth to know 
D:  if people 
D:  can still go on in that area of that kind of work then they are back in their university or their company or whatever . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  and even if it 's nur unschl 
D:  part - time 
D:  jobs and  
D:  and if it 's come to a real proposal , that maybe the people can hook in , 
F:  <long outbreath> 
D:  uh , one more time because I need this information definitely t 
D:  uh , to inform 
D:  the 
D:  uh , 
D:  the Siemens management 
D:  that it 's worth to send me back here . 
D:  So maybe Wilbert you can start . You will leave end of January definitely . 
D:  And currently you see no chance , as far as I know , 
D:  uh , to stay longer here 
D:  and either you will go back to KPN 
D:  or you will stay here and find then a job opportunity another company , is that right ? 
E:  Yes , 
E:  yeah . 
D:  Can you give us more 
D:  details of  concerning the status ? 
E:  No , 
D:  No ? 
E:  no . 
E:  Pending . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  Pending . 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  See for me it 's the same I can also say , uh , 
A:  for me everything has completely changed , so now I go back and I don't anything what to do , 
A:  so it 's like I have to sort everything out when I 'm 
D:  Yes , but you have no  
A:  back in Germany  
A:  but I won't go back to the university so 
D:  yeah ? 
A:  I don't think so . 
D:  So you are looking for a job . That 's probably then  OK . 
D:  in principle , I would like to say you are lost for the NSA group , because 
A:  Then it 's like 
A:  yeah . 
D:  ffft  
D:  that 's uh , 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  Yeah , 
D:  it would be a  
A:  No , no , no .  
D:  a wonder if , uh , 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  it hook in at the same area , you know . 
E:  Uh , but that 's also for me , I 'm kind of lost for the NSA group . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I think so , yeah . 
A:  " Lost " is maybe a bit like  
E:  And oh , also  
B:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  also 
D:  Ja 
E:  <sniff>  
D:  from the work contributions , you know . 


E:  Well , 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  b but I think even  also K P N . 
E:  i 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  is lost for the , uh , for the I C S I . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh , do you know whether they have  
E:  There 's a 
E:  lot of , uh , z 
E:  budget cuts going on and 
E:  nothing is possible anymore , so . 
D:  Um , so from your side 
D:  the statement is , 
D:  um , that , uh , 
D:  independently of your person 
D:  uh , the KPN is 
D:  not  they 're not willing to send us another guy here to ICSI anyway . 
E:  Yes . 
E:  Absolutely . 
D:  And , if they are interested in 
D:  uh , a certain kind of project 
D:  then it must be related 
D:  to a certain kind of really service or a certain kind of end system or real product or whatever kind of thing 
D:  <inbreath> 
E:  I it  
D:  with respect to UMTS , right ? 
E:  It will be different thing . 
E:  It will be a  
E:  it will be a start - up . 
E:  And I know they 're  they 're working on a w 
E:  a few of them in this area , 
E:  but it 's  ou outside of ICSI . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  So , 
D:  KPN and  and ICSI 
D:  in principle . 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  After you will leave here that is . 
D:  Yeah , and then  what do you intend to do in the last two months 
D:  beside of course , looking for , 
E:  u 
B:  Holidays 
E:  Th - 
D:  yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Um , I am working 
E:  now on  on something , 
E:  uh an open source router . 
D:  This is that from from Mark , right ? 
E:  No , in  
D:  Not ? 
E:  well , it 's a little bit u 
E:  out of Mark . I 'm  
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  Right now I 'm interested and I 'm looking into it and I 'm working  started yesterday , actually working on it , 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  to do the , uh  
E:  u 
E:  to do an implementation of the protocol that was designed by Mark , 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  um , on an open - source router that 's different from 
E:  the one that  of Mark 's project . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah , do you finish that and 
E:  S s 
D:  do you believe that you can finish that until 
E:  I hope so . I 
D:  end of January ? 
D:  It sounded  sounded to me a little bit  
E:  That would be cool . 
E:  Yeah . It 's 
D:  little bit ,  hard t hard  hard time constraint , right ? 
E:  hard work . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's right . 
E:  But I 'm working on it . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 


D:  OK , Mi - Miguel , 
D:  maybe you can say also . 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  Oh , I 'll be  
C:  I 'll be here until the end of July . 
C:  And , uh , well , eh 
C:  even later 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  if , uh , there is some interesting work , uh , going on , well I  I will 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  be able to 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  to do some work from Spain too . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  So , that 's my  future 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  uh forecast . 
D:  Mm - hmm , 
D:  and , uh , do you have some students which could be join 
C:  Yeah .  
D:  if there is  
D:  I assume there is a certain activity . Maybe i if you will leave in July 
C:  Yeah , well , you know , 
C:  uh the problem the  I think that we have a  a problem  or a difference in Spain , at least , 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  compared with the Americans . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  And i is that our students are , uh  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  are not getting involved 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  in research 
C:  until they have , 
C:  uh , finished their studies . 
C:  <inbreath> 
E:  <sniff> 
C:  So , uh , it 's something a little bit , uh , strange but it is this  
D:  What ? They are not  
C:  this is the w 
D:  sorry ? 
D:  They are not involved in  in research ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  You know  
D:  What they are doing then ? 
D:  I 'm sorry . 
E:  Lectures . 
D:  Huh ? 
C:  You know , they  
D:  Ach so , ach so , 
D:  OK . 
C:  You  you have to  to pass the different tests and you have to study the different subjects . And , 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  until you have 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  finished with this , uh well  
C:  OK , 
C:  you can do it 
C:  by  by your own , but  
F:  <long outbreath> 
C:  but the thing is that 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  you 're not supposed to do it . 
C:  And usually students are pretty busy 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  for not doing other things . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <inbreath> 
C:  Uh . 
B:  And there 's no final master 's thesis or something like that 
B:  what they have to perform ? 
C:  Ah yeah em nnn ,  not really . 
C:  You know , 
C:  there is . 
C:  There is . But , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  uh , 
C:  it is not a research work . 
C:  Usually it 's an application work . 
C:  <inbreath> So you build a web site , your own E - commerce site , uh , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  whatever , or a program or  
C:  <inbreath> 
D:  Why I didn't study in Spain ? 
C:  but  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <sniff> 
E:  <sniff> 
C:  But it is not , uh , something your 
C:  teacher provides you some research papers and you , 
D:  Mmm . 
E:  <sniff> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  let 's say , build a simulator or try to . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Are certain tasks and so ? 
B:  OK . 
C:  So 
C:  we have , uh , other students are 
C:  which are , uh , 
C:  mmm 
C:  people that has a grant 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  and they are  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  they are starting as , uh , researchers , 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  aaa ,  but 
C:  this is 
C:  only connected 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  to your own funding so if you  if you have projects 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  you can have , 
C:  uh , people working with you . If you don't have , 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  a research project 
E:  <mike noise> 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  well , you cannot pay them so u u usually 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  you don't have anybody . 
C:  So it 's kind of , uh , 
C:  <inbreath> 
E:  <mike noise> 
C:  dependent 
C:  on 
C:  the funding we have 
C:  in some projects . 
C:  So 
C:  w 
C:  it 's 
D:  Hmm ? 
C:  not sure , 
D:  No , 
C:  not really sure . 
D:  there . 
D:  <mike noise> 
D:  We 're not talking about to send the students here to I C S I . 
D:  I 'm talking if there is an activity , at least with the NSA group , 
D:  that certain kind of activities also in the university 
D:  could apply for the master works , of 
D:  diplomas thesis ,  uh , whatever kind of thing 
C:  Yeah , 
C:  we  we  
C:  I think we could  
D:  that  
C:  We could find , uh , 
C:  some , eh work force . 
C:  OK ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Because  well , you  you can , eh , 
C:  fo <tsk> redirect 
C:  you know , the  the work as  uh 
C:  let 's say as a subject work of something 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  that you can  <inbreath> 
C:  you can try to , eh , s 
C:  In some subjects , in fact , 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  eh , the  the  the , uh , topics are more open so 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  you can introduce some research topics too . So  
C:  but 
C:  the main thing is that 
C:  there is a , uh , this 
C:  big difference 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  because , eh , students are not supposed to do 
C:  research , eh , work until they have 
C:  finished their gra their grade . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  You can change that . <long outbreath> 
C:  Yeah , sure . 
E:  M uh , maybe you sh 
C:  Sure . 
E:  I think it 's pretty healthy for a student to  <inbreath> to have a project , eh , where you have to write actually some part of research or . 
C:  Yeah , I think so too ,  but , 
C:  eh , you know , it also depends 
C:  on the subjects because sometimes 
E:  Sure . 
C:  subjects are fixed 
C:  so you cannot  you cannot , uh 
E:  OK . 
C:  uh , give any  any stuff you want . 
C:  You have to  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  to provide a certain  a certain prime  
D:  <clear throat> 
E:  O 
C:  for the subject too ,  
E:  Of course . 
C:  but , 
C:  you know , 
C:  sometimes , especially in the  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  in the latest , eh uh , courses 
C:  uh , things are probably more open and , well , it  it 
C:  is something that can be changed . 
D:  Mm - hmm . OK . Thank you . 


D:  Claudia , I still mentioned , 
D:  Have you other things ?  
D:  For me , as I said before 
D:  I will be funded by a d 
D:  uh by the ministry of , 
D:  uh , the German government for research in the project so - called Invinet 
D:  That seems to be sure . 
D:  And I got 
D:  absolutely freedom 
D:  to do 
D:  what I would like to do , 
D:  and I would like to go on with the QS in advance mechanism 
D:  and , uh , 
D:  in the 
D:  relation of USAIA I also have the 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  activities with Georgia Tech . 
D:  They have now a PHD . It is settled , 
D:  and my other next , uh , generation of contract 
D:  is also going in that sense so the topic is still going  go going on . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  and when I will come back here , I would like to use these things too to maybe come to a 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  closer , a bigger project 
D:  um , outside of this goal , with contributions here from , uh  
D:  first of all from the NSA group and then from  from other partners . 
D:  But this I have definitely ou uh discussed with my management 
D:  and  this will happened , 
D:  I believe , in December , 
D:  maybe , and in the beginning of January . 
D:  and I will keep informed to the management of ICSI anyway , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  but also , 
D:  I assume that my suggestions that we have a weekly phone conference 
D:  and email exchange  during that time 
D:  so that we can 
D:  inform each other 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  concerning what are the questions , what are the problems , what is the status and so on . 
D:  Uh ? But 
D:  I think we will 
D:  uh 
D:  detail these things 
D:  then in one of the last meetings . 


D:  So 
D:  how is your status and  and your ideas and your plans and your future and  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Well 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  I will  
D:  You 're addicted to the testbeds you run on the hour , so that 's  
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  No , no , no , no , no .  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  So I will stay here 
B:  till the end of February 
B:  <outbreath> 
B:  and 
B:  afterwards , um , at Berlin I 'm 
B:  yeah , funded by an institution of the German government , so , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  they are paying me , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  and I have to do research for them , of course . I have to 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  um 
B:  well , uh , 
B:  reach some goals and so on . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  But on the other hand there will be some 
B:  time left I think to do some work on  
B:  this area I started here . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  And for me , myself , I 'm 
B:  also very interested in  in continue this work 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  and so that will 
B:  be manageable 
B:  and , um , 
B:  on the other hand there are also 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  uh , some students or  
B:  well , 
B:  at the moment it 's  quite difficult to find students , eh , who are doing their master 's thesis and so on 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  because there are not a lot of students , uh , which are in this state in Germany now , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  but um , 
B:  about 
B:  two years ago the 
B:  numbers of students 
B:  were , um , studying computer science , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  uh , 
B:  started to increase again and 
B:  so in 
B:  one or two years we will have , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  uh , many students , uh , which are performing their master 's thesis and so 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  I think there will also be , uh , 
B:  many students 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  which are joining in this work . 
B:  So , hopefully , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  uh , I will found  will find some students which are 
B:  joining in and , um  
B:  So , 
B:  hopefully this work will be go on . 
D:  Mm - hmm . OK , sounded good to me . 
D:  And Michael ? 
F:  So ,  I won't change the topic then . 
F:  I 'm here until 
F:  end of May 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  and after that I presumably going to a Siemens project with some  department of gee - mens , but related to that 
F:  topic 
F:  what I have done here . So , 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  it 's some of pre - stage  to that , so it might be more 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  related or loosely related . So it 's 
F:  at least it 's in the same topic . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And  progress , it 's  going on , 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  but it 's not that fast going on as I would have like it . 
F:  <outbreath> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Oh , 
F:  I would like to have it .  Sorry . 
F:  Well 
F:  but oder ? 
D:  Yeah , then , what is the current status anyway ? 
D:  @ @ this is . 


F:  Um , I 'm  currently I 'm looking into 
F:  <outbreath> 
F:  Quality of Service Routing , and I had discussions with a post - doc from the U - UCB . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  Well , 
F:  <outbreath> 
F:  we want to  
F:  we started to 
F:  collect information to 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  write the paper about Quality of Serving  routing . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  for MPLS in an MPLS domain . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So you have  um distributed routing at the edges , 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  and 
F:  one aspect 
F:  is 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  that the information is outdated , so that you know to always have the 
F:  exact information of your links , dates , and so on . 
F:  It what we have plans of that . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And trying to 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  look at some routing  policies , 
F:  or routing algorithms . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Now as I see , in principle , uh 
D:  fff  
D:  that 's a really raw view . 
D:  MPLS offers certain kind of success of active routing , because 
D:  in principle , the 
D:  forwarding pass is a little bit 
D:  decoupled from this  from the routing pass ,  and this was , in principle  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  <inbreath> 
D:  OK , it 's  it 's not 
F:  It  it  
D:  really the subject but in a broader sense it could be seen 
F:  It d yeah . 
D:  in that sense . I think 
D:  uh , there are 
D:  in a certain degree 
D:  some alignment with  with both of you guys , right ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So at least from the desh 
F:  definition of Christian Tschudin , MPLS is a 
F:  subset of  
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  of 
F:  active  route 
F:  active routing . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  So it 's very   It 's static ? It 's  No , active ? 
F:  But it 's sort of active  because they have these program 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  statements . 
D:  Yeah , maybe it 's a separation , in principle , that I do not use the normal traditional , 
F:  But y 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  <inbreath> 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  uh , data forwarding pass 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  and update , in principle , only the routing information 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  Well , they are  they are using 
D:  uh , to  to  to use it . 
C:  the  the  the same idea of labelling  packets 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <inbreath> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  with a  
F:  Yeah . 
C:  with a 
C:  content descriptor or something . 
F:  That 's right . 
D:  Yeah , so what I mean is at a certain degree , 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  yeah , that has to be figured out . 
C:  There 's a connection point .  
D:  There is , uh , there are some linkage between them . 
D:  @ @ 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  in both of your  
D:  your work . 
F:  Yeah . 


D:  So , 
D:  my last point , uh , in principle , is the proposal itself . 
D:  Um 
D:  I know , in the past it was always if I 'm 
D:  not writing something nothing gonna happen . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  So , I believe , Wilbert , you are going out of these activity . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  You have to use your time 
D:  to 
D:  finish your work as you 
D:  uh , 
D:  have in mind until your 
D:  end of February , or is that right ? 
E:  January , yes . 
D:  End of January , sorry , so you will not  y 
D:  you will not find any time to contribute anymore to this 
E:  No . 
D:  activity . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Then from Miguel 's side 
D:  I expect more 
D:  detailed vision . 
D:  We can do it , as I mentioned before , bilateral afterwards , 
C:  Later .  
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  uh , concerning your work and how you think it could be 
D:  beneficial contribution to the activity 
D:  maybe based on the generic 
D:  uh , uh , USAIA architecture . 


D:  I will write 
D:  as 
D:  long as I have time here , 
D:  uh , on the proposal itself and in the near - term future , 
D:  I will 
D:  distribute a list 
D:  of the 
D:  small cluster 
D:  of people . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  I tried to access 
D:  Juan Peire 
D:  several times , 
D:  he didn't answer , because he still had mentioned that there 's some minor funding , 
D:  that I think would help , 
D:  for instance , to have initial meeting 
D:  either here or in Europe or  or wherever . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  I 've , uh , contact 
D:  one more time the professor , what is his name ? Rao ? or  ?  
D:  uh , L Landay mentioned , uh , 
F:  L Lan - 
F:  Landay ? 
D:  Rao , right ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  because he 's a professor in  uh , responsible for the infrastructure at UCB and he has some projects 
F:  Landay . 
F:  Ah . 
D:  which are related to 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  um , these  these , uh , activities 
D:  I would c c name it cor intelligent classroom . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  I don't know whether I can succeed to get an appointment then 
D:  but I will distribute a list  
D:  contact list and @ @ the interests of each partner 
D:  so that everybody can see 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  and 
D:  everybody knows , yeah , I have in mind 
D:  maybe it 's a small NSA group activity 
D:  itself , 
D:  with no linkage to the outer world 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  maybe it 's a NSA group activity with a linkage to the outer world 
D:  based on the 
D:  uh universities at home or the companies at home 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  there 's some linkage 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  and the third stage is , let 's say there 's a NSA group activity in this area , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  uh , with the supported , um , 
D:  home entities 
D:  and with certain kind of linkage here to the companies or u or universities here in this area . 


D:  The last one , I think it 's , uh , the best one . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  But , you see the question is always " Where 's the money ? " 
D:  and I say " Oh poo ,  currently I don't know . " 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  The second question is how long I stay here and say ooo ,   I don't know " , 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  so 
D:  everybody 's waiting . 
D:  Yeah , and the only rea 
D:  um , 
D:  activity could come from the NSA group itself , 
D:  but I think it 's a  a work in process and that it will take some time and , uh , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  everything must be just settled a little bit more . 
D:  So , but anyway , I would like to get contributions 
D:  from the people here of the NSA group concerning proposals , this is a living thing 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  and 
D:  it 's a pity 
D:  that Multicast is , in principle , removed 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  and we do not have any expert from Multicast anymore . 
D:  And , uh , that 's makes very hard , I believe . 
D:  Because that is a major @ @ , 
D:  at least twenty - five percent of the whole network 
D:  uh , stuff 
D:  and , um , but neverless we have to live with this situation . 
D:  Right . 
D:  You are laughing , again ?  <laugh> <inbreath> 
E:  Right . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Right . 
D:  So maybe we have to <makes noise> rewrite something , have new ideas going forward more in 
D:  certain kind of really telecommunication network and the routing and QS stuff , 
D:  and remove , in principle , the Multicast stuff 
D:  which , in principle , a pity because I think that 's a really really good eh  
D:  uh  
D:  mmm 
D:  source of research work 
D:  for the future telecommunication core networks because 
D:  they are still not able to deal with Multicast , they still have there that 
D:  tunnel generations and all those kind of things <inbreath> 
D:  and I  I believe that would be very beneficial to use it for the 
D:  really  uh , mobile scenarios in  in that network , 
E:  <cough> 
E:  <clear throat> 
D:  so  but anyway we have to live with a real situation and that means we have to 
D:  drop Multicast from the proposal . 
D:  <microphone sound> 
D:  Any comments ? 
C:  Oh , not really , you know , 
C:  uh , I  I  I  I think that  
C:  Well , in the future , 
C:  somebody will come 
C:  to the NSA group 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  eh 
D:  Then we can extend the proposal one more time with Multicast . 
C:  Ah , 
C:  so  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  No , I mean <tsk> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <sniff> 
C:  that  
C:  OK , 
C:  I  I  I think that 
C:  it cannot , eh , be , eh considered the first type task to do because 
C:  nobody is  is knowledgeable about multicasting but 
C:  I think that , eh , any of us 
C:  could 
C:  address these things in the future , 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  or maybe 
C:  a new person could address this . 
C:  in the future . So 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  if  
C:  I mean , 
C:  wh what I think is that , 
C:  uh , it  it makes no sense to me 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  to reduce , 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  uh , uh , uh , uh , 
C:  something which is more or less 
C:  complete , 
C:  because we don't have the person . I think that the  the way to  
C:  to go is probably the opposite , to try to find 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  something which has 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  a meaning by itself 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  and then try to get 
C:  the resources to  to  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  to do 
C:  this  
D:  Oh , maybe you understand me in the wrong way . 
D:  Uh , 
D:  I do not mean to drop it , to remove the text from the proposal . 
C:  OK , 
C:  OK . 
D:  I mean , activities , planning activities . 
C:  Sorry . 
C:  Yeah , 
C:  that 's OK . 
D:  Work packages . 
C:  Sorry , sorry , heh ? 
D:  Yeah , 
C:  Now I 
D:  so 
D:  no , no , because that 's , uh , that 's why I mentioned that it is important thing . 
D:  So 
D:  <mike noise> 
D:  Any other question ? 
D:  Any other comment ? 
D:  <microphone sound> 
D:  Oh . 


D:  But , currently there 's only one 
D:  new group member , 
D:  Sven Buchholz , 
D:  who will figure out the thing , 
D:  hmm 
D:  how to say , 
D:  um , the 
D:  taking into account the end system , 
D:  or the limited end system capabilities 
D:  with respect to mobility and the network itself . 
D:  Where it should be ada @ @  where should be , uh , the adaptation process performed 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  to deal with the different devices , 
D:  for ubiquitous access to the network ? Should it be in the end system itself ? 
D:  Should be in the edge device ? It should it be in the core ? should it be on the server ? 
D:  These are the questions he would like to figure out . 
D:  And to p uh , to have , in principle , the pro and cons 
D:  <microphone sound> 
D:  of , uh , different  of all these different approaches . 
D:  So that 's the only 
D:  new member . 
E:  Who is that ? 
D:  Sven Buchholz . 
D:  He was here . I invited him and discussed with him 
D:  his potential 
D:  work , I @ @ .  
D:  quite sure 
E:  Oh , he was here one day . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  Hmm . 
D:  But he showed up the  next day but only for administration stuff , but for the technical discussion he was here one day . 
F:  Several days . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  I I 'm do not remember whether  w whether you were  
A:  That must be three weeks ago , 
A:  cuz I r 
E:  Yeah , I do remember him , but I didn't talk with him about , uh   about the research 
A:  I  just met him when I arrived . 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  topic . 
E:  So I didn't know what he was going to do . 
D:  Yeah , he will come 
D:  mid of January , I believe , yeah , 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  as far as I know . 
D:  So , but this is the only guy , you know , 
D:  but that is not reflected in that sense that we remove the text . 
D:  @ @ 
D:  what I mean is  is , uh , the  
C:  OK . 
D:  that we  
D:  what 's kind of activity we are going more in detail in describing , the network packages and  
D:  and detailed , uh , uh , descriptions  
D:  more detailed descriptions . 


D:  Then we pu should start with reading the numbers 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  one more time . 
A:  Oh , again ? 
E:  We have to do that ?  Oh !  
D:  Yes , we  have to do it , so that means we have to read the transcript script 
A:  I don't know . 
D:  number and then the numbers , 
D:  and if there 's a 
D:  new line , a short break . 
D:  And , afterwards we have to , 
D:  uh , that device is switched on , so please do not 
D:  switch off the devices . 
D:  And I will call Herr Janin and that  Adam @ @ . 
D:  So I will start . 
E:  <cough twice>  
B:  That 's it . 
D:  OK . Thank you . OK , then I will call Adam . 
B:  <laugh>
