C:  OK . 
C:  But wh wh wh what are the box ? 
C:  But what w 
C:  OK . 
C:  You know , I  I can  I can build , eh , any computer uh you n  installing whatever . It 's needed , 
C:  I mean , I will enjoy doing it . 
C:  So . 
C:  That 's OK for me . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah , 
C:  OK . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah , 
C:  I think so . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  That 's OK . 
C:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
C:  OK . 
C:  OK . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Uh , there  there  there are couple of comments I  I have about the web pages . 
C:  One is  is the , uh , I think it 's Joe 's , uh , graphic , I think it should be better . 
C:  Maybe you are working at it . 
C:  OK , 
C:  And then maybe the  the ICSI logo could be  <inbreath> could be  <inbreath> could be , 
C:  uh  
C:  No , 
C:  it is just , 
C:  uh  
C:  Maybe we can  we can , uh , translate the white color into transparent color 
C:  so it will  get more natural . 
C:  It 's just a suggestion . 
C:  To the  home page . 
C:  OK . 
C:  That 's  that 's OK . 
C:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
C:  OK . 
C:  I 
C:  I will take a look and I will tell you something . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Well , th they have uh , a  a white booklet , you know , probably  
C:  No , 
C:  no , no . 
C:  I  I just  I 
C:  In fact the Pacific Bell phone was not working , for example 
C:  when I tried the  the phone on this booklet it was not working . 
C:  But the thing is that maybe <inbreath> this could be on a starting point or  or  if  digest 
C:  It 's a common  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Hmm ? 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah , 
C:  that 's OK , too . 
C:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Oh , I 'll be  I 'll be here until the end of July . 
C:  And , uh , 
C:  well , eh 
C:  even later <inbreath> if , uh , there is some interesting work , uh , going on , 
C:  well I  I will <inbreath> be able to <inbreath> to do some work from Spain too . 
C:  So , that 's my  future <inbreath> uh forecast . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , well , you know , uh the problem the  I think that we have a  a problem  or a difference in Spain , at least , <inbreath> compared with the Americans . 
C:  And i is that our students are , uh  <inbreath> are not getting involved <inbreath> in research until they have , uh , finished their studies . 
C:  So , uh , it 's something a little bit , uh , strange 
C:  but it is this  this is the w 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  You know  
C:  You know , they  
C:  You  you have to  to pass the different tests 
C:  and you have to study the different subjects . 
C:  And , <inbreath> until you have <inbreath> finished with this , uh well  OK , you can do it by  by your own , 
C:  but  but the thing is that <inbreath> you 're not supposed to do it . 
C:  And usually students are pretty busy <inbreath> for not doing other things . 
C:  Uh . 
C:  Ah yeah em nnn ,  not really . 
C:  You know , there is . 
C:  There is . 
C:  But , <inbreath> uh , it is not a research work . 
C:  Usually it 's an application work . 
C:  So you build a web site , your own E - commerce site , uh , <inbreath> whatever , 
C:  or a program or  
C:  but  
C:  But it is not , uh , something your teacher provides you some research papers and you , <inbreath> let 's say , build a simulator or try to . 
C:  So 
C:  we have , uh , other students are which are , uh , mmm people that has a grant 
C:  and they are  <inbreath> they are starting as , uh , researchers , 
C:  aaa ,  but this is only connected <inbreath> to your own funding 
C:  so if you  if you have projects <inbreath> you can have , uh , people working with you . 
C:  If you don't have , <inbreath> a research project <inbreath> well , you cannot pay them 
C:  so u u usually <inbreath> you don't have anybody . 
C:  So it 's kind of , uh , <inbreath> dependent on the funding we have in some projects . 
C:  So 
C:  w 
C:  it 's not sure , 
C:  not really sure . 
C:  Yeah , 
C:  we  we  
C:  I think we could  We could find , uh , some , eh work force . 
C:  OK ? 
C:  Because  well , you  you can , eh , fo <tsk> redirect you know , the  the work as  uh let 's say as a subject work of something <inbreath> that you can  <inbreath> you can try to , eh , s 
C:  In some subjects , in fact , <inbreath> eh , the  the  the , uh , topics are more open 
C:  so <inbreath> you can introduce some research topics too . 
C:  So 
C:  but the main thing is that there is a , uh , this big difference 
C:  because , eh , students are not supposed to do research , eh , work until they have finished their gra their grade . 
C:  Yeah , 
C:  sure . 
C:  Sure . 
C:  Yeah , I think so too , 
C:  but , eh , you know , it also depends on the subjects 
C:  because sometimes subjects are fixed 
C:  so you cannot  you cannot , uh uh , give any  any stuff you want . 
C:  You have to  <inbreath> to provide a certain  a certain prime  for the subject too , 
C:  but , you know , sometimes , especially in the  <inbreath> in the latest , eh uh , courses uh , things are probably more open 
C:  and , well , it  it is something that can be changed . 
C:  Well , they are  they are using the  the  the same idea of labelling  packets <inbreath> with a  with a content descriptor or something . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  There 's a connection point . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Later . 
C:  Oh , not really , you know , 
C:  uh , I  I  I  I think that  Well , in the future , somebody will come to the NSA group 
C:  eh 
C:  Ah , 
C:  so  
C:  No , I mean <tsk> that  
C:  OK , 
C:  I  I  I think that it cannot , eh , be , eh considered the first type task to do 
C:  because nobody is  is knowledgeable about multicasting 
C:  but I think that , eh , any of us could address these things in the future , 
C:  or maybe a new person could address this . in the future . 
C:  So 
C:  if  
C:  I mean , wh what I think is that , uh , it  it makes no sense to me <inbreath> to reduce , <inbreath> uh , uh , uh , uh , something which is more or less complete , 
C:  because we don't have the person . 
C:  I think that the  the way to  to go is probably the opposite , to try to find <inbreath> something which has <inbreath> a meaning by itself 
C:  and then try to get the resources to  to  <inbreath> to do this  
C:  OK , 
C:  OK . 
C:  Sorry . 
C:  Yeah , 
C:  that 's OK . 
C:  Sorry , sorry , 
C:  heh ? 
C:  Now I 
C:  OK .
