F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  Aber das wird jetzt geaendert . 
F:  Das wird geaendert . 
F:  But the problem is , are you allowed to change anything on the general ICSI server ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So you may need just a link from the main ICSI page to the NSA page . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , but that 's  that 's effort . 
F:  That 's the whole problem , that nobody wants to do it . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  So ,  I won't change the topic then . 
F:  I 'm here until end of May 
F:  and after that I presumably going to a Siemens project with some  department of gee - mens , 
F:  but related to that topic what I have done here . 
F:  So , 
F:  it 's some of pre - stage  to that , 
F:  so it might be more <inbreath> related or loosely related . 
F:  So it 's at least it 's in the same topic . 
F:  And  progress , it 's  going on , 
F:  but it 's not that fast going on as I would have like it . 
F:  Oh , 
F:  I would like to have it . 
F:  Sorry . 
F:  Well 
F:  but oder ? 
F:  Um , I 'm  currently I 'm looking into <outbreath> Quality of Service Routing , 
F:  and I had discussions with a post - doc from the U - UCB . 
F:  Well , 
F:  we want to  we started to collect information to <inbreath> write the paper about Quality of Serving  routing . <inbreath> for MPLS in an MPLS domain . 
F:  So you have  um distributed routing at the edges , 
F:  and one aspect is <inbreath> that the information is outdated , so that you know to always have the exact information of your links , dates , and so on . 
F:  It what we have plans of that . 
F:  And trying to <inbreath> look at some routing  policies , or routing algorithms . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  It  it  
F:  It d yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So at least from the desh definition of Christian Tschudin , MPLS is a subset of  <inbreath> of active  route active routing . 
F:  So it 's very   It 's static ? 
F:  It 's  No , active ? 
F:  But it 's sort of active  because they have these program statements . 
F:  But y 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  L Lan 
F:  Landay ? 
F:  Landay . 
F:  Ah . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Several days . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm .
