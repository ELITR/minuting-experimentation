B:  OK , babble , take five . 
B:  Um , so . 
B:  If we can't , we can't . But uh we 're gonna try to make this an abbreviated meeting 
B:  cuz the  the next  next occupants were pushing for it , 
B:  so . 
B:  Um . 
B:  So . 
B:  Agenda is  according to this , is transcription status , DARPA demos XML tools , disks , backups , et cetera and 
B:  OK . 
B:  Should we just go in order ? 
B:  Transcription status ? 
B:  Who 's  that 's probably you . 
B:  Seven ? 
B:  Oh . 
B:  OK , wh 
B:  DARPA demos , 
B:  we had the submeeting the other day . 
B:  And then does it play something back 
B:  or that 's something you 're having to program ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm 
B:  That was a really good look . 
B:  It 's too bad that that couldn't <laugh> come into the  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  And then again , maybe not . 
B:  So , <laugh> uh  
B:  Yeah , that soun that sounds reasonable . 
B:  Yeah , it loo it  my  my recollection of it is it 's  it 's a pretty reasonable uh demo sort of format . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  How about having it run under free BSD ? 
B:  So  
B:  But it would  what would serve  would serve both purposes , is if you contact him and ask him if he 's already done it . 
B:  If he has then you learn , 
B:  if he hasn't then he 'll do it . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Tony Robinson ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Steve Renal - Steve Renals . 
B:  No . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Oh , OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Assuming we 're  
B:  The thing I was asking about with , um , free BSD is that it might be easier to 
B:  get PowerPoint shows running in free BSD than to get this other package running in  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  OK . 
B:  So there was that demo , which was one of the main ones , 
B:  then we talked about um some other stuff 
B:  which would basically be um showing off the  the Transcriber interface itself 
B:  and as you say , maybe we could even merge those in some sense , 
B:  but  but um , 
B:  uh  and part of that was showing off what the speech - non uh nonspeech  stuff that Thilo has done  s  looks like . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Well I think 
B:  at  at the very least we 're gonna want something illustrative with that 
B:  cuz I 'm gonna want to talk about it 
B:  and so i if there 's something that shows it graphically it 's much better than me just having a bullet point 
B:  pointing at something I don't know much about , 
B:  so . 
B:  S so when we here were having this demo meeting , what we 're sort of coming up with is that we wanna have all these pieces together , to first order , by the end of the month 
B:  and then that 'll give us a week or so . 
B:  Ju 
B:  June . June . June . 
B:  Uh  that 'll  that 'll give us  that 'll give us a week or so to uh  to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Well , this is to an audience of researchers 
B:  so I mean , you know , 
B:  to let s the goal is to let them know what it is we 're doing . 
B:  So that 's  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Good . 
B:  Done with that . 
B:  XML tools ? 
B:  Seat ? 
B:  Oh ! Not  not the quality or anything . No . 
B:  OK . I see . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  That 's more seat information than we wanted . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Some of these are missing . 
B:  Aren't they ? 
B:  Some fall out of  
B:  Ah , OK . 
B:  Small shocks 
B:  administered to the  
B:  OK . 
B:  Oh  
B:  Well I guess it is true that even with something that 's backed up it 's not gonna  
B:  if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups . 
B:  Yeah , so the monthly full will be a bear 
B:  but  
B:  Really ? 
B:  So I guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that , 
B:  right ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  So we can get more disk . 
B:  Yeah . So . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Well I was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had uh  
B:  Hmm ! 
B:  Good . CrossPads ? 
B:  CrossPads ? 
B:  So we 've never used them . 
B:  Once ? 
B:  i 
B:  But  
B:  So it 's  it 's um  it 's a regular pad , just a regular pad of paper but there 's this pen which indicates position . 
B:  And so you have time and position stuff stored 
B:  so that you can  you have a record of whatever it is you 've written . 
B:  And one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because uh we were interested in  in higher - level things , 
B:  not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth 
B:  and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting you know , where would it come from ? 
B:  And um I think that was one of the things , 
B:  right ? 
B:  And so the  it seemed like a neat idea . 
B:  We 'll have a  you know , have a scribe , 
B:  have somebody uh take good notes and then that 's part of the record of the meeting . 
B:  And then we did it once or twice and we sort of  
B:  probably chose the wrong scribe 
B:  but it was  <laugh> It 's uh  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Summary . 
B:  I guess  so , you know , what  what makes one think i is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later 
B:  and  and  and put some kind of summary or something 
B:  uh you know , some  there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing , 
B:  not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important . 
B:  But  then you don't  you don't have the time reference uh that you 'd have if you had it live . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Well  one thing that we might try um is on some set of meetings , some collection of meetings , maybe EDU is the right one or maybe something else , 
B:  we  we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . 
B:  I mean , 
B:  uh part of the reason  I think part of the reason that Adam was so interested in uh the SpeechCorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes 
B:  and  
B:  and so forth 
B:  so and  and Jane is more into it 
B:  but eh uh 
B:  you know I don't know if you wanna really do  do this all the time 
B:  so I think the thing is to  to get someone to actually buy into it 
B:  and have at least some series of meetings where we do it . 
B:  Um  
B:  and if so , it 's probably worth having one . 
B:  The p the  the problem with the  the more extended view , 
B:  all these other you know with uh quibbling about particular applications of it 
B:  is that it looks like it 's hard to get people to um uh routinely use it , 
B:  I mean it just hasn't happened anyway . 
B:  But maybe if we can get a person to  
B:  Yeah , I do like the idea of having a couple buttons 
B:  where like one  one button was " uh - oh " 
B:  and then another button was " that 's great " 
B:  and another button " that 's f " 
B:  Right . 
B:  No , no , but it 's just  it 's just storing the pixel informa position information , 
B:  it 's all digital . 
B:  Right . 
B:  You don't have to  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  So we have no 
B:  but  uh by I  I would suggest you return one . 
B:  Because we  we you know , we  we haven't used it at all . 
B:  We have some aspirations of using them 
B:  and  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Maybe Jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there  when  when somebody laughed . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Well dear . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  You know what he means 
B:  but isn't that funny sounding ? 
B:  " We ordered more wireless . " 
B:  It 's like wires are the things 
B:  so you 're wiring  you 're  you 're  you  we 're  we ordered more absence of the thing . 
B:  Anyway . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I mean there 's  there 's all this stuff going on uh between uh Andreas and  and  and Dave and Chuck and others with various kinds of runs 
B:  uh um  recognition runs , 
B:  trying to figure things out about the features 
B:  but it 's  it 's all sort of in process , 
B:  so there 's not much to say 
B:  right now . 
B:  Uh why don't we start with our  our esteemed guest . 
B:  See all you have to do is go away to move way up in the  
B:  We  we could . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Well OK , so let 's do one of those simultaneous ones . 
B:  That sounds good . 
B:  Everybody ready ? 
B:  A one . 
B:  OK , 
B:  a one and a two and a three . 
B:  OK , babble , take five .
