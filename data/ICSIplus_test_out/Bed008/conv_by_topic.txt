B:  Anyway , so my idea f for today and we can uh 
B:  decide that that isn't the right thing to do 
B:  was to at  spend at least part of the time 
B:  trying to 
B:  eh build the influence links , you know 
B:  which sets of things are 
B:  uh relevant 
B:  to which decisions 
B:  and actually I had 
B:  uh specific s suggestion to start first with the path ones . 
B:  The database ones being 
B:  in some sense less interesting to us although probably have to be done 
B:  and so to do that 
B:  so there 's  and the idea was we were gonna do two things 
C:  Is your mike on ? 
D:  Oops .   
D:   
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Ah . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh right , well . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> That 's funny . 
B:  Yeah . We were gonna do two things 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  one of which is 
B:  just lay out the 
B:  influence structure of what we think influences what 
B:  and then as a uh separate but related task 
A:  <clears throat> 
B:  uh particularly Bhaskara and I were going to 
B:  try to decide 
B:  what kinds of belief nodes are needed in order to 
B:  um 
B:  do what we  what we need to do . Once 
B:  so but du we should sort of have all of the uh 
B:  basic design of what influences what 
B:  done before we decide exactly how to compute it . 
B:  So I didn't  did you get a chance to look at all  yet ? 
D:  Yeah , I looked at some of that stuff . 
B:  Great . OK so let 's 
B:  start with the 
B:  uh belief - nets , the general influence stuff and then we 'll  then we 'll also 
B:  at some point break and talk about the techy stuff . 
B:  Well yeah . So here 's  here 's what 's permissible 
B:  is that 
B:  you can arrange 
B:  so that the um 
B:  the value of that 
B:  is gonna have to be updated and n it 's not a belief update , right ? It 's  you took some actions , you spent money and stuff , so the update of that 
B:  is gonna have to be essentially external to the belief - net . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  Right ? 
B:  And then what you 're going to need 
B:  is uh for 
B:  the things that it influences . Well let 's  first of all let 's see if it does influence anything . 
B:  And if it does influence anything 
B:  then you 're gonna need something that converts from 
B:  the  the number here to something that 's relevant to the decision there . 
B:  So it could be ra they create different ranges that are relevant for different decisions or 
B:  whatever  but for the moment this is just 
B:  a node that is conditioned externally 
B:  and might influence 
B:  various things . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Yeah  this is where 
E:  um OK anyways 
E:  let 's 
E:  forget it . 
B:  Well that 's fine . 
B:  Well anyway , go ahead . 
E:  OK , and so 
E:  this , oh 
D:  The other thing is that um every time that 's updated beliefs will have to be propagated but then the question is 
E:  that 
D:  do you  do we wanna propagate beliefs every single time it 's updated or only when we need to ? 
B:  Yeah , that 's a good question . 
B:  And uh 
B:  does it have a lazy mode ? 
B:  I don't remember . 
D:  Uh 
D:  Well , I mean , in Srini 's thing there was this thing  there was this um 
B:  Oh right . 
D:  option like proper inferences which suggests that uh 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  S probably does . 
D:  doesn't happen , automatically . 
B:  Yeah 
B:  someone has to track that down , but I  but uh 
E:  I just accidentally 
B:  And  and  and I think  actually uh 
E:  Oops .  
B:  one of the we w items for the uh 
B:  user 
B:  home base 
B:  uh should be uh 
B:  essentially non - local . 
B:  I they 're only there for the day and they don't have a place that they 're staying . 
D:  Well 
E:  Oh just uh accidentally erased this , I  I just had values here such as uh 
E:  um is he s we had 
E:  in our list we had " Is he staying in our hotel ? " , " Is he staying with friends ? " , and so forth uh 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  so we 're 
E:  OK . 
A:  Can I ask about " slurred " and " angry " as inputs to this ? <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  That 's a 
A:  What  why ? 
D:  Like they 're either true or false and 
E:  The prosody ? 
A:  OK . <laugh> 
D:  they uh 
D:  oh I see . 
C:  If the  
C:  if the person talking is angry or slurs their speech 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  they might be tired or , you know 
A:  OK . Drunk . 
D:  Therefore 
C:  And , you know , possibly uh 
A:  Less likely to enter . 
A:  Hmm . <laugh> 
C:  some , yeah . 
D:  uh I was thinking less likely to view 
B:  Yeah . But that 's - that seems to , yeah . So  so my advice to do is  is 
B:  get this down to what we think is actually likely to  to be a  a strong influence . 
A:  OK . 
D:  Right . 
B:  But yeah , that was what he had in mind . 
B:  So let 's think about this  this question of 
B:  how do we wanna handle  
B:  so there 're two separate things . One is  
B:  So let me suggest we switch to 
B:  another one , I mean clearly there 's more work to be done on this but I think it 's gonna be more instructive to  to think about 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <clears throat> 
B:  uh other decisions that we need to make in path land . 
B:  And what they 're gonna look like . 
C:  So you can save this one as and open up the old one , right and  
C:  and then everything would be clean . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  You could do it again . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Why , I think it 's worth saving this one but I think I 'd  I 'd like to keep this one cuz I wanna see if  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  if we 're gonna reuse any of this stuff . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah .  
E:  Um 
E:  so this might be 
E:  What next ? 
B:  Well you tell me , so in terms of the 
B:  uh 
B:  But 
B:  um 
B:  What I was gonna suggest next 
B:  is maybe we wanna work on this a little longer 
B:  but I do want to also talk about 
B:  the thing that we started into now of 
B:  uh 
B:  well it 's all fine to say all these arrows come into the si same place 
B:  what rule of combination 
B:  is used there . 
B:  So th yes they  so these things all affect it , how do they affect it ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . Right . 
B:  And belief - nets have their own beliefs about uh what are good ways to do that . 
B:  So is it  it 's  it 's clearer n clear enough what the issue is , right ? 
D:  Right . 
B:  So do we wanna switch that now or we wanna do some more of this ? 
E:  R basically 
A:  <mouth> 


E:  Well I think one could go 
E:  there 's 
E:  I think we can di discuss everything . 
E:  First of all this I added , I 
E:  knew from 
E:  sort of basically this has to be there right ? Um 
B:  Oh are you gonna go there or not ? Yeah , so one i 
E:  Given  given uh uh not transverse the castle , the decision is does the person want to go there or is it just 
B:  Right , true . Does have to be there . 
E:  And 
B:  And I 'm sure we 'll find more as we go that 
E:  Hmm ? 
E:  So Go - there in the first place or not is definitely 
E:  uh one of the basic ones . We can start 
E:  with that . 
E:  Interesting effect . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Um 
E:  Is this 
E:  basically true or false 
E:  or maybe 
E:  we 'll get 
B:  Well  
D:  Which one ? 
E:  what ? 
A:  " Go there " . 
E:  m right . Here we 
B:  so 
B:  there is this question about 
E:  we actually get just probabilities , right for each down here . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  When we 're  yeah when we 're done . 
E:  Hmm . 
B:  So  so @ @ 
B:  the  the reason it might not be true or false 
B:  is that we did have this idea of when 
B:  so it 's , you know 
B:  uh current @ @ and so forth and so on or not at all , right ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  And so that a decision would be 
B:  do we want 
B:  that 
B:  so you could  two different things you could do , you could have 
B:  all those values for Go - there or you could have Go - there be binary and given that you 're going there 
E:  When . 
B:  when . 
E:  How . 
B:  Yeah and so forth . 
E:  Why , yeah . 
B:  So I 'll let 
B:  we 'll see . 
E:  Hmm ? 
A:  I mean it seems that you could 
A:  um 
A:  uh it seems that those things would be logically independent like you would wanna have them 
A:  separate or binary , Go - there and then the  the possibilities of how to go there because  
B:  OK , that 's  let 's start that way . 
A:  because , you know it might be easy to figure out that this person is going to need more film eventually from their utterance but 
E:  Hmm . 
A:  it 's much more complex to query 
A:  when would be the most appropriate time . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  OK . 


E:  And so I 've tried to come up with some initial 
E:  things one could observe so who is the user ? 
E:  Everything that has user comes from the user model everything that has situation comes from the situation model - A . 
E:  We should be 
E:  be clear . 
E:  But when it comes to sort of writing down when you  when you do these things is it here ? 
E:  You sort of 
E:  have to a write the values this can take . 
B:  Right . 
E:  And here I was really 
E:  uh in some 
E:  s sometimes I was really sort of standing in front of a wall feeling very stupid because 
E:  um  this case it 's pretty simple , but as we will see the other ones 
E:  um 
E:  for example if it 's a running budget 
E:  so what are the discrete values of a running budget ? 
E:  So maybe my understanding there is too impoverished . 
A:  Hmm . 
E:  How can I write here that this is something , a number that cr keeps on changing ? 
B:  No uh 
E:  But OK . 
E:  Thus is understandable ? 
C:  Yes . 
A:  Think so . <laugh> 
E:  So here for example . 
B:  You 've s have you seen this before at all Keith , these belief - net things ? 
A:  Uh , no , but I think I 'm following it . <laugh> 
A:  So far . 
E:  So here is the  the  we had that the user 's budget may influence 
E:  the outcome of decisions . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  <clears throat> 
D:  Hmm . 
E:  There we wanted to keep sort of a running total of 
E:  things . 
D:  Is this like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend ? 
D:  OK , h well I mean how is it different from user finance ? 
E:  Um the finance is sort of here thought of as  as the financial policy a person 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  carries out in his life , he  is he cheap , average , or spendy ? 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Alright . 
E:  And um I didn't come uh maybe a user 
E:  I don't know , I didn't want to write greediness , but 
A:  Yeah .  
A:  Hmm . 
E:  Welcome . 
B:  Or cheapness . 
E:  Welcome . <laugh> 
A:  User thrift . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Thrift , that 's good . 
B:  Great . 
E:  There it is . 
B:  Yeah . So Keith 
B:  w what 's behind this is actually a program that will 
B:  once you fill all this in actually s solve your belief - nets for you and stuff . So this is not just a display , this is actually a GUI to 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  a simulator that will 
B:  if we tell it all the right things we 'll 
B:  wind up with a functioning belief - net at the other end . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
E:  And it 's so simple even I can use it . 
A:  <laugh> Wow , that is simple . 
E:  <laugh> 
E:  OK , so here was OK , I can think of uh 
E:  people being cheap , average , or spendy or we can even have a  a finer scale moderately cheap , doesn't matter . 
B:  Doesn't matter . 
E:  Agree there 
E:  but here 
E:  um 
E:  I wasn't sure what to write in . 
B:  Let 's  
B:  go ahead . 
D:  Well , I mean 
D:  you 've written in  you 've written in what uh seems to be required like what else is  is 
D:  do you want ? 
E:  If that 's permissible then I 'm happy . 


B:  So 
B:  it 's clear where w w w where we are right now . 
B:  So my suggestion is we just pick 
B:  uh 
E:  Something down here ? 
B:  one , you know one uh particular one of the uh 
B:  well let 's do the first  first one let 's do the one 
B:  that we 
B:  sort of already think we did so w that was the  of the endpoint ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And um 
E:  Oops .  
D:  Is 
D:  hmm 
E:  Ah , OK . 
D:  So it 's true or false ? 
E:  No no no , EVA . 
B:  No , that 's  that 's a @ @ 
E:  Missed that one . 
D:  So 
C:  What 's the difference between mode 
D:  I thought mode , yeah . 
C:  and endpoint ? 
B:  although that 
E:  Um mode was um 
B:  Well , that 's @ @ 
D:  Mode of transportation ? 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  OK . 
D:  <laugh> Also true or false . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  No , he has he hasn't filled them in yet , is what 's true . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , OK . 
E:  Did I or didn't I ? 
E:  Ah . 
E:  Probably nothing done yet , oh I just did it on the upper ones , OK . 
E:  Makes sense . 
E:  OK , so this was EVA . 
E:  Maybe we can think of more things , cross 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
A:  Climb , rob . 
E:  climb , emerge 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  No no no , these are ju that 's just a point , this is ju 
C:  Uh <laugh> 
D:  Well some of those 
D:  are subsumed by approach . 
C:  Would it be an endpoint if you were crossing over it ? 
A:  The Charles Bridge , you know . 
B:  Yeah , would be a f for a given segment . 
B:  You know , you  y you go  first go the town square 
C:  Well I 
A:  No , I mean , if you go to re you know if you go to Prague or whatever one of your  your key points that you have to do is cross the Charles Bridge 
C:  eh 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  and doesn't really matter which way you cross 
A:  which  where you end up at the end but the part  the good part is walking over it , so . 
B:  That 's subtle , but true . Anyway 
B:  so let 's just leave it three  with three for now 
E:  Mm - hmm , mmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  and let 's see if we can get it linked up 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  just to get ourselves 
B:  started . 
A:  <clears throat> 
E:  OK , we 
B:  You 'll see it  you 'll see something comes up immediately , that the reason I wanna do this . 
E:  w well the uh user was uh 
B:  Right . 
E:  definitely 
E:  more likely to enter if he 's a local 
B:  Right . 
E:  more likely to view if he 's a tourist 
E:  um 
E:  and then of course we had the fact that 
E:  given the fact that he 's thrifty and there will be admission then we get all these cross um 
B:  We did , but the three things w that  that it contributed to this 
B:  in fact , the other two aren't up there . 
B:  so one was the ontology 
E:  We 'll d what type of building is it ? Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  And the  and the third thing we talked about was something from the discourse . 
E:  What he has mentioned before . 
B:  OK , so this is w 
B:  Right , so what w I  what we seem to need here , this is why it starts getting into the technical stuff 
A:  mm - hmm 
B:  the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes 
B:  uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from 
B:  the uh 
B:  user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse . 
B:  So each of those 
B:  the way we had it designed , now we can change the design , but the design we had 
B:  was there was a decision with the same three outcomes 
A:  mm - hmm 
B:  uh based on the th those three separate considerations 
B:  so if we wanted to do that 
E:  Uh we can load it up it you know very simple . 
A:  So - 
B:  would have to put in 
B:  uh 
B:  three 
B:  intermediate nodes 
B:  and then what you and I have to talk about is , OK if we 're doing that and they get combined somehow 
B:  uh how do they get combined ? 
B:  But the  they 're  they 're undoubtedly gonna be more things to worry about . 
E:  So this was adjusted for this one mode thing . 
D:  Oh yes . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  So that 's w w in our uh in  in Johno 's 
E:  sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to 
E:  whether a person wants to enter , view , or approach something . 
B:  Oh , it was called mode , so this  this is 
B:  m mode 
B:  here means the same as 
E:  Is now 
E:  this endpoint . 
B:  endpoint . 
C:  Right . 
B:  OK , why don't we ch can we change that ? 
E:  We can just rename that , yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Alright . 
B:  You know , but that was actually , yeah unfortunately 
B:  that was a um 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  kind of an intermediate versio that 's I don't think what we would currently do . 


B:  uh at least two . One is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology 
B:  now what we talked about , and this is another technical thing Bhaskara , is 
B:  uh can we arrange so that 
B:  I think we can 
B:  so that the belief - net itself 
B:  has properties 
B:  and the properties are filled in uh from on ontology items . So the  let 's take the case of the 
B:  uh this endpoint thing , the notion was 
B:  that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site , you know some kind of landmark 
B:  is it a place of business uh is it something you physically could enter 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK , et cetera . 
B:  So that there 'd be certain properties that would fit into the decision node 
B:  and then 
B:  again as part of the ou outer controlling conditioning of this thing 
B:  those would be set , so that some somehow 
B:  someone would find this word , look it up in the ontology , pull out these properties , put it into 
B:  the belief - net , and then the 
B:  decision would flow . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Now 
E:  Seems to me that we 've sort of e em embedded a lot , em 
E:  embedded a lot of these uh things we had 
E:  in there previously 
E:  in  in  in some of the other final decisions done here , for example 
E:  if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something 
B:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
E:  um if it 's exhibiting itself it is a landmark , meaning more likely to be viewed 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yep . 
E:  if it is exhibiting pictures or sculptures and stuff like this , then it 's more likely to be 
E:  entered . 
B:  I uh that 's  I think that 's completely right 
B:  and um 
B:  I think that 's good , right ? 
B:  So what  what that says is that we might be able to 
B:  uh 
B:  take 
B:  and 
B:  in particular so  so the ones we talked about were 
B:  uh exhibiting and selling 
E:  Accessibility . 
B:  no , accessibility meant 
E:  If it 's closed one probably won't enter . 
E:  Or if it 's not accessible to a tourist ever 
B:  OK . 
E:  the likelihood of that person actually wanting to enter it , given that he knows it , of course . 
B:  Alright . So let me suggest this . 
B:  Uh 
B:  w could you move those up about halfway . 
B:  Uh 
B:  The ones that you th 
B:  And selling I guess . 
E:  Yeah , all  all of these if it 's fixing things 
E:  selling things , or servicing things 
B:  Right . 
B:  So here  here 's what it looks like 
B:  to me . 
B:  is that you want an intermediate structure 
B:  which i uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of  
B:  of uh selling , f fixing , or 
B:  servicing . 
B:  So that it 
B:  uh 
B:  that is , for certain purposes , it becomes important but for this kind of purpose 
B:  uh one of these places is quite like the other . 
B:  Does that seem right ? 
B:  So we di if we 
C:  Basic - 
C:  you 're basically just merging those for just the sake of endpoint decision ? Yeah . 
B:  Yes . So if  well it may be more than endpoint decisions , so the idea would be 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  that you might wanna merge those three 
E:  These three ? 
B:  Yeah . Eh ser s uh selling , fixing , and servicing . 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  What ex um and so either those is true f or false ? 
D:  So 
B:  Uh 
B:  Uh well it  it  i here 's where it gets a little tricky . 
B:  Uh from the belief - net point of view it is 
B:  from another point of view of course it 's interest it 's  it 's important to know what it 's 
B:  selling or servicing and so forth . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  OK . 
B:  So for this decision 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  it 's just uh true or false 
B:  and in th this is a case where the or seems just what you want . 
D:  OK . 
B:  That  that if any of those things is true 
B:  then it 's the kind of place that you 
B:  uh 
E:  Um more likely to enter . 
B:  are more likely to enter . 
D:  So you just wanna have them all pointing to a 
B:  You could , yeah . 
D:  summary thing ? 
B:  Yeah , so let 's do that . 
B:  No no , no eh to  to an inter no , an intermediate node . 
D:  T 
E:  Oh , OK . 
B:  That 's the p part of the idea , is 
E:  Um is  is that the object type node ? 
B:  I d 
E:  So are they the  is it the kind of object that sells , fixes , or services things ? 
B:  Well , o open up object type and let 's see what its values are . 
E:  Oh I just created it , it has none so far . 
B:  Oh , well OK first of all it 's not objects , we called them entities , right ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  And then we have sort of the um 
B:  Let 's say I put commercial . 
E:  Yeah , I w I was just gonna commercial action inside 
E:  where people p 
B:  Well couldn't I do  let 's do commercial 
B:  uh 
B:  landmark 
B:  and 
E:  And where was the 
E:  accessible , yeah . 
B:  Well 
B:  accessible I think is different 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  cuz that 's tempor that  that varies temporally , whereas 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  this is a 
C:  What would a hotel fall under ? 
B:  I would call that a service , but  but I don't know . 
C:  Well I mean in terms of entity type ? 
B:  Say w w well it 's co I would s a a again 
B:  for this purpose I think it 's commercial . 
B:  Someplace you want to go in to do some kind of business . 
C:  OK . 
D:  Um what does the 
D:  underscore - T at the end of each of those things signify ? 
E:  Um things . 
E:  So places that service things 
D:  Uh - huh . 
E:  sell things or fix things and pe 
D:  OK . 
E:  places that e exhibit things . 
D:  OK . 
D:  That also points to entity type I guess . 
A:  So we 're deriving um 
A:  this  the  this feature of whether the  
A:  the main action at this place happens inside or outside or what we 're deriving that from what kind of activity is done there ? 
A:  Couldn't you have it as just a primitive feature of the 
B:  Well you could , that 's a  that 's a choice . 
A:  entity ? 
A:  OK . 
B:  So 
B:  uh 
A:  I mean it seems like that 's much more reliable cuz you could have outdoor places that sell things and 
A:  you know indoor places that do something else and 
B:  Yeah , the problem with it is 
B:  that it sort of 
B:  putting in a feature just for one decision , now w we may wind up having to do that 
A:  Hmm . 
B:  this i anyway , this i 
A:  OK . 
B:  at a mental level that 's what we we 're gonna have to sort out . 
A:  OK . 
B:  So , you know what does this look like , what are  what are 
B:  uh intermediate things that are worth computing , what are the features we need 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  in order to 
D:  <mike sounds> 
B:  make all these decisions 
B:  and what 's the best way to organize this 
B:  so that um 
B:  it 's clean and  and 
A:  OK . 
B:  consistent and all that sort of stuff . 
A:  I 'm just thinking about how 
A:  people , human beings who know about places and places to go and so on would store this and it would probably  you wouldn't just 
A:  sort of remember that they sell stuff and then deduce from that that 
E:  Well I think an entity maybe should be regard as a vector of several possible things , it can either 
A:  it must be going on inside or something . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  em 
E:  do s do sell things , fix things , service things , exhibit things , it can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things , it 's not either or mmm 
D:  <mike sounds> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  certainly a place can be a hotel and a famous site . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Many come to mind . 
E:  Things can be generally 
E:  um a landmark and be accessible . 
E:  IE a  a castle or can be a landmark a or not accessible , some statue you know can 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  go inside . 
B:  OK . 


B:  Anyway so let me suggest you do something else . 
B:  Uh which is to 
B:  get rid  get rid of that l long link between who  the user 
D:  <mike sounds> 
B:  and the endpoint . 
E:  Could we just move it like this ? 
B:  No no , I don't want the link there at all . 
E:  Oh , OK . 
B:  Because what we 're gonna want is an intermediate 
B:  thing which is 
B:  uh the 
B:  endpoint decisi the endpoint decision 
B:  based o on the user models , so what we  we  what we talked about is three separate 
B:  endpoint decisions , so let 's make a new node 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  Just as a suggestion maybe you could " save as " to 
C:  keep your old one nice and clean and 
C:  so you can mess with this one . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  The old one was not that 
E:  not that important , I think but 
C:  OK , well , not a big deal then . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Let 's do it then . 
C:  Well the  
C:  Isn't there a " save as " inside of java base ? 
E:  But 
E:  I can just take this 
C:  OK . 
E:  copy it somewhere else . 
E:  This was user something or 
B:  Well this was uh let 's p put it this  let 's do endpoint 
B:  underbar - U . 
D:  <mike sounds> 
E:  end 
E:  point ? 
B:  i endpoint , e end poi this is sa 
E:  Ah . 
B:  it 's the endpoint 
E:  Gotcha , yeah . 
B:  let 's say underbar - U , so that 's the endpoint decision 
B:  uh as seen through the 
C:  As related from the user model . 
B:  Right . 
B:  So let 's  let 's actually 
B:  yeah so lin you can link that up to the 
E:  Should I rename this  too ? No . 
B:  uh yeah , so that , I guess that 's endpoint 
B:  uh 
E:  It 's underscore - E .  
B:  underscore - E for entity , and we may change all this , but . 
B:  Right . 
B:  And 
E:  OK , shouldn't I be able to move them all ? No .  Or  ?   Can I ? 
E:  Mmm - mm .   
E:  Where ? What ? 
B:  Oh I d eh I don't know . 
B:  Actually , I guess the easiest thing would move  mo 
A:  <mike sounds> 
B:  move the endpoint , well , go ahead . 
B:  Just do whatever . 
E:  Wasn't this possible ? 
B:  Well . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  I think you have to be in move mode before 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  OK . 
B:  Good . 
B:  Right . 
E:  So now we 're looking for user related things that um 
B:  Yeah . And uh maybe th maybe it 's just one who is the user , I don't know , maybe  maybe there 's more . 
A:  Huh . 
E:  Well if he 's usi if he 's in a car right now 
E:  what was that 
E:  people with Harry drove the car into the cafe 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Never mind .  
B:  Uh 
B:  anyway , this is crude . 
B:  Now but the  now so  so  but then the question is 
B:  uh 
B:  so  and  and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology , but then we had this third idea 
B:  of input from the discourse . 
E:  Well 
E:  let 's  should we finish this , I mean but surely the user interests 
B:  Sure , OK . 
C:  The user thrift , the user budget . 
E:  yeah , yeah 
B:  Well , maybe , I again , I d 
B:  well , OK , put em in but 
B:  what we 're gonna wanna do is actually uh 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Well is  
E:  Here this was one of my problems we have 
E:  the user interest is a  is a vector of five hundred values , so 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  um 
D:  Oh you mean level of interest ? 
E:  That 's from the user model , mm - hmm , no not levels of interest but things you can be interested in . 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  Well  <laugh> 
B:  somebody else has built this user model . 
E:  Gothic 
D:  Oh I see , right . 
E:  churches versus Baroque 
E:  townhouses versus 
D:  So why is it 
D:  oh it , so it 's like a vector of five hundred one 's or zero 's ? 
E:  Yea - n is that 
D:  Like for each thing are we  are you interested in it or not ? 
E:  yeah uh I  I think 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  I see . 
A:  Hmm . 
B:  OK . So 
B:  uh you cou and so here let me give you two ways to handle that . 
B:  Alright ? 
B:  One is um you could ignore it . 
B:  But the other thing you could do 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  is have an  and this will give you the flavor of the  of what @ @ 
B:  you could have a node that 's  that was a measure of the match between the 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <clears throat> 
B:  object 's feature , you know , the match between the object 
B:  the entity , I 'm sorry 
E:  Uh . 
B:  and the user . 
D:  <mike sounds> 
B:  So you could have a k a " fit " node 
B:  and again that would have to be computed by someone else 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  but uh 
B:  so that uh 
E:  Just as a mental note 
E:  uh 
B:  Yeah , that 's all . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And  and 
E:  should we say that this interests eh affects the likelihood of  of entering ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I mean , we could . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  And also 
E:  if it 's an expensive place to enter , this may also 
B:  OK . 
D:  Budget . 
A:  User schedule . <laugh> 
E:  Schedule ? 
A:  " Do I have time to go in and climb all the way to the top of the Koelner Dome  or do I just have to  " 
B:  Right . 
A:  " time to take a picture of the outside ? " 
C:  It seems like everything in a user model a affects  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Well that 's what we don't wanna do , see that  se cuz then we get into huge combinatorics and stuff like that 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  an 
C:  Cuz if the , I mean , and if the user is tired , the user state , right , it would affect 
D:  Well 
C:  stuff , but 
B:  Well , but 
C:  I can't see why e anything w everything in the model wouldn't be 
D:  Right . 
B:  <mike sounds> 
B:  Well , that  that 's  we can't do that , so we we 're gonna have to 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  but this is a good discussion , we 're gonna have to somehow figure out 
D:  <mike sounds> 
B:  uh some way to encapsulate 
B:  that 
B:  uh so if there 's some general notion 
B:  of for example 
B:  the uh 
B:  relation to the time to do this to the amount of time the guy has or 
B:  something like that is  is the uh 
B:  compatibility with his current state , so that 's what you 'd have to do , you 'd have to get it down to something 
B:  which uh 
B:  was itself relatively compact , so it could be 
B:  compatibility with his current state 
B:  which would include his money and his time and  and his energy 
C:  Yeah , just seems like it 'd push the problem back a level . Yeah , but 
D:  Right . 
B:  It does . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  No but , it 's more than that , like the  the more sort of you break it up @ @ like because if you have everything pointing to one node it 's like exponential 
D:  whereas if you like keep breaking it up more and more it 's not exponential anymore . 
B:  So it yeah , there are two advantages . That 's tha there 's one technical one 
C:  Sh - sh yeah ,  
B:  and the other is it  it gets used 
C:  S so we 'd basically be doing subgrouping ? 
C:  Subgrouping , basically into mo 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  so basically make it more tree like going backwards ? 
D:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  But it  there 's two advantages , one is the technical one that you don't wind up with such big exponential 
E:  @ @ 
E:  Bhaskara ? 
D:  <mike sounds> 
B:  uh CBT 's , the other is it can be  it presumably can be used for multiple decisions . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  So that if you have this idea 
D:  Right . 
B:  of the compatibility with the requirements of an action to 
B:  the state of the user 
B:  one could well imagine that that was u 
B:  not only is it sim is it cleaner to compute it separately but it could be that it 's used in multiple places . 
B:  Anyway th so in general this is the design , this is really design problem . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  OK , you 've got a signal , a d set of decisions 
B:  um how do we do this ? 
E:  What do I have under user state anyhow 
E:  cuz I named that already something . 
E:  Oh that 's tired , fresh , yeah . 
E:  Maybe should be renamed into physical state . 
B:  Or fat user fatigue even . 
A:  Hmm . 
E:  That 's with a " G " ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Whatever . 
E:  Then we can make a user state . 
B:  What 's th what we 're talking about is compatibility . 
B:  Uh or something , I don't know , but . 


C:  I guess the  the question uh is 
C:  It 's hard for me to imagine how 
C:  everything wouldn't just contribute to user state again . 
C:  Or user compatibility . 
B:  Oh but 
B:  the thing is 
B:  that we uh uh 
B:  we had some things that 
B:  uh 
E:  That don't . 
B:  that don't 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  The user interests and the user 
E:  who  who  who the user is 
E:  are completely apart from the fact whether he is tired 
E:  broke 
C:  Sure , but other  I thought though the node we 're creating right now is user compatibility to the current action , right ? 
B:  the 
B:  right 
C:  Seems like everything in the user model would contribute to whether or not the user was compatible with something . 
B:  Uh maybe not . I mean the  that 's the  the issue is um 
B:  would 
B:  Even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had and can make use of . 
B:  And anyway we 're gonna have to find some way to cl 
B:  uh get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible . 
E:  Maybe um if we look at the  if we split it up again into sort of um 
E:  if we look at the uh the endpoint again 
E:  we  we said that 
E:  for each of these things there are certain preconditions 
E:  so you can only enter a place if you are 
E:  not too tired to do so 
E:  and also eh have the money 
E:  to do so if it costs something 
E:  so if you can afford it 
E:  and perform it 
E:  is preconditions . 
E:  Viewing usually is cheap 
E:  or free . 
E:  Is that always true ? I don't know . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Well , with the way we 're defining it I think yeah . 
B:  W w 
B:  but that eh viewing it without ent yeah view w with our definition of view it 's free 
B:  cuz you 
E:  And so is approaching . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Well what about the Grand Canyon , right ? No , never mind . I mean are there  are there large things that you would have to pay to get up close to like , I mean 
A:  never mind , not in the current  
B:  No we have to enter the park . 
A:  OK . 
B:  Eh almost by definition 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  um 
B:  paying involves entering , ge going through some 
A:  OK . Right , sure . 
C:  <mike sounds> 
B:  Right . 
B:  Uh 


E:  Well let 's  th this 
B:  planner what 's  what 's a good one to do ? 
E:  go there or not I think is a good one . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh 
E:  Is a very basic one . 
E:  So 
E:  what makes things more likely 
E:  that  
E:  So 
B:  Well the fir see the first thing is , getting back to thing we left out of the other 
B:  is 
B:  the actual discourse . 
B:  So Keith this is gonna get into your world because 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  uh we 're gonna want to know 
B:  you know , which constructions indicate 
B:  various of these properties 
B:  s 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  and 
B:  so 
B:  I  I don't 
B:  yet know how to do this , I guess 
B:  we 're gonna wind up pulling out 
B:  uh discourse properties like we have object properties and we don't know what they are yet . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  So that  that the Go - there decision will have 
B:  a node from 
B:  uh discourse , and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be 
A:  <mike sounds> 
E:  <mike sounds> 
B:  as a placeholder for 
E:  We  we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint . 
B:  Of  of course . 
E:  Identified that 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  and so 
E:  again re that 's completely correct , we have the user model , the situation model here , we don't have the discourse model here yet . 
E:  Much the same way as we didn't  we don't have the ontology here . 
B:  Well the ontology we sort of 
E:  Really . 
B:  said we would pull these various kinds of properties from the ontology like exhibiting , selling , and so forth . 
B:  So in some sense it 's  it 's there . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  But the discourse we don't have it represented at all yet . 
A:  <mike sounds> 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Um 
E:  This be specific for second year ? 
E:  Um 
E:  And  and we probably will have uh 
E:  something like a discourse for endpoint . 
B:  But if we do it 'll have the three values . 
E:  Hmm ? 
B:  It 'll have the EVA values if  if we have it . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK 
E:  just for starters 
E:  and here 
E:  discourse um 
B:  So  so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out 
B:  is what this says is that 
B:  uh there sh should be a link , and this is where things are gonna get very messy 
B:  from the endpoint 
B:  uh 
D:  I guess the final 
B:  decision maybe the t they 're final re and , I guess 
B:  the very bottom endpoint decision 
B:  uh to the Go - there node . 
B:  And I  don't worry about layout , I mean then we 'll go  we 'll go nuts 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
B:  but 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Maybe we could um have intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go - there S node 
D:  sort of fed into ? 
B:  Could be , yeah . 
A:  <clears throat> 
D:  Right . 
D:  Because that 's what we , I mean that 's why this situation comes up . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Well the Go - there , actually the Endpoint node could feed  feed into the Go - there S 
D:  Yeah , right . 
B:  That 's right , so the Endpoint node , make that up t t 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  to the Go - there then 
B:  and again we 'll have to do layout at some point , but something like that . 
B:  Now it 's gonna be important not to have loops by the way .  
E:  <laugh> I was just gonna 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh really important in  in the belief worl net world not to have loops uh 
D:  Yes . 
E:  How long does it take you to  to 
E:  compute uh 
B:  No it 's much worse than that . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  It  if i loo 
D:  It  things don't converge , yeah . 
E:  uh 
B:  it  it  it  it  it 's not def i it 's not well defined if you 're there are loops , you just 
E:  R recursive action ? 
B:  you have to 
B:  there are all sorts of ways of 
B:  breaking it up so that there isn't 
B:  uh 
E:  Uh but this isn't , this is  this line is just coming from over here . 
B:  OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , no it 's not a loop yet , I 'm just saying we  we , in 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Mmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  no , in 
D:  Well , but the good thing is we  
D:  we could have loopy belief propagation which <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  we all love . 
B:  Right . 
B:  OK , so anyway , so that 's another decision . 
B:  Uh what 's  what 's another decision you like ? 
E:  OK , these have no parents yet , but I guess that sort of doesn't matter . 
E:  Right ? 
B:  Well , the idea is that you go there , you go comes from something about the user 
E:  I mean this is sort of 
E:  This comes from traffic and so forth , yeah . 
B:  from something about the situation 
D:  <yawn> 
B:  and the uh 
D:  <mike sounds> 
B:  the discourse is  is a mystery . 
E:  Sh - 
E:  Should we just make some 
B:  Sure , if you want . 
E:  um 
E:  if there 's parking maybe 
E:  Mmm 
E:  Oh who cares . 
E:  OK . 
E:  And if he has seen it already or not 
B:  Right . 
E:  and so forth , OK . 
E:  Um 
E:  and discourse is something that sort of 
E:  should we make a Keith note here ? That sort of comes from Keith . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Sure . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Just sort of 
E:  so we don't forget . 
E:  Oops .  
E:  Have to get used to this . 
E:  OK , whoops .  
A:  Um actually  
B:  And then also the discourse endpoint , I  I guess endpoint sub - D is  if you wanna make it consistent . 
C:  Wh - ah . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Mm - hmm . 


B:  For Go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say . That 's what we talked about . 
E:  um 
E:  well , I think um 
E:  we 're looking at the  the little data that we have , so people say how do I get to 
E:  the castle 
E:  and this usually means they wanna go there . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  So this should sort of 
E:  push it 
B:  Right . 
E:  in one direction 
E:  however people also sometimes say how do I get there in order to find out 
E:  how to get there 
E:  without wanting to go there . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And sometimes um people say where is it 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  because they wanna know where it is 
E:  but in most cases they probably 
B:  Yeah , but that doesn't change the fact that you 're  you want these two values . 
E:  Oh yeah , true . <laugh> 
E:  So this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff and then says here it 's either  
E:  yep , yay , A , or nay . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK ? 
B:  And they 'll be a y uh , a user 
B:  Go - there 
B:  and maybe that 's all , I don't know . 
D:  Situation Go - there , I mean , because it 's  whether it 's open or not . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK , good . 
D:  That definitely interes @ @ 
B:  Yep . 
D:  But that 
D:  now that kind of 
D:  um what 's the word um 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  the  that interacts with the uh 
D:  EVA thing if they just wanna view it 
D:  then it 's fine to go there when it 's closed 
D:  whereas if they want to um 
B:  Right . 
D:  so 
B:  Right , so that 's  that 's where it starts getting to be uh 
B:  uh essentially more interesting , so what 
B:  uh Bhaskara says which is completely right 
B:  is if you know that they 're only going to view it then 
B:  it doesn't matter whether it 's closed or not in terms of 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  The time of day , right I  well , right . 
B:  uh uh 
B:  you know , whether  whether you wanna go there . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  It does matter though if there 's like a strike or riot or something . 
B:  Absolutely there are other situational things that do matter . 
D:  Right . 
D:  So 
D:  yeah , that 's what I said just having one situational node may not be enough because 
D:  this  that node by itself wouldn't distinguish 
B:  Well i i it can have di various values . 
B:  Yeah , but we eh you  you 're right it might not be enough . 
D:  Yeah , I mean , see I 'm  
A:  Well , what   Whoops .  <laugh> 
D:  I 'm thinking that any node that begins with " Go - there " 
D:  is either gonna be true or false . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
B:  Ah . 
B:  I see that could be . 
A:  Also , that node , I mean 
A:  the Go - there s S node would just be fed by separate ones for 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Could be . 
A:  you know , there 's different things , the strikes and the 
B:  Yeah . N 
D:  Like situation traffic and so on . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , the time of day . 


A:  Um actually is this the  the right way to have it where um 
A:  go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of 
A:  don't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision because 
B:  <mouth> 
B:  I think so . 
A:  isn't the , I mean 
B:  S 
A:  uh , hmm 
A:  OK . 
B:  Maybe not , a 
A:  But that still allows for the possibility of the  of 
A:  the user model affecting our decision about whether a strike is the sort of thing which is going to keep this user away from  
B:  Right . 
A:  That  all that  that kind of decision making happens at the Go - there node . 
B:  Uh y you  yeah you  i you  if you needed to do that . 
A:  Uh . 
A:  If you needed it to do that . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  But uh OK I was just thinking 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  I guess maybe I 'm conflating that user node with 
A:  possible  possible asking of the user 
A:  you know 
B:  Ah . 
A:  hey there 's a strike on , uh does that affect whether or not you wanna go or something or 
B:  Good point , I don't  I don't know how we 're going to  t uh 
A:  <clears throat> 
A:  Yeah , so that might not come out of a user model but , you know , directly out of 
B:  Right . 
A:  interaction . 
B:  Uh 
B:  I gu yes my curr you know , don't yeah yeah yeah that 's enough . 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh 
B:  My current idea on that 
B:  would be that each of these decision nodes has 
B:  questions associated with it . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  And the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things 
B:  you know , given that you know there 's a strike do you still wanna go ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  <clears throat> Yeah . 
B:  But 
B:  uh if you told him a bunch of stuff , then you would ask him do you wanna go ? But 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . 
B:  I think 
A:  Right , right . 
B:  trying to formulate the conditional question , that sounds too much . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right , sure , OK . 
B:  To me . <mouth> 
E:  Mm - hmm . 


B:  Alright , but let me  let  let 's stay with this a minute because I want to do a little bit of organization . 
E:  But 
B:  Before we get more into details . 
B:  The organization is going to be that 
B:  uh the flavor of what 's going on 
B:  is going to be that 
B:  uh as we s e sort of going to this detail 
B:  indeed Keith is going to  to worry about the various constructions that people might use 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  and Johno has committed himself to being the parser wizard , so 
A:  Alright . 
B:  what 's going to happen is 
B:  that 
B:  eventually 
B:  like by the time he graduates , OK 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  uh they 'll be some sort of system 
B:  which is able to 
B:  take the discourse in context 
B:  and have 
B:  outputs that can feed the rest of belief - net . 
B:  I j wa I  I assume everybody knows that , I just wanna 
B:  you know , get closure that 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  that 'll be the game then , so the 
B:  semantics that you 'll get out of the 
B:  discourse will be 
B:  of values that go into 
B:  the various discourse - based decision nodes . 
B:  And now some of those will get fancier like mode of transportation and stuff so it isn't by any means 
B:  uh necessarily a simple 
B:  thing that you want out . 
B:  So uh if there is an and there is mode of transportation 
E:  And it 
E:  there 's a sort of also a split if you loo if you blow this up and look at it in more detail there 's something that comes from the discourse in terms of what was actually just said 
E:  what 's the utterance go giving us 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  and then what 's the discourse history 
E:  give us . 
B:  Yeah , well that , well , we 'll have to decide 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  That 's uh two things then . 
B:  uh 
B:  how much of th where that goes . 
E:  Mmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  an and it 's not clear yet . 
B:  I mean it could be those are two separate things , it could be that the discourse 
B:  gadget 
B:  itself integrates em as  which would be my guess 
B:  that you 'd have to do 
B:  see in order to do reference and stuff like that 
B:  um you 've gotta have both the current discourse and the context to say 
B:  I wanna go back there , wow , what does that mean and 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm 
A:  Now . 
B:  uh 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Alright . So 


E:  But is th is this picture that 's emerging here 
E:  just my wish that you have noticed already for symmetry or is it that we get for each  
E:  each decision on the very bottom we sort of get the sub - E , sub - D , sub - U 
E:  and maybe a sub - O  " O " for " ontology " 
E:  um 
E:  meta node 
B:  I don't know . 
E:  but it might just 
B:  It could be . 
E:  could be so this 
B:  This is  this is getting into the thing I wanna talk about next , which is 
B:  s if that 's true 
B:  uh how do we wanna combine those ? 
B:  O or when it 's true ? 
E:  but this eh w wou wou would be nice though that , you know , we only have 
E:  at most four at the moment 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  um 
E:  arrows going f to each of the uh 
E:  bottom decisions . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  And four you  we can handle . 
B:  No . <laugh> 
E:  It 's too much ? 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Well 
B:  i i it see i if it 's fou if it 's four 
B:  things and each of them has four values 
B:  it turns out to be a big CPT , it 's not s completely impossi I mean it 's  it 's not beyond what the system could solve 
B:  but it 's probably beyond what we could actually 
B:  uh write down . 
E:  Right , true . 
B:  or learn . 
B:  Uh but , you know it 's 
B:  four to the fourth . 
B:  It 's pretty big . 
B:  Uh . 
C:  Two fifty - six , is that what that 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , I mean it 's 
B:  and I don't think it 's gonna g e I don't think it 'll get worse than that by the way , so le that 's a  that 's a good 
D:  Mmm yeah . 
E:  But  
E:  but four  
E:  didn't we decide that all of these had true or false ? So is  it 's four 
B:  Uh for go there , but not f but not for  the other one 's three values for endpoint already . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I mean you need actually three to the five because uh 
D:  well I mean if  if it has four inputs and then it itself has three values so 
C:  Right . 
D:  I mean it can get big fast . 
E:  Um for endpoint ? No it 's  it 's sh 
B:  EV - it 's the EVA . 
E:  yeah , down here , but 
E:  this one only has two . 
D:  No it still has three , EVA . 
B:  No . 
B:  Since ta they will still have three . 
B:  Each  so you 're uh uh from each point of view you 're making the same decision . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  So 
B:  from the point of view of the ob of the entity 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Want to view that , yeah yeah . 
E:  C sl yeah 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  This  and also , I mean , the other places where , like for example 
D:  consider endpoint view , it has inputs coming from user budget , user thrift 
B:  Right . 
D:  so even 
B:  Those are not necessarily binary . 
A:  <clears throat> 
B:  S so we 're  we 're gonna have to use some t care in the knowledge engineering 
B:  to not have this explode . 
B:  And in fact I think it doesn't in the sense that 
B:  um 
B:  Read it , you know actually with the underlying semantics and stuff I think it isn't like 
B:  you have two hundred and fifty - six different 
B:  uh 
B:  ways of  of thinking about whether this user wants to go to some place . 
B:  Alright . 
B:  So we  we just have to figure out what the regularities are and 
B:  and code them . 


E:  w we just need to sort of 
E:  in order to get some closure on this 
E:  figure out 
E:  how we 're gonna get this picture sort of uh 
E:  completely messy . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Well , here  
B:  he here 's one of the things that  that I th 
B:  you sh you  no , I don't know how easy it is to do this in the interface 
B:  but you  it would be great if you could 
A:  <mike sounds> 
B:  actually just display 
B:  at a given time 
B:  uh all the things that you pick up , you click on " endpoint " , OK 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  and everything else fades and you just see 
B:  the links that are relevant to that . 
B:  And I does anybody remember 
B:  the GUI on this ? 
C:  Uh d I would almost say the other way to do that would be to open u or make 
C:  you know N - many belief - nets and then open them 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  every time you wanted to look at a different one 
C:  vers cuz uh 
E:  It 's probably pretty easy do it  to do it in HTML , just  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , but <laugh> 
E:  Uh <laugh> 
D:  HTML ? 
E:  Yeah I have each of these thing each of the end belief - nets be  be a page and then you click on the thing and then 
D:  OK . 
E:  li consider that it 's respective , but 
B:  Yeah 
B:  the  well the b 
B:  <mike sounds> 
B:  anyway 
B:  so uh it clear 
B:  that even with this if we put in all the arrows nobody is gonna be able to read the diagram . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Alright , so 
B:  e we have to figure out some eh eh 
B:  uh 
B:  basically display hack or something to do this because 
B:  anyway 
B:  I  I  let me consi suggest that 's a s not a first - order consideration , we have two first - order considerations 
B:  which is what are the 
B:  uh influences 
B:  A , and B 
B:  how do they get combined mathematically , how do we display them is an issue , but 
B:  um <mouth> 
C:  I don't , yeah I just don't think this has been designed to support 
C:  something like that . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I  I mean , it might soon , if this is gonna be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start 
D:  modifying it for our purposes . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah , and 
B:  Um I  that seems like a perfectly feasible thing to get into , but 
B:  um 
B:  we have to know what we want first . 


B:  OK , so why don't you tell us a little bit about 
D:  So 
B:  decision nodes and what  what the choices might be for these ? 
D:  <mike sounds> Ah , sorry . I guess that 's 
C:  You can technically wear that as you 're talking . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , it 's 
D:  right , I guess I can do that . 
A:  Darn . 
B:  Put it in your , yeah . 
D:  <mike sounds> 
D:  <mike sounds> 
D:  I guess this board works fine . 
A:  <clears throat> 
D:  So um recall the basic problem which is that um 
D:  you have a belief - net and you have like 
D:  a lot of different nodes 
D:  all contributing to one node . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  So as we discussed 
D:  specifying this kind of thing 
D:  is a big pain and it 's so will take a long time to write down because 
D:  for example if these S have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you know you have 
D:  two hundred and forty - three possibilities which is already 
D:  a lot of numbers to write down . 
D:  So what um helps us in our situation is that 
D:  these all 
D:  have values in the same set , right ? These are all like 
D:  saying EV or A , right ? So it 's not just a generalized situation like 
D:  I mean 
D:  basically we wanna just take a combination of  we wanna view each of these as experts 
C:  <coughs twice> 
D:  ea who are 
D:  each of them is making a decision based on some factors 
A:  <mike sounds> 
D:  and we wanna sort of combine their decisions 
D:  and create 
D:  you know , um 
D:  sorta weighted 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  ROVER , the ROVER decision . 
D:  combination . 
D:  The what decision ? 
E:  ROVER . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  All of their outputs combined to make a decision . 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So 
D:  the problem is to specify the uh 
D:  so the conditional property of 
D:  this given all those , right ? That 's the way 
D:  belief - nets are defined , like each node given its parents , right ? 
D:  So um 
D:  that 's what we want , we want for example P of um 
D:  let 's call this guy Y and let 's call these X - one , X - two 
D:  XN , right . 
D:  So we want probability that Y equals , you know , for example 
D:  um E 
D:  given that these guys are 
D:  I 'll just refer to this as like X um 
D:  hat or something , uh the co like all of them ? 
D:  Given that for example the data says you know , A , V , A , E , or something 
D:  right ? 
B:  Yep . 
D:  So we would like to do this kind of combination . 
B:  Alright , so um 
B:  Is that uh I  yeah , I just wanna make sure everybody is with us 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  I think so , yeah . 
B:  before he goes on . 
B:  It 's  it 's cl e 
B:  is  is it clear what 
B:  he wants to compute ? 
D:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  So , right . 
D:  So 
D:  Basically um 
D:  <clears throat> what we don't wanna do is to 
D:  for every single combination of 
D:  E and V and A and every single letter E , s give a number because that 's 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  obviously not 
D:  desirable . 
D:  What we wanna do is find some principled way of um 
D:  saying what each of these is 
D:  and we want it to be a valid probability distribution , so we want it to um 
D:  add up to one , right ? 
D:  So those are the two things that we uh need . 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  So 
D:  what uh I guess , what Jerry suggested earlier was basically 
D:  that we , you know 
D:  view these guys as voting and we just take the uh 
D:  we 
D:  essentially take um 
D:  averages , right ? So for example 
D:  here two people have voted for A , one has voted for V , and one has voted for E , so we could say that 
D:  the probabilities are , you know , probability of being E is one 
D:  over four , because one person voted for E out of four 
D:  and similarly , probability of 
D:  so this is probability of E 
D:  s and then probability of A 
D:  given all that is um two out of four 
D:  and probability of V is one out of four . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  So that 's 
D:  step  that 's the uh 
D:  yeah that 's the  that 's the basic uh thing . 
D:  Now 
E:  Um 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  Is that all OK ? 
E:  And that one outcome , that 's 
B:  What ? 
E:  it 's X  
E:  X - one voted for A 
E:  X - two voted for V and so forth ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Y right . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's the outcome . 
B:  S so this assumes symmetry and equal weights and all this sort of things , which 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  may or may not be a good assumption , so that 
A:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  I still have trouble understanding the very first step , maybe just because I 'm approaching it from the very wrong end . I don't know . 
E:  So , this is true for the case that X - one voted for A , X - two voted for B , 
B:  Yes . 
E:  and so forth . 
E:  Now , X - one could potentially also vote E . 
B:  That wo that would be another sort of i Absolutely . 


D:  So step two is um 
D:  right . So we 've assumed equal weights whereas it might turn out that 
D:  you know , some w be that for example , what the um 
D:  the actual 
D:  the uh verbal content of what the person said , like what 
D:  uh what might be uh somehow more uh important than 
D:  the uh 
C:  X - one matters more i than X - two or 
B:  <mouth> 
D:  Right . 
D:  Sure , so we don't wanna like give them all equal weight so currently we 've been giving them all weight one fourth 
D:  so we could replace this by uh 
D:  W - one , W - two , W - three , and W - four 
D:  right ? 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  And in order for this to be a valid probability distribution for each um 
D:  X - hat , we just need that the W 's sum to one . 
D:  So they can be for example , you know 
D:  you  you could have point one , point three , point two , and point four , say . 
E:  That 's one . 
D:  And that 'd be one . 
D:  So that um also seems to work fine . 
D:  And uh 
C:  So I jus just to make sure I understand this , so in this case 
B:   
C:  um we would still 
C:  compute the average ? 
D:  You 'd compute the weighted average , so 
C:  OK , so  
D:  the probability of 
D:  E would be uh 
C:  so it 'd be 
C:  so in this case the probability that Y equals A would be 
C:  uh  
A:  Point three . 
C:  W one times  or A or  let 's see , one full quarter times point one 
C:  e 
C:  OK . 
D:  Not one quarter , so 
B:  @ @ three . 
A:  No . 
D:  these numbers have been replaced with point one , point three , point two , and point four . 
B:  So it would be , in this case 
D:  So you can view these as gone . 
B:  you just add up the  Yeah . So it would  it would  in this case , it would be   probability of A would be point three . 
D:  Probability of 
B:  B  yeah , B would be point three and the probability of E would be point four . 
C:  OK . 
B:  If that  if that was the voting plan . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  OK . 
D:  So , alright . 
D:  So this is uh step two . 


D:  So the next possibility is that um 
D:  we 've given just a single weight to each expert , right , whereas it might be the case that um 
D:  in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable . 
D:  So 
D:  the way this is handled is by what 's called a mixture of experts , so 
D:  what you can have is 
D:  you augment these diagrams like this so 
D:  you have a new thing called " H " , OK ? This is a hidden variable . 
D:  And what this is 
D:  is 
D:  it gets its input from X - one , X - two , X - three , and X - four , and what it does is it decides 
D:  which of the experts is to be trusted in this particular situation . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  And then 
D:  these guys all 
D:  come here . 
D:  OK . 
D:  So this is sightly uh more complicated . 
D:  So what 's going on is that um 
D:  this H node looks at these four 
D:  values of those guys and it decides in 
D:  given these values 
D:  which of these isn't likely to be 
D:  more reliable or most reliable . 
D:  So H produces some 
D:  you know , it produces a number , either one , two , three , or four , in our situation , right ? 
D:  Now this guy 
D:  he looks at the value of H 
D:  say it 's two , and then he just selects the uh 
B:  @ @  Yeah , so that 's one thing you can do , but the other  So , are you going to go on and  say @ @  
D:  thing . 
D:  That 's all there is to say , I guess about it . 
B:  No it isn't . Because the other thing you can do is you  So this  in this case , a mixture of experts just picks one . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right , so you can have a mixture that 
B:  But  
B:  A weighted one . So what you can do , if you  if you need it is to say that  I mean here there 's a fourth parameter . There 's a fifth parameter . 
B:  OK ? which is the H parameter . 
B:  So let 's suppose the H says in situ @ @ different uh , alpha . 
B:  OK , in situation - alpha , that 's the weighting factor , but in situation - beta , it 's some other weighting factor . 
D:  Right . 
B:  So you still combine these with weight , but the weights aren't always the same . 
B:  That this guy uh detects for you that this is a situation in which you should weight this more or less . 
A:  So  so the function of the thing that comes out of H is very different from the function of the other inputs . 
B:  Correct . It 's actually s it  it  
A:  It 's driving how the other four are interpreted . 
B:  In - indeed . 


B:  It 's  it 's  it 's conditioning how the other four are @ @ . And what people do , in another literature , is learn all this stuff . So you learn the weights , you can learn the expert , et cetera . And if you have enough data , then it makes perfectly good sense to do this . 
A:  OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <clears throat> 
C:  So H passes a vector on to the next node ? 
B:  Well now , y it  it  Well it could , or you co could just pass other  
D:  It could . 
C:  It could ? 
C:  A vector of the weights as the se oh . 
B:  No , no . No . Not normally . It would just pass a  a selection . So  so it could pass either  
D:  Yeah , it could 
D:  Sorry ? 
A:  Well a vector with three zero 's and one one , right ? <laugh> 
B:  Well , it could . Yeah . If  if  
B:  @ @ Yeah , it could do that . <board being erased> 
E:  <mike noise> 
B:  OK . Uh , you know , uh , uh , a ma a binary mask . 
E:  <mike noise> 
C:  Oh it 's basically to tell the bottom node which one of the situations that it 's in 
B:  We - yeah . Or w in this case , wh which one of these guys to pay attention to . 
C:  or which one of the weighting systems 
E:   
D:  Right , so 
C:  W I was just , if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w a weighting s system though too , couldn't you ? 
D:  I mean the way you desc 
B:  I mean , the way you  
B:  Well , that  yo You could but I think what  that 's not  that 's harder than to just say they 're a discrete number of situations and this says , you know , hey , you 're in situation - alpha . 
C:  OK . 
A:  Um 
A:  Does H have to have another input to tell it alpha , beta , whatever , or is the  
B:  No . 
A:  that 's determined by what the experts are saying , like the type of situ OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Or in @ @ definitely could have  have other  it absolutely could have other inputs from something that has n doesn't have anything directly to do with these experts . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
B:  And it 's s it actually often does . So it is  
A:  I mean 
A:  It  it just seems that like without that  that outside input that you 've got a situation where , you know , like if  if uh X - one 
A:  says no , you know , a low value coming out of X - on or i if X - one says no then ignore X - one , you know , I mean that seems like 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , well could be things like if X - two and X - three say yes then i ignore X - one also . 
A:  that 'd be weird , right ? 
A:  Oh , OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Or if X - two is greater than X - I could imagine i all sorts of garbage . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Alright , right . 
B:  And so these  so this is  this is one collection of technology that we could bring to bear . Yeah . 
A:  <clears throat> 
C:  Oh 
C:  The situations that H has , are they built into the net or 
B:  Depends . 
B:  So @ @ you  
C:  OK , so they  they could either be hand coded or learned or 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
B:  It depends on  on  on , you know , what situations you 're in . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Based on training data , OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  And  there 're bits @ @ actually Michael Jordan did a lot of nice work , uh , earlier on sit situations which you could actually train these up and stuff . 
B:  Um , I don't think we 're gonna be in a situation where realistically we 're gonna have enough data to actually train these things , uh , anytime soon . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  But , I still think it 's a nice idea if the architecture supports it . 
D:  Yes . 
B:  So that , you know , you say , " here 's the design and if enough data comes along uh , you co you could use it  use the technology to  to do that . " 


C:  So you specify one of these things for every one of those possi 
C:  possible situations . 
C:  Oh yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Um 
D:  Well , I mean 
D:  to learn them we need data , where are we gonna get data ? 
D:  Well 
D:  I mean we need data with people intentions , right ? 
A:  Right , right . <laugh> 
D:  Which is slightly tricky . 
D:  Right . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  But what 's the data about like , are we able to get these nodes from the data ? 
A:  Like how thrifty the user is , or do we have access to that ? <laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh right . 
A:  Oh good . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . 
D:  Yeah , but that 's my question , like how do we  I mean , how do we have data about something like um 
D:  um endpoint sub - E , 
D:  or endpoint sub uh  you know s S ?  
C:  Well , basically you would say , based on  in this dialogue that we have 
D:  Mmm . 
C:  which one of the things that they said eh whether it was the entity relations or whatever 
D:  Mmm . 
C:  was the thing that determined what mode it was , right ? 
D:  So this is what we wanna learn . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I don't think , well 
D:  you have a  can you bring up the function thing ? 
D:  Um 
D:  w where is the thing that allows you to sort of 
C:  That 's on the added variable , isn't it ? 
D:  Oh function properties , is that it ? 
D:  Hmm , I guess not . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , that 's 
A:  No . 
D:  Right . 
D:  OK . 
D:  And um it so e either it 'll allow us to do everything which I think is unlikely , I think more likely it 'll allow us to do very few of these things 
A:  <clears throat> 
D:  and in that case we 'll have to um 
D:  just write up little things that allow you to um 
D:  create such CPU 's on your own in the java base format . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do because 
D:  yeah I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do , it 's 
D:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Ah . 
C:  Well in terms of java base I think it 's basically what you see is what you get in 
C:  I don't 
C:  yeah , I would be surprised if it supports anything more than what we have right here . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <mike sounds> 
A:  So 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  By the way um uh just talking about uh about that general end of things uh 
A:  is there gonna be data soon from what people say when they 're interacting with the system and so on ? Like , I mean , what kind of questions are being given  being asked ? Cuz  
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Fey , you mean . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  O OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  I 'm just wondering , because in terms of , you know , I mean 
A:  uh w <laugh> the figure  I was thinking about this figure that we talked about , fifty constructions or whatever that 's uh that 's a whole lot of constructions  and um you know , I mean one might be f 
A:  fairly pleased with getting a really good analysis of 
A:  five maybe ten in a summer 
A:  so , I mean I know we 're going for sort of a 
A:  rough and ready . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  I mean , I  I  I  I was  uh I was talking about the , you know , if you wanted to do it really in detail and we don't really need all the detail for what we 're doing right now 
A:  but anyway in terms of just narrowing that task you know 
A:  which fifty do I do , I wanna see what people are using , so 
A:  Well , it will inspire me . <laugh> 
A:  Right , sure sure . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah , sure . 
A:  Sure . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Touche . 
A:  Good enough .
