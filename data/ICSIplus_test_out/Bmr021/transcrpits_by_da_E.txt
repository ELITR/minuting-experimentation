E:  Tell them to test their mikes , or  
E:  One two three four five six   I 'm on seven . 
E:  So you guys need to start going to the EDU meetings . 
E:  I prefer these , 
E:  but I don't mind using those . 
E:  Those are better than the Sonys ? 
E:  Yeah , that 's why I was saying if we could just unplug them and plug them in . 
E:  Well , it s It seems like right now if  if u what they 're complaining are those , 
E:  if we just got two more of these  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  And then they can just unplug those from the  transmitter . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  How much is it just to buy the mike ? 
E:  Really . 
E:  Oh that 's way more than I thought . 
E:  I  
E:  yeah . 
E:  Wow ! 
E:  Is there any educational discount ? 
E:  And when I was at Computer Motion we used Shure , 
E:  the SM - ten - A 's , 
E:  and I think they were only like eighty bucks or something . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  But they were  they seemed pretty good . 
E:  Oh . 
E:  Right , right . 
E:  So then all those red channels there would become wireless ones ? 
E:  Cool . 
E:  The Andrea mike ? 
E:  Which one is the Andrea mike ? 
E:  A wired one ? 
E:  Well , if you 're gonna go to all wireless , 
E:  Oh , you mean in the meantime . 
E:  Ah , I see . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I haven't  In the meetings that I recorded s It 's always been at most six people , 
E:  so I 've never had to  
E:  Recently I haven't had to used any of the wired ones at all . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  There 's some knocks . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  You have a special phone ? 
E:  Oh , we could add one , yeah . 
E:  Well like  
E:  At least Feacalc doesn't . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Wow ! 
E:  You know what would be a  
E:  u I don't know if this would mess other things up , 
E:  but  It seems like kind of a pain to have all these split up files around . 
E:  What would be easier would be like pointers . 
E:  You know , lists like " original wavefile , start , end " . 
E:  This is  
E:  Well , is there  is there  is there a NIST routine which can seek in a compressed file but with uncompressed indices ? 
E:  Right . Right we  I mean the original Switchboard files are not compressed , 
E:  right ? 
E:  So we could leave those as they are . 
E:  Well , assuming you 'd  Yeah . Assuming that you then off - load the original Switchboard files . 
E:  Yeah , yeah . 
E:  He did it on purpose . 
E:  Are they ? 
E:  I don't remember where I put them now . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Physical disk . 
E:  Yeah , after each meeting we copy the data to  
E:  Yeah , there was something weird about that . 
E:  Yeah like  like the same meeting  shortened , files that we pull off of Popcorn when we 're done doing the recording , looked , to the backup software , as if they had been written , you know , every single night , i for  f you know , a week in a row , 
E:  which is really weird . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Maybe n next week if we could . 
E:  I 'm trying to finish up some stuff . 
E:  That sounds like a good idea . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  I think we should also at the same time try to , uh , convert over to your new naming conventions . 
E:  That 'd be good . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I actually haven't looked at it yet . I haven't had a chance , 
E:  so . 
E:  I mean , these  
E:  Well , if we  
E:  If we change things , it won't really affect what you 're doing , 
E:  will it ? 
E:  Yeah . So you  but you can switch that any time you want , 
E:  right ? 
E:  I mean , if we  
E:  Everybody will use it . 
E:  Fine slash U slash star . 
E:  So Andreas , would it be appropriate to ask how the experiments are going ? 
E:  Uh  
E:  Just PLP . 
E:  Thirty - seven fifty . 
E:  There 's one other slight difference , 
E:  right ? 
E:  Or two  two differences . 
E:  Do they subtract the max from each i one or do they subtract each one from the max ? 
E:  Doesn't matter ? 
E:  Except you get a lot of negatives the other way . 
E:  Oh !  Oh ! 
E:  For the C - zero . 
E:  Yeah , Dan added that in , 
E:  but  
E:  What about ta concatenating the two feature vectors into a single one ? 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  What are people doing , 
E:  they 're switching their mikes off or something ? 
E:  Test  
E:  Tell them to test their mikes , or
