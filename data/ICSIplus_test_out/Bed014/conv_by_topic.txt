E:  <mike noise> <breath> 
B:  Sorry . 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  Mental  mental Palm Pilot . 
B:   Right . 
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  Hence  no problem . 
F:  Let 's see .  
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  So . What ? I 'm supposed to be on channel five ? <mike noise> 
F:  Her . Nope .  Doesn't seem to be , yeah . 
B:  Hello  I 'm channel one . 
F:  <lateral tongue click>  
D:  @ @  <mike noise> 
E:  What does your thing say on the back ? 
F:  Nnn , five . 
D:  Testing .  
F:  Alright , I 'm five . <mike noise> 
D:  Sibilance .  
F:  <laugh-breath> 
D:  Sibilance .   Three , three . 
D:  I am three .  
F:  <laugh-breath> 
B:  Eh . 
D:  See , that matches the seat up there . So . 
F:  Yeah , well , I g guess  it 's coming up then , or  
D:  <mike noise> 
D:  Cuz it 's  
D:  That starts counting from zero and these start counting from one . 
C:  <mike noise> 
D:  <extended inbreath> 
D:  Ergo , the classic off - by - one error . <outbreath>  
B:  But mine is correct . 
D:  Is it ?  
E:  No .  
B:  It 's one . 
B:  Channel one . 
E:  Look at the back .  
D:  Your mike  number  is what we 're t  
B:  Oh , oh , oh ! 
B:  Oh .  
D:  Ho !  
B:  So  
D:  I 've bested you again , Nancy .  
B:  But your p 
B:  No , but the paper 's correct . 
D:  The paper is correct . 
B:  Look at the paper . 
D:  I didn't det I was saying the microphone , not the paper . 
C:  Nnn ,  
C:  it 's n 
B:  Oh . 
C:  It 's always offset . Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yes , you 've bested me again . <laugh> That 's how I think of our continuing interaction . <laugh> Damn ! Foiled again ! 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  So is Keith showing up ? He 's talking with George right now . Uh , is he gonna get a rip  uh  rip himself away from  
C:  <loud mike spike> 
C:  What  
B:  He 'll probably come later . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  He - he he 's 
E:  <mike loud spike>  
D:  from that ? 
C:  probably not , is my guess . 
D:  Oh , then it 's just gonna be the five of us ? 
E:  Well , he  he was very affirmative in his way of saying he will be here at four . But  you know , that was before he knew about that George lecture probably . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> 
D:  <mike noise> 
C:  Right . 
D:  <laugh-breath> 
C:  This  this is not  
B:  <clears throat> 
C:  It 's not bad for the project if Keith is talking to George . 
B:  <sniff> 
B:  <extended outbreath> 
C:  OK . So my suggestion is we just 
B:  Forge ahead .  
C:  Forge ahead , yeah .  
E:  Cool .  
B:  <laugh> 
B:  Are you in charge ? 
E:  Sure . <breath> 
E:  Um . 
E:  <long loud breath>  


E:  Well , I sort of had informal talks with 
E:  most of you . So , Eva just reported she 's really happy about the  CBT 's being in the same order in the XML as in the 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  um  be Java declaration format so you don't have to 
F:  The e 
F:  Uh , yeah . 
E:  do too much in the style sheet 
F:  Yeah , so . 
E:  transversion . 
E:  The  uh , Java  the embedded Bayes  wants to take input  uh , uh , a Bayes - net  in  in some Java notation 
E:  and 
E:  Eva is using the Xalan style sheet processor to convert the XML that 's output by the Java Bayes 
E:  for the  into the , uh , E Bayes input . 
B:  <sniff> 
D:  Mmm . 
F:  Actually , maybe I could try , like , emailing the guy and see if he has any something already . 
D:  <breath> 
C:  Sure . 
E:  Hmm . 
F:  That 'd be weird , that 
F:  he has both the Java Bayes and the embedded Bayes in  
F:  Yeah . 
D:  But that 's some sort of conversion program ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  And put them into different  formats . 
F:  Oh  Yep , he could do that , too . 
D:  I think you should demand things from him . 
B:  <sniff> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> He charges so much . Right . 
D:  <laugh> Yeah .  
C:  No , I think it 's a good idea that you may as well ask . Sure . 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  <clears throat> 


E:  And , um , well  pretty mu pretty much on t on the top of my list , I would have asked Keith how the " where is X ? "  hand parse is standing . 
E:  Um .  But we 'll skip that . 
E:  Uh , there 's good news from Johno . The generation templates are done . 
D:  So the trees  for  
B:  <sniff> 
D:  the XML trees for the  for the gene for the synthesizer 
D:  are written . So I just need to  do the , uh  write a new set of  tree combining rules .  But 
D:  I think those 'll be pretty similar to the old ones . 
D:  So . 
D:  Just gonna be  you know  


C:  Oh ! 
C:  You were gonna send me a note 
C:  about hiring  
B:  <clears throat> 
E:  Yes . 
E:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
C:  I didn't finish the sentence but he understood it . <sniff> 
D:  I know what he 's talking about . 
C:  OK . 
D:  <laugh-breath> 
C:  But Nancy doesn't . 
B:  Hiring somebody . 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  We  w um  
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  The guy . 
E:  OK , so  
C:  No . 
E:  natural language generation  produces 
E:  not a  just a surface string that is fed into a text - to - speech 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  but , a  surface string with a syntax tree that 's fed into a concept - to - speech . 
B:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  <sniff> <sniff> 
E:  Now and this concept - to - speech module has  certain rules on how  if you get the following syntactic 
B:  Better . 
E:  structure , how to map this onto prosodic rules . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <sniff> 
B:  Sure .  
B:  <sniff> 
B:  Mm - hmm .  
E:  And Fey has foolheartedly agreed to rewrite 
E:  uh , the German concept uh syntax - to - prosody rules  
B:  I didn't know she spoke German . 
E:  No , she doesn't .  But she speaks English . 
B:  Oh , OK . 
B:  Oh . Rewrite the German ones into English . OK , got it . 
E:  Into English . <breath>  And um 
E:  therefore  the , uh  
E:  if it 's OK that we give her a couple of more hours per week , then  she 'll do that . 
B:  OK , got it . 
D:  What  language is that  written i Is that that Scheme thing that you showed me ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's the LISP - type scheme . 
D:  She knows how to program in Scheme ?  I hope ? 
E:  No , I  @ @  
E:  My guess is  I  I asked for a commented version of that file ? 
E:  If we get that , then it 's  doable , even without getting into it , even though the Scheme li uh , stuff is really well documented in the  Festival . 
B:  <sniff> <sniff> 
D:  Well , I guess if you 're not used to functional programming , Scheme can be completely incomprehensible . 
D:  Cuz , there 's no  
D:  Like  there 's lots of unnamed functions and   You know ? 
C:  Syntax . 
C:  Yeah .  
B:  Mm - hmm .  
C:  Anyway , it  We 'll sort this out . Um .  
C:  But anyway , send me the note and then I 'll - I 'll check with , uh , Morgan on the money . I  I don't anticipate any problem but we have to  ask . 
B:  <sniff> <sniff> 
C:  Oh , so this was  <mike noise burst> 
B:  <clears throat> 
C:  You know , on the generation thing , 
B:  <sniff> 
C:  um  
C:  if  
C:  sh y she 's really going to do that , then we should be able to get prosody as well . So it 'll say it 's nonsense with 
D:  <laugh-breath> 
C:  perfect intonation . 
D:  <laugh-breath> <laugh> 
B:  <mike noise> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <mike noise> 


D:  Are we gonna  Can we change the voice 
A:  <breath> 
D:  of the  of the thing , because right now the voice sounds like a murderer . 
E:  Yep . We ha we have to change the voice . 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  Wh - Which one ? 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  The  the little Smarticus  Smarticus sounds like a murderer . 
A:  <laugh-breath> 
B:  Oh . 
A:  That 's good to know .  
D:  " I have your reservations . "  
F:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  But I will not give them to you unless you come into my lair .  
B:  <laugh-breath> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  It is  Uh , we have the choice between the , uh , usual Festival voices , which I already told the SmartKom people we aren't gonna use because they 're really bad . 
F:  <inbreath> 
B:  Festival ? 
C:  It 's the name of some program ,  the  the synthesizer .  
D:  <laugh-breath> 
B:  Oh , oh . Got it . OK . 
B:  <sniff> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  But , um <laugh-breath> 
A:  You know , the usual party voices .  
B:  Yeah , I know .  That doesn't sound , <laugh> exactly right either . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  OGI has , uh , crafted a couple of diphone 
A:  <breath> 
E:  type voices that are really nice and we 're going to use  that . We can still , um , d agree on a gender , if we want . 
E:  So we still have male or female . 
A:  <coughs twice> 
B:  I think  
B:  Well , let 's just pick whatever sounds best . 
A:  <cough-sneeze> 
E:  Hmm ? 
B:  Whatever sounds best . 
E:  Uh .  
B:  <sniff> 
D:  Does OGI stand for  ?  
B:  Unfortunately , probably male voices , a bit more research on . So . 
C:  Orego - 
D:  Original German Institute ? 
E:  <mike noise burst> 
C:  Or - 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Oregon .  Try Oregon . 
C:  Oregon @ @  Graduate Institute 
D:  Oh . 
B:  Oregon Graduate Insti - 
D:  Ah . 
C:  It turns out there 's the long - standing links with these guys in the speech group . 
B:  Hmm !  
C:  Very long . 
D:  Hmm ! 
E:  <breath> Hmm . 
C:  In fact , there 's this guy who 's basically got a joint appointment ,  Hynek  Hermansky .  
C:  He 's - spends a fair amount of time here . Anyway . 
C:  Leave it .  Won't be a problem . 
B:  <sniff> 


E:  OK .  And it 's probably also absolutely uninteresting for all of you to , um 
E:  learn that as of twenty minutes ago , David and I , per accident , uh managed to get 
E:  the whole SmartKom system running on the  uh , ICSI Linux machines with the ICSI NT machines 
F:  <low level static across next several segments> 
E:  thereby increasing the number of running SmartKom systems in this house from  one on my laptop to three . 
B:  Mmm , that 's good . 
D:  How was this by accident ? 
B:  Yeah , I know . Tha - that 's the part I didn't understand . 
E:  Um , I suggested to try something that was really kind of  even though against better knowledge shouldn't have worked , but it worked . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Hmm ! 
E:  Intuition .  Maybe  maybe  maybe a bit for the AI i intuition thing . 
B:  Will it work again , or  ?  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  And , um , we 'll never found out why . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  It - it 's just like why  why the generation ma the presentation manager is now working ? 
A:  Hmm ! 
E:  Which 
A:  This is something you ha you get used to as a programmer , right ? You know ,  and it 's cool , it works out that way . 
B:  <extended breath> 
E:  Hmm .  So , <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  the  the people at Saarbruecken and I decided not to touch it ever again . 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah , that would work .  


E:  OK . 
E:  Um  I was gonna ask you where something is 
E:  and what we know about that . <laugh> 
A:  Where  OK . 
B:  Where the " where is " construction is . 
E:  Where is X ? 
A:  What  what thing is this ? 
A:  OK . 


E:  Oh , but by  Uh , we can ask , uh , did you get to read all four hundred words ? <breath> Was it OK ? Was it ? 
C:  I did . 
D:  I  I wa I was looking at it . It doesn't follow logically . 
C:  Yeah .  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  It doesn't  The first paragraph doesn't seem to have any link to the second paragraph . 
A:  And so on . 
E:  Hmm . That  
C:  Yeah .  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  You know , i Yeah , it  <expulsive outbreath>  
D:  Each paragraph is good , though . I li <laugh> 
E:  <laugh>  
C:  <laugh> 
C:  I i Yeah . Well , it it 's fine . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  It was written by committee . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh>  
C:  Anyway . Um . 
C:  But c the meeting looks like it 's , it 's gonna be good . 
C:  So .  
E:  Yeah . 
C:  I think it 's uh  
B:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah , I didn't know about it until  Robert told me , like , 
C:  Yeah , I  I ra I ran across it in  I don't even know where , you know  some just  some weird 
B:  @ @ 
C:  place . 
C:  And , uh , yeah , I I 'm surprised I didn't know about it 
B:  Y yeah . Well , yeah . I was like , why didn't Dan tell me ? <laugh> 
C:  since we know all the invited speakers , an 
C:  Right , or some Anyway . 
A:  Right . 
C:  So  But anyway , yeah . 
C:  I so I  I did see that . 


C:  Oh wha Yeah . Before we get started on this st  so I also had a nice email correspondence with Daphne Kohler , who said yes indeed she would love to work with us on the , um ,  you know , using these structured belief - nets and stuff 
B:  <clears throat> 
B:  <sniff> <clears throat> 
C:  but  starting in August , that she 's also got a new student working on this and that we should get in touch with them again in August and then we 'll figure out a way for you  uh  you to get seriously connected with , um 
C:  their group . So  
C:  that 's , uh  looks 
C:  pretty good . 


C:  And um  
C:  Yeah , I 'll say it now . So , um  
C:  And it looks to me like  
C:  we 're now at a good point to do something  start working on something really hard . 
B:  <sniff> 
C:  We 've been so far working on things that are easy . 
A:  Oh ! <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh>  
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <inbreath> Uh , w Which is  
C:  mental spaces and uh  
A:  Hmm ! <breath> 
C:  and - or  
B:  It 's hard . 
C:  Huh ? 
E:  <laugh>  
B:  Yeah , it 's hard . Yeah .  
C:  It 's a hard puzzle . But the other part of it is the way they connect to 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  these , uh , probabilistic relational models . 
C:  So  there 's all the problems that the linguists know about , about mental spaces , and the cognitive linguists know about , but then there 's this problem of the 
C:  belief - net people have only done a moderately good job of dealing with temporal belief - nets . 
C:  Uh , which they call dynamic  
C:  they incorrectly call dynamic belief - nets . So there 's a term " dynamic belief - net " , doesn't mean that . It means time slices . And Srini used those and people use them . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  <sniff> <clears throat> 
B:  <sniff> 
C:  Uh . 
C:  But 
C:  one of the things I w would like to do over the next , uh , month , it may take more ,  is to st understand to what extent we can not only figure out the constructions for them 
C:  for multiple worlds 
C:  and 
C:  uh sort of what the formalism will look like and where the slots and fillers will be , but also what that would translate into in terms of belief - net and the inferences . 
C:  So the story is that if you have these probabilistic relational models , they 're set up , in principle , so that you can make new instances and instances connect to each other , and all that sort of stuff , so it should be feasible 
B:  <sniff> <sniff> 
C:  to set them up in such a way that if you 've got the past tense and the present tense and each of those is a separate  uh , belief structure 
C:  that they do their inferences with just the couplings that 
C:  are appropriate . 
C:  But that 's g that 's , as far as I can tell , it 's  it 's putting together two real hard problems . One is 
C:  the linguistic part of 
C:  what are the couplings and  and when you have a certain , uh , construction , that implies certain couplings and other couplings , you know , between let 's say between the past and the present , or any other one of these things 
B:  <sniff> <sniff> 
C:  and then we have this inference problem of exactly technically how does the belief - net work 
C:  if it 's got 
C:  um , let 's say one in  in , you know , different tenses or my beliefs and your beliefs , or any of these other ones of  of multiple models . So 
C:  um 
C:  you know , in the long run we need to solve both of those and my suggestion is that we 
B:  <sniff> <sniff> 
C:  start 
C:  digging into 
C:  them both , uh , in a way we that , you know , th hopefully turns out to be consistent , so that the  
B:  <sniff> 
C:  Um . 
B:  <clears throat> <sniff> 
C:  And sometimes it 's actually easier 
C:  to solve two hard problems than one because they constrain each other . I mean if you 've got huge ra huge range of possible choices 
A:  Yeah . <breath-laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <extended breath> 
C:  um   
C:  We 'll see .  But anyway , so that 's , um  


A:  Oh yeah , like uh , I solved the  the problem of um  we were talking about how do you  
A:  various issues of how come a plural noun gets to quote " count as a noun phrase " , you know , occur as an argument of a higher construction , but a bare singular stem doesn't get to act that way . Um , 
C:  Right . 
A:  and it would take a really long time to explain it now , but I 'm about to write it up this evening . 
A:  I solved that at the same time as " how do we keep adjectives from floating to the left of determiners and how do we keep all of that from floating outside the noun phrase " to get something like " I the kicked dog " . Um . 
B:  <sniff> <sniff> <sniff> 
C:  That 's great . 
A:  Did it  did it at once . So maybe  maybe it 'll be a similar thing . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah .  
B:  Cool . 
C:  No , I know , I th I I think that is gonna be 
C:  sort of 
C:  the key to this wh to th the big project of the summer of  of getting the constructions right is that 
D:  <paper rustling> 
C:  people do manage to do this so there probably are some , uh , relatively clean rules , they 're just not context - free trees . 
A:  Right . 
C:  And if we  if the formalism is  is good , then we should be able to 
C:  have , you know , sort of moderate scale thing . And that by the way is  is , Keith , what I encouraged George to be 
C:  talking with you about . Not the formalism yet 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  but the phenomena . 
A:  Yeah . 


C:  The p And  Oh , another thing , um 
C:  there was this , uh 
C:  thing that Nancy agreed to in a  in a weak moment this morning 
A:  Hmm ! 
C:  that 
B:  I was really strong . <laugh> 
A:  Hmm ! 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  Hmm .  
C:  Uh , sorry . In a  in a friendly moment . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  Same thing . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <sniff> 
C:  Anyway , uh , that we were  that we 're gonna try to get a 
C:  uh , first cut at the revised formalism by the end of next week . 
C:  OK ? Probably skipping the mental spaces part . 
D:  <laugh-breath> 
A:  Alright . 
B:  Seems  
A:  Right . I do . 
C:  Uh , just trying to write up essentially what  what you guys have worked out 
C:  so that everybody has something to look at . We 've talked about it , but only the innermost inner group 
C:  currently , uh , knows , uh 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Knows .  
A:  OK . 
B:  Yeah , and  and not even all of them really do . But like   
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Right . 
A:  There 's  The group as a whole knows but no individual member kno <laugh> 
C:  Well that that  yeah th there 's one of the advantages of a document , right ? , is  is that 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
C:  it actually transfers from head to head . 
C:  So anyway . So um  
A:  OK . 
B:  Ah , communication ! 
C:  Huh ? 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  Communication . 
C:  Communication , documentation and stuff .  Anyway , so , uh , with a little luck  
A:  Hunh ! 
B:  <sniff> 
B:  <clears throat> 
C:  Uh  l let 's , let 's have that as a goal anyway . 
C:  And  
A:  So , uh , what was the date there ? Monday or  ?  
C:  No , no , no . 
A:  It 's a Friday . <laugh>  
C:  No , w uh  we 're talking about a week fr e end of next week . 
B:  But , uh , but  but the two of us will probably talk to you at well before th I mean . 
A:  End of next week . I thought you said beginning of n 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Anyway , w let 's talk separately about how t 
A:  Yeah , I have a busy weekend but after that   <breath> 
A:  Yeah , gung - ho . <laugh> 
C:  OK . Yeah , so  so someti sometime next week . 
A:  Great , 
C:  Now if it turns out that that effort leads us into 
C:  some big hole 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  that 's fine . 
A:  OK . 
C:  You know , if you say we 're  we 're dump  dump  dump . 
C:  There 's a really hard problem we haven't solved yet  that , that 's just fine . 
A:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  But at  at least sort of try and work out what the state of the art is right now . 
B:  <sniff> 
C:  Right , t t if  to the extent that we have it , let 's write it 
A:  OK . 
C:  and to the extent we don't , let 's find out what we need to do . 
A:  OK . 
C:  So , uh 
E:  <lip noise> Can we  ? 


E:  <clears throat> Is it worth  thinking of an example out of our 
E:  tourism thing domain , that involves a  a  a decent mental  space shift  or setting up  
C:  I think it is , but  uh  but I interrupted before Keith got to tell us what happened with 
C:  " where is the Powder - Tower ? " or whatever 
B:  Right .  
A:  Well . 
A:  Uh , what was supposed to happen ? I 've sort of been actually caught up in some other ones , so , um , you know , I don't have a write - up of  
E:  <laugh> 
A:  or I haven't elaborated on the ideas that we were already talking about which were  
E:  Hmm , yeah . I think  I think we already came 
E:  to the conclusion that we have two alternative  paths that we  
E:  two alternative ways of representing it . One is sort of a  has a 
E:  um <outbreath> 
A:  It 's gone . <breath> 
F:  <heavy static> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  um <outbreath> 
A:  The question of whether the polysemy is sort of like in the construction or pragmatic . 
B:  One of them was th 
B:  Right . 
E:  or comes  is resolved 
B:  Right . 
E:  later . Yeah . 
A:  I think it has to be the  the second case . 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  Um , so d ' you  Is it clear what we 're talking about here ? 
B:  I agree . 
C:  Uh  
E:  It 's  
A:  The question is whether the construction is semantic or like ambiguous between asking for location and asking for path . Um 
B:  So you might be  yeah , y 
B:  And asking for directions . 
E:  Should we have a  a  a  
A:  or  or whether the construction semantically , uh , is clearly only asking for location but pragmatically that 's construed as meaning " tell me how to get there " . 
B:  Uh  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  So  assume these are two , uh , nodes we can observe in the Bayes - net . So these are either 
C:  Yep . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
E:  true or false and it 's also just true  or false . 
B:  <breath> 
E:  If we encounter a phrase such as " where is X ? " , should that set this to true and this to true , and the Bayes - net figures out which under the c situation in general is more likely ? 
E:  Um , or should it just activate 
B:  <breath> 
E:  this , have this be false , and the Bayes - net figures out whether this actually now means  ? 
C:  Uh w that 's a s OK , so that 's a  that 's a separate issue . So I a I I th I agree with you that , um , it 's a disaster to try to make separate constructions for every 
B:  Slightly different . 
A:  OK . 
B:  <sniff> 
B:  <clears throat> <sniff> 
C:  uh , pragmatic 
C:  reading , although there are some that will need to be there . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Good .  
B:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
C:  I mean , there there 's some that  
B:  Or have every construction list all the possible pragmatic implications of the same one .  Right . 
C:  You can't do that either . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  But , you know , c um  almost certainly " can you pass the salt " is a construction worth 
B:  <sniff> 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  noting that there is this th this  this  this  uh 
B:  Request . 
A:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
B:  Very yeah .  
A:  So right , this one is maybe in the gray area . Is it  is it like that or is it just sort of 
C:  Ri - 
B:  Mmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  One  
A:  obvious from world knowledge that no one  you wouldn't want to know the location without wanting to know how to get there or whatever . 
E:  Or in some cases , it 's  it 's quite definitely s so that you just know  wanna know 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  where it is . <breath> 
A:  Well the question is basically , is this conventional or conversational implicature ? 
C:  Exactly . Yeah . 
B:  <extended heavy breath> 
B:  Might be , yeah . 
C:  And I guess , see , the more important thing at this stage is that we should be able to know how we would handle it in ei 
C:  f in the short run it 's more important to know 
C:  how we would treat  
C:  technically what we would do if we decided A and what we would do if we decided B , than it is t to decide A or B r 
B:  Right . 
A:  OK , right . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Which one it is .  
A:  Which of that is .  Yeah , OK 
E:  Hmm . 
C:  right now . 
B:  Cuz there will be other k examples that are one way or the other . Right . 
C:  W we know for sure that we have to be able to do both . So I guess <mouth> 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  In the short run , let 's  let 's 
C:  be real clear on h 
C:  what the two alternatives would be . 
A:  OK . 


E:  <mouth> And then the <clears throat> we had another idea floating around 
E:  um , which we wanted to , uh , get your input on , and that concerns the  
B:  <extended outbreath> 
E:  But the nice thing is w we would have a person that would like to work on it , and that 's Ir - Irina Gurevich from EML  who is going to be visiting us , uh , the week before , uh , August 
B:  <sniff> <sniff> 
E:  and a little bit into August . 
E:  And she would like to <outbreath> apply the  ontology that is , um <breath> 
E:  being crafted at EML . That 's not the one I sent you . The one I sent you was from GMD , out of a European CRUMPET . 
C:  It was terrible . 
E:  Agreed . 
E:  Um , and one of the reas one of the  those ideas was , 
E:  so , 
E:  back to the old Johno observation that if y if you have a dialogue history  and it said 
E:  the word " admission fee " 
E:  was 
E:  uh , mentioned 
E:  um , it 's more likely that the person actually wants to enter  than just take a picture of it 
E:  from the outside . 
E:  Now what could imagine  to , you know , have a list for each construction of things that one should look up in the discourse history , yeah ? That 's the really stupid way . 
E:  Then there is the  really clever way that was suggested by Keith  and then there is the , uh , middle way that I 'm suggesting <laugh> and that is you  you get X , which is whatever , the castle . 
B:  <sniff> 
B:  <sniff> 
B:  <laugh-breath> 
B:  <clears throat> <sniff> 
E:  The ontology will tell us that castles have opening hours , that they have admission fees , they have whatever . 
E:  And then , this is  We go via a thesaurus 
B:  <mike squeak> 
E:  and look up  certain linguistic surface structures  that are related to these concepts  and feed those through the dialogue history and check dynamically 
B:  <sniff> 
B:  <sniff> 
E:  for each e entity . We look it up 
E:  check whether any of these were mentioned 
E:  and then activate the corresponding nodes on the discourse 
E:  side . 
E:  <inbreath> Yeah . But that 's  
E:  I mean this  this function ,  
E:  so , has the current object been mentioned in  
E:  in  with a question about  
C:  No , no . It 's  it  
E:  concerning its  
C:  It goes the other d it goes in the other direction . 
C:  Is  
B:  <yawn> 
C:  When th When the  this is mentioned ,  the 
B:  <yawn> 
C:  uh 
C:  probability of  of , let 's say , entering changes 
B:  Of that object .  
C:  changes . 
B:  For  But  Right . 
D:  You could just hav uh , just basically , ob it  
D:  It observes an  er , it sets the  a node for 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  " entered " or " true " or something , " discourse enter " . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  So . 
E:  But , we 'll  
B:  <sniff> 
E:  @ @  
E:  uh , we have time to  
B:  <clears throat> 
E:  This is a s 
E:  just a sidetrack , but uh 
E:  <mouth> I think it 's also something that people have not done before , is 
E:  um , sort of abuse an ontology for these kinds of , uh , inferences , on 
E:  whether anything relevant to the current something has been  
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  uh , has crept up in the dialogue history already , or not . 
E:  And , um 
E:  I have the , uh  
E:  If we wanted to have that function in the dialogue hi dialogue module of SmartKom , I have the written consent of Jan to put it in there . 
C:  Good . 
C:  OK .  
C:  <inbreath> 


E:  But Keith suggested that a  a much cleaner way would be  is , you know , to keep track of the discourse in such a way that you  if you know that something like that ha has been mentioned before , this just a continues to add up , you know , in th in a  
A:  So if someone mentions admission f fees , that activates an Enter schema which sticks around for a little while in your rep in the representation of what 's being talked about . And then when someone asks " where is X ? " you 've already got the  the Enter schema activated and you 're able to  to conclude on it . Yeah . 
B:  <sniff> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Kind of a priming 
C:  <mouth> Yeah . 
B:  priming a spreading activation 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . So that 's certainly  more  realistic . I m I mean psychologically . Now technically 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Um  
D:  Well , uh , is it  doesn't it seem like if you just managed the dialogue history with a  a thread , that 
D:  you know , kept track of ho of the activity of  
D:  I mean , cuz it would  the  the thread would know what nodes  like , needed to be activated , so it could just keep track of  how long it 's been since  something 's been mentioned , and  automatically load it in . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  You could do that . Um . 
C:  But 
C:  here 's  here 's a way  in th in the bl Bayes - net you could  you could think about it this way , that if 
C:  um  at the time " admissions fee " was mentioned  you could increase the probability  that someone wanted to enter . 
B:  Turn prior on .  
D:  We - yeah  th th that 's what I wa I wasn't  I was  
D:  I wasn't thinking in terms of Enter schemas . I was just  
C:  Fair enough , OK , but , but , in terms of the c c the current implementation  right ? 
C:  so that 
C:  um 
B:  It would already be higher in the  context . 
C:  th that th the  the  the conditional probability that someone  
C:  So at the time you mentioned it  
C:  This is  this is essentially the Bayes - net equivalent 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  of the spreading activation . It 's  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <mike noise> 
C:  In some ways it 's not as good but it 's  the implementation we got . We don't have a connectionist implementation . 
A:  Yeah , sure . No , I mean 
C:  Now  


C:  Now my guess is that it 's not a question of time but it 
C:  is a question of whether another  intervening object has been mentioned . 
B:  Yeah , relevance . Yeah . 
C:  I mean , we could look at dialo this is  Of course the other thing we ha we do is , is we have this data coming 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  which probably will blow all our theories , but  <laugh> but skipping that  so  so  but my guess is what  what 'll probably will happen , 
B:  <mike noise> 
A:  Yeah , right . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Here 's a  here 's a proposed design .  
C:  is that there 're certain constructions which , uh , for our purposes do 
C:  change the probabilities of EVA decisions and various other kinds 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  and  
C:  th that 
C:  the , uh , standard way that  that the these contexts work is sort of stack - like or whatever , but that 's sort of the most recent thing . 
C:  And so it could be that  when another 
C:  uh , en tourist entity gets mentioned , you 
B:  Renew  @ @ Yeah .  
C:  re re essentially re - initiali you know , re - i essentially re - initialize the  state . 
D:  Mmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <clears throat> 
B:  <sniff> 
C:  And of course i if we had a fancier one with multiple worlds 
C:  you could have  uh , you could keep track of what 
B:  <sniff> 
C:  someone was  uh 
B:  <clears throat> <sniff> 
C:  saying about this and that . You know , " I wanna go  in the morning I wanna  " 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  " Here 's my plan for today . Here 's my plan for tomorrow . " hypothetically .  
C:  Yeah , or  Yeah , in the morning morning I I 'm planning t to go shopping , in the afternoon to the Powder - Tower  
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh , tal so I 'm talking about shopping and then you say , uh , you know , well , um 
C:  " What 's it cost ? " or something . Or  Anyway . So one could well imagine , but not yet . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  But I do th think that the   
C:  It 'll turn out that it 's gonna be  depend pretty much on whether there 's been an override . 
B:  <clears throat> <sniff> 
E:  Yeah , I mean , if  if you ask " how much does a train ride and  and cinema around the vineyards cost ? " and then somebody tells you it 's sixty dollars and then you say 
E:  " OK 
E:  How much is , uh  I would like to  visit the  " <laugh> whatever , something completely different , " then I go to , you know , Point Reyes " , 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  it  it 's not more likely that you want to enter anything , but it 's , as a matter of fact , a complete rejection of entering 
C:  Right .  
B:  Right .  
C:  Right .  
A:  Yeah . <breath> 
E:  by doing that . 
B:  So when you admit have admission fee and it changes something , it 's only for that particular  It 's relational , right ? It 's only for that particular object . 
C:  Yeah , I th th Yeah . 
E:  <inbreath> 
C:  Well , and  and  and the simple idea is that it 's on it 's only for m for the current 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  uh , tourist e entity of instre interest .  
A:  Yeah . <breath> 
B:  Right . 


C:  Now , uh  But I think Ro - Robert 's right , that to determine that , 
C:  OK ? you may well want to go through a th thesaurus and  and  
B:  <clears throat> 
C:  So , if the issue is , if  so now th this construction has been matched and you say " OK . 
B:  <sniff> 
B:  <sniff> 
A:  <breath> 
C:  Does this actually have any implications for our decisions ? " 
C:  Then there 's another piece of code 
C:  <mouth> that presumably  does that computation . 
B:  So , sort of forward chaining in a way , rather than  backward . OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah .  
B:  <sniff> 
C:  But  but what 's Robert 's saying is  is , 
B:  <clears throat> <sniff> 
C:  and I think he 's right ,  
C:  is you don't want to try to build into the construction itself 
C:  all the synonyms and all  you know , all the wo  
C:  Uh 
C:  maybe . 
B:  <yawn> 
C:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
C:  I 'll have to think about that . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  <sniff> 
C:  I don't know . 
B:  <clears throat> <sniff> 
C:  I mean it  th 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  I can thi I can think of arguments in either direction on that . <inbreath> But somehow you want to do it . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <5 tongue taps>  
B:  <sniff> 
E:  Well , it 's just another , sort of , construction side is how to get at the possible inferences we can draw from the discourse history 
E:  or changing of the  probabilities , and - or   
B:  Guess it 's like  I g The other thing is , whether you have a m 
B:  m user model 
B:  that has , you know , whatever , a current plan , 
B:  whatever , 
B:  plans that had been discussed , and 
B:  I don't know , I mean   
B:  <sniff> <clears throat> 
D:  What  uh , what 's the argument for putting it in the construction ? Is it just that  the s synonym selection is better , or  ?  
C:  Oh , wel 
C:  Well , the ar the  The argument is that 
C:  you 're gonna have the  
C:  If you 've recognized the word , 
C:  you 've recognized the word , which means you have a lexical construction for it , so you could just as well tag 
B:  <breath> 
C:  the lexical construction with the fact that it 's a 
C:  uh , you know , thirty percent increase in 
C:  probability of entering . 
C:  You  So you could  you could  you could invert  invert the whole thing , so you s you tag that information on to  the lexicon since you 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Oh , I see . 
C:  had to recognize it anyway . 
C:  That  that 's the argument in the other direction . 
C:  at  at  
C:  Yeah , and this is   
E:  <inbreath> Even though uh the lexical 
E:  construction itself  out  out of context , 
E:  uh , won't do it . I mean , y you have to keep track whether the person says <inbreath> 
E:  " But I but I 'm not interested in the opening times " 
B:  Yeah .  
E:  is sort of a more a V type . <laugh> 
B:  <big yawn> 
C:  Yeah there 's , yeah ther there 's that as well . 


C:  Well , this  this is highly relevant to someone 's thesis . 
E:  Yes , um . 
C:  You 've noticed that . 
E:  That 's  uh , I 'm  I 'm 
E:  keeping on good terms with Jan . Yeah . 
C:  OK .  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  So the point is , it 's very likely that Robert 's thesis is going to be along these lines , and the local rules are 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh-breath> 
E:  <laugh-breath> 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh , s 
D:  <outbreath> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  if it 's your thesis , you get to decide how it 's done . 
B:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  OK . So if , you know  if this is  seriously , if this becomes part of your thesis , you can say , hey we 're gonna do it this way , that 's the way it 's done . 
E:  Mmm . 
B:  <mouth> 
B:  Yay , it 's not me . <laugh> It 's always me when it 's someone 's thesis . 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  No , no , no ! No , no . We 've got a lot  we 've got a lot of theses going . 
B:  Now it 's not . Yay ! <laugh> I know it is .  It 's so nice ! <laugh> 
A:  There 's a few of us around now . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  Right .  
E:  Well , let 's  let 's talk after Friday the twenty - ninth . 
E:  Then we 'll see how f f  
C:  Right . So h he 's got a th he 's got a meet meeting in Germany with his thesis advisor . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh-breath> 
B:  Yeah , he said he 's gonna f finish his thesis by then . 
A:  Oh yeah . 
E:  Yeah .  
E:  I should try to finish it by then . Yeah . So . 
C:  Oh , right . 
E:  It  it might even be  interesting then to  say that I should be forced to 
D:  <laugh-breath> 
A:  <breath> 
C:  <inbreath> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  um , sort of pull some of the ideas that have been floating in my head out of the , uh  out of the top hat 
C:  Yes . 
E:  and , um  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <scraping noise> Always good . 
C:  Right .  
E:  That metaphor is not going anywhere , you know .  
C:  So - 
B:  <breath> 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Ri - No . Absolutely . So , uh , wh you had  you know you ha You had done one draft . 
A:  <breath> 
E:  Yes , and , um , it 's  
C:  And a another draft 
B:  I didn't get  
E:  Ha - None of that is basically still around , but it 's  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Oh , I guess it 's good I didn't read it . <laugh> 
C:  OK . 
F:  <laugh>  
C:  D i @ @ 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  That 's normal . <laugh> 
C:  I i 
C:  I  this is  I 'm shocked . This is the first time I 've seen a thesis proposal change .  
A:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <yawn> Really ? 
C:  Right . Anyway , uh . <laugh> So . But , yeah , a second  that would be great . So , uh , a sec I mean you 're gonna need it anyway . 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  <sniff> 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Yeah , and I would like to d discuss it and , you know , get you guys 's input and make it sort of bomb - proof .  
C:  and 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yep . 
B:  Bomb proof ! 
A:  Good . 
B:  Oh ! Oh , OK . <laugh> 
E:  Bullet - proof . 
E:  That 's the word I was looking for . <laugh> 
C:  Both proof . 
A:  Either way . 
B:  Both . 
C:  Right .  
B:  <full breath> Good luck . <breath> Really .  
C:  Uh 
C:  So that , so th thi this  I mean , so this is the point , is we  we 're going to have to cycle through this , but 
E:  <outbreath> 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  th the draft of the p proposal on the constructions is  is going to tell us a lot about  what  we think needs to be done by construal . 
B:  <sniff> 
B:  <sniff> 
E:  <inbreath> OK .  <clears throat> <outbreath> 
C:  And , um , we oughta be doing it . 


A:   
B:   
C:   
D:   
E:   
F:   
C:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Um .  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah . So I think  in fact , 
C:  That 's the other thing .  uh , this is  this is , 
C:  speaking of hard problems ,  this is a very good time 
C:  um , to start trying to make explicit where construal comes in and  you know , where c where the construction 
B:  <yawn> 
B:  <clears throat> 
B:  <sniff> 
C:  per - se 
C:  ends  and where construal comes in , cuz this is clearly part of th Huh ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <mouth> 
B:  Yeah , we 've  we 've done quite a bit of that . <laugh> We 've been doing quite a bit of that . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Well I said . But that 's part of what the f 
B:  We have many jobs for you , Ro - Robert . <laugh> The conclusion . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah , it seems to always land in your category . You 're lucky . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well , he 's gonna need this . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . So . <laugh> Right . So thing  That 's part of why we want the formalism , is  is because th it is gonna have implicit in it 
E:  <laugh-breath> 
E:  <breath> <laugh-breath> 
E:  <breath> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <sniff> 
E:  <clears throat> 
E:  Was I ? In the room ? 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  No , you weren't there  on purpose . Like   
C:  Yeah .  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Made it much easier to make these decisions . Uh . <breath> 
B:  Obviously . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . Well I  That 's tentative . They aren't decisions , they 're ju they 're just proposals . 
A:  Yeah . Right , right , right . 
B:  No , they 're decisions . <laugh> OK . 
A:  Yes . <laugh> Excuse me . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , that  That 's the point , is  is th 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  Constraints . Let 's call them constraints , around which one has to  
B:  <breath> 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah .   Anyway . But so that 's that 's w 
B:  Actually , yeah . <laugh> There 's a problem with that word , too , though . 
D:  Yeah , but it  he the decisions I made wer had to do with my thesis . So consequently don't I get to decide then that it 's Robert 's job ? 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  No . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Uh . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Anyhow . <laugh> 
C:  <mike noise burst> 
B:  Well , I 'll just pick a piece of the problem and then just push the hard stuff into the center  and say it 's Robert 's . Like .  
E:  I 've always been  completely in favor of consensus decisions , so we 'll  we 'll find a way . 
B:  I can   
C:  Right .  
D:  <laugh>  
C:  Well , we  we  we will , but um 
B:  I haven't .  OK .  
C:  not  


E:  Yeah , we need  we need some  Then we need to make some dates . 
E:  Um . <outbreath> 
B:  @ @  
B:  Why do I have this unless I 'm gonna write ? Fine . 
B:  That 's OK . 
A:  OK . 
B:  Cuz then you 'll find out more of what we 're making you do . <laugh> 
E:  Yep , and then  
D:  Hmm , hmm .  
A:  Yeah . 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <laugh> We 'll make a presentation of your propo  of your proposal .  
E:  Yikes . 
A:  Oy ,  deadlines . 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Perfect . Can you also write it up ? 
B:  It 's like , " this is what we 're doing . And the complement is Robert . " <laugh>

B:  <laugh> I already sent you my fi  my bib file . So . 
E:  <laugh> 
E:  OK . And , um . 
E:  Sounds good .  
B:  W do you have data , like the  the  
B:  You have preliminary  data ? Cuz I know , you know , we 've been using this one easy sentence 
B:  and I 'm sure you guys have  uh , maybe you are the one who 've been looking at  the rest of it  it 'd  it 'd be useful for me , if we want to  have it a little bit more 
A:  Um , I 
A:  To tell you the truth , what I 've been looking at has not been the data so far , I just sort of said " alright let 's see if I can get noun phrases and , uh , major verb co uh , constructions out of the way first . " 
B:  data oriented . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm  mm - hmm . 
A:  And I have not gotten them out of the way yet . Surprise . So , um . 
B:  Mm - hmm .  
E:  <laugh-breath> 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  <sniff> 
A:  Uh , no , all the focus stuff . We sort of just dropped that cuz it was too weird and we didn't even know , like , what we were talking about  exactly , what the object of study was . So . 
E:  <breath> 
B:  Um - mmm .  
C:  Yeah . Well , if  if  I mean , i part of  of what the exercise is , t by the end of next week , is to say what are the things that we just don't have answers for yet . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  That 's fine . I mean 
A:  Yep . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Well , if you  if you 
B:  <noises> 
E:  do wanna discuss focus  background 
E:  and then 
E:  get me into that because  I mean , I wo I w scientifically worked on that for  for almost two years . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  OK , then certainly we will . Good . 
B:  Yeah , you should definitely , um 
B:  be on on that  maybe  maybe by  after Monday we 'll  y you can see what things we are and aren't  
A:  Yeah . w We should figure out what our questions are , for example , <laugh> to ask you . So . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK .  
B:  <clears throat> 
A:  OK . 
B:  <sniff> 
C:  <3 tongue taps>  
C:  Yeah .   Great . And then we 're gon we 're gonna  because of this other big thing we haven't talked about is  actually implementing this stuff ? 
B:  <cough> <cough> 
C:  So that I guess the three of us are gonna connect tomorrow about that . 
B:  Yeah , we could talk tomorrow . 


E:  <inbreath> Meeting  regular meeting time for the summer , we really haven't found one . We did  Thursdays one for a while . 
B:  <clears throat> 
E:  I just talked to Ami . It 's - it 's a coincidence that he can't do  couldn't do it today  here . 
B:  @ @  
B:  Usually , he can . 
E:  Usually he has no real constraints . So  
C:  And the NTL meeting moved to Wednesday , cuz of  of , uh  
B:  <clears throat> 
E:  Yeah , it was just an exception . 
C:  Yeah , you weren't here , but  but  but  s uh ,  And so , if that 's OK with you , you would  
A:  It 's i Is it staying basically at the Wednesday noon ? 
C:  Yeah , it was th 
A:  OK . It was th off this week , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . I always thought it was staying . 
C:  Right . 
B:  Yeah , I thought it was just this week that we were changing it . 
E:  Mmm .  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  And , um . How do we feel about doing it Wednesdays ? Because it seems to me that this is sort of a time where when we  have things to discuss with other people , there  they seem to be s tons of people around . 
B:  <clears throat> <sniff> 
C:  The only disadvantage  is that it may interfere with other 
E:  Or  
B:  <sniff> 
E:  subgroup meetings 
C:  s you know , other  other  No , you  Uh , people in this group connecting with  with 
B:  <clears throat> 
B:  Those people who  happen to be around .  
C:  those people  who  who might not be around so much . Uh , I don't care . I I uh 
C:  you know 
C:  I have no fixed  
A:  To tell you the truth , I 'd rath I 'd , I 'd  would like to avoid more than one ICSI meeting per day , if possible . <laugh> But  <laugh> I mean . I don't know . Whatever . <laugh> 
B:  <clears throat> <sniff> 
C:  OK . 
C:  No , that 's fine . I mean that  
E:  The  I 'd like to have them all in one day , so package them up and then  <breath> 
A:  Yeah , I can understand that . 
C:  Well p <mike noise burst> 
C:  people  people differ in their tastes in this matter . I  I 'm neutral . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah .  I 'm always here anyway , so   
E:  It 's OK , that  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . @ @ That 's  Me too . I 'm basically  I 'm here . So . 
B:  It doesn't matter . 
E:  Well , if  one  sort of thing is , this room is taken at  after three - thirty pr pretty much every day 
B:  <breath> 
E:  by the data collection . So we have subjects anyway  Except for this week , we have subjects in here . That 's why it was one . 
B:  Oh . 
B:  Oh .  
C:  OK . 
E:  So we just knew i 
B:  So did you just say that Ami can't make one o ' clock ? 
E:  No , he can . 
B:  Oh , OK . 
A:  Oh . 
E:  So let 's say Thursday one . But for next week , this is a bit 
E:  late . 
E:  <inbreath> So  I would suggest that we need to  to talk  
B:  Oh , oh , OK . <clears throat> 
E:  OK . About the c the  th 
B:  Could we do Thursday at one - thirty ? Would that  
E:  No .  
B:  that be horrible ? 
D:  <laugh-breath> 
E:  Yes . 
B:  Oh really ? 
E:  Because , uh , this room is again taken at two - thirty by Morgan . 
B:  Oh , OK . OK . You didn't tell me that . OK , that 's fine . 
E:  And 
E:  the  s meeting recorder meeting meeting meeting recording on meeting meetings   
B:  OK , OK , OK . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  OK .  Yeah . 
E:  So .  
C:  Interesting .  So you 're proposing that we meet Tuesday . 
A:  Ah , yeah . <laugh> 
E:  How about that ? 
C:  I  I could 
A:  Next week . 
B:  Well , we 're meeting Tuesday . I mean we usually meet Tuesday  or l like , linguists  um , at two . 
D:  Would it  
A:  That 's right . 
B:  So . 
D:  And the s 
B:  Do you want to meet again here bef 
E:  <mouth> <inbreath> I mean w 
D:  Is the Speech - Gen meeting still at  on Tuesdays ? 
E:  Well , actually we w we we did scrap our Monday time just because Bhaskara couldn't 
B:  Hhh .  Maybe I do need a Palm Pilot . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  come Monday . So there 's  Nothing 's impeding Monday anymore  either . 
A:  That doesn't apply to a  
E:  Get a fresh start  
D:  Although I thought you wanted to go camping on Monday  er , take off Mondays a lot so you could go camping . 
E:  <inbreath> Yeah , that 's another s thing . Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  But , um . I mean , there are also usually then holidays anyways . 
E:  I mean  like   
B:  Usually ? <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Sometimes  it works out that way . 
F:  <laugh>  
D:  <laugh> 
E:  So . Hmm ! 
B:  Well , I mean , the linguists ' meeting  i happens to be at two , but I think that 's  I mean . <mouth> 
A:  That should be relatively flexible be  
B:   pretty flexible , I think . So . 
A:  Yeah . There 's just  sort of the 
B:  The multiple meetings  yeah . 
A:  two to four of us . Right ? Yeah . So . 
B:  Right . 
A:  And , you know , of course Nancy and I are just sort of always talking anyway and sometimes we do it in that room . So , you know , I mean . <breath> <expulsive outbreath>  
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
E:  OK , so  l forget about the b the camping thing . So let 's  eh , any other problems w w w ? 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <sniff> 
E:  But , I suggested Monday . If that 's a problem for me then I shouldn't  suggest it . <laugh> 
D:  Ha - ha - ha .  
C:  OK .  
E:  So . 
A:  Um , all of the proposed times sound fine with me . 
B:  Same here . 
E:  Monday ? 
C:  OK , whate I mean  
A:  <breath> 
C:  What I think Robert 's saying is that 
A:  Earlier in the week 
C:  earlier we  At least for next week , there 's a lot of stuff we want to get done , so why don't we plan to meet Monday and  we 'll see if we want to meet any more than that . 
A:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
E:  Mmm . 
A:  OK . 
B:  <inbreath> What time ?  
E:  OK . 
B:  At o o o o one , two , three  ?  
E:  One , two , three ? 
E:  Three 's too late . Two - thirty ? 
C:  Oh , I i  Yeah , I actually  Two is the earliest I can meet on Monday . 
E:  OK , two . 
C:  Here I 'm blissfully agreeing to things and realizing that I actually do have some stuff scheduled on Monday . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Sure . Sounds great . 
B:  <sigh> 
A:  Uh , so that 's the eighteenth . 
B:  You guys will still remind me , right ? <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  No way ! 
B:  Y you 'll come and take all the  <laugh> the headph the good headphones first and then remind me . 
E:  W why do you  ? 
A:  Yeah , exactly . 
D:  <hiss>  
E:  And 
A:  Sorry , two PM . 


E:  do I get to see th uh , your formalism before  that ? 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  Yes .  
B:  Uh . Would you like to ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <laugh> OK . I was actually gonna work on it for tomorrow  like this  this weekend . 
E:  <laugh> I wo I would like  I would sort of  get a  get a notion of what  what you guys have in store for me . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Well m @ @ you know , w maybe Mond - Maybe we can put  This is part of what we can do Monday , if we want . 
B:  Yeah . I 
B:  OK . 
A:  Alright . <breath> 
E:  OK . 
B:  I mean , I  I  I  
C:  Is some  some version 
B:  Yeah , so there was like , you know , m m in my head the goal to have like an intermediate version , like , everything I know . 
F:  <mike noise> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <laugh> And then , w I would talk to you and figure out everything you know , that  you know , see if they 're consistent . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Why don't w Maybe you and I should meet sort of more or less first thing Monday morning and then we can work on this . 
B:  Yes . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  That 's f fine with me . So . 
A:  OK . 
E:  <mouth> You - y <outbreath> 
B:  I might  I might  um , s You said you 're busy  over th until the weekend , right ? 
A:  Yeah , sort of through the weekend because Kate has a photography show . 
B:  <breath> 
B:  That 's fine . So we might continue our email 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  thing and that might be fine , too . So , maybe I 'll send you some   
A:  Um , if you have time after this I 'll show you the noun phrase thing . 
B:  OK . That would be cool . So . 
B:  OK , and 
B:  we 'll  
E:  <inbreath> So the idea is on Monday at two we 'll  
B:  You wanna m 
E:  we 'll see an intermediate version of the formalism for the constructions , and do an on - line merging with my construal  ideas . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  So that 's OK for you  
B:  Sure , sure . 
C:  OK . 
A:  Alright . 
E:  So it won't be , like , a for semi - formal presentation of my  proposal . It 'll be more like towards  finalizing that proposal . OK , that 's fine . 


A:  Someday we also have to  we should probably talk about the other side of the " where is X " construction , which is the issue of , um , how do you simulate questions ? What does the simspec look like for a question ? 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . <mouth noise> 
A:  Because  it 's a little different . We had to  we had an idea for this which seemed like it would probably work . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , now , we we w 
C:  Great . OK . Yeah . Simspec may need  we may n need to re - name that . 
B:  I  Yeah . I  
A:  Yeah . 
C:  OK ? So let 's think of a name for  for whatever the  this intermediate structure is . Oh , we talked about semspec , for " semantic spec specification " and that seems  
A:  Mmm . 
C:  Um .  
A:  It 's more general @ @ 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  You know , so it 's a m minimal change . 
B:  Only have to change one vowel . That 's great . All the old like <laugh> graphs , just change the  just , like , mark out the  
E:  <laugh-breath> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . Just  
C:  Right . 
A:  Cool . 
C:  Right , a little substi substi You know , that 's what text substitution 
A:  Yeah . It 's good for you . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  uh macros are for . Anyway , uh , so let 's  let 's for the moment call it that until we think of something better . 
E:  <laugh-breath> 
A:  OK . 
C:  And , yeah , we absolutely need to find  
C:  Part of what was missing were markings of all sorts that weren't in there , incl including the questions  We didn't  we never did figure out how we were gonna do emphasis 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  in  in 
C:  uh , the semspec . 
B:  Yeah , we 've talked a little bit about  that , too , which  
B:  uh , uh , it 's hard for me to figure out with sort of our general linguistic issues , how they map onto this particular one , but   
A:  Yeah . 
B:  OK , yeah , understood .  
C:  But that 's part of the formalism  is got to be 
C:  uh , how things like that get marked . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 


A:  So , I have not really approached a lot of the data , but I mean obviously like these  the  the question one , since we have this idea about the indefinite pronoun thing and all that , you know , I ca can try and , um 
A:  run with that , you know , try and do some of the sentence constructions now . It would make sense . 
E:  OK . Do you wanna run the indefinite pronoun idea past Jerry ? 
B:  OK . 
A:  Oh yeah , the basic idea is that um , 
A:  uh  you know  Uh , <laugh> let 's see  if I can  formulate this . 
E:  So  Mary fixed the car with a wrench . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  So you perform the mental sum and then , you know , " who fixed the car with a wrench ? " 
E:  You  basically are told , to  to do this 
E:  <mike noise> In the  in  analogously to the way you would do " someone fixed the car with a wrench " . And then you hand it back to your hippocampus and find out  what that , you know , 
A:  Means .  
E:  means , and then  come up with that  so who that someone was . 
A:  The WH question has this as sort of extra thing which says " and when you 're done , tell me who fills that slot " or w you know . So , um . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  And , you know , this is sort of a nice way to do it , the idea of sort of saying that you treat  from the simulation point of view or whatever  you treat , uh , WH constructions similarly to 
A:  uh , indefinite pronouns like " someone fixed the car " because  lots of languages , um , have WH questions with an indefinite pronoun in situ or whatever , and you just get intonation to tell you that it 's a question . 
B:  Use actually the same one .  
C:  Alright , which is 
A:  So it makes sense  um  
C:  Skolemization .  
A:  Hmm ? 
C:  In  in logic , it 's  it 's  @ @  it 's actual Huh ? What ? 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Right . <laugh> Let 's put a Skolem  <laugh> Skolem constant in , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> shko 
E:  <laugh-breath> 
A:  Sure . 
B:  Yeah .  Right . 
E:  <breath> 
A:  OK . 
C:  That - that 's not  that 's not saying it 's bad , it 's just that  
A:  Right . 
C:  that  that  the logicians have  have , uh  
A:  Right . No . Of course . 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  That 's right . 
E:  come up with this 
A:  It makes sense from that point of view , too , which is actually better . So yeah , um . 
A:  Anyway , but just that kind of thing and we 'll figure out exactly how to write that up and so on , but 
C:  Good . 


C:  Wel - then t Hans . 
C:  Has  I haven't seen Hans Boas ? 
B:  He 's been around . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . So has he been  been involved with this , or  ? 
B:  Just maybe not today . 
B:  Eh . with us ? Yeah . I would say that tha that those discussions have been primarily , um , Keith and  Keith and me , but um 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  like in th the meeting  I mean , he sort of  I thin like the last meeting we had , I think we were all very much part of it  but  um 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Sometimes Hans has been sort of coming in there as sort of like a  devil 's advocate type role or something ,  like  " This make  you know , I 'm going to pretend I 'm a linguist who has nothing to do with this . This makes no sense . " And he 'll just go off on parts of it which  definitely need fixing but aren't where we 're at right now , so it 's 
B:  but different perspec Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
C:  Yeah , yeah .  No , that 's fine . I just wanted t to 
C:  I have to catch up with him , and I wanted t to get a feeling for that . OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  So I don't know what his take will be on these meetings exactly , you know . 
C:  OK . 
A:  <breath> 
C:  Good . 
A:  Cuz sometimes he sort of sounds like we 're talking a bunch of goobledy - gook from his point of view . 
B:  I think it 's good when we 're  
B:  when we 're into data and looking at the  some specific linguistic phenomenon  in  in English or in German , in particular , whatever , 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  that 's great , and Ben and  and Hans are , if  if anything , more  you know , they have more to say than , let 's say , I would about some of these things . 
C:  Right . 
B:  But when it 's like , well , w how do we capture these things , you know , I think it 's definitely been Keith and I who have d you know , who have worried more about the  
C:  Well , that 's good . That 's  I I I think that should be the  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  s Which is fine . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  the core group  and  um 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  that 's , you know , I think  very close to the maximum number of people working together that can get something done . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Yes . 
B:  Yeah . We actually have  I think we have been making progress , and its sort of surprising . You know , like   
A:  Yeah . 
C:  I  I  I  I definitely get that impression . Yeah . That 's great . 
A:  Yep . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  So anyone else would like uh  ruin the balance of  Anyway . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Well , but  Well . But th th then w then we have to come back to the bigger group . 
B:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 


B:  Like  like what you call certain things , which we decided long ago we don't care that much right now . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  OK . 
B:  But in a sense , it 's good to know that he  of all people  you know , like maybe a lot of people would have m much stronger reactions , so , you know , he 's like a relatively friendly linguist and yet a word like " constraint " causes a lot of problems . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  <mouth noise> OK . This is consistent with 
B:  And , so .  Right . So . 
C:  um 
C:  the role I had suggested that he  he play , 
B:  Ah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  OK , which was  that 
B:  <clears throat> 
C:  o one of the things I would like to see happen 
B:  <sniff> 
C:  is a paper that was tentatively called " Towards a formal cognitive semantics " 
C:  which was addressed to 
C:  these linguists  uh  who haven't been following  this stuff at all . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  So  it could be that he 's actually , at some level , thinking about how am I going to  communicate this story   
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  So , internally , we should just do  whatever works , cuz it 's hard enough . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  But  if he g if he turns  is  is really gonna turn around and help t to write this version that 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  does  connect with as many as possible of the  other linguists in the world 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  um  
C:  then  
C:  then it becomes important to  use 
C:  terminology that 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm .  Sure . 
C:  doesn't 
C:  make it hard  I mean , it 's gonna be plenty hard for  for people to understand it as it is , but y y you don't want to make it worse . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  So .  
A:  No , right . I mean , tha that role is  is , uh , indispensable but that 's not where sort of our heads were at in these meetings . It was a little strange . <inbreath> 
C:  Right . 


B:  I was just gonna say , though , that , for instance , there was  you know , out of a meeting with Johno  
B:  came the suggestion that " oh , 
B:  could it be that the  meaning  constraints really aren't used for selection ? " which has sort of been implicit  in the parsing  strategy we talked about . In which case we w we can just say that they 're the effects or the bindings . 
C:  Right . 
B:  Which  uh , so far , in terms of like putting up all the constraints as , you know , pushing them into type constraints , the  when I 've , you know , propo then proposed it to linguists who haven't yet given me  you know , we haven't yet thought of a reason that that wouldn't work . 
B:  Right ? As long as we allow our type constraints to be reasonably  complex . 
C:  Well , it  
B:  So  Anyway , to be  to talk about later . 
C:  Yeah , it has to in the sense that 
C:  you 're gonna use them eventu it 's  you know , it 's sort of a , um , generate and test 
B:  <cough> <cough> 
B:  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm . 
C:  kind of thing , and if you over - generate then you 'll have to do more . I mean , if there are some constraints that you hold back and don't use 
C:  uh , in your initial matching 
B:  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm . 
C:  then you 'll match some things  I mean , I  I d I don't think there 's any way that it could completely fail . It  it could be that 
C:  uh , you wind up  I mean  
C:  The original bad idea of purely context - free grammars 
C:  died because  there were just vastly too many parses . 
C:  You know , exponentially num num many parses . And so th the concern might be that  not that it would totally fail , but that  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  That it would still generate too many .  
C:  it would still genera 
B:  Right ? So by just having semantic even bringing semantics in for matching just in the form of j semantic types , right ? Like 
B:  " conceptually these have to be construed as this , this , and this " 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  might still give us quite a few possibilities  
C:  We don't know , but , yeah . 
B:  that , you know  And  and 
B:  it certainly helps a lot . I mean , le let 's put it that way . So . 
C:  No question . Yeah . And I think it 's a  it 's a perfectly fine place to start . 
B:  <sniff> 
C:  You know , and say , let let 's see how far we can go this way . 
B:  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm . 
C:  And , uh  
D:  Well it definitely makes the problem easier . 
C:  I 'm  I 'm in favor of that . 
D:  <laugh> <laugh> 
C:  Uh , cuz I think i I think it 's  As you know , I think it 's real hard and if w if we   Right . 


B:  <sniff> 
B:  So  Friday , Monday 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Monday . So . OK , that 's  Tuesday . Like   th that 's the conclusion . OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
E:  So , you your dance card is  completely filled now ? 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh-breath> Shoot .
