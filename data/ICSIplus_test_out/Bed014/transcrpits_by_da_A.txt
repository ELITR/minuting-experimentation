A:  Bummer . 
A:  That 's good to know . 
A:  But I will not give them to you unless you come into my lair . 
A:  You know , the usual party voices . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Hmm ! 
A:  This is something you ha you get used to as a programmer , right ? 
A:  You know ,  and it 's cool , it works out that way . 
A:  Where  
A:  OK . 
A:  What  what thing is this ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  And so on . 
A:  It was written by committee . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Oh ! 
A:  Hmm ! 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh yeah , like uh , I solved the  the problem of um  we were talking about how do you  
A:  various issues of how come a plural noun gets to quote " count as a noun phrase " , 
A:  you know , occur as an argument of a higher construction , but a bare singular stem doesn't get to act that way . 
A:  Um , 
A:  and it would take a really long time to explain it now , 
A:  but I 'm about to write it up this evening . 
A:  I solved that at the same time as " how do we keep adjectives from floating to the left of determiners and how do we keep all of that from floating outside the noun phrase " to get something like " I the kicked dog " . 
A:  Um . 
A:  Did it  did it at once . 
A:  So maybe  maybe it 'll be a similar thing . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Hmm ! 
A:  Hmm ! 
A:  Same thing . 
A:  Alright . 
A:  Right . I do . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Knows . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  There 's  The group as a whole knows 
A:  but no individual member kno 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Hunh ! 
A:  So , uh , what was the date there ? 
A:  Monday 
A:  or  ? 
A:  It 's a Friday . 
A:  End of next week . 
A:  I thought you said beginning of n 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , I have a busy weekend 
A:  but after that   <breath> Yeah , 
A:  gung - ho . 
A:  Great , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  But at  at least sort of try and work out what the state of the art is right now . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Well . Uh , what was supposed to happen ? 
A:  I 've sort of been actually caught up in some other ones , 
A:  so , um , you know , I don't have a write - up of  or I haven't elaborated on the ideas that we were already talking about 
A:  which were  
A:  It 's gone . 
A:  The question of whether the polysemy is sort of like in the construction or pragmatic . 
A:  I think it has to be the  the second case . 
A:  Um , so d ' you  Is it clear what we 're talking about here ? 
A:  The question is whether the construction is semantic or like ambiguous between asking for location and asking for path . 
A:  Um 
A:  or  or whether the construction semantically , uh , is clearly only asking for location 
A:  but pragmatically that 's construed as meaning " tell me how to get there " . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
A:  So right , this one is maybe in the gray area . 
A:  Is it  is it like that or is it just sort of obvious from world knowledge that no one  you wouldn't want to know the location without wanting to know how to get there or whatever . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well the question is basically , is this conventional or conversational implicature ? 
A:  OK , right . 
A:  Which of that is .  Yeah , OK 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  So if someone mentions admission f fees , that activates an Enter schema which sticks around for a little while in your rep in the representation of what 's being talked about . 
A:  And then when someone asks " where is X ? " you 've already got the  the Enter schema activated 
A:  and you 're able to  to conclude on it . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , sure . 
A:  No , I mean 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  " Here 's my plan for today . 
A:  Here 's my plan for tomorrow . " 
A:  hypothetically . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  There 's a few of us around now . 
A:  Oh yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , it seems to always land in your category . 
A:  You 're lucky . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Made it much easier to make these decisions . 
A:  Uh . 
A:  Yeah . Right , right , right . 
A:  Yes . <laugh> Excuse me . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Anyhow . 
A:  Always good . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  That 's normal . 
A:  Good . 
A:  Either way . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  It 's i Is it staying basically at the Wednesday noon ? 
A:  OK . It was th off this week , 
A:  yeah . 
A:  To tell you the truth , I 'd rath I 'd , I 'd  would like to avoid more than one ICSI meeting per day , if possible . 
A:  But  <laugh> I mean . I don't know . 
A:  Whatever . 
A:  Yeah , I can understand that . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Ah , yeah . 
A:  Next week . 
A:  That 's right . 
A:  That doesn't apply to a  
A:  That should be relatively flexible be 
A:  Yeah . There 's just  sort of the two to four of us . 
A:  Right ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So . 
A:  And , you know , of course Nancy and I are just sort of always talking anyway and sometimes we do it in that room . 
A:  So , you know , I mean . 
A:  Um , all of the proposed times sound fine with me . 
A:  Earlier in the week 
A:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Sure . Sounds great . 
A:  Uh , so that 's the eighteenth . 
A:  Yeah , exactly . 
A:  Sorry , two PM . 
A:  Alright . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Why don't w Maybe you and I should meet sort of more or less first thing Monday morning and then we can work on this . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah , sort of through the weekend 
A:  because Kate has a photography show . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Um , if you have time after this I 'll show you the noun phrase thing . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Alright . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Oy ,  deadlines . 
A:  Someday we also have to  we should probably talk about the other side of the " where is X " construction , 
A:  which is the issue of , um , how do you simulate questions ? 
A:  What does the simspec look like for a question ? 
A:  Because  it 's a little different . 
A:  We had to  we had an idea for this which seemed like it would probably work . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  It 's more general 
A:  Cool . 
A:  Yeah . It 's good for you . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Um , I 
A:  To tell you the truth , what I 've been looking at has not been the data so far , 
A:  I just sort of said " alright let 's see if I can get noun phrases and , uh , major verb co uh , constructions out of the way first . " And I have not gotten them out of the way yet . 
A:  Surprise . 
A:  So , um . 
A:  So , I have not really approached a lot of the data , 
A:  but I mean obviously like these  the  the question one , 
A:  since we have this idea about the indefinite pronoun thing and all that , you know , I ca can try and , um run with that , 
A:  you know , try and do some of the sentence constructions now . 
A:  It would make sense . 
A:  Oh yeah , the basic idea is that 
A:  um , uh  you know  
A:  Uh , <laugh> let 's see  if I can  formulate this . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Means . 
A:  The WH question has this as sort of extra thing which says " and when you 're done , tell me who fills that slot " or w you know . 
A:  So , um . 
A:  And , you know , this is sort of a nice way to do it , 
A:  the idea of sort of saying that you treat  from the simulation point of view or whatever  you treat , uh , WH constructions similarly to uh , indefinite pronouns 
A:  like " someone fixed the car " 
A:  because  lots of languages , um , have WH questions with an indefinite pronoun in situ or whatever , 
A:  and you just get intonation to tell you that it 's a question . 
A:  So it makes sense 
A:  um 
A:  Hmm ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  shko 
A:  Sure . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Right . Right . No . Of course . 
A:  That 's right . 
A:  It makes sense from that point of view , too , which is actually better . 
A:  So yeah , um . 
A:  Anyway , but just that kind of thing 
A:  and we 'll figure out exactly how to write that up and so on , 
A:  but 
A:  Uh , no , all the focus stuff . 
A:  We sort of just dropped that 
A:  cuz it was too weird 
A:  and we didn't even know , like , what we were talking about  exactly , 
A:  what the object of study was . 
A:  So . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yep . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  OK , then certainly we will . 
A:  Good . 
A:  Yeah . w We should figure out what our questions are , for example , <laugh> to ask you . 
A:  So . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Sometimes Hans has been sort of coming in there as sort of like a  devil 's advocate type role or something , 
A:  like  " This make  you know , I 'm going to pretend I 'm a linguist who has nothing to do with this . 
A:  This makes no sense . " 
A:  And he 'll just go off on parts of it which  definitely need fixing 
A:  but aren't where we 're at right now , 
A:  so it 's 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  No , right . I mean , tha that role is  is , uh , indispensable 
A:  but that 's not where sort of our heads were at in these meetings . 
A:  It was a little strange . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So I don't know what his take will be on these meetings exactly , you know . 
A:  Cuz sometimes he sort of sounds like we 're talking a bunch of goobledy - gook from his point of view . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yep . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Shoot . 
A:  Bummer .
