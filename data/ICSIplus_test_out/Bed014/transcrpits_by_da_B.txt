B:  Anyw 
B:  Sorry . 
B:  Mental  mental Palm Pilot . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Hence  no problem . 
B:  Hello  I 'm channel one . 
B:  Eh . 
B:  But mine is correct . 
B:  It 's one . 
B:  Channel one . 
B:  Oh , oh , oh ! 
B:  Oh . 
B:  So  
B:  But your p 
B:  No , but the paper 's correct . 
B:  Look at the paper . 
B:  Oh . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yes , you 've bested me again . 
B:  That 's how I think of our continuing interaction . 
B:  Damn ! 
B:  Foiled again ! 
B:  He 'll probably come later . 
B:  Forge ahead . 
B:  Are you in charge ? 
B:  Hiring somebody . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Better . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Sure . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  I didn't know she spoke German . 
B:  Oh , OK . 
B:  Oh . Rewrite the German ones into English . 
B:  OK , got it . 
B:  OK , got it . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Wh - Which one ? 
B:  Oh . 
B:  Festival ? 
B:  Oh , oh . Got it . OK . 
B:  Yeah , I know . 
B:  That doesn't sound , <laugh> exactly right either . 
B:  I think  
B:  Well , let 's just pick whatever sounds best . 
B:  Whatever sounds best . 
B:  Unfortunately , probably male voices , a bit more research on . 
B:  So . 
B:  Oregon Graduate Insti 
B:  Hmm ! 
B:  Mmm , that 's good . 
B:  Yeah , I know . 
B:  Tha - that 's the part I didn't understand . 
B:  Hmm ! 
B:  Will it work again , 
B:  or  ? 
B:  Where the " where is " construction is . 
B:  Yeah , I didn't know about it until  Robert told me , like , 

B:  Y yeah . Well , yeah . I was like , why didn't Dan tell me ? 
B:  It 's hard . 
B:  Yeah , it 's hard . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Cool . 
B:  I was really strong . 
B:  Seems  
B:  Yeah , and  and not even all of them really do . 
B:  But like  
B:  Right . 
B:  Ah , communication ! 
B:  Communication . 
B:  But , uh , but  but the two of us will probably talk to you at well before th 
B:  I mean . 
B:  Anyway , w let 's talk separately about how t 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  One of them was th 
B:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
B:  I agree . 
B:  So you might be  yeah , y And asking for directions . 
B:  Uh  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Slightly different . 
B:  Good . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Or have every construction list all the possible pragmatic implications of the same one . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Request . 
B:  Very yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Might be , yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Which one it is . 
B:  Cuz there will be other k examples that are one way or the other . Right . 
B:  Kind of a priming 
B:  priming a spreading activation 
B:  Turn prior on . 
B:  It would already be higher in the  context . 
B:  Yeah , relevance . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Renew 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  So when you admit have admission fee and it changes something , it 's only for that particular  It 's relational , right ? 
B:  It 's only for that particular object . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Of that object . 
B:  For  But  
B:  Right . 
B:  So , sort of forward chaining in a way , rather than  backward . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Guess it 's like  I g The other thing is , whether you have a m m user model that has , you know , whatever , a current plan , whatever , plans that had been discussed , 
B:  and 
B:  I don't know , 
B:  I mean  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh , s 
B:  Yay , it 's not me . 
B:  It 's always me when it 's someone 's thesis . 
B:  Now it 's not . Yay ! 
B:  I know it is . 
B:  Yeah , he said he 's gonna f finish his thesis by then . 
B:  Yeah , we 've  we 've done quite a bit of that . 
B:  We 've been doing quite a bit of that . 
B:  We have many jobs for you , Ro - Robert . 
B:  The conclusion . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  No , you weren't there  on purpose . 
B:  Like  
B:  Obviously . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  No , they 're decisions . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Actually , 
B:  yeah . <laugh> There 's a problem with that word , too , though . 
B:  Well , I 'll just pick a piece of the problem and then just push the hard stuff into the center  and say it 's Robert 's . 
B:  Like . 
B:  I can  
B:  I haven't .  OK . 
B:  I didn't get 
B:  Oh , I guess it 's good I didn't read it . 
B:  Really ? 
B:  Bomb proof ! 
B:  Oh ! Oh , OK . 
B:  Both . 
B:  Good luck . <breath> Really . 


B:  Usually , he can . 
B:  Yeah . I always thought it was staying . 
B:  Yeah , I thought it was just this week that we were changing it . 
B:  Those people who  happen to be around . 
B:  Yeah .  I 'm always here anyway , 
B:  so  
B:  It doesn't matter . 
B:  Oh . 
B:  Oh . 
B:  So did you just say that Ami can't make one o ' 
B:  Oh , OK . 
B:  Oh , oh , 
B:  OK . 
B:  Could we do Thursday at one - thirty ? 
B:  Would that  that be horrible ? 
B:  Oh really ? 
B:  Oh , OK . OK . You didn't tell me that . 
B:  OK , that 's fine . 
B:  OK , OK , OK . OK .  Yeah . 
B:  Well , we 're meeting Tuesday . 
B:  I mean we usually meet Tuesday  or l like , linguists  um , at two . 
B:  So . 
B:  Do you want to meet again here bef 
B:  Hhh .  Maybe I do need a Palm Pilot . 
B:  Usually ? 
B:  Well , I mean , the linguists ' meeting  i happens to be at two , 
B:  but I think that 's  I mean . 
B:  pretty flexible , I think . 
B:  So . 
B:  The multiple meetings 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Same here . 
B:  What time ? 
B:  At o o o o one , two , three  ? 
B:  You guys will still remind me , right ? 
B:  Y you 'll come and take all the  <laugh> the headph the good headphones first and then remind me . 
B:  Why do I have this unless I 'm gonna write ? 
B:  Fine . 
B:  Yes . 
B:  Uh . Would you like to ? 
B:  OK . I was actually gonna work on it for tomorrow  like this  this weekend . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . I 
B:  OK . 
B:  I mean , I  I  I  
B:  Yeah , so there was like , you know , m m in my head the goal to have like an intermediate version , like , everything I know . 
B:  And then , w I would talk to you and figure out everything you know , that  you know , see if they 're consistent . 
B:  Yes . Yeah . 
B:  That 's f fine with me . 
B:  So . 
B:  I might  I might  um , 
B:  s You said you 're busy  over th until the weekend , right ? 
B:  That 's fine . So we might continue our email thing 
B:  and that might be fine , too . 
B:  So , maybe I 'll send you some  
B:  OK . That would be cool . 
B:  So . 
B:  OK , and we 'll  You wanna m 
B:  So that 's OK for you  
B:  Sure , sure . 
B:  That 's OK . 
B:  Cuz then you 'll find out more of what we 're making you do . 
B:  We 'll make a presentation of your propo  of your proposal . 
B:  It 's like , " this is what we 're doing . 
B:  And the complement is Robert . " 
B:  OK . 
B:  I already sent you my fi  my bib file . 
B:  So . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I  Yeah . I  
B:  Only have to change one vowel . 
B:  That 's great . 
B:  All the old like <laugh> graphs , 
B:  just change the  just , like , mark out the  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , we 've talked a little bit about  that , too , 
B:  which  
B:  uh , uh , it 's hard for me to figure out with sort of our general linguistic issues , how they map onto this particular one , 
B:  but  
B:  OK , yeah , understood . 
B:  W do you have data , like the  the  You have preliminary  data ? 
B:  Cuz I know , you know , we 've been using this one easy sentence 
B:  and I 'm sure you guys have  uh , maybe you are the one who 've been looking at  the rest of it  
B:  it 'd  it 'd be useful for me , if we want to  have it a little bit more data oriented . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm  mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Use actually the same one . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Right . <laugh> Let 's put a Skolem  <laugh> Skolem constant in , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Yeah .  Right . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Um - mmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah , you should definitely , um be on on that  
B:  maybe  maybe by  after Monday we 'll  y you can see what things we are and aren't  
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  He 's been around . 
B:  Just maybe not today . 
B:  Eh . with us ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I would say that tha that those discussions have been primarily , um , Keith and  Keith and me , 
B:  but um 
B:  like in th the meeting  I mean , he sort of  I thin like the last meeting we had , I think we were all very much part of it 
B:  but  um 
B:  but different perspec 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Like  like what you call certain things , 
B:  which we decided long ago we don't care that much right now . 
B:  But in a sense , it 's good to know that he  of all people  
B:  you know , like maybe a lot of people would have m much stronger reactions , 
B:  so , you know , he 's like a relatively friendly linguist 
B:  and yet a word like " constraint " causes a lot of problems . 
B:  And , so .  Right . So . 
B:  Ah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm .  Sure . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  I think it 's good when we 're  
B:  when we 're into data and looking at the  some specific linguistic phenomenon  in  in English or in German , in particular , whatever , that 's great , 
B:  and Ben and  and Hans are , if  if anything , more  you know , they have more to say than , let 's say , I would about some of these things . 
B:  But when it 's like , well , w how do we capture these things , you know , I think it 's definitely been Keith and I who have d you know , who have worried more about the  
B:  s Which is fine . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yes . 
B:  Yeah . We actually have  I think we have been making progress , 
B:  and its sort of surprising . 
B:  You know , like  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  So anyone else would like uh  ruin the balance of  
B:  Anyway . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah , we could talk tomorrow . 
B:  I was just gonna say , though , that , for instance , there was  you know , out of a meeting with Johno  came the suggestion that " oh , could it be that the  meaning  constraints really aren't used for selection ? " 
B:  which has sort of been implicit  in the parsing  strategy we talked about . 
B:  In which case we w we can just say that they 're the effects or the bindings . 
B:  Which  uh , so far , in terms of like putting up all the constraints as , you know , pushing them into type constraints , the  when I 've , you know , propo then proposed it to linguists who haven't yet given me  you know , we haven't yet thought of a reason that that wouldn't work . 
B:  Right ? As long as we allow our type constraints to be reasonably  complex . 
B:  So  Anyway , to be  to talk about later . 
B:  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  That it would still generate too many .  Right ? 
B:  So by just having semantic even bringing semantics in for matching just in the form of j semantic types , right ? 
B:  Like " conceptually these have to be construed as this , this , and this " might still give us quite a few possibilities 
B:  that , you know  And  and it certainly helps a lot . 
B:  I mean , le let 's put it that way . 
B:  So . 
B:  Mm - hmm .  Mm - hmm . 
B:  So  Friday , 
B:  Monday 
B:  Monday . 
B:  So . OK , that 's  Tuesday . 
B:  Like   th that 's the conclusion . OK . 
B:  Yeah , and I have nothing to do this weekend but work . 
B:  No , that 's not really true , 
B:  but like  
B:  It 's almost true . 
B:  Oh , I don't have it this weekend , 
B:  so , tsk  don't have to worry about that . 
B:  Speaking of dance , 
B:  Dance Dance Revolution 
B:  I can't believe I 'm  
B:  It 's a  it 's like a game , but it 's for , like , dancing . 
B:  Hard to  It 's like karaoke , but for dancing , 
B:  and they tell you what  
B:  It 's amazing . 
B:  It 's so much fun . 
B:  Yeah , it 's so good . 
B:  My friend has a home version and he brought it over , 
B:  and we are so into it . 
B:  It 's so amazing . 
B:  Well , y you know of it ? 
B:  I i i it 's one of your hobbies ? 
B:  It 's great exercise , I must say . 
B:  I can't wait to hear this . 
B:  Uh - huh . 
B:  Oh , definitely . They have , like , places  instead of like  Yeah , instead of karaoke bars now that have , like , DDR , 
B:  like  
B:  Yeah , yeah , I didn't until I started hanging out with this friend , who 's like " Oh , well , I can bring over the DDR if you want . " 
B:  Oh , oh , Dance Dance Revolution  OK . 
B:  He actually brought a clone called Stepping Selection , 
B:  but it 's just as good . 
B:  So . 
B:  Anyw
