C:  Yeah . 
C:  Is that English ? 
C:  Yeah , I think we 're up to MR thirteen or something . 
C:  For IBM , yeah . 
C:  Yep . 
C:  There 's only two channels . 
C:  So it 's only  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  As the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed I think . 
C:  So . 
C:  Yep . 
C:  So but it 's just transcripts , not the  not the audio ? 
C:  OK , yeah , yep . 
C:  Ah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well   Yeah . 
C:  I 've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows 
C:  so i 
C:  And I installed it on Dave Gelbart 's PC and it worked just fine . 
C:  So hopefully that will work . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yep . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah 
C:  but  But the problem is the version Transcriber works with , the Snack version , is one point six whatever 
C:  and that 's not anymore supported . 
C:  It 's not on  on the web page anymore . 
C:  But I just wrote an email to  to the author of  to the Snack author 
C:  and he sent me to one point six whatever library 
C:  and so it works . 
C:  Yeah , 
C:  but then you can't add our patches 
C:  and then the  the new version is  is totally different 
C:  a and in  yeah , in terms of  of the source code . 
C:  You  you can't find the Tcl files anymore . 
C:  It 's some whatever wrapped thing 
C:  and you can't  you can't access that 
C:  so you have to install  First install Tcl then install Snack 
C:  and then install the Transcriber thing 
C:  and then do the patches . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  No , I haven't done that yet .

C:  Yeah . 
C:  Isn't that XH ? 
C:  But I 'm using XH  H , too . 
C:  So . 
C:  It 's  It 's a little bit more as I usually don't  do not uncompress the  all of the PZM and the PDA things . 
C:  So . 
C:  It 's  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  One point five or something . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yep .
