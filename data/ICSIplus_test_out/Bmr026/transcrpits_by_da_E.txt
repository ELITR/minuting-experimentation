E:  Yeah . 
E:  Which meetings is she transcribing ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  So we 're doing some in parallel . 
E:  So they 're just doing their own thing until  
E:  OK . 
E:  Right . 
E:  And , also um , I was just showing Andreas , I got um an X Waves kind of display , 
E:  and I don't know how much more we can do with it  
E:  with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom 
E:  so , right now it 's just an X Waves 
E:  and then you have three windows 
E:  but I don't know , it looked pretty nice 
E:  and I 'm sure it  think it has potential for a little something , 
E:  yeah , for a demo . 
E:  So  
E:  Oh . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah , OK . 
E:  Well , we 'll see , um  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , it 's basically ASCII files or binary files , whatever representation . 
E:  Just three different  
E:  It 's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it 's  
E:  I mean we could do it in Matl -  I mean you could do it in a number of different places I 'm sure . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , that 'd be very cool . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Um  What do you mean by real time ? 
E:  Do you mean like  
E:  OK . 
E:  It would be cool to see it  
E:  It would be cool like to see  to hear it and see it , 
E:  and see the pitch contours also . 
E:  I think it would lose  
E:  Yeah , I mean y 
E:  Right , right . 
E:  I just thought if you meant slides I thought you meant like just  like  um view graphs or something . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  How much space do you need for these ? 
E:  I have um  I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer . 
E:  So  
E:  Uh , Samosa . 
E:  Yeah , I had . 
E:  Well it 's about  I think there 's about twelve gig left . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So , I didn't realize it was so critical . 
E:  I mean I 'm not doing anything on it right now until I get new meetings to transcri or that are  new transcriptions coming in I really can't do anything . 
E:  Um not that I can't do anything , I jus 
E:  Well  
E:  I have a lot of space , though . 
E:  I have a lot of space and it 's not  it 's n 
E:  There 's very little uh  
E:  Yeah 
E:  not for long . 
E:  But I mean it 's not going f 
E:  It 's not being used often at all . 
E:  I th 
E:  I think it 's about four or five gig 
E:  cuz I have four meetings on there , 
E:  three or four meetings . 
E:  So . 
E:  Watch a ball game ? 
E:  Yeah .
