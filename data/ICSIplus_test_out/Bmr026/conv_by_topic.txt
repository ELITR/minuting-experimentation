B:  Yeah . 
A:  OK , we 're on . 
A:  So , I think this is gonna be a pretty short meeting because I have four agenda items , three of them were 
A:  requested by Jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today . 
A:  <mouth> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  So . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <mike noise> 
topic_description:	opening


A:  The uh first was transcription status .  Does anyone besides Jane know what the transcription status is ? 
F:  Um , sort of , I do , peripherally . Um  
C:  Is that English ? 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  Well first of all with IBM I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  That 's our system . <laugh> 
F:  finally made the tape for 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Ugh !  
F:  the thing that we sent them a  week or week and a half ago and that it 's gone out to the transcribers and hopefully next week we 'll 
E:  <inbreath> 
F:  have the transcription back from that . 
F:  Um  
A:  C can I have a pen ? 
F:  Jane seems to be um 
F:  moving right along on the 
F:  transcriptions from the ICSI side . She 's assigned , I think 
F:  probably 
F:  five or six 
C:  Yeah , I think we 're up to MR thirteen or something . 
F:  m more meetings . 
F:  Yeah , so um , I guess she 's hired some new transcribers and  
D:  Mmm . 
E:  Which meetings is she transcribing ? 
D:  Speaking  
F:  Um well we 've  we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are um , sort of 
E:  OK . 
F:  awaiting 
F:  to go to IBM . 
C:  For IBM , yeah . 
E:  OK . 
D:  Hmm . 
F:  and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here . 
B:  <clear throat> 
E:  So we 're doing some in parallel . 
D:  So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there 's no data back from 
A:  Yep . 
F:  No . 
F:  Oh no no . No . We 're not waiting on them . 
D:  IBM no ? 
A:  No , no . We haven't done that process . So . They ' r they 're doing the full transcription process . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Oh , OK . 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  So they 're just doing their own thing until  
D:  Because I  
F:  We 're doing it in parallel , yeah . 
E:  OK . 
D:  I need to ask Jane whether it 's  it would be OK for her  
D:  um , s some of her people to 
D:  transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection , which is these short like five or seven minute sessions . 
C:  Yep . 
D:  Um and we want it  You know , we need  
D:  The  Again , we  we have a similar uh 
D:  logistic set - up where we are supposed to send the data to Munich and get it transcribed and get it back . 
E:  <breath> <mike noise> <breath> 
A:  Right . 
D:  But to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started . 
A:  Yep , sounds familiar . <laugh> 
D:  And so um I wanted to ask Jane if  if 
B:  <clear throat> 
D:  uh , you know , maybe one of their 
D:  transcribers could  could do  I mean since these are very short , that should really be uh , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  um  
C:  There 's only two channels . 
C:  So it 's only  Yeah . As the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed I think . So . 
D:  It 's  Yeah . It 's only two  
D:  Right , s 
D:  Yeah . So  So it 's basically one channel to transcribe . And it 's  One session is only 
D:  uh like seven  
B:  So that should have ma many fewer  And it 's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that , right ? So .  Yeah . 
D:  Right . And some of it is read speech , so we could give them the  
D:  the thing that they 're reading and they just may  
A:  Make sure it 's right .  
D:  And so um , 
C:  Yep . 
D:  um , I guess since she 's  I was gonna ask her but since she 's not around I  maybe I 'll  
B:  Yeah , well it certainly seems  
D:  Uh if  if that 's OK with you to  to , you know , 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  get that stuff uh  to ask her for that , then I 'll do that . 
B:  Yeah , if we 're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that , that 's OK because I I um , I mean I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us , so it 's  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  OK , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Alrighty . 
F:  Oh , yeah , and also related to the transcription stuff , so I 've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected and what stage each meeting is in , in terms of whether it 's  
B:  <clear throat> 
A:  Can you mail that out to the list ? 
F:  Mm - hmm , yeah I will . I  That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll  
A:  Oh , OK , OK . 
F:  I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it . 
A:  Yeah , I haven't done that . So . I have lots of stuff to add that 's just in my own directory . I 'll try to get to that . 
F:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	transcription status


A:  OK . So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but I don't really think there 's much to talk about . I 'm just gonna do it .  And uh , if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead .  <laugh> 
B:  You are going to  
A:  I 'm gonna send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to 
F:  <clear throat> 
A:   suggest edits . And then bleep them out . 
B:  OK . 
A:  For the ones that we have . 
A:  Um  
C:  So but it 's just transcripts , not the  not the audio ? 
A:  Nope , they 'll have access to the audio also . 
C:  OK , yeah , yep . Ah . 
A:  I mean that 's my intention . Because the transcripts might not be right . So you want people to be able to listen to them . 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  So  
B:  <clear throat> 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  So , um the audio that they 're gonna have access to , will that be the uncompressed version ? Or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and  
A:  Oh , that 's a good point . 
A:  That 's a good point . Yeah , it 's  it 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , uh , uh , it takes too long to do random access decompression . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Yeah , I was just wondering because we 're uh running out of the un - backed - up disk space on 
A:  Well , that was the other point .  Yep , that 's another agenda item . 
F:  Oh , was that another one ? OK . I 'll wait . 
A:  So , uh  
E:  <mike noise> 
A:  But that is a good point so we 'll get to that , too . 
topic_description:	participant approval


A:  Um , DARPA demo status , not much to say . The back - end stuff is working out fine . It 's more or less ready to go . I 've added some stuff that uh indes indexes by the meeting type MR , EDU , et cetera and also by the user ID . 
E:  <breath> <mike noise> 
A:  So that the front - end can then do filtering based on that as well . 
A:  Uh  
A:  The back - end is uh , going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I 'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer . 
A:   And uh Dave Gelbart says he 's a little too busy . So I think Don and I are gonna work on that and  and you and I can just talk about it off - line more . 
E:  Right . 
A:  But uh  the back - end was pretty smooth . So I think , we 'll have something . It may not be as  
B:  Oh - 
A:  As pretty as we might like , but we 'll have something . 
B:  I wondered whe when we would reach Dave 's saturation point . He 's sort of been  been volunteering for everything and  and uh  
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh>  Yeah . 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  O K . Finally said he was too busy . <laugh> I guess we reached it . 
A:  <laugh>  Yeah , he  he actually  he volunteered but then he s then he retracted it . So . Oh well . 
E:  <breath> 
A:  Um  
E:  And , also um , 
B:  <clear throat> 
E:  I was just showing Andreas , I got um an X Waves 
E:  kind of display , and I don't know how much more we can do with it  with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom so , right now it 's just an X Waves and then you have three windows but I don't know , it looked pretty nice and I 'm sure it  think it has potential for 
A:  Oh , cool . 
A:  For a demo ?  Yeah , sounds good . 
E:  a little something , yeah , for a demo . 
E:  So  
B:  OK , so again , the issue is  For July , the issue 's gonna be what can we fit into a Windows machine , uh , and so on , but  
E:  Oh . <breath> OK . 
A:  So it might just be slides . 
E:  Yeah , OK . Well , we 'll see , um  
C:  Well   Yeah . 
C:  I 've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows so i And I installed it on Dave Gelbart 's PC and it worked just fine . So hopefully that will work . 
D:  Really ? So is that  
D:  Because there 's some people um  
D:  It would be cool if we could uh get that to work uh at  at SRI because the um  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yep . 
D:  we have m m We have more Windows machines to run the  
A:  Well 
A:  Transcriber is Tcl - TK , very generic with Snack , so basically anything you can get Snack to run on , it will work . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah but  But the problem is 
C:  the version Transcriber works with , the Snack version , is one point six whatever and that 's not anymore supported . It 's not on  on the web page anymore . But I just wrote an email to  to the author of  to the Snack author and he sent me to one point six whatever library and so it works . 
A:  Well I thought it was packaged with Transcriber ? 
C:  Yeah , but then you can't add our patches and then 
C:  the  the new version is  is totally different a and in  yeah , in terms of  of the source code . You  you can't find the Tcl files anymore . It 's some whatever wrapped thing and you can't  you can't access that so 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Ah . 
D:  Mmm . 
C:  you have to install  First install Tcl then install Snack and then install the Transcriber thing and then 
C:  do the patches . Yeah . 
F:  <mike noise> 
A:  Patch . Ugh ! 
D:  I  I wonder if  if we should 
D:  contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along  We have ? Oh . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  We have   Yeah b it 's just hasn't made it into the release yet . 
D:  Oh , OK . 
F:  So did you um 
F:  put the uh  <clear throat> the NT version out on the uh Meeting Recorder page ? Or  
C:  No , I haven't done that yet . I 'm  oh Nope . 
C:  But I definitely will do that . 
B:  So , can some of the stuff that Don 's talking about somehow fit into this 
B:  Uh , mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , it 's basically ASCII files or binary files , whatever representation . Just three different  It 's a waveform and 
C:  So  
E:  just a stylized pitch vector basically so it 's  
D:  So  So  Well  
E:  I mean we could do it in Matl -  I mean you could do it in a number of different places I 'm sure . 
D:  But  But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the  you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary 
C:  Yep . 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  valued function that is  that is you know time synchron ti 
E:  Yeah , that 'd be very cool . 
B:  Yes . 
A:  It 'd be easy enough to add that . Again it 's  it 's  It 's more Tcl - T K programming . So someone who 's familiar with Tcl - TK has to do it , but uh , it wouldn't be hard to do . 
D:  ti time synchronous with the wavform . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
D:  But it would almost be like having another waveform displayed . S Right . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yep . 
C:  Yep . 
C:  Yeah .  Yeah , maybe we could l look into that . 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  But it  it seems to me that 
C:  And  
A:  I c 
A:  It doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary . So yo It seems to me you could do images . 
E:  Um  What do you mean by real time ? Do you mean like  
F:  Like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo . 
E:  OK . 
F:  Is that what you mean ? Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , jus Yeah . It just seems to me jus 
E:  It would be cool to see it  It would be cool like to see  
C:  And to hear it . Yeah . Yeah . 
E:  to hear it and see it , and see the pitch contours also . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Sure , but I don't think  I  You can do all that just statically in PowerPoint. 
E:  I think it would lose  
E:  Yeah , I mean y 
A:  Just record the audio clip and show an image and I think that 's  
E:  Right , right . 
E:  I just thought if you meant slides I thought you meant like just  
E:  like  
D:  <breath> 
E:  um view graphs or something . 
B:  You know , wh Yeah . So . Uh , no , we 're talking about on the computer and  and um , I think when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting , we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have 
E:  Right . 
B:   and , <clear throat> the more live , the better , but uh , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent . So I think  
B:   For a lot of reasons , I think it would be very nice to have this Transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it so it 'd be a good thing to get in there . But , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  um  Anyway , jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you 're doing , uh , 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  in   to people . 
B:  Cuz a lot of this stuff , particularly for Communicator , uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th originally had t had to do with prosodics 
B:  It 'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
B:  see them . 
topic_description:	demo and transcriber software


A:  And the last i item on the agenda is disk issues yet again . So , we 're doing OK on backed up . We 're  We 're only about thirty percent on the second disk . 
A:  So , uh , 
A:  we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical , but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  <mike noise> 
A:  And , my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space , but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data 
A:   all at once , in a lot of different ways . 
E:  <breath> 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh there 's a lot of transcribers , too . 
A:  Yeah , there 're a lot of transcribers , so all of those need to be expanded , and then people are doing chunking and I want to do uh , uh , 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  An - 
E:  <breath> 
F:  Right . 
A:  uh , the permission forms , so I want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around . 
A:  Um  
A:  And Jane was gonna talk to , uh , Dave Johnson about it . One of the things I was thinking is we  we just got these hundred  alright , excuse me  ten , uh 
A:  SPARC - Blade 
B:  Did they come in ? 
F:  SUN - Blades . Yeah . They came in the other day . 
A:  SUN - Blades . They came in but they 're not set up yet . And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh . 
A:   because they 'll be in the machine room , they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines . 
A:   And if we just need un - backed - up space , we could just hang disks off them . 
F:  Well , is there  Why not just hang them off of Abbott , is there a  
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Because there 's no more room in the disk racks on Abbott . 
F:  Ah . 
F:  Ah , I see . 
B:  Weren't we gonna get  Well , maybe it should get another rack . 
D:  But you still need to store the disks somehow . 
D:  So  
A:  Well , but the SUN - Blades have spare drive bays . 
F:  You can put two  
A:  Just put them in . 
D:  Oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the  
C:  Internal . Yeah . 
A:  Sure . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh . 
A:  Cuz the SUN  uh , these SUN - Blades take commodity hard drives . So you can just go out and buy a PC hard drive and stick it in . 
D:  Mmm . 
B:  But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it  it  file server  it seems like we would want to get it , uh , a second disk rack or something . 
D:  Plus we 're talking about buying a second dis uh , file server .  
A:  Well , I mean there are lots of long term solutions . What I 'm looking for is where do we s expand the next meeting ? 
C:  Yep . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  I see <laugh>  Oh , I see . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Well , for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten , mightn't you ? Uh , you know Dave Johnson is gone for , like , ten days , 
A:  Oh , I didn't know he had left already . 
B:  Uh , well , tonight . 
A:  Oh , oh well . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  You mean he won't set up the  mmm . 
E:  How much space do you need for these ? 
B:  I don't know . I don't know what his schedule is . I 'm just saying he 's gone . 
A:  You  we need about a gig per meeting . 
F:  I  I thi 
C:  Yep . <breath> 
E:  I have um  I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer . 
A:  Alright ! What 's your computer 's name ? 
E:  So  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> You had an eighteen gigabyte drive . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Uh , Samosa . 
E:  Yeah , I had . Well it 's about  I think there 's about twelve gig left . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  So it  And you have an X drives installed ? OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So , I didn't realize it was so critical . I mean I 'm not doing anything on it right now until I get new meetings to transcri or that are  new transcriptions coming in I really can't do anything . 
A:  And you 're o you 're offering ? 
A:  OK . 
F:  I  I jus I just gave Thilo some  about ten gigs , the last ten gigs of space that there was on  on uh Abbott . 
E:  Um not that I can't do anything , I jus 
F:  Uh  
F:  And uh  So but that  But  
A:  Which one was that , X  G ? OK . 
C:  XG . 
F:  XG . 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  XG ? 
D:  That 's also where we store the  
D:  The uh Hub - five training set waveforms , right ? 
C:  Oops .  
F:  No . I don't think that 's on XG . On XG is only Carmen and Du - and Stephane 's disk . 
A:  But that won't be getting any bigger , will it ? 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Right . 
C:  It 's  Yeah . 
D:  But I 've also been storing  I 've been storing the feature files there and I guess I can s start deleting some because we now know what the best features are and we won't be using the old ones anymore . 
E:  Well  
F:  Yeah , I do I don't think it was on XG . I th 
E:  I have a lot of space , though . 
D:  Uh  
C:  Isn't that XH ? 
E:  I have a lot of space and it 's not  it 's n There 's very little uh  Yeah not for long . But I mean it 's not going f It 's not being used often at all . 
A:  Not  not for long . <laugh> 
D:  Oh thats XA  Oh that 's X  
D:  Maybe I 'm confu Oh no I 'm sorry . 
C:  But I 'm using XH  H , too . So . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , it 's probably  Probably only about four gig is on X  on your X drive , but we 'll definitely take it up if you  
D:  Oh OK . 
E:  I th 
D:  I think you 're right . It 's XH and D  The b I 'm also using DG I got that confused . OK . 
E:  I think it 's about four or five gig cuz I have four meetings on there , three or four meetings . 
A:  Great . 
E:  So . 
B:  We need  
A:  OK , so that will get us through the next couple days .  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  We need another gigaquad . <laugh> 
A:  Yep .  At least . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  OK . 
B:  There should  I d There should just be a b I should have a button . 
B:  Just press  Press each meeting saying " we need more disk space " <laugh> " this week " . Skip the rest of the conversation . 
A:  The " more disk space " button ?  Yep . 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
F:  Well we 've collected so far something like 
F:  uh sixty - five meetings . 
F:  And it 's 
B:  And  And how much does each meeting take ? 
F:  about a gig uncompressed . 
C:  It 's  It 's a little bit more as I usually don't  do not uncompress the  all of the PZM and the PDA things . So . 
F:  Is a little more ? 
F:  Right , yeah so if you uncompressed everything it 's even more . U Uh compressed how much are they ? Like  
C:  It 's  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  One point five or something . 
A:  Half a gig .  For all of them . 
F:  About half ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Yep . 
F:  So we 're definitely are storing 
F:  you know , all of those . 
F:  So there 's what thirty some gig 
B:  So - so So maybe there 's a hundred  gig or something . Or  
F:  of just meetings so far ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  I mean . Cuz we  we have the uncompressed around also . So it 's like  
F:  Right . Right . Well we  We haven't uncompressed all the meetings , but  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  I would like to . 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . Well I mean it 's  the they really are cheap . I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , but 
F:  Right .  
A:  Yep . 
B:  But uh , we could  You know , if you want to get four disks , get four disks . I mean it 's  it 's small  I mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars . 
F:  Yeah . Well I sent that message out to , I guess , you and Dave asking for  if we could get some disk . I s I sent this out 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  And put it where ? <laugh> 
B:  Right . 
F:  a  a day ago but  and Dave didn't respond so I don I don't know 
F:  how the whole process works . I mean does he just go out and get them and  if it 's OK , and  
A:  Yep . 
F:  So I was assuming he was gonna take over  that . But he 's probably too busy given that he 's leaving . 
B:  Yeah , I think you need a direct conversation with him . And just <clear throat> say an - e just ask him that , you know , wha what should you do . And in my answer back was " are you sure you just want one ? " So I mean I think 
F:  Yeah . 
B:   that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure " well , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months " . 
A:  Wa - a I know what they want . The sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine . 
A:   So they don't want to stack up external drives . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Um  
A:   And then they want everything else in the machine room . 
B:  Right . 
A:  So the question is where are you gonna hang them ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I don't know what the space situation is in the machine room . 
A:  Right . 
F:  So . 
B:  Right . So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave , cuz it  
D:  Th - The  
F:  I think part of the reason why Dave can't get the  the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now . So he has to re - arrange a bunch of stuff . 
D:  One  
D:  Mmm . 
A:  Yep . 
D:  One  One 
D:  On - One thing to in to um t to do when you need to conserve space is 
D:  I bet there are still some old , uh , like , nine gig disks , uh , 
D:  around and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks and  and you know recover the space . 
A:  Yep . 
B:  Yeah . No . I think Dave  Dave knows all these things , of course . An - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  But I  I know that  generally their first priority has been for backed up disk . And so I think what he 's been concentrating on is uh 
D:  Mmm . 
A:  the back  the 
A:   back up system , rather than on new disk . So . 
D:  Mmm . 
B:  Well . So . But this  this is a very specific question for me . Basically , we can easily get 
A:  Which  
B:   one to four disks , I mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it , it 's no big deal . 
B:   Uh , but the question is where they go , and I don't think we can solve that here , you just have to ask him . 
D:  Maybe we can put some disks in the  in that back room there . 
A:  Yeah really . <laugh> 
B:  Attach to  
A:  Popcorn . 
D:  To the machine that collects the data . So then you could , at least temporarily , store stuff there . The only  
B:  Yeah ? 
A:  Yeah , it 's just  It 's not on the net , so it 's a little  awkward  It 's not  
F:  Hmm . 
D:  What do you mean it 's not on the net ? 
C:  It 's not bad . 
A:   It 's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except S S H  Yep . 
D:  Oh because it 's  because it 's an ACIRI machine ? Oh , oh oh . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  And also on the list is to get it into the normal ICSI net , but 
A:  Who knows when that will happen ? 
F:  That might be a good 
D:  But that can't be that hard . I mean  
F:  short term solution , though . 
A:  No , the  the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire 
A:  running to that back room  that goes anywhere near one of the ICSI routers . <laugh> 
D:  Oh ,  hhh .  
A:  So , they actually have to run a wire 
A:  somewhere . 
A:  @ @  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , e again , you know , any one of these things is certainly not a big deal . If there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it 's  it 's  jus every ever everybody  everybody has a  has  
A:  But Dave has to do all of them . 
B:   Well all of us have long lists of different things we 're doing . 
B:  But at any rate I think that there 's a  there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need and I think we need a  a conversation with  
B:  Uh , maybe  maybe after  after tea or something you and I can go down and  and talk to him about it  Just say " wha you know , what should we do right now ? " 
C:  <cough> 
F:  How long is David gonna be gone ? 
B:  Uh , eleven days or something ? 
A:  Oh my !  
B:  <clear throat> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah basically tomorrow and all of  the week after . 
A:  And that 's all I have . 
topic_description:	disk issues


B:  Um  
B:  Let 's see . The only oth thing  other thing I was gonna add was that um  
B:  uh , I talked briefly to Mari and uh we 
B:  had <clear throat> both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the  last meeting we had here 
B:   but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting 
B:  the Friday after next . 
B:  And I  I  I wanted to make it , um 
B:  after the next one of these meetings , so something that we wanna 
B:  do next meeting is  is uh to 
B:  put together um , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it , 
B:  um , 
B:  that 
B:  we 've done . 
B:  <laugh> I mean just sort of 
D:  <breath> 
B:  bulletize I mean o e do do I can  I can dream up text but  this is basically gonna lead to the annual report . 
B:   So  Um  If w 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  This is the fifteenth ? 
B:  Um , that would 
A:  So just a week from tomorrow ?  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  So , uh , we can  This  So that 's an  
D:  Is this gotta be in the morning ? 
B:  Um  
D:  Or  Because you know I  Fridays I have to leave uh 
D:  like around uh two . 
D:  So if it could be before that would be be 
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  No , no but I  I  I don't need other folks for the meeting . I can do it . A A All I 'm saying is that on  
D:  Oh , OK , alright . Oh I 'm sorry , I misunderstood . I thought you are  
B:  Yeah so what I meant was on the me this meeting 
D:  OK . 
B:   if I wa something I  I  I 'm making a major thing in the agenda is I wanna help in getting together a list of what it is that we 've done so I can tell her . 
D:  Alright . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:   I think I have a pretty good idea but  but um  
D:  OK . 
B:  Uh , and then the next day uh , late in the day I 'll 
B:  be having that  that discussion with her . 
D:  Mmm . 
B:  Um . 
B:  So . 
D:  Um  Uh  One thing  I mean  we  <inbreath> 
D:  <clear throat> in past meetings we had um 
D:  also a you know various  variously talked about the um work that 
D:  w uh was happening sort of on the  on the recognition side um but isn't necessarily 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  related to meetings uh specifically . So . Um . And 
D:  I wondered whether we should 
D:  maybe have um a separate meeting and between 
D:  you know , whoever 's interested in that 
D:  because I feel that uh there 's plenty of stuff to talk about but it would be sort of 
D:  um 
D:  maybe the wrong place to do it in this meeting if uh  
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  Think so ? 
D:  Well , it 's that  
D:  It 's just 
D:  gonna be ver very boring for people who are not 
D:  you know , sort of 
D:  really interested in the details of the 
A:  I 'm interested . 
D:  recognition system . 
C:  Me too . 
B:  Well , OK , so how many  how many people here would not be interested in uh  in a meeting about recognition ? 
D:  <inbreath> <vocal squeak> 
D:  <inbreath> w 
D:  <expulsive breath>  
F:  Jane may not be . 
A:  Jane , I think . 
D:  Well I know  Well , Jane an  
C:  Yep . 
D:  Well you mean in a separate meeting or ha ha talking about it in this  
A:  No . If we talked about it in this meeting . 
F:  He 's wondering how much overlap there will be . 
E:  <mike noise> 
D:  OK . 
B:  Yeah , so you 're su So . 
D:  So , uh , 
D:  uh , Liz and Jane probably . 
B:  OK , so we 're gonna have a guy 's meeting . 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh . <laugh> 
F:  Good thing Liz isn't here . <laugh> 
E:  <breath> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Real  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh , if you wanna put it that way .  <laugh> 
E:  Watch a ball game ? 
B:  Wh - <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , real  real  real men 
F:  Don't listen to this , Liz . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  " Real men do decoding " or something like that . 
D:  Right . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh . 
D:  I mean it it 's sort of  
C:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  I mean when  when the talk is about data collection 
D:  stuff , sometimes I 've  
A:  The  Nod off ?  
D:  you know , I  I 'm bored . So it 's I c I can sympathize with them not wanting to  
B:  It 's cuz  y you have a  
D:  i to  to be uh  you know  If  I cou you know  this could  
D:  <breath> 
B:  So you need a better developed feminine side . 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath> 
D:  <laugh, "aheh!">  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  I 'm not sure I wanna  <laugh> 
B:  There 's probably gonna be a lot of " bleeps " in this meeting . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , I would as  I would guess . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <ingressive laugh> 
B:  Uh . 
D:  Yeah  and  
B:  Um . 
B:  <laugh> I think it must be  uh nearing the end of the week . 
D:  <breath> 
B:  Um . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <vocal squeak> I  
F:  <clear throat> 
B:  You know , I  I 've heard some comments about like this . That m could be . I mean the  Um . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And we don't have to do it every week . We could do it every other week or so . You know , whatev or whenever we feel like we  
F:  Could we  
F:  Right , I was  
F:  Why don't we alternate this meeting every other week ? 
A:  Or just alternate the focus . 
B:  <inbreath> U 
F:  Tha - That 's what I mean . 
A:  Yeah , so on even weeks have  basic  on data . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  We could do that , yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  I  I  Personally I 'd  I 'm not in favor of more meetings . 
D:  Um . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Right . 
D:  Because , uh . <laugh> You know . 
A:  I am .  
A:  Oh sor <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  But I do I don't  I mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on Meeting Recorder . So if we did that  
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Right . 
A:  Well , except that we keep going for our full time .  
C:  Yep . 
F:  Well , cuz we get into these other topics . 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  We feel  We feel obligated to collect more data . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Ugh . 
F:  So if we could alternate the focus of the meeting  
A:  I don't . Let 's read digits and go . 
B:  Why don't we just start with that . And then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting . But I  I think that 's a great idea . 
D:  ummh .  
D:  ummh .  OK . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Uh . 
B:  So uh . 
B:  Um . 
B:  Let 's chat about it with Liz and Jane  when we get a chance , see what they think and  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah that would be good . I mean Andreas and I have 
F:  various talks in the halls and there 's lots of 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  things , you know , details and stuff that would I think people 'd be interested in and I 'd  you know , where do we go from here kind of things and  
F:  So , it would be good . 
B:  Yeah , and you 're  you 're attending 
B:   the uh  the front - end meeting as well as the others so you have  you have 
B:  probably one of the best   you and I , I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two . We are doing recognition in both of them . So . 
A:  Bridge . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right . 
B:  Uh . 
D:  So um . 
A:  OK ? 
D:  So  so we could talk a little bit about that now if  if there 's some time . 
A:  No , no that would be for next week .  
F:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	meeting organisation


D:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  Um I jus So the latest result was that um 
D:  um 
D:  yot 
D:  I tested the uh  the 
D:  sort of final version of the PLP 
D:  configuration 
E:  <mike noise> 
D:  um on development test data for  for this year 's Hub - five test set . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And the 
D:  recognition performance was 
D:  exactly , and I mean exactly up to the  you know , the first decimal , same as with the 
D:  uh Mel Cepstra 
D:  front - end . 
A:  Mmm . 
F:  For both females and males ? 
D:  Yes . 
F:  Oh ! 
D:  Uh , well i there was a little bit of a  
D:  i overall . 
D:  They  They were  The males I think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really . I mean definitely not significant . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And then the really nice thing was that if  if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Wow . 
D:  <inbreath> So . 
B:  <ingressive snort laugh> 
A:  Just with ROVER ? 
D:  <inbreath> <mouth> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  t With N - best ROVER , which is like our <breath> new and improved version of ROVER . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Which u actually uses the whole N - best list from both systems  to  mmm , uh  c combine that . <inbreath> 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  So except  I mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the 
B:  auto - regressive versus the 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  cepstral truncation .  OK . 
D:  And , the  
F:  But a percent and a half ? That 's  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , it 's pretty  impressive . 
D:  And  And so uh after I told the  my uh colleagues at SRI about that , you know , 
D:  now they definitely want to , you know , uh , have a  Next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh , you know , basically a at least the system combination . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Um , and , you know , why not ? Uh . <laugh> So . 
B:  Sure , why not ? 
A:  We clearly gotta add a few more features , though . 
D:  Uh w what do you mean ? More features in the sense of front - end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles ? 
A:  No , uh front - end features . 
A:  You know we did PLP and Mel Cepstra . Let 's , you know , try RASTA and MSG , and  
D:  Oh I mean  Yeah . Well  Right . So , we cou Yeah . That 's  the  the 
D:  the  There 's one thing uh  I mean you don't want to overdo it because y every front - end  You know , if you  you know you basically multiply your effort by N , where N is a number of different 
F:  Oh . 
D:  systems and  Um . So . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  So one  one 
D:  compromise would be to  
D:  only 
D:  to have the  everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system and then 
D:  after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems and combine the results and that 's a fairly painless um thing . So . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  An - 
F:  Do you think we 'd still get the one and a half uh  
D:  I  I think so . Yeah . Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower and so if  You know , maybe it 's only one percent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  So . 
D:  Um  Jus - You know , just wanted to let you know that that 's working out very nicely . 
A:  Cool . 
D:  <mouth> 
D:  And then we had some results on  digits , uh , 
D:  with um  We  We  So this was uh 
D:  really   really sort of just to get Dave going with his um 
D:  experiments . And so , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  uh . But as a result , um , you know , we were sort of wondering why is the 
D:  Hub - five system doing so well on the digits . And the reason is basically there 's a whole bunch of read speech data in the Hub - five training set . And you c 
B:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
B:  Including digits I gather , yeah . 
D:  And  Not all of  No it 's actually , digits is only a maybe a fifth of it . The rest is  is read  is read TIMIT data and uh ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that . 
B:  A fifth of it is how much ? 
B:  Right . But a fi a fifth is how much ? 
D:  <breath> 
D:  A fifth would be maybe 
D:  uh two hours something . 
B:  Yeah , so I mean that 's actually not that different from the  amount of training that there was . So . 
D:  Right . 
D:  But it definitely helps to have the other read data in there  because we 're doing  
B:  Oh yeah  w 
D:  You know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on ti uh TIMIT   uh not TIMIT uh TI - digits , which is only what two hours something ? 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
A:  I don't know . 
D:  So . 
D:  Uh , more read speech data definitely helps . And you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty . That 's e That was e Right , right . 
B:  Yeah that was the interesting thing . Because  because uh , it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better , but  but uh . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <mike noise> 
D:  Right . 
F:  Well is there even more read speech data around ? 
D:  Oh , yeah . So we only  for the Hub - five training , we 're only using uh a fairly small subset of the Macrophone  database . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Um , so , you could beef that up and probably do even better . 
A:  I could also put in  uh 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  focus condition zero from Hub - four 
A:  from Broadcast News , 
A:  which is mostly prepared speech . 
A:  It 's not exactly read speech but it 's pretty darn close . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Well , I mean that 's plenty of read speech data . I mean , Wall Street Journal ,  uh , take one example . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  That 's right . 
D:  But um . 
D:  So , you know that might be useful for the people who train the  the digit recognizers to  to use uh something other than TI - digits . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Well they been using TIMIT . 
D:  OK . 
B:  That  Uh . 
B:   They  they uh  they experimented for a while with a bunch of different databases with French and Spanish and so forth cuz they 're multilingual tests and  and uh , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  um ,  and actually the best results they got wa were uh using TIMIT . 
A:  Hmm . 
B:  Uh  
B:  But uh  which  So that 's what they 're  they 're using now . But  but yeah certainly if we , 
D:  Mmm . 
B:  um  
B:  If we knew what the structure of what we 're doing there was . I mean there 's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms . So we don't know exactly which combination we 're gonna be going with . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Once we know , then  the trainable parts of it  it 'd be great to run 
B:  lots of  lots of stuff through . 
topic_description:	PLP configuration


D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Well , that was that . And then I th guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem 
D:  uh system and  
D:  You wanna  <laugh> You wanna see where that stands ? @ @ 
F:  Well , I 'm  Yeah , so Andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the SRI system uses . And so I 'm in the process of um 
F:  converting those alignments into uh label files that we can use to train 
F:  uh a new net with . And uh so then I 'll train the net . And . 
D:  An - And one side effect of that would be that it 's  um that the phone set would change . So the MLP would be trained on I think only forty - six or forty - eight  forty - eight phones ? 
F:  Right . 
F:  Eight . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Uh which is smaller than the um 
D:  than the phone set that  that we 've been using so far . 
B:  Yeah . <clear throat> 
D:  And that  that  that will probably help , actually , because 
F:  So it 's a little different ? 
D:  um the fewer dimensions uh e the less trouble probably with the  as far as just the um , 
D:  um  
D:  Just  You know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features . And so you h have to multiply everything by two or three . And so , you know , 
D:  fewer dimensions in the  phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view . 
B:  Sure . Although we  I mean , it 's not that many fewer and  and  and we take a KLT anyway so we could  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Exactly . So  so that was the other thing . And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe 
D:  uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um 
D:  front - end . So 
D:  that would mean just doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the KLT 
B:  Yeah , and I think  and we sh again check  we should check with Stephane . My impression was that when we did that before that had very little  uh he didn't lose very much . 
D:  dimensions . 
D:  Right . 
F:  By just taking the top whatever ? 
A:  Yep . 
B:  Yeah  yeah . 
D:  But then  And then something  Once we have the new M L P trained up , 
D:  uh one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on 
D:  you know , those features uh and uh retrain MLP and also the 
D:  you know , the dictionary that we use for the Hub - five system . 
B:  And the b And the base u starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i from a pretty decent system . 
D:  Exactly . 
F:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . So 
B:   Yeah . 
D:  that would basically give us a , um , more  hopefully a  a 
D:  better system 
D:  um because  you know , compared to what Eric did a while ago , where he trained up , I think , a system based on Broadcast News and then 
D:  uh tra retraining it on Switchboard or s uh and  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  But he  I think he d he didn't  
D:  he probably didn't use all the training data 
D:  that was available . And his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to um 
D:  conversational speech as  as the  
D:  as ours is . So . 
B:  That 's  That 's certainly one thing , yeah . Uh . 
D:  And the dictionary made a huge difference . Uh . We  we made some 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  improvements to the dictionary 's uh  to the dictionary about two years ago which resulted in a  
D:  uh something like a four percent absolute 
D:  error rate reduction on Switchboard , which  <breath> 
B:  Well the other thing is , dipping 
B:   deep into history and into uh our resource management days , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  when we were collaborating with SRI before , uh 
D:  Mmm . Mm - hmm . 
B:  it was  I think , it is was a really key 
B:  uh starting point for us that we actually got our alignment . When we were working together we got our initial alignments from Decipher , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  uh  at the time .  Uh . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
B:   And . Later we got away from it because  because once we had decent systems going 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  then it was  it was typically better to use our own systems cuz they were self consistent but  but certainly to start off when we were 
B:  trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error uh rate . Uh . <laugh> But that was a  that was a good  good  good way to start . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:   And we 're not quite that bad with our  our Switchboard systems but it was  they certainly aren't as good as SRI 's , so  
D:  OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  W What is the performance on s the best Switchboard system that we 've done ? 
D:  Right . 
F:  Roughly ? 
B:  Well , the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty percent 
B:   error . And uh it was   I think there 's just a whole lot of things that uh no one ever had time for . We never did really 
B:  fix up the dictionary . 
B:  Uh we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were gonna do and  and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  But that w Even that  that number  
B:  Uh , we never did an never did any adaptation  uh , we never did any  
D:  Right . 
D:  And  And that number I think was on Switchboard - one data , right ? 
D:  Where the error rate now is in the twenties . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  So , um . 
B:  So we were  Yeah . We were 
D:  That 's yet s 
B:  probably at least a factor or two off . 
D:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  So it would be  So it would be good t to sort of r re uh  just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do . 
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  But I think  again it 's  
B:  Yeah . It 's the conver it 's the s 
B:  conversational speech bit . 
B:  Because our  our Broadcast News system is actually pretty good . He knows . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right . 
D:  And the other thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the M L P is trained up . Right ? 
D:  Because it 's a pretty good um 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  indicator of that . 
D:  So it 's sort of a sanity check of the M L P outputs  before we go ahead and train up the  
D:  uh you know , use them as a basis for the tandem system . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . It 'll still probably be worse . I mean , it 's  it 'd be context independent and so on . But . 
D:  No . 
D:  Sure . 
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  Should we  Should we bother with um using the net 
D:  Not  But  
F:  before doing uh embedded 
F:  training ? 
F:  I mean should  should we even use that ? Or should I just go straight to  
D:  Oh  oh that 's a good question . Yeah , we  we weren't sure whether it 's worth to just use the alignments um 
D:  from the S R I recognizer or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign . 
A:  Try it . 
A:  You run it ? Keep  keep both versions ? See which one 's better ? 
B:  Uh , yeah . I mean . I think I agree with Ad - 
B:  I mean basically you would then  You proceed with the embedded training . It 's gonna take you a while to train at this net anyway . And while it 's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it did . <laugh> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right . 
D:  <laugh>  OK . 
F:  Mmm . 
D:  Alright . 
A:  I could make arguments either way . You know , it 's  Sort of given up guessing . 
D:  But  But so I  Well but i But in your experience I mean uh have you seen 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  big improvements in s on some tasks with embedded training ? Or was it sort of small - ish uh improvements that you got 
B:  Uh well . It depended on the task . I mean I think in this one I would sort of expect it to be important because we 're coming from 
D:  Right . 
B:  uh , alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system . 
D:  That are from another  
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
A:  Although , 
B:  Uh . 
A:  I mean we 've done it with  When we were combining with the Cambridge recurrent neural net , embedded training made it worse . 
A:  Which I 've never figured out . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Right . But I mean i 
A:  I think it 's a bug . 
D:  So you  you started training with outputs from a  with alignments that were generated by the Cambridge uh system ? 
A:  Yep . 
D:  And then  
D:  Uh . Hmm . 
A:  Yeah .  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , that might probably just  Hmm . That was probably because your initial system  I mean your system was ba worse than Cambridge 's . 
D:  And you  
D:  Um . 
B:  Was it ? I don't think it was . 
A:  No they were  they were comparable . 
D:  It wasn't ? 
B:  No . 
D:  Really ? 
A:  They were very close . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  That 's weird . 
D:  <laugh>  
B:  Excuse me ? 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  That 's  That 's weird . 
B:  Oh ! <laugh> 
D:  No I mean it 's weird that it did  I 'm sorry . It 's w <laugh>  It 's weird that it got worse . 
A:  That 's what I said . 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath> <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  That 's ambiguous . 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  Um . No . Uh . 
B:  Tha - u we we 've see I mean  and wi with the numbers  OGI numbers task we 've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better . 
D:  Oh actually it 's not that weird because we have seen  
D:  We have seen cases where acoustic  retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better . 
B:  Yeah . It just  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  But I But I would  I would suspect that something that  that had um a very different 
B:  Um 
B:  feature set , for instance  I mean they were using pretty diff similar feature sets to us . 
A:  Yep . 
B:  I  I would expect that something that had a different feature set would  would uh benefit from  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  What about uh hidden unit size  on this .  Oh . 
B:  Oh , wait a minute , and the other thing uh , sorry , it was  the other thing is that what was in common  
B:  to the Cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors . 
A:  Right . 
B:  So I mean , uh , that 's another pretty big difference and 
A:  Ah yeah . That 's another big difference . 
B:  uh , one bac at least  
B:  Back at  
D:  You mean with soft targets ? 
D:  Or  ?  
D:  Sorry , I 'm sor I missed  What  What 's the key issue here ? 
B:  Oh , that uh 
B:  both the Cambridge system and our system were  were training 
B:   posteriors . And if we 're  we 're coming from alignments coming from the SRI system , it 's a likelihood - based system . 
B:  So  so that 's another difference . I mean . You know , there 's diffe different front - end 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  different  different uh , um , 
B:  training criterion  
B:  Uh , I would think that in a that an embedded  uh 
B:   embedded uh 
B:  training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more . But we don't know . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  OK . 
B:  You gonna say something ? 
F:  Yeah . I was wondering uh you know what 
F:  size net I should  
D:  <mike noise> 
F:  Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ? 
B:  Uh , how much training data ? 
F:  Well , I was gonna start off with the small train set . 
B:  And how  How many hours is that ? 
F:  That 's why I was  I  I 'm not sure how much that is . 
D:  Uh , I think that has about  
D:  Well i you 'd  would be gender - dependent training , right ? So  So I think it 's  uh that 's about 
F:  Gender - dependent , yeah . 
D:  mmm , something like thirty hours . 
F:  Thirty hours . 
D:  Thirty hours per gender . 
A:  I 'm not sure what this 'll mean .  
F:  In the small training set ? 
D:  I  I think so . I 'll  
A:  Hello ?  
E:  <laugh> 
A:  Excuse me ?  
D:  It 's definitely less than a hundred  You know , it 's more like  
A:  Alright .  
D:  like thirty forty hours something like that . 
A:  Wrong number . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  They called to tell us that ? 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . <inbreath while smiling> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Um . So . Uh . 
F:  I mean , I didn't want to do too big , just  
B:  after run 
B:  Right . So <clear throat> At least a couple thousand hidden units . 
D:  <breath> Mm - hmm . 
B:  I mean . It 's  it 's th the thing I 'll  I 'll think about it a little more but it  it 'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand . 
F:  Mmm . 
B:  You definitely wouldn't want the eight thousand . It 's m It 's more than  
F:  And a thousand is too small ? 
B:  Oh let me think about it , but I think that  that uh th at some point there 's diminishing returns . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  I mean it doesn't actually get worse , typically , but it  but  but there is diminishing returns and you 're doubling  the amount of time . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Remember you 'll have a smaller output layer so there 's gonna be fewer parameters there . And then  
A:  But not by a lot . 
B:  Not by much . Fifty s Fifty four to forty eight ? 
A:  Vast majority is from the input unit . 
D:  OK . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . It 'll have a very tiny effect . 
A:  Right , because you used the context windows  and so the input to hidden is much , much larger . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh I see , I see , yeah , of course . Yeah . It 's negligible , OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , so it 's  it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
B:  Uh . 
B:  There 's uh  
B:  How bi how big  
B:  Let 's see . What am I trying to think of ?  
F:  The  The net that  that we did use already  uh was eight thousand hidden units and that 's the one that Eric trained up . 
B:  Right . And that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of  
B:  of speech . 
D:  Was that gender - dependent or independent ? 
F:  Gender - dependent . 
B:  Oh . So that would be like trained on s sixty or seventy hours . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  So , uh , yeah definitely not the one thousand uh  
B:  two thousand fr I mean the four thousand will be better 
B:  and the two thousand will be almost  will be faster and almost as good . So . 
A:  It 'll be faster . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Maybe I 'll start off with two thousand just 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  to see . 
D:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
B:  Yeah , thirty hours is like a hundred and 
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  ten thousand 
B:  uh 
B:  seconds . 
B:  Uh , so that 's like eleven  eleven million frames . 
B:  And a two thousand hidden unit net 
B:  is uh 
B:  I guess about 
B:  seven , eight hundred thousand parameters . 
B:  So that 's probably  
B:  That 's probably fine . I mean a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from but the two thousand 'd be faster so  
D:  Right . I actually have to go . So . 
B:  Alright . 
D:  <breath> 
B:  Uncle Bernie 's rule is ten to one . 
D:  <mike noise> 
B:  Bernie Woodrow 's Rule of  yeah  Uncle Bernie  yeah . 
D:  Yeah . I figured . <laugh>
