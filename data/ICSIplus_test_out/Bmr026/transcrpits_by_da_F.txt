F:  Transcript 
F:  Um , sort of , I do , peripherally . 
F:  Um  Well first of all with IBM I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a  week or week and a half ago 
F:  and that it 's gone out to the transcribers 
F:  and hopefully next week we 'll have the transcription back from that . 
F:  Um  Jane seems to be um moving right along on the transcriptions from the ICSI side . 
F:  She 's assigned , I think probably five or six m more meetings . 
F:  Yeah , so um , I guess she 's hired some new transcribers 
F:  and  
F:  Um well we 've  we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are um , sort of awaiting to go to IBM . 
F:  and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here . 
F:  No . 
F:  Oh no no . 
F:  No . 
F:  We 're not waiting on them . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  We 're doing it in parallel , yeah . 
F:  Oh , yeah , and also related to the transcription stuff , 
F:  so I 've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected 
F:  and what stage each meeting is in , in terms of whether it 's  
F:  Mm - hmm , yeah I will . 
F:  I  
F:  That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages 
F:  and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll  
F:  I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So  
F:  So , um the audio that they 're gonna have access to , will that be the uncompressed version ? 
F:  Or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and  
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Yeah , I was just wondering because we 're uh running out of the un - backed - up disk space on 
F:  Oh , was that another one ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  I 'll wait . 
F:  So did you um put the uh  <clear throat> the NT version out on the uh Meeting Recorder page ? Or  
F:  Like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo . 
F:  Is that what you mean ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh there 's a lot of transcribers , too . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  SUN - Blades . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  They came in the other day . 
F:  Well , is there  
F:  Why not just hang them off of Abbott , 
F:  is there a  
F:  Ah . 
F:  Ah , I see . 
F:  You can put two  
F:  I  I thi 
F:  I  I jus I just gave Thilo some  about ten gigs , the last ten gigs of space that there was on  on uh Abbott . 
F:  Uh  And uh  
F:  So but that  But  
F:  XG . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  No . 
F:  I don't think that 's on XG . 
F:  On XG is only Carmen and Du - and Stephane 's disk . 
F:  Yeah , I do I don't think it was on XG . 
F:  I th 
F:  Well we 've collected so far something like uh sixty - five meetings . 
F:  And it 's about a gig uncompressed . 
F:  Is a little more ? 
F:  Right , yeah so if you uncompressed everything it 's even more . 
F:  U Uh compressed how much are they ? 
F:  Like  
F:  About half ? 
F:  So we 're definitely are storing you know , all of those . 
F:  So there 's what 
F:  thirty some gig of just meetings so far ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Well we  We haven't uncompressed all the meetings , 
F:  but  
F:  Right . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Well I sent that message out to , I guess , you and Dave asking for  if we could get some disk . 
F:  I s I sent this out a  a day ago 
F:  but  and Dave didn't respond so I don I don't know how the whole process works . 
F:  I mean does he just go out and get them and  if it 's OK , and  
F:  So I was assuming he was gonna take over  that . 
F:  But he 's probably too busy given that he 's leaving . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I don't know what the space situation is in the machine room . 
F:  So . 
F:  I think part of the reason why Dave can't get the  the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now . 
F:  So he has to re - arrange a bunch of stuff . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  That might be a good short term solution , though . 
F:  How long is David gonna be gone ? 
F:  Jane may not be . 
F:  He 's wondering how much overlap there will be . 
F:  Good thing Liz isn't here . 
F:  Don't listen to this , Liz . 
F:  Could we  
F:  Right , I was  
F:  Why don't we alternate this meeting every other week ? 
F:  Tha - That 's what I mean . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  But I do I don't  I mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on Meeting Recorder . 
F:  So if we did that  
F:  Well , cuz we get into these other topics . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So if we could alternate the focus of the meeting  
F:  Yeah that would be good . 
F:  I mean Andreas and I have various talks in the halls 
F:  and there 's lots of things , you know , details and stuff that would I think people 'd be interested in 
F:  and I 'd  you know , where do we go from here kind of things and  
F:  So , it would be good . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  For both females and males ? 
F:  Oh ! 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  But a percent and a half ? 
F:  That 's  
F:  Oh . 
F:  Do you think we 'd still get the one and a half uh  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Well is there even more read speech data around ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Well , I 'm  
F:  Yeah , so Andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the SRI system uses . 
F:  And so I 'm in the process of um converting those alignments into uh label files that we can use to train uh a new net with . 
F:  And uh so then I 'll train the net . 
F:  And . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Eight . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So it 's a little different ? 
F:  By just taking the top whatever ? 
F:  Right . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  W What is the performance on s the best Switchboard system that we 've done ? 
F:  Roughly ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Should we  Should we bother with um using the net before doing uh embedded training ? 
F:  I mean should  should we even use that ? 
F:  Or should I just go straight to  
F:  Mmm . 
F:  That 's ambiguous . 
F:  What about uh hidden unit size  on this . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I was wondering uh you know what size net I should  
F:  Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ? 
F:  Well , I was gonna start off with the small train set . 
F:  That 's why I was  
F:  I  I 'm not sure how much that is . 
F:  Gender - dependent , yeah . 
F:  Thirty hours . 
F:  In the small training set ? 
F:  They called to tell us that ? 
F:  I mean , I didn't want to do too big , 
F:  just  
F:  Mmm . 
F:  And a thousand is too small ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  The  The net that  that we did use already  uh was eight thousand hidden units 
F:  and that 's the one that Eric trained up . 
F:  Gender - dependent . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Maybe I 'll start off with two thousand just to see . 
F:  OK .
