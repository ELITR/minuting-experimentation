B:  That 's all folks ! 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  So that should have ma many fewer  
B:  And it 's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that , 
B:  right ? 
B:  So . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , well it certainly seems  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , if we 're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that , that 's OK because I I um , I mean I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us , so it 's  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  You are going to  
B:  OK . 
B:  Oh 
B:  I wondered whe when we would reach Dave 's saturation point . 
B:  He 's sort of been  been volunteering for everything 
B:  and  and uh  
B:  O K . 
B:  Finally said he was too busy . 
B:  I guess we reached it . 
B:  OK , so again , the issue is  For July , the issue 's gonna be what can we fit into a Windows machine , uh , and so on , 
B:  but  
B:  So , can some of the stuff that Don 's talking about somehow fit into this 
B:  Uh , mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the  
B:  Yes . 
B:  You know , wh 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  So . Uh , 
B:  no , we 're talking about on the computer 
B:  and  and um , I think when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting , 
B:  we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have 
B:  and , <clear throat> the more live , the better , but uh , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent . 
B:  So I think   For a lot of reasons , I think it would be very nice to have this Transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it 
B:  so it 'd be a good thing to get in there . 
B:  But , 
B:  um  Anyway , jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you 're doing , uh , in   to people . 
B:  Cuz a lot of this stuff , particularly for Communicator , uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th originally had t had to do with prosodics 
B:  It 'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and see them . 
B:  Did they come in ? 
B:  Oh . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Weren't we gonna get  
B:  Well , maybe it should get another rack . 
B:  But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it  it  file server  it seems like we would want to get it , uh , a second disk rack or something . 
B:  Well , for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten , 
B:  mightn't you ? 
B:  Uh , you know Dave Johnson is gone for , like , ten days , 
B:  Uh , well , tonight . 
B:  I don't know . 
B:  I don't know what his schedule is . 
B:  I 'm just saying he 's gone . 
B:  You had an eighteen gigabyte drive . 
B:  We need  
B:  We need another gigaquad . 
B:  There should  I d There should just be a b I should have a button . 
B:  Just press  Press each meeting saying " we need more disk space " <laugh> " this week " . 
B:  Skip the rest of the conversation . 
B:  And  And how much does each meeting take ? 
B:  So - so So maybe there 's a hundred  gig or something . 
B:  Or  
B:  I mean . Cuz we  we have the uncompressed around also . 
B:  So it 's like  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Well I mean it 's  the they really are cheap . 
B:  I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , 
B:  but But uh , we could  You know , if you want to get four disks , get four disks . 
B:  I mean it 's  it 's small  I mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah , I think you need a direct conversation with him . 
B:  And just <clear throat> say an - e just ask him that , you know , wha what should you do . 
B:  And in my answer back was " are you sure you just want one ? " 
B:  So I mean I think  that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure " well , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months " . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
B:  So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave , 
B:  cuz it  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  No . 
B:  I think Dave  Dave knows all these things , of course . 
B:  An - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time . 
B:  Well . 
B:  So . 
B:  But this  this is a very specific question for me . 
B:  Basically , we can easily get  one to four disks , 
B:  I mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it , 
B:  it 's no big deal . 
B:  Uh , but the question is where they go , 
B:  and I don't think we can solve that here , 
B:  you just have to ask him . 
B:  Attach to  
B:  Yeah ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , e again , you know , any one of these things is certainly not a big deal . 
B:  If there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it 's  it 's  jus every ever everybody  everybody has a  has  
B:  Well all of us have long lists of different things we 're doing . 
B:  But at any rate I think that there 's a  there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need 
B:  and I think we need a  a conversation with  
B:  Uh , maybe  maybe after  after tea or something you and I can go down and  and talk to him about it 
B:  Just say " wha you know , what should we do right now ? " 
B:  Uh , eleven days or something ? 
B:  Yeah 
B:  basically tomorrow and all of  the week after . 
B:  Um  
B:  Let 's see . 
B:  The only oth thing  other thing I was gonna add was that um  uh , I talked briefly to Mari 
B:  and uh we had <clear throat> both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the  last meeting we had here 
B:  but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the Friday after next . 
B:  And I  I  I wanted to make it , um after the next one of these meetings , 
B:  so something that we wanna do next meeting is  is uh to put together um , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it , um , that we 've done . 
B:  I mean just sort of bulletize I mean o e do do I can  I can dream up text but  this is basically gonna lead to the annual report . 
B:  So  Um  If w 
B:  Um , that would 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  So , uh , we can  
B:  This  
B:  So that 's an  
B:  Um  
B:  No , no but I  I  I don't need other folks for the meeting . 
B:  I can do it . 
B:  A A All I 'm saying is that on  
B:  Yeah 
B:  so what I meant was on the me this meeting  if I wa something I  I  I 'm making a major thing in the agenda is I wanna help in getting together a list of what it is that we 've done so I can tell her . 
B:  I think I have a pretty good idea 
B:  but  but um  
B:  Uh , and then the next day uh , late in the day I 'll be having that  that discussion with her . 
B:  Um . So . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Think so ? 
B:  Well , OK , so how many  how many people here would not be interested in uh  in a meeting about recognition ? 
B:  Yeah , so you 're su 
B:  So . 
B:  OK , so we 're gonna have a guy 's meeting . 
B:  Real  
B:  Yeah , real  real  real men <laugh> " Real men do decoding " or something like that . 
B:  Uh . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  It 's cuz  y you have a  
B:  So you need a better developed feminine side . 
B:  There 's probably gonna be a lot of " bleeps " in this meeting . 
B:  Uh . Um . 
B:  I think it must be  uh nearing the end of the week . 
B:  Um . <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  I  You know , I  I 've heard some comments about like this . 
B:  That m could be . 
B:  I mean the  
B:  Um . <inbreath> U 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Why don't we just start with that . 
B:  And then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting . 
B:  But I  I think that 's a great idea . 
B:  Uh . So uh . Um . Let 's chat about it with Liz and Jane  when we get a chance , see what they think and  
B:  Yeah , and you 're  you 're attending  the uh  the front - end meeting as well as the others so you have  you have probably one of the best  
B:  you and I , I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two . 
B:  We are doing recognition in both of them . 
B:  So . 
B:  Uh . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  So except  I mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the auto - regressive versus the cepstral truncation . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Sure , why not ? 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  An 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Including digits I gather , yeah . 
B:  A fifth of it is how much ? 
B:  Right . 
B:  But a fi a fifth is how much ? 
B:  Yeah , so I mean that 's actually not that different from the  amount of training that there was . 
B:  So . 
B:  Oh yeah 
B:  w 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah that was the interesting thing . 
B:  Because  because uh , it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better , 
B:  but  but uh . 
B:  Well they been using TIMIT . 
B:  That  
B:  Uh .  They  they uh  they experimented for a while with a bunch of different databases with French and Spanish and so forth cuz they 're multilingual tests 
B:  and  and uh , um ,  and actually the best results they got wa were uh using TIMIT . 
B:  Uh  But uh  which  So that 's what they 're  they 're using now . 
B:  But  but yeah certainly if we , um  
B:  If we knew what the structure of what we 're doing there was . 
B:  I mean there 's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms . 
B:  So we don't know exactly which combination we 're gonna be going with . 
B:  Once we know , then  the trainable parts of it  it 'd be great to run lots of  lots of stuff through . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Sure . 
B:  Although we  I mean , it 's not that many fewer and  and  and we take a KLT anyway so we could  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , and I think  and we sh again check  we should check with Stephane . 
B:  My impression was that when we did that before that had very little  uh he didn't lose very much . 
B:  Yeah 
B:  yeah . 
B:  And the b And the base u starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i from a pretty decent system . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  That 's  That 's certainly one thing , yeah . 
B:  Uh . Yeah . 
B:  Well the other thing is , dipping  deep into history and into uh our resource management days , when we were collaborating with SRI before , 
B:  uh it was  I think , it is was a really key uh starting point for us that we actually got our alignment . 
B:  When we were working together we got our initial alignments from Decipher , uh  at the time . 
B:  Uh .  And . Later we got away from it because  because once we had decent systems going then it was  it was typically better to use our own systems 
B:  cuz they were self consistent 
B:  but  but certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error uh rate . 
B:  Uh . <laugh> But that was a  that was a good  good  good way to start . 
B:  And we 're not quite that bad with our  our Switchboard systems but it was  they certainly aren't as good as SRI 's , 
B:  so  
B:  Well , the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty percent  error . 
B:  And uh it was  
B:  I think there 's just a whole lot of things that uh no one ever had time for . 
B:  We never did really fix up the dictionary . 
B:  Uh we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were gonna do 
B:  and  and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did . 
B:  Uh , we never did an never did any adaptation 
B:  uh , we never did any  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  So we were  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  We were probably at least a factor or two off . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  But I think  again it 's  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  It 's the conver it 's the s conversational speech bit . 
B:  Because our  our Broadcast News system is actually pretty good . 
B:  He knows . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  It 'll still probably be worse . 
B:  I mean , it 's  it 'd be context independent and so on . 
B:  But . 
B:  Uh , yeah . 
B:  I mean . I think I agree with Ad 
B:  I mean basically you would then  You proceed with the embedded training . 
B:  It 's gonna take you a while to train at this net anyway . 
B:  And while it 's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it did . 
B:  Uh well . It depended on the task . 
B:  I mean I think in this one I would sort of expect it to be important 
B:  because we 're coming from uh , alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system . 
B:  Uh . 
B:  Right . 
B:  But I mean i 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Was it ? 
B:  I don't think it was . 
B:  No . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Excuse me ? 
B:  Oh ! 
B:  Um . No . 
B:  Uh . Tha - u we we 've see I mean  and wi with the numbers  OGI numbers task we 've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  It just  
B:  But I But I would  I would suspect that something that  that had um a very different Um feature set , for instance  
B:  I mean they were using pretty diff similar feature sets to us . 
B:  I  I would expect that something that had a different feature set would  would uh benefit from  
B:  Oh , wait a minute , 
B:  and the other thing uh , 
B:  sorry , 
B:  it was  the other thing is that what was in common  to the Cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors . 
B:  So I mean , uh , that 's another pretty big difference 
B:  and uh , one bac at least  
B:  Back at  
B:  Oh , that uh both the Cambridge system and our system were  were training  posteriors . 
B:  And if we 're  we 're coming from alignments coming from the SRI system , it 's a likelihood - based system . 
B:  So  so that 's another difference . 
B:  I mean . You know , there 's diffe different front - end different  different uh , um , training criterion  
B:  Uh , I would think that in a that an embedded  uh  embedded uh training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more . 
B:  But we don't know . 
B:  You gonna say something ? 
B:  Uh , how much training data ? 
B:  And how  How many hours is that ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Um . So . Uh . after run 
B:  Right . 
B:  So 
B:  At least a couple thousand hidden units . 
B:  I mean . 
B:  It 's  it 's th the thing I 'll  I 'll think about it a little more 
B:  but it  it 'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand . 
B:  You definitely wouldn't want the eight thousand . 
B:  It 's m It 's more than  
B:  Oh let me think about it , 
B:  but I think that  that uh th at some point there 's diminishing returns . 
B:  I mean it doesn't actually get worse , typically , 
B:  but it  but  but there is diminishing returns 
B:  and you 're doubling  the amount of time . 
B:  Not by much . 
B:  Fifty s Fifty four to forty eight ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  It 'll have a very tiny effect . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , so it 's  it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference . 
B:  Uh . There 's uh  
B:  How bi how big 
B:  Let 's see . 
B:  What am I trying to think of ? 
B:  Right . 
B:  And that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of  of speech . 
B:  Oh . 
B:  So that would be like trained on s sixty or seventy hours . 
B:  So , uh , 
B:  yeah definitely not the one thousand uh  two thousand fr 
B:  I mean the four thousand will be better 
B:  and the two thousand will be almost  will be faster and almost as good . 
B:  So . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh seconds . 
B:  Uh , so that 's like eleven  eleven million frames . 
B:  And a two thousand hidden unit net is uh I guess about seven , eight hundred thousand parameters . 
B:  So that 's probably  That 's probably fine . 
B:  I mean a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from 
B:  but the two thousand 'd be faster 
B:  so  
B:  Alright . 
B:  Uncle Bernie 's rule is ten to one . 
B:  Bernie Woodrow 's Rule of  
B:  yeah  
B:  Uncle Bernie  
B:  yeah . 
B:  Yes sir . 
B:  Nah . 
B:  Since we have nothing to talk about we only talked for an hour . 
B:  So . 
B:  de - ba - de . de - ba - de 
B:  That 's all folks !
