D:  Right ? 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Uh , OK . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  So are we recording now ? 
D:  Is this  
D:  Oh ! We 're  we 're  we 're live . 
D:  OK . 
D:  So , uh , <inbreath> what were we gonna talk about again ? 
D:  So we said  we said data collection , which we 're doing . 
D:  No . I it 'd be even better with this big  
D:  It 's not that long . 
D:  w u 
D:  Oh , yeah , the element , 
D:  yeah , n should be as close to you  your mouth as possible . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Alright . 
D:  So what we had  was that we were gonna talk about data collection , 
D:  and , um , uh , you  you put up there data format , 
D:  and other tasks during data collection , 
D:  and  
D:  I just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were gonna do at the front where we each said who we were . 
D:  Roll call . 
D:  No , not a 
D:  No , I just  My mind went elsewhere . 
D:  So , 
D:  uh , yeah , I 'm Morgan , 
D:  and 
D:  where am I ? 
D:  I 'm on channel three . 
D:  I 'm Rocky Raccoon <breath> on channel  
D:  Well , I mean , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones . 
D:  There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column  common  that we will not know . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I mean , we  we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design , 
D:  and  and  and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be <laugh> jargon to  to us . 
D:  So . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That  that 's right . 
D:  There were others of course . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  We can go back . 
D:  There 's  there 's another problem 
D:  which is , um , we certainly do want to branch out beyond , uh , uh , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder . 
D:  And , uh , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , uh , reduces enormously . 
D:  And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do , 
D:  how  you know , we  we did n you know another meeting here for another group 
D:  and  and , uh , they were fine with it . 
D:  But if we 'd said , " OK , now all eight of you have to  <laugh-breath> have to come up with , uh , the summar " 
D:  t See ? 
D:  There we go . 
D:  I 
D:  I 'm worried that if you did  even if you did push them into it , it  it  it might be semi - random , 
D:  uh , as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing . 
D:  Well , I think that we  I mean , the  the f the core thing is that you know once we get some of these issues nailed down , we need to do a bunch of recordings 
D:  and send them off to IBM 
D:  and get a bunch of transcriptions 
D:  even if they 're slightly flawed 
D:  or need some other  
D:  And then we 'll have some data there . 
D:  And then , i i we can start l looking and thinking , what do we want to know about these things 
D:  and  at the very least . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  It  
D:  That 's a good idea 
D:  but that doesn't  
D:  Maybe I 'm missing something , 
D:  but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries , right ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That  that 's what I mean , is that I think it gets at something interesting 
D:  but if we were asking the question , which I thought we were , of  of  of , um , " how do we figure out what 's the nature of the queries that people are gonna want to ask of such a system ? " , knowing what 's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking . 
D:  Does it ? 
D:  Maybe . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah , but we 're just looking for a place to start with that 
D:  because , you know , th what  what  what James is gonna be doing is looking at the user - interface 
D:  and he 's looking at the query in  in  
D:  i We  we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff 
D:  but we have zero hours of  of  of queries . 
D:  So he 's just sort of going " where  where do I  where do I start ? " 
D:  OK . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I 've b been thinking  
D:  I 've been thinking about it a little bit here  about the  uh , th this , e um  
D:  I think that the  
D:  now I 'm thinking that the summary  a summary , uh , is actually a reasonable , uh , bootstrap into this  into what we 'd like to get at . 
D:  It 's  it 's not ideal , 
D:  but we  you know , we  we have to get started someplace . 
D:  So I was  I was just thinking about , um , suppose we wanted to get  
D:  w We have this collection of meeting . 
D:  We have five hours of stuff . 
D:  Uh , we get that transcribed . 
D:  So now we have five hours of meetings 
D:  and , uh , you ask me , uh , uh , " Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ? " 
D:  Uh , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask . 
D:  I 'd have to get started someplace . 
D:  So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go " oh , yeah , I was in that meeting , 
D:  I remember that , 
D:  um , what was the part that  " 
D:  And  and th I think that might then help me to think of things  even things that aren't listed in the summary , but just as a  as a  as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , yeah . That 's true too . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  A 
D:  Adam , you can  
D:  you can correct me on this , 
D:  but  but , uh , my impression was that , uh , pretty much , uh , true that the meetings here , nobody sits with a w uh , with a laptop 
D:  and  
D:  I 
D:  Yeah , but those are bigger deal things . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  Where you 've got fifteen peo 
D:  I mean , most  
D:  th this is one of the larger meetings . 
D:  Most of the meetings we have are four or five people 
D:  and you 're not  you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it . 
D:  You just <breath> get together and talk about where you are . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Do they ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Li 
D:  uh , L L 
D:  L 
D:  Liz , you  
D:  u uh , Liz , you sa you sat in on the , uh , <breath> subcommittee meeting or whatever  
D:  uh , on  you  on the subcommittee meeting for  for  at the , uh  that workshop we were at that , uh , uh , Mark Liberman was  was having . 
D:  So I  I wasn't there . 
D:  They  they  they  they h must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So  so to address what  what Adam 's saying , 
D:  I mean , I think you  uh , that 
D:  the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing . 
D:  And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  So , uh  
D:  Right . 
D:  So we 're gonna  
D:  So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do , 
D:  whatever 's reasonable for us . 
D:  But having  
D:  Well , minimally , I mean , what  what Dan is referring to at least having some representation of the p the spatial position of the people , 
D:  cuz we are interested in some spatial processing . 
D:  And so  
D:  so , um  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Great idea . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Well , I think for  I mean , for our purposes we probably will d 
D:  we  we might try that some 
D:  and  and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that , 
D:  uh , which , you know , we we 'll  we 'll get other value out of , I think . 
D:  There you go . 
D:  I think at the moment we should be determining this on the basis of our own , uh , interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing . 
D:  As you say , if they  <breath> if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to , 
D:  uh , and  and will include all that . 
D:  Um , 
D:  I  I  I 'm not worried about the cost of setting it up . 
D:  I 'm worried about the cost of people looking at it . 
D:  In other words , it 's  it  it 'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all . 
D:  And so I  I  I think that we do have to do some picking and choosing of the stuff that we 're doing . 
D:  But I  I am int I do think that we m minimally want  something  we might want to look at  at some  some , uh , subsets of that . 
D:  Like for a meeting like this , at least , uh , take a Polaroid of the  <laugh> of the  of the boards , 
D:  and  
D:  a 
D:  and know the position of the people  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So  
D:  So , I mean , departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about , you know , this group and what we actually want to do , 
D:  uh , so I guess that 's th the way  what you were figuring on doing was  was  was , uh , putting together some notes and sending them to  to everybody 
D:  from  from today ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  So . 
D:  Um  
D:  So  <outbreath> so the question  that  that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during  during th during the collection . 
D:  And I guess the CrossPads was certainly one idea , 
D:  uh , and we 'll get them from him and we 'll just do that . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  And then the next thing we talked about was the  was the summaries 
D:  and are we gonna do anything about that . 
D:  Oh , OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  What  
D:  I guess the point was to try  again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for  for the UI stuff . 
D:  So it 's sort of Landay supplying it 
D:  so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do . 
D:  So it  it  Right now he 's g operating from zero , 
D:  and so even if we didn't get it done from UW , it seems like that would  could still  You shou 
D:  I mean , at least try it . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I guess a lot of the stuff we 're doing now really is pilot 
D:  in one sense or another . 
D:  And so we try it out and see how it works . 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  So who  who does this summarization ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Ru 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Well , I think it 's like the note - taking thing , 
D:  that  that y that you can't  certainly can't require it 
D:  or people aren't gonna want to do this . 
D:  But  but if there 's some cases where they will , then it would be helpful . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  The fl the fluorescent light is flickering . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , you still wanted to talk with Liz . 
D:  And you and I need to 
D:  Oh , oh . You already did the Liz talk . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Oh , OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I 'm at your disposal . 
D:  So , up to you . 
D:  Um , I think we should be able to wind up in another half - hour or something , 
D:  you think ? 
D:  Less ? 
D:  Well , I mean , we still haven't talked about the action items from here and so on . 
D:  And  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , well there 's gonna be these student projects that can do some things 
D:  but it can't be , yeah , very deep . 
D:  u I  I actually think that  that , uh , again , just as a bootstrap ,  if we do have something like summaries , then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , come up with  with  with queries , uh , could at least give  give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know . 
D:  I mean , ye 
D:  Right ? 
D:  If he doesn't know anything about the area , and  the people are talking about and  and , uh  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Maybe . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  I would think that would be the most likely thing . 
D:  Hey . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Boy , I  I don't know how we get at this  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well  
D:  It 's gonna take some thought . 
D:  I mean , 
D:  It seemed  <inbreath> The kind of , uh , interest that I had in this thing initially was , uh , that i basically the form that you 're doing something else  later , 
D:  and you want to pick up something from this meeting related to the something else . 
D:  So it 's really the imp the  the list of what 's important 's in the something else 
D:  rather than the  
D:  And it might be something minor  of minor importance to the meeting . 
D:  Uh , in fact if  if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and  and  and check on it even . 
D:  So it 's  it 's that you 're trying to find   You 're  you 've now  
D:  You weren't interested  
D:  Say I  I said " well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue , 
D:  I 'm more of an acoustics person " . 
D:  But  but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm " well what is  what was that part that  that  that , uh , Mari was saying ? " 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And then I 'm trying to fi I mean , that 's  that 's when I look  in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that <breath> didn't really stick in my head the first time around 
D:  and  but for some  new reason I 'm  I 'm  I 'm interested in  in  in the old stuff . 
D:  So , I don't  I don't know . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . That  that might get at some of what I was  
D:  I was concerned about , uh , being interested in something later that w uh , I didn't consider to be important the first time , 
D:  which for me is actually the dominant thing , 
D:  because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if I didn't , 
D:  but some new  task comes along that makes me want to look up . 
D:  Yeah . So having multiple people might get at some of that . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , and this is a starting point . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  W 
D:  Well , irreversible . 
D:  I  I  I mean , I guess what I what I  I keep coming back to in my own mind is that , um , the soonest we can do it , we need to get up some kind of system 
D:  so that people who 've been involved in the meeting can go back later , 
D:  even if it 's a poor system in some ways , 
D:  and , uh  and ask the questions that they actually want to know . 
D:  If  you know , if  uh , as soon as we can get that going at any kind of level , then I think we 'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask than in any  anything we do before that . 
D:  But obviously we have to bootstrap somehow , 
D:  and  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , and again , if we can figure out a way to jimmy a  a  a  a very rough system , say in a year , then  uh , so that in the second and third years we  we actually have something to  
D:  ask queries . 
D:  Uh  
D:  I I 'm  
D:  I I 'm not so sure I agree with that . 
D:  Because  uh , b because it depends on , uh , what our goal is . 
D:  If our goal is Wizard of Oz - ish , 
D:  we might want to know what is it that people would really like to know about this data . 
D:  And if it 's  if  if it 's something that we don't know how to do yet , th great , 
D:  that 's , you know , research project for year four or something . 
D:  You know ? 
D:  Um , 
D:  well , not  maybe not true Wizard of Oz 
D:  because people are too 
D:  uh , aware of what 's going on . 
D:  But  but just  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  w Just " what would you like to know ? " 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I usually don't remember my action items . 
D:  But  <laugh> I 'd  I  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  We  we had  I mean , 
D:  somewhere up there we had milestones , 
D:  but I guess  Did y did you get enough milestone , uh , from the description things ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  And , you know , there 's obviously  detail behind each of those , as much as is needed . 
D:  So , you just have to  let us know . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Three of them . 
D:  Well  <laugh> I mean , 
D:  uh , 
D:  mostly together . 
D:  Wh 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  i 
D:  i 
D:  w 
D:  In  in our phone call , uh , before , we  we , uh  It turns out the way we 're gonna send the data is by , uh , 
D:  And , uh  
D:  and then what they 're gonna do is take the CD - ROM and transfer it to analog tape 
D:  and <breath> give it to a transcription service , uh , that will  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , foot  foot pedals 
D:  and  
D:  See , that 's a good question . 
D:  No , I mean , it 'll be 
D:  probably about like you did , 
D:  and then there will be some things  you know , many things that don't work out well . 
D:  And that 'll go back to IBM 
D:  and they 'll  they 'll , uh  they run their aligner on it 
D:  and it kicks out things that don't work well , 
D:  which  you know , the overlaps will certainly be examples of that . 
D:  And , uh  
D:  I mean , what w we will give them all of it . Right ? 
D:  We 'll give them all the  the multi - channel stuff 
D:  and  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . <mouth> Good idea . 
D:  Well  
D:  It 's also won't be adding much to the data to give them the mixed . 
D:  Right . And I was gonna m email them the  which I haven't yet , a pointer to  to the web pages that we  that we currently have , 
D:  cuz in particular they want to see the one with the  the way the recording room is set up 
D:  and so on , your  your page on that . 
D:  Oh , yeah . 
D:  We were gonna  
D:  Yeah , we w 
D:  Right . 
D:  OK . 
D:  So , what n 
D:  important thing  
D:  So a key thing will be that you  we tell you 
D:  what it is . 
D:  Uh , we also had  
D:  We also had the , uh , uh  that we were s uh , that you were gonna get us the eight - hundred number 
D:  and we 're all gonna  
D:  we 're gonna call up your Communicator thing 
D:  and  and we 're gonna be good slash bad , 
D:  depending on how you define it , uh , users . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , we can do that . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 

D:  My mother would have a very interesting conversation with it 
D:  but it wouldn't have anything to do with the travel . 
D:  OK . 
D:  We talked about that we 're getting the recording equipment running at UW . 
D:  And so it depends , 
D:  w e e e 
D:  they 're  you know , they 're p m 
D:  If that comes together within the next month , there at least will be , uh , uh , major communications between Dan and <breath> UW folks 
D:  as to  
D:  But we have  it  it 's  it 's pretty  
D:  We don't know . 
D:  I mean , he  he s uh , he said that it was sitting in some room collecting dust 
D:  and  and so we don't know , 
D:  i e 
D:  We don't know . 
D:  " Recording equipment . " 
D:  W We know it 's eight channels . 
D:  Uh , we know it 's digital . 
D:  We don't even know if there 're microphones . 
D:  So , 
D:  we 'll find out . 
D:  Yeah , OK . 
D:  I 'll do that . 
D:  Um , and he also said something about outside  there  that came up about the outside text sources , that he  he may have 
D:  some text sources that are close enough to the sort of thing that we can play with them for a language model . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  But it 's p it might be  
D:  OK . 
D:  Yeah , why search for them ? 
D:  They 're  we know where they are . 
D:  Yeah , that 's true . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So we can  we can  we can do better than that . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  There 's  there 's some , uh , Carnegie Mellon stuff , right ? 
D:  On  on meeting recording , 
D:  and  
D:  And Xerox . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Wasn - but w I think we were saying before also that the natural language group here had less overlap . 
D:  So it also depends on the style of the group of people . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Did they discuss any of that in the  the meeting they had with L Liberman ? 
D:  What  
D:  What  what do they  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Actually , th @ @  the CMU folk have collected a lot of data . 
D:  Is that  is that going to be publicly available , 
D:  or  ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  Just to check . 
D:  Yeah . W we should know what 's out there certainly . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh , they only did the far - field ? 
D:  I see . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , once we send out  
D:  I mean , we still haven't sent out the first note saying " hey , this list exists " . 
D:  But  but , uh , once we do that  
D:  Yeah . It 's on  I already added that one on my board to do that . 
D:  So , uh  
D:  uh , 
D:  hopefully everybody here is on that list . 
D:  We should at least check that everybody here  ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  We haven't sent anything to the list yet . 
D:  We 're just compiling the list . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So , seems like we 're winding down . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  Many  ways . 
D:  Oh ! Good man . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Well , being more management lately than  <breath-laugh> than research , I think the thing that impressed me most was the people dynamics 
D:  and not any of the facts . 
D:  That is , I  I really enjoyed hanging out with this group of people today . 
D:  So that 's what really impressed me . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I 'd probably search for something like that . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Find me a funny thing that Jeff said . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So I think we 're done . 
D:  Great . 
D:  Now these we turn off . 
D:  Right ?
