E:  Great . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  It 's a good idea . 
E:  Which way is  
E:  Mari ? 
E:  Y I think your  your  your thing <spike> may be pointing in a funny direction . 
E:  Sort of it 's  it helps if it points sort of upwards . 
E:  Sort of it  
E:  you know . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So that thing  the little  th that part should be pointing upwards . 
E:  That 's it . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's good . 
E:  That kind of thing is good . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh , yeah . 
E:  It 's a  
E:  It 's working . 
E:  Right . I mean , we  because you 'd have several people with these pads , you could collect different things . 
E:  I mean , cuz I tend to take notes which are summaries . 
E:  And so , you know  
E:  I 'm Dan Ellis . 
E:  Let me , uh , turn that off . 
E:  Oh . PZM nearest , nearest , next nearest . 
E:  Next one . 
E:  Furthest . 
E:  PDM - right , 
E:  PZA - right  
E:  PDA - right , 
E:  PDA - left . 
E:  Thanks . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Although  
E:  Well . But , I mean , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system . 
E:  Right ? 
E:  I mean , they 're something . 
E:  It 's a  a kind of output you 'd like . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Activity . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Well , see , there are th 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  But th there is this , um  <outbreath> <mouth> <inbreath> There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time 
E:  but some in retrospect you think " oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? " 
E:  And it 's something that didn't appear in the summary but you  
E:  And that 's kind of what this kind of , uh , complete data capture is kind of nicest for . 
E:  Cuz it 's the things that you wouldn't have bothered to make an effort to record but they get recorded . 
E:  So , I mean  And th there 's no way of generating those , u u until we just  until they actually occur . 
E:  You know , it 's like  
E:  Right , right . Exactly . 
E:  But I mean , it 's difficult to sort of say " and if I was gonna ask four questions about this , what would they be ? " 
E:  Those aren't the kind of things that come up . 
E:  Oh , yeah . 
E:  Yeah , sure . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I 've d When we  when we have other meetings . 
E:  When I have meetings on the European projects , we have someone taking notes . 
E:  In fact , I often do it . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  How many people are those meetings ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  We sh we should  
E:  Well , I don't know . 
E:  f u 
E:  I think for this data capture , it would be nice to have a digital camera 
E:  just to take pictures of who 's there , 
E:  where the microphones are , 
E:  and then we could also put in what 's on the board . 
E:  You know , like three or four snaps for every  
E:  for every meeting . 
E:  Well , no . I mean , I  I just think  I mean , I think that right now we don't make a record of where people are sitting on the tables . 
E:  And that  the  at some point that might be awfully useful . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  We 
E:  n uh , 
E:  Not  not as part of the  not as a part of the data that you have to recover . 
E:  Just  just in terms of  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So  
E:  Actually  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  People with radio mikes can go into separate rooms and continue recording without hearing each other . 
E:  That 's the nice thing . 
E:  That 's right . 
E:  Well , that 's the interesting thing , though . 
E:  If we do  if we collect four different summaries , you know , we 're gonna get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently . 
E:  It 's like  this is not what we meant to research . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  It 's kind of nice . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Hello . 
E:  Dan here . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Mari ? 
E:  Someone wants to know when you 're getting picked up . 
E:  Is someone picking you up ? 
E:  OK , five - thirty . 
E:  Sounds  
E:  OK . 
E:  h Thanks , bye . 
E:  That 's that . 
E:  Yeah , really . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  You  you can keep it on . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Cuz you 'll get  cuz you 'll get very different answers from everybody , right ? 
E:  So  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  On the other hand people might try and come up with different ones , right ? 
E:  They might say " oh , I was gonna say that one 
E:  but now I have to think of something else " . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  And " interesting " is more interesting than " important " . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I mean , there is still this hope that people might actually think of real queries they really want to ask at some point . 
E:  And that if  if that ever should happen , then we should try and write them down . 
E:  Yeah , really . 
E:  If they 're real queries . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Research , yeah . 
E:  We 'd have to listen to all the data . 
E:  Well just imagine if  
E:  Get people to ask questions that they def the machine definitely can't answer at the moment , 
E:  but  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yes . 
E:  Well  
E:  Yeah . Then we 'll know . 
E:  Right . We  
E:  we need to look at our web page 
E:  and make one that 's  
E:  that 's p 
E:  PDA - free . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Well  
E:  uh , yeah . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I mean , 
E:  we should talk about it , 
E:  but  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , that was  uh , that was  What he was saying was this  he  this thing that , uh , Jason had been working on finds web pages that are thematically related to what you 're talking about . 
E:  Well , that 's the idea . 
E:  So that that  that would be a source of text which is  supposedly got the right vocabulary . 
E:  But it 's obviously very different material . 
E:  It 's not spoken material , for instance , 
E:  so  
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Sure . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  We can do that . Yeah . 
E:  turn off 
E:  Oh , really ? 
E:  It 's those guys . 
E:  Who specifically ask not to be . 
E:  " Hey , look what we found ! " 
E:  " I found this great corpora . " 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So we should go  go around and s 
E:  We should go around and say something interesting that happened at the meeting ? 
E:  I had a real revelation about taking pictures . 
E:  I don't know why 
E:  I didn't do this before and I regret it . 
E:  So that was very interesting for me . 
E:  Not that I  
E:  The boards aren't really related to this meeting . 
E:  I mean , I will take pictures of them , 
E:  but  
E:  But  
E:  OK . 
E:  Well , that 's why I 'll take pictures of them , then . 
E:  For the moment . 
E:  How are we gonna find that in the data ? 
E:  Oh , yeah . 
E:  Right . 
E:  How happy were they ? 
E:  That 's great . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Perfect . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Great .
