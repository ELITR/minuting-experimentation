H:  h Do we need  do I need to turn something off here , or I do unplug this , or  ? 
H:  What  
H:  Otherwise you just get a heartbeats . 
H:  It 's a  
H:  Well , one thing that came up in the morning  in the morning was the , um , 
H:  i uh , if he  I , um  
H:  if he has  s 
H:  I  I don't remember , 
H:  Mister Lan - Doctor Landry ? 
H:  La - Landay ? 
H:  So he has , um , these , uh , um , tsk  note - taking things , 
H:  then that would sort of be a summary which you wouldn't have to solicit . 
H:  y if  if we were able to  to do that . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  The roll call . 
H:  I 'm Jane Edwards , I think on channel B . 
H:  Should we have used pseudo - names ? 
H:  Should we do it a second time with pseudo 
H:  No . <laugh> No . 
H:  Next nearest . 
H:  OK . 
H:  I have a question on protocol in these meetings , 
H:  which is when you say " Jimlet " and the person listening won't know what that is , sh shou How  how do we get  Is that important information ? 
H:  You know , the Jimlet  
H:  I mean , the box that contains the  
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  OK . 
H:  Good . 
H:  OK . 
H:  OK . Good . 
H:  OK , so we were on the data collection   and the summary issue . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Tsk . 
H:  Well , there is this other thing which y which you were alluding to earlier , which is , um , there are certain key words like , you know , " action item " and things like that , 
H:  which could be used in , uh , t to some degree finding the structure . 
H:  And  and I also , um , was thinking , with reference to the n uh , note - taking , 
H:  the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later . 
H:  And the fir third thing I wanted to say is the summaries afterwards , 
H:  um , I think they should be recorded instead of written 
H:  because I think that , um , it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary . 
H:  Yeah , good . 
H:  Good point . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  That 's a nice idea . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  I also think that w if  if you can use the summaries as an indication of the important points of the  of the meeting , then you might get something like  
H:  y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection , 
H:  you know , maybe the summary would say , you know , " we discussed types of na data collection " . 
H:  And , you know  And  and maybe you could get to it by that . 
H:  If you  if you had the  the larger structure of the  of the discourse , then if you can categorize what it is that you 're looking for with reference to those l those larger headings , then you can find it 
H:  even if you don't have a direct route to that . 
H:  I think that  
H:  I I  I think that , um , there 's  we 're using " summary " in two different ways . 
H:  So what you just described I would describe as " minutes " . 
H:  And what I originally thought was , um , if you asked someone " what was the meeting about ? " 
H:  And then they would say " well , we talked about this 
H:  and then we talked about that , 
H:  and so - and - so talked about  " 
H:  And then you 'd have , like  
H:  I  e My thought was to have multiple people summarize it , on recording rather than writing 
H:  because writing takes time 
H:  and you get irrelevant other things that u take time , that  
H:  Whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting , 
H:  you know , a two - minute summary of what the meeting was about , I think you would get , 
H:  uh , with mult 
H:  See , I  I also worry about having a single note - taker 
H:  because that 's just one person 's perception . 
H:  And , um , 
H:  you know , it  it 's releva it 's relative to what you 're focus was on that meeting , 
H:  and  and people have different  major topics that they 're interested in . 
H:  So , my proposal would be that it may be worth considering both of those types , you know , the note - taking and a spontaneous oral summary afterwards , 
H:  no longer than two minutes , 
H:  from multiple people . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  I agree . 
H:  I agree . 
H:  That 's wonderful . 
H:  I agree . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  It 's just a digital record . 
H:  Yes , I agree . 
H:  I agree . 
H:  It 's i because discourse is about things , 
H:  and then you have the things that are about , and it 's recoverable . 
H:  Yes . 
H:  And it 's so simple . 
H:  Like you said , three snapshots 
H:  and  
H:  Just to archive . 
H:  Mmm . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  I agree . 
H:  And if it 's simple as  I mean , as simple as just the digital  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Well , she 's not  making  
H:  Well  
H:  Well , there 's  that 'd be the  the parallel , yeah . 
H:  But I think y she 's  we 're just proposing  a minimal preservation of things on boards , 
H:  sp spatial organization  
H:  And you could anonymize the faces for that matter . 
H:  You know , I mean , this is  
H:  We can talk about the  
H:  It 's just one snapshot . 
H:  We 're not talking about a movie . 
H:  We 're talking about a snapshot . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Hmm . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Well , it 's worth considering . 
H:  Maybe we don't want to  spend that much more time discussing it , 
H:  but  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Th 
H:  The thing is , if it 's easy to collect it  it th then I think it 's a wise thing to do 
H:  because once it 's gone it 's gone . 
H:  And  
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Exactly . 
H:  Exactly . 
H:  We  And it  
H:  Especially since this is common knowledge . 
H:  I mean , this is shared knowledge among all the participants , 
H:  and it 's a shame to keep it off the recording . 
H:  s 
H:  Well , I don't understand that point . 
H:  I mean , I just think that the  
H:  Well  
H:  Well  
H:  I agree . 
H:  That 's great . 
H:  Yeah , I 'm thinking that  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Uh - huh . 
H:  How fascinating . 
H:  That could be very interesting . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Well , I think if  
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Yeah , I 'd just try  Well , however the least intrusive and  and quickest way is , 
H:  and th and closest to the meeting time too , 
H:  cuz people will start to forget it as soon as they l leave . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  w 
H:  I would s 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  And I 'm also wondering , couldn't that be included in the data sample 
H:  so that you could increase the num you know , the words that are , uh , recognized by a particular individual ? 
H:  If you could include the person 's meeting stuff and also the person 's summary stuff , maybe that would be uh , 
H:  an ad addition to their database . 
H:  Under the same acoustic circumstance , 
H:  cuz if they just walk next door with their set - up , nothing 's changed , 
H:  just  
H:  You turn  
H:  Uh , let the record show the light is flickering . 
H:  I 'm also wondering if we could ask the  the people a  a question 
H:  which would be " what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting ? " 
H:  Becau - in terms of like informativeness , 
H:  it might be , you know , that the summary would  would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting fact . 
H:  I think you get two different types of information . 
H:  Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the  what the meeting was about . 
H:  So you get the general structure , the important points of what the meeting was about  with the summary . 
H:  But with the " what 's the most interesting thing you learned ? "  
H:  Uh , so the fact that , uh , I know that Transcriber uses Snack is something that I thought was interesting 
H:  and that  and that Dan worked on  on that . 
H:  So I thought that was really  
H:  you know . 
H:  So , I mean , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings 
H:  but could be very informative . 
H:  I think it wouldn't be too , uh , uh , cost - intensive either . 
H:  You know , I mean , it 's like something someone can do pretty easily on the spur of the moment . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  And that  I think it would pick up the micro - structure , the  
H:  some  some of the little things that would be hidden . 
H:  That would be interesting . 
H:  Uh - huh . 
H:  Well , and  and one thing , we  we 're saying " important " and we 're saying " interesting " . 
H:  And  and those  those can be two different things . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  OK , good . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  I will say that  that I  I chose " interesting " 
H:  because I think it includes also " important " 
H:  in some cases . 
H:  But , um , I  I  I feel like the summary gets  at a different type of information . 
H:  Well , and  and also  
H:  i it puts a lot of burden on the person to  to evaluate . 
H:  You know , I think inter " interesting " is  is non - threatening in  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  k 
H:  Sure . 
H:  That 's good . 
H:  I like that . 
H:  I like that . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  A 
H:  And one  and one qualification on  on the oral summaries . 
H:  They 'd be s they 'd be separate . 
H:  They wouldn't be hearing each other 's summaries . 
H:  And  and that would also be that the data would be included in the database . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  OK . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  I I was wondering if  if there might be one s more source of queries 
H:  which is indicator phrases like " action item " , 
H:  which could be obtained from the text  from the transcript . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah , that 's something to be determined , something to be specified , 
H:  but text - oriented . 
H:  I think you 'd remember that , yeah . 
H:  Yeah , that 's true . 
H:  Well , but then you could  you could prompt them to say , you know , " other than your action item " , 
H:  you know , whatever . 
H:  But  but the action item would be a way to get , uh , maybe an additional query . 
H:  So . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Well , but  you know , but you could get again @ @  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . yeah . 
H:  Good . 
H:  OK . 
H:  So y 
H:  Sure , sure , sure . 
H:  You could email to both of us , uh , just  I mean , if you wanted to . 
H:  I mean , I don't think either of us would mind recei 
H:  but  but in any case I 'd be happy to send you the  
H:  Edwards at 
H:  ICSI . 
H:  Yeah , using foot pedals 
H:  and  
H:  Yeah . They  they don't have a way . 
H:  But they have a verification . 
H:  I did . 
H:  I  I m emailed them the Transcriber URL , 
H:  um , the on - line , uh , data that Adam set up , 
H:  The URL 
H:  so they can click on an utterance and hear it . 
H:  and I emailed them the str streamlined conventions 
H:  which you got a copy of today . 
H:  Good . 
H:  Oh , excellent . Good . 
H:  I C - I CC ' ed Morgan . 
H:  I should have sent  I should have CC ' ed you as well . 
H:  Oh , I thought we did . 
H:  We discussed , uh , musi musical score notation 
H:  and  
H:  and its XML  
H:  Well , um  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  OK , excellent . 
H:  Well , it c 
H:  Great . 
H:  Mmm . 
H:  Can I ask , uh , one thing ? 
H:  It relates to data  data collection 
H:  and I  and I 'd  and we mentioned earlier today , this question of  
H:  um , so , 
H:  um , I s I know that from  with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , uh , are lessened . 
H:  But I wonder if  Uh , is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , um , u w we would c uh , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ? 
H:  So either by rules of participation , or whatever . 
H:  Now , I mean , you know , it 's true , 
H:  I mean , we were discussing this earlier , 
H:  that depending on the task  
H:  so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap . 
H:  But , um , 
H:  i i uh , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway . 
H:  But , um , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ? 
H:  OK . 
H:  OK . 
H:  Just want to be sure there 's enough data to  
H:  OK , good . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  On the task , and the task . 
H:  It 's just  
H:  I just wanted to  uh , 
H:  because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if  if they 're asked to . 
H:  Not  not entirely modify it , 
H:  but lessen it if  if it 's desired . 
H:  But if  if that 's sufficient data  
H:  I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed . 
H:  Time . 
H:  Fine . And I  you know , I  I know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree . 
H:  I just wanted to be sure . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Well , I  just as  as  as a contributary  
H:  eh , so I  I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are prevented from overlapping . 
H:  They 'll just say , you know  you know , " wait till each person is finished before you say something " . 
H:  So it is possible to lessen if we wanted to . 
H:  But  but these other factors are fine . 
H:  I just wanted to raise the issue . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Oh , yeah . 
H:  Yeah , I think that 's always desired . 
H:  I just want to be sure we don't  that we 're able to process , i u uh , you know , as much data as we can . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah , I think  
H:  u e e 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah , I am . 
H:  So , I w uh , just  just for clarification . 
H:  So " found data " , 
H:  they mean like established corpora of linguistics and  and other fields , right ? 
H:  It sounds like such a t 
H:  Yeah , OK . 
H:  OK . 
H:  But it includes like standard corpora that have been used for years in linguistics and  other fields . 
H:  OK . 
H:  Exactly . 
H:  Yeah . OK , OK . 
H:  That 's interesting . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  OK . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Just wanted to know . 
H:  Well , I  I just realized there 's another category of interesting things 
H:  which is that , um , 
H:  I  I found this discussion very , uh , i this  this question of how you get at queries really interesting . 
H:  And  and the  and I  and the fact that it 's sort of , uh , nebulous , what  what that  what kind of query it would be 
H:  because it depends on what your purpose is . 
H:  So I actually found that whole process of  of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting . 
H:  But that 's not really a specific fact . 
H:  I just sort of thought we  we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there , 
H:  which I thought was worthwhile . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  That 's a good point . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Oh . 
H:  Like e expert systems and stuff , 
H:  or  ? 
H:  Uh - huh . 
H:  Yeah . 

H:  h Do we need  do I need to turn something off here , or I do unplug this , or  ?
