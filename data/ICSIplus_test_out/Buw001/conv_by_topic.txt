G:   headphones that aren't so uncomfortable . 
B:  <laugh> I think  Well , this should be off the record , but I think  
D:  Hmm . 
D:   
E:   
F:   
G:   
H:   
A:   
B:   
C:   
D:  Uh , OK . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> We 're not recording yet , are we ? 
G:  Well , I don't think  No . 
F:  No , uh , that  that wasn't recorded . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  <mouth> Um , I don't think they 're designed to be over your ears . 
C:  <mike noise> 
B:  Yeah , I know . It just  it really hurts . It gives you a headache , like if you  
F:  Temple squeezers . 
B:  On your temple  Yeah . 
G:  Yep . <breath with closure> 
B:  Yeah .  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  But I definitely  haven't figured it out . 
F:  <loud outbreath>  
F:  I guess I have to d stop doing this sigh of contentment , you know , after sipping cappuccino or something .  <laugh> I was just noticing a big s <laugh> 
A:  Um , Meeting Recorder meeting . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah , with the  We kno I know . <laugh> We know exactly how much you have left in your cup .  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  " Sip , sigh . "   
E:  <mike noise> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
H:  <mike noise> 
D:  <mouth> So are we recording now ? Is this  
B:  <sniff> 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh ! We 're  we 're  we 're live . OK . 
C:  <clears throat> 
H:  <mike noise> 
D:  <breath> 
E:  Yeah . 


D:  So , uh , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  what were we gonna talk about again ? So we said  we said data collection , which we 're doing . 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  Were we gonna do digits ? 
D:  <mouth> 
A:  OK . Do we do th do you go around the room  and do names or anything ? 
B:  <outbreath> 
G:  <mouth> I think that  
E:  It 's a good idea . 
G:  u 
G:  usually we 've done that and also we 've s done digits as well , but I forgot to print any out . So . Besides with this big a group , <breath with closure> 
D:  <mouth> 
D:  No . I it 'd be even better with this big  
G:  it would take too much time . 
B:  You can write them on the board , if you want . 
E:  <mouth> Which way is  <laugh-breath> 
G:  Yeah , but it takes too much time . 
B:  <sniff> 


E:  Mari ? Y I think your  your  your thing <spike> may be pointing in a funny direction . 
H:  What  <audible closure> 
A:  What ? 
D:  It 's not that long . 
A:  <mike noise> 
E:  Sort of it 's  it helps if it points sort of upwards . 
A:  Whoops .   
E:  Sort of it  you know . Yeah . 
A:  <mike noise> 
A:  Would it  m 
A:  <mike noise> 
E:  So that thing  the little  th that part should be pointing upwards . That 's it . Yeah . 
D:  w u 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  So  Oh , this thing .  
H:  <mike noise> 
A:  <mike noise> 
H:  Otherwise you just get a heartbeats . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . It 's kind of   
D:  <inbreath of surprise> Oh , yeah , the element , yeah , n should be 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  <mike noise> 
D:  as close to you  your 
A:  Yeah . OK . 
E:  That 's good . That kind of thing is good . 
H:  It 's a  
A:  <mike noise> 
D:  mouth as possible . <laugh> 
A:  This w 
E:  Yeah . Oh , yeah . It 's a  
A:  Alright . How 's that working ? 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  It 's working . 
A:  OK . 
H:  <mike noise> 
D:  Alright . So what we had  was that we were gonna talk about data collection , 
A:  <mike noise> 
E:  <mike noise> 
H:  <mike noise> 
E:  <mike noise> 
D:  and , um , uh , you  you put up there data format , 
A:  Um . 
D:  and other tasks during data collection , 


A:  So , I think the goal  the goal was 
D:  and  <outbreath> 
A:  what can we do  how can you do the data collection differently to get  
A:  what can you add to it to get , um , 
A:  some information that would be helpful for the user - interface design ? Like  
G:  Uh , especially for querying . 
A:  Especially for querying . So , getting people to do queries afterwards , getting people to do summaries afterwards . 


H:  <mouth> Well , one thing that came up in the morning  in the morning was the , um , 
A:  Um . 
H:  i uh , if he  I , um  
H:  if he has  s I  I don't remember , Mister Lan - Doctor Landry ? La - Landay ? 
G:  Landay . James . 
H:  So he has , um , these , uh , um , tsk  note - taking things , 
H:  then that would sort of be a summary which you wouldn't have to solicit . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <clears throat> 
H:  y if  if we were able to  
A:  Well , if  if you 
H:  to do that . 
A:  actually take notes as a summary as opposed to n take notes 
A:  in the sense of taking advantage of the time - stamps . So action item or 
A:  uh , reminder to send this to so - and - so , blah - blah - blah . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  So that wouldn't be a summary . That would just be  that would b relate to the query side . 
G:  <inbreath> But if we had the CrossPads , we could ask people , you know , if  if something comes up <audible closure> 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  write it down and mark it <audible closure>  somehow , you know . 
E:  Right . I mean , we  because you 'd have several people with these pads , you could collect different things . 
E:  I mean , cuz I tend to take notes which are summaries . And so , you know  
A:  Right . 
F:  I mean , the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the , 
F:  uh , quality of <outbreath> the handwriting recognition was quite poor . 
A:  Well  
G:  But that 's alright . 
G:  I don't think there 'd be so many that you couldn't 
A:  <inbreath> So  
G:  have someone clean it up <audible closure> 
G:  pretty easily . 
A:  Yeah . We also could come up with some code for 
A:  things that people want to do so that  for frequent things . 
F:  Yeah . 
A:  And the other things , people can write whatever they want . I mean , it 's to some extent , 
A:  uh , for his benefit . So , 
A:  if that  you know , if  if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful . 
F:  Right . 
D:  <inbreath> 
G:  Yeah . 


D:  <inbreath> I just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were gonna do at the front where we each said who we were .  
H:  <mike noise> 
H:  The roll call . 
A:  Right . I thought you did that 
D:  Roll call . 
A:  on purpose . But anyway , shall we do the roll call ? 
D:  No , not a  No , I just  My mind went elsewhere . So , 
D:  uh , yeah , I 'm Morgan , 
D:  and  
D:  where am I ?  I 'm on channel three . 
G:  <mouth> And I 'm Adam Janin on channel A . 
H:  <mike noise> 
H:  <inbreath> I 'm Jane Edwards , I think on channel B . 
E:  I 'm Dan Ellis . 
F:  Eric on channel nine . 
B:  Liz , on channel one . 
A:  <mouth> Mari on channel zero . 
C:  <mouth> Katrin on channel two . 
H:  Should we have used pseudo - names ? 
H:  Should we do it a second time with pseudo No . <laugh> No . 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> I 'm Rocky Raccoon <breath> on channel  
G:  And , uh , do you want to do the P D As and the  P Z Ms ? 
E:  Let me , uh , turn that off . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <clears throat> 
H:  <laugh> 
E:  Oh . 
E:  PZM nearest , nearest , next nearest .  
E:  Next one . 
H:  Next nearest . 
G:  Far . 
E:  Furthest . PDM - right , PZA - right  PDA - right ,  PDA - left . 
H:  OK . 
E:  Thanks . 
G:  Yeah , and eventually once this room gets a little more organized , the Jimlets  will be mounted under the table , 
G:  and these guys will be permanently mounted somehow . You know , probably with double - sided tape , but  
G:  So . You  So we won't have to go through that . 
G:  <breath with audible closure> 
A:  Hmm . 


H:  <mouth> I have a question on protocol in these meetings , which is 
H:  when you say " Jimlet " and the 
H:  person listening won't know what that is , sh shou 
H:  How  how do we get  Is that important information ? You know , the 
E:  <mike noise> 
D:  <inbreath>  
H:  Jimlet  I mean , the box that contains the  
D:  Well , I mean , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones . There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other 
D:  have in column  common  that we will not know . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
H:  OK . 
A:  Right . So the there will be jargon that we he There 'll be transcription errors . 
H:  <mouth> Good . 
D:  Yeah . 
H:  OK . 
D:  I mean , we  we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design , and  and  and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be <laugh> jargon to  to us . So . 
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  Well , that was just one of the reasons . But , yeah , definitely . 
H:  OK . Good .  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That  that 's right . There were others of course . Yeah . 




H:  <long inbreath> OK , so we were on the data collection   and the summary issue . 
D:  Right . We can go back .  
A:  So , 
A:  uh , u u 
A:  So , actually there 's kind of three issues . There 's the CrossPad issue . 
A:  <mouth> Should we do it and , if so , what 'll we have them do ? 
A:  Um , do we have s people write summaries ? 
A:  Everybody or one person ? 
A:  And then , do we ask people for how they would query things ? 
F:  <inbreath> There 's  there 're sub - problems in that , in that where  or when do you actually ask them about that ? I mean , that was  
A:  Is that  
A:  Right . 
F:  One thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said 
F:  earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then . 
A:  Right . 
F:  But 
F:  there 's a problem with that in that 
F:  if  you 're not  
F:  If you don't have an interactive system , it 's gonna be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question . 
A:  Right . 
F:  Right . And furth id explore the data further . 
D:  <inbreath> 
A:  Right . 
G:  <mouth> And  
F:  So . 
D:  There 's  there 's another problem which is , um , 
D:  we certainly do want to branch out beyond , uh , uh , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  And , uh , once we get out beyond our little group , 
D:  the people 's motivation factor , uh , reduces enormously . And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do , 
D:  how  you know , we  we did n you know another meeting here for another group and  and , uh , they were fine with it . But if we 'd said , " OK , now all eight of you have to  
D:  <laugh-breath> have to come up with , uh , the summar " 
G:  <mouth> Well , I asked them to and none of them did . <audible closure> 
D:  t See ? There we go . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  So , I  I asked them to send me 
A:  They  
G:  ideas for queries after the meeting and no one ever did . <mouth> I didn't follow up either . 
E:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  So I didn't track them down and say " please do th do it now " . But , uh , 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  <clears throat> 
G:  no one spontaneously 
G:  provided anything . <mike noise> 
D:  I 
D:  I 'm worried that if you did  even if you did push them into it , it  it  it might be semi - random , 
A:  Right . 
D:  uh , as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing . 
E:  Right . 
G:  <mouth> I just don't know how else to generate the queries other than getting an expert 
A:  OK . 
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  to actually listen to the meeting and say " that 's important , that might be a query " . 
H:  Tsk .  Well , there is this other thing which y which you were alluding to earlier , which is , um , there are certain key words like , you know , " action item " and things like that , which 
H:  could be used in , 
H:  uh , 
E:  <inbreath> Although  
H:  t to some degree finding the structure . And  and I also , um , was thinking , with reference to 
A:  Yeah . W 
H:  the n uh , note - taking , 
H:  the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later . 
H:  And the fir third thing I wanted to say is the summaries afterwards , 
H:  um , I think they should be recorded instead of written 
H:  because I think that , um , it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary . 


A:  <inbreath> How about this idea ? That normally 
A:  at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker . 
H:  Yeah , good . Good point . Yeah . 
A:  And  So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ? 
G:  I mean , that gives you a summary but it doesn't really  How do you generate queries from that ? 
H:  <mike noise> 
E:  Well . But , I mean , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system . Right ? 
H:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  <audible closure> 
E:  I mean , they 're something . It 's a  a kind of output you 'd like . 
C:  <clears throat> 
B:  <inbreath> Actually  
G:  Uh , James and I were talking about this during one of the breaks . And the problem with that is , I 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval 
B:  And so  
G:  even if it 's sort of not full full - bore 
A:  Right . 
G:  what I 'm gonna do for my thesis . I 'm gonna do something . I 'm not gonna do anything with summarization . 
G:  And so if someone wants to do that , that 's fine , but it 's not gonna be me . 
D:  <inbreath> Well , I think that we  I mean , the  the f the core thing is that you know once we get some of these 
H:  <mouth> <inbreath>  <outbreath> 
A:  Well  
D:  issues nailed down , 
D:  we need to do a bunch of recordings 
D:  and send them off to IBM and get a bunch of transcriptions even if they 're slightly flawed or need some other   
G:  Yep . <audible closure> 
D:  And then we 'll have some data there . 
A:  <inbreath> Yeah . 
D:  And then , i i we can start 
D:  l looking and thinking , what do we want to know about these things and  at the very least . 
A:  <inbreath> 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah  
B:  I actually want to say something about the note pad . So , 
D:  Hmm . 
B:  if you could sense just when people are writing , 
B:  and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  be using that for other purposes ,  and each person has a note pad . They just get it when they come in the room . 
B:  Then you c you can just have a fff  plot of wh you know , who 's writing when . 
E:  <mouth> 
B:  That 's all you  
E:  Activity . Yeah . 
B:  And , you can also have notes of the meeting . But I bet that 's  that will allow you to go into the  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  sort of the hot places where people are writing things down . I mean , you can tell when you 're in a meeting when everybody stops to write something down that something was just said . It may not be 
G:  <sniff> 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  Oh , I see . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  kept in the later summary , but at that point in time is was something that was important . 
H:  Mm - hmm . <inbreath>  
B:  And that wouldn't take any extra  
H:  That 's a nice idea . 
B:  Or someone could just pu you could just put your hand on the pad and go like that if you want to .  
D:  It  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <mouth> <inbreath>  
D:  <inbreath> That 's a good idea but that doesn't  
B:  It 's  
D:  Maybe I 'm missing something ,  but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries , right ? 
A:  <inbreath> Well , what it does  
B:  <inbreath> Well , then you can go to the points where the  you could actually go to those points in time and find out what they were talking about . And you r 
D:  Yeah .  
A:  <inbreath> Well , what it does is provide a different  I  I think it 's an interesting thing . I don't think it gets at the  
B:  And  
G:  Uh , y 
A:  the queries per - se , but it does give us 
A:  an information fusion sort of thing that , you know , you wanna i say 
D:  <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  " what were the hot - points of the meeting ? " 
D:  <mouth> 
D:  That  that 's what I mean , is that I think it gets at something interesting but if we were asking the question , which I thought we were , of  of  of , um , 
D:  " how do we figure out what 's the nature of the queries that people are gonna want to ask of such a system ? " , 
D:  knowing what 's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking . 
B:  But I bet it 's a good  superset of it . 
D:  Does it ? 
A:  <mouth> 
E:  <mouth> Well , see , there are th 
H:  <mouth> <inbreath>  
A:  Well , yeah . I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , 
A:  uh , when  uh , when did so - and - so s 
A:  talk about blah . And at least that gives you the word  that they might run a query on . 
B:  At least you can find the locations where there are maybe keywords and  
G:  <mouth> I mean , i this would tell you what the hit is , not what the query is . What  
D:  Maybe . 
B:  Right , right . But I think  I think thinking about queries is a little bit dangerous right now . We don't even know what  
A:  Right . It 'll tell you the hit but not the query . 
G:  And so you could  you can generate a query from the hits , but  
A:  Right . 
B:  I mean , if you want to find out what any user will use , that might be true for one domain and one user , but I mean a different domain and a different user  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Mm - hmm .  
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Yeah , but we 're just looking for a place to start with that because , you know , th what  what  what James 
B:  Um . 
D:  is gonna be doing is looking at the user - interface and he 's looking at the query in  in  
D:  i We  we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff but we have zero hours of  of  of queries . So he 's just sort of going " where  where do I  
A:  <inbreath> <mouth> w 
D:  where do I start ? " 


A:  Well , th you could do  I think the summaries actually may help get us there , 
H:  <mike noise> 
D:  OK . 
A:  for a couple reasons . One , if you have a summary  if you have a bunch of summaries , 
A:  you can do 
A:  a word frequency count and see what words come up 
A:  in different types of meetings . 
D:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  So " action item " is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever . 
A:  So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Um , the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run 
A:  a little pilot experiment with somebody saying " here 's a summary of a meeting , 
A:  what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? " 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  Yeah , I think that 's difficult because then they 're not gonna ask the questions that are in the summary . 
A:  Well  
G:  But , I think it would give  
A:  That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary , 
G:  <inbreath>  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  and you want to ask questions to get more detail . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  th Yeah , I think it has to be a participant . Well , it doesn't have to be . 
G:  OK . So that  that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about , 
G:  which is for someone else , 
G:  as opposed to as a  remembrance agent , which is what had been my primary thought 
G:  in the information retrieval part of it would be . 
G:  But , uh , 
G:  I guess if you had a meeting participant , 
G:  they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries . But it 's not  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  I don't know how to do it if  until you have a system . 
B:  <inbreath> The summary is actually gonna drive the queries then . I mean , your research is going to be very circular . 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  Mmm . 
G:  Yeah , that  that 's what I was saying . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  <inbreath> But th there is this , um  <outbreath> <mouth> <inbreath> 
E:  There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time but some 
E:  in retrospect you think " oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? " 
E:  And it 's something that didn't appear in the summary but you   And that 's kind of what this kind of , uh , complete data capture is kind of nicest for . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <clears throat> 
A:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
E:  Cuz it 's the things that you wouldn't have bothered to make an effort to record but they get recorded . 
A:  Right . 
E:  So , I mean  And th there 's no way of generating those , u u until we just  until they actually occur . You know , it 's like  
B:  But you could always post - hoc label them . 
E:  Right , right . Exactly . But I mean , it 's difficult to sort of say " and if I was gonna ask four questions about this , what would they be ? " 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  Those aren't the kind of things that come up . 
H:  <mouth> <inbreath>  
G:  But at least it would get us started . <laugh> 
E:  Oh , yeah . Yeah , sure . 
H:  <mouth> I also think that w if  if you can use the summaries as an indication of the 
H:  important points of the  of the meeting , 
H:  then you might get something like  
H:  y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection , 
H:  you know , maybe the summary would say , you know , " we discussed types of na data collection " . 
H:  And , you know  And  and maybe you could get to it by that . If you  if you had the  the larger structure of the  
H:  of the discourse , then 
H:  if you can categorize what it is that you 're 
H:  looking for with reference to those l 
H:  those larger headings , then you can find it even if you 
G:  <inbreath> Mmm . 
H:  don't have a direct route to that . 
G:  <mouth> Although it seems like that 's , um , 
H:  I think that  
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  a high burden on the note - taker . 
H:  <inbreath>  
D:  I 've b been thinking  I 've been thinking about it a little bit here  about the  uh , th this , e um  
A:  Well - <outbreath> 
G:  We 'll just have to see . 
D:  <inbreath> I think that the  
D:  now I 'm thinking that the summary  a summary , uh , is actually a reasonable , 
D:  uh , bootstrap into this  into what we 'd like to get at . It 's  it 's not ideal , but we  you know , we  we have to get started someplace . <inbreath> 
D:  So I was  I was just thinking about , 
D:  um , suppose we wanted to get  
D:  w We have this collection of meeting . We have five hours of stuff . 
D:  Uh , we get that transcribed . So now we have five hours of meetings 
D:  and , uh , you ask me , uh , uh , " Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ? " 
D:  Uh , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask . I 'd have to get started someplace . So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go " oh , yeah , I was in that meeting , 
B:  <mike noise> 
D:  I remember that , 
D:  um , what was the part that  "  
D:  And  and th I think that might 
D:  then help me to think of things  even things that aren't listed in the summary , 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  but just as a  as a  as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting . 
A:  <inbreath> I think it serves two purpo purposes . One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  queries , but also , I mean , maybe we do want to generate summaries . And then it 's  
D:  Well , yeah . That 's true too . 
E:  Hmm . 
G:  Yeah , absolutely . Then you want to have it . 
A:  you know , it 's kind of a key . 
G:  <audible closure> 
B:  So how does the summary get generated ? I 'm not against the idea of a summary , but 
A:  Uh  
A:  Well , i i  ? 
G:  By hand . 
B:  I wanted to think carefully about who 's generating it and how  because the summary will drive 
A:  Or , d o 
B:  the queries . So  
A:  <inbreath> What I  I think , you know , in most meetings , 
A:  this one being  different ,  but 
A:  in most meetings that I attend , there 's somebody t explicitly taking notes , frequently on a laptop  
A:  Um , you can just make it be on a laptop , so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII and not somebody  you don't have to go through handwriting recognition . 
B:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  Um , and then they post - edit it into , 
A:  uh , a summary and they email it out for minutes . I mean , that happens in most meetings . 


G:  That 's a pretty fine grain that the note - taker will have to take . 
B:  <inbreath> Maybe Landay can put a student in to be a note - taker . 
H:  <mouth> <inbreath>  
A:  I th No . I think you got to have somebody 
B:  No ? 
A:  who knows the pro knows the topic or  you know , whose job it is delegated to be the note - taker . Somebody who 's part of the meeting . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <inbreath> No , I mean , but someone who can come sit in on the meetings and then takes the notes with them that the real note - taker  
G:  But they  <audible closure> 
B:  And that way that one student has , you know , a rough idea of what was going on , 
B:  and they can use it for their research . I mean , this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system , 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  because that that 's a lot of trouble  and maybe it 's not the best way to do it . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  But if he has some students that want to study that 
B:  then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings , and 
B:  get the notes from the note - taker or something . 
G:  Right . 
G:  <breath with audible closure> 
G:  <inbreath> Well , I think that 's a little bit of a problem . Their sort of note - taking application stuff 
D:  Hmm . 
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  they 've been doing for the last couple of years , and I don't think anyone is still working on it . 
G:  I think they 're done . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  <inbreath> 
H:  <mouth> <inbreath>  
G:  Um , so I 'm not sure that they have anyone currently working on 
G:  notes . So what we 'd have to interest someone in 
G:  is the combination of note and speech . 
B:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  And so the question is " is there such a person ? " And I think right now , the answer is " no " . 


H:  I I  I think 
H:  that , um , there 's  we 're using " summary " in two different ways .  So what you just described I would describe as " minutes " .  
G:  Minutes .  
E:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
H:  And what I originally thought was , um , if you asked someone " what was the meeting about ? " 
B:  Yeah . OK . 
H:  And then they would say " well , we talked about this and then we talked about that , and so - and - so talked about  "  
A:  Hmm . 
H:  And then you 'd have , like  
H:  <inbreath> I  e My thought was 
H:  to have multiple people summarize it , 
H:  on recording rather than writing because writing takes time and you get irrelevant other things that u take time , that  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting , 
H:  you know , a two - minute summary of what the meeting was about , I think you would get , 
H:  uh , with mult See , I  I also worry about having a single note - taker because that 's just one person 's perception . 
H:  And , um , 
H:  you know , it  it 's releva it 's relative to what you 're focus was on that meeting , and  and people have different  
D:  Mm - hmm .  
H:  major topics that they 're interested in . 
A:  <inbreath>  
D:  A 
H:  So , my proposal would be that it may be worth considering both of those types , you know , the note - taking and 
A:  OK . 
E:  <mouth> Yeah . 
H:  a spontaneous oral summary afterwards , no longer than two minutes , 
D:  <inbreath> Adam , you can  
H:  from multiple people . 
H:  Yeah .  
D:  you can correct me on this , but  but , uh , my impression was that , uh , 
D:  pretty much , uh , true that the meetings here , nobody sits with a w uh , with a laptop and  
G:  Never . 
G:  Never . I 've never seen it at ICSI . Does anyone  ?  
D:  <laugh> 
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  I mean , Dan is the one who  who 
D:  I 
B:  Dan ? <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  most frequently would take notes , and  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I 've d When we  when we have other meetings . When I have meetings on the European projects , we have someone taking notes .  <laugh> 
G:  Oh , really ? 
E:  In fact , I often do it . Yeah .  
D:  Yeah , but those are bigger deal things . Right ? Where you 've got fifteen peo I mean , most  th this is one of the larger meetings . Most of the meetings we have are 
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  That 's true  are four or five people . 
D:  four or five people and you 're not  you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it . You just <breath> get together and talk about where you are . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . So , I think it depends on whether it 's a business meeting 
G:  Culture .  
A:  or a technical discussion . And I agree , technical discussions you don't usually have somebody taking notes . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  The IRAM meeting , they  they take notes every  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Do they ? 
G:  There 's uh a person with a laptop  at each meeting . 
E:  How many people are those meetings ? 
G:  There are more . I mean , there are ten - ish . 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 


B:  Y you should also have a record of what 's on the board . I mean , I find it very  hard to reconstruct what 's going on . I  I don't know how  
G:  They 're very sparse . 
G:  <inbreath> Yeah . This is something early in the project we talked a lot about . <audible closure> 
B:  I don't know how , but for instance , I mean , the outline is sort of up here and that 's what people are seeing . And if you have a  
B:  Or you shou could tell people not to  to use the boards . But there 's sort of this missing information otherwise . 
G:  <inbreath> I agree , but  but 
E:  <inbreath> We sh we should  
H:  I agree . 
G:  you  you just  you g end up with video , 
H:  <mike noise> 
H:  <laugh, inhaling while smiling> 
E:  <inbreath> Well , I don't know . 
G:  and  and instrumented rooms . And  that 's a different project , I think . 
E:  f u 
E:  I think for this data capture , it would be nice to have a digital camera 
G:  Yeah , different   <laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Uh , y 
E:  just to take pictures of who 's there , where the microphones are , and then we could also put in what 's on the board . You know , like three or four snaps for every  
B:  <outbreath> 
B:  Right . 
H:  I agree . That 's wonderful . 
B:  Yeah . People who were never at the meeting will have a very hard time understanding it otherwise . 
E:  for every meeting . 
G:  But don't you think that 's  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Don't you think that  But  
H:  I agree . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Well , no . I mean , I  I just think  I mean , I think that right now we don't make a record of where people are sitting on the tables . 
B:  Even people who were at the meeting .  
G:  <inbreath> Huh . 
A:  Right . 
G:  Right . <audible closure> 
E:  And that  the  at some point that might be awfully useful .  <laugh> 
G:  <mouth> <inbreath> But I think adding 
H:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  <noise> 
H:  <mike noise> 
A:  Mmm . 
G:  photographs adds a whole nother level of problems . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  We - 
H:  It 's just a digital record . 
E:  n uh ,  
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  Not  not as part of the  not as a part of the data that you have to recover . Just  just in terms of  
B:  I don't mean that you model it . 
B:  We should just  
B:  Like archiving it or storing it . 
E:  Yeah . 
H:  Yes , I agree . 
H:  <mike noise> 
H:  I agree . 
H:  It 's i because discourse is about things , and then you have the things that are about , and it 's recoverable . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <inbreath> Because someone  
E:  <mouth> 
E:  So  
B:  someone later might be able to take these and say " OK , they , you know  at least these are the people who were there and here 's sort of what they started talking about , and  " 
B:  and just  
H:  Yes . And it 's so simple . Like you said , three snapshots and  
D:  <inbreath> Li - 
D:  uh , L L 
D:  L 
D:  Liz , you  
H:  Just to archive . 
D:  u uh , Liz , you sa you sat in on the , uh , 
E:  <mouth> Actually  <mike noise>  
D:  <breath> 
D:  subcommittee meeting or whatever  
E:  I 'll go and get the camera . 
D:  uh , on  you  on the subcommittee meeting for  for  at the , uh  that workshop we were at that , uh , uh , Mark Liberman was  was having . 
D:  <breath> 
D:  So I  I wasn't there . They  they  they  they h must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that . 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  Big , big interest . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Huge . I mean , it  personally , I don't  I would never want to deal with it . But I 'm just saying 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  first of all there 's a whole bunch of 
B:  fusion issues that DARPA 's interested in . You know , fusing gesture and face recognition , even lip movement and things like that , 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah .  
B:  for this kind of task . 
B:  And there 's also 
B:  I think a personal interest on the part of Mark Liberman 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  in this kind of  
B:  in storing these images in any data we collect so that later we can do other things with it . 
D:  Yeah . <mike noise> 
H:  Mmm . Mm - hmm . <mike noise> 
D:  So  so to address what  what Adam 's saying , I mean , I think you  uh , that 
B:  And  
D:  the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <mouth> <breath> 
D:  And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it . 
D:  Right ? So , uh  
H:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
G:  But that  it 's gonna be a lot of effort on our part 
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  to create it , and store it , and 
D:  <mouth> 
D:  Right . So we 're gonna  
G:  get all the standards , and to do anything with it . 
D:  So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do , whatever 's reasonable for us . But having  
G:  Yeah . 
B:  I think even doing something very crude  Like I know with ATIS , we just had a tape recorder running all the time . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  And later on it turned out it was really good that you had a tape recorder of what was happening , even though you w you just got the speech from the machine . 
B:  <inbreath> So if you can find some really , 
B:  you know , low , uh , perplexity ,  
G:  <mouth> 
G:  Low fidelity .  Yeah . 
B:  yeah ,  way of  
B:  of doing that , I think it would be worthwhile . 
H:  I agree . And if it 's simple as  I mean , as simple as just the digital  
B:  Otherwise you 'd  you lose it . 
H:  Yeah .  
D:  <inbreath> Well , minimally , I mean , what  what Dan is referring to at least having some 
D:  representation of the p the spatial position of the people , cuz we are interested in some spatial processing . And so  
H:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Right . <audible closure> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <inbreath> so , um  
D:  <mouth> <outbreath> 
G:  Well , once the room is a little more fixed that 's a little easier cuz you 'll  Well , the wireless . 
D:  <mouth> Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> But  
B:  <inbreath> Also CMU has been doing this and they were the most vocal at this meeting , Alex Waibel 's group . 
G:  <breath with audible closure> 
C:  <clears throat> 
B:  And they have  said , I talked to the student who had done this ,  that with two 
B:  fairly inexpensive cameras they  they just recorded all the time and were able to get all the information from  or maybe it was three  from all the parts of the room . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  So I think we would be  we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't collect it  
G:  <inbreath> Yeah . 
G:  I  I  I don't disagree . I think that if you have that , then people who are interested in vision can use this database . 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  at all . 
G:  The problem with it is 
G:  you 'll have more people who don't want to be filmed than who don't want to be recorded . 
H:  Well , she 's not  making  
G:  So that there 's going to be another group of people who are gonna say " I won't participate " . 
C:  Mmm . <laugh> <mouth> That 's true . 
H:  <inbreath> 
G:  <audible closure> 
G:  <inbreath> Um  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Or you could put a paper bag over everybody 's head and not look at each other and not look at boards , and just all be sitting <breath> talking . That would be an interes <laugh> Bu -  
H:  <mouth> Well  
D:  Uh - huh . Great idea . <laugh> 
H:  Well , there 's  that 'd be the  the parallel , yeah . But I think y she 's  we 're just proposing  a minimal preservation of things on boards , 
B:  Yeah . I definitely won't participate if there 's a camera . 
H:  sp spatial organization  And you could anonymize the faces for that matter . You know , I mean , this is  We can talk about the  
D:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  <inbreath> But , you know , that 's a lot of infrastructure and work . To set it up and then anonymize it ? 
H:  It 's just one snapshot . We 're not talking about a movie . We 're talking about a snapshot . 
B:  <inbreath> No , it wa n not , um  
A:  No , no , no , no .  
B:  Not for  not for CMU . They have a pretty crude set - up . And they had  
A:  So  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Yeah . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  they just turn on these cameras . They were  they were not moving or anything . 
G:  Couldn't find it ?  
G:  <audible closure> 
E:  It 's on its way . 
B:  And stored it on analog media . 
H:  Hmm .  <mike noise> 
G:  Hmm ? 
E:  It 's coming . 
B:  And they  they didn't actually align it or anything . They just  they have it , though . 
E:  <mike noise>  
H:  Yeah . Well , it 's worth considering . Maybe we don't want to  
H:  spend that much more time discussing it , but  
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  Did they store it digitally , or  ?  
B:  Hmm - mm .  I think they just  
F:  or just put it on videotape ? 
B:  I think they just had the videotapes with a c you know , a counter or something . Um , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <inbreath> Well , I think for  I mean , for our purposes we probably will d 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  I 'm not sure . 
D:  we  we might try that some and  and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that , 
H:  Yeah .  
D:  uh , which , you know , we we 'll  we 'll get other value out of , I think . 
B:  Yeah . 
H:  Th - 
H:  The thing is , if it 's easy to collect it  it th then I think it 's a wise thing to do because once it 's gone it 's gone . And  
B:  <inbreath> I 'm just  The community  
B:  If LDC collects this data  u I mean , and L - if Mark Liberman is a strong proponent of how they collect it and what they collect , 
B:  there will probably be some video data in there . 
D:  There you go . 
B:  And so that could argue for us not doing it or it could argue for us 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  doing it . The only place where it sort of overlaps is when 
B:  some of the summarization issues are  actually could be , 
B:  um , easier  made easier if you had  the video . 
D:  <inbreath> I think at the moment we should be determining this on the basis of our own , 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  uh , interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing . As you say , if they  
D:  <breath> 
D:  if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to , uh , and  and will include all that . 
B:  Mmm .  
D:  Um , <inbreath> 
D:  I  I  I 'm not worried about the cost of setting it up . I 'm worried about the cost of people looking at it . 
A:  e 
D:  In other words , it 's  it  it 'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all . And so 
D:  I  I  I think that we do have to do some picking and choosing 
D:  of the stuff that we 're doing . 
D:  But I  I am int I do think that we m minimally want  something  
D:  we might want to look at  at some  some , uh , subsets of that . Like 
D:  for a meeting like this , at least , uh , take a Polaroid of the  <laugh> of the  of the boards , and   
B:  Of the board .  
C:  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  <mike noise> Exactly . 
B:  Or at least make sure that the note - taker takes a sh you know , a snapshot of the board . 
D:  <mouth> a 
D:  and know the position of the people   
B:  That 'll make it a lot easier for meetings that are structured . I mean , otherwise later on if nobody wrote this stuff on the board down we 'd 
H:  Exactly . 
D:  <vocal squeak> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  have a harder time summarizing it or agreeing on a summary . 
H:  <mike noise> 
H:  We  And it  
H:  Especially since this is common knowledge . I mean , this is shared knowledge among all the participants , and it 's a shame to keep it off the recording . 
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  Uh , except in  er , if we weren't recording this , this  this would get lost . Right ? <audible closure> 
H:  s 
H:  Well , I don't understand that point . I mean , I just think that the  
D:  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <inbreath>  
G:  The point is that we 're not saving it anyway . 
G:  Right ? In  in  our real - life setting . 
H:  Well   
E:  <mike noise> 
A:  What do you mean we 're not saving it anyway ? I 've written all of this down and it 's getting emailed to you . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> And you 're gonna send it out by email , too . 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  Well , uh , in that case we don't need to take pictures of it . 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
B:  Right . That would be the other alternative , to make sure that anything that was on the board , 
G:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah .  
A:  Yeah . 
H:  Well   


A:  <inbreath> Well , that 's why  that 's why I 'm saying that I think the note - taking 
B:  um , is in the record . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  would be  I think in many  for many meetings there will be some sort of note - taking , 
A:  in which case , that 's a useful thing to have  
A:  Uh , I mean , we  uh , we don't need to require it . Just like the  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  I mean , I think it would be great if we try to get a picture with every meeting . 
H:  I agree .  
A:  Um , 
H:  <mike noise> 
A:  so  so we won't worry about requiring these things , but the more things that we can get it for , 
A:  the more useful it will be for various applications . 
D:  <inbreath> So  
A:  So . 
D:  So , I mean , departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about , you know , this group and what we actually want to do , 
D:  <breath> 
D:  uh , so I guess that 's th the way  what you were figuring on doing was  was  was , uh , putting together some notes and sending them to  
D:  to everybody  
D:  from  from today ? OK . 
D:  So . 
D:  Um  
H:  That 's great .  
H:  <inbreath>  
D:  <outbreath> So  <outbreath> so the question  that  that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during  during th during the collection . And I guess the CrossPads was certainly one idea , 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  Ow .  
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  uh , and we 'll get them from him and we 'll just do that . Right ? And then the next thing 
F:  <laugh> 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  we talked about was the  was the summaries 
A:  <inbreath>  
D:  and are we gonna do anything 
F:  <inbreath> <mouth>  
D:  about that . 
A:  <noise> 
A:  <inbreath> Well , before we leave the CrossPads and  and call it done . 
D:  Oh , OK . 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  So , if I 'm collecting data 
B:  <breath> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  then there is this question of 
A:  do I use CrossPads ? 
A:  So , I think that if 
A:  we really seriously have me collect data 
A:  and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it , 
H:  <mike noise> 
A:  um , unless you think that the CrossPads are gonna  
A:  n 
A:  I 'm not  I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do . But  but having a small percentage of the data with it , I 'm not sure 
A:  whether that 's useful or not . Maybe  maybe it 's no big deal . Maybe we just do it and see what happens . 
D:  <inbreath> What  
D:  <inbreath> I guess the point was to try  again , to try to collect more 
D:  information that could be useful later for  for the UI stuff . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  So it 's sort of Landay supplying it so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do . So it  it  Right now he 's g operating from 
A:  Right . 
C:  <breath> 
A:  Nothing . 
D:  zero , and so even if we didn't get it done from UW , it seems like that would  could still  
A:  <mouth> OK . 
D:  You shou I mean , at least try it . 
B:  I think it 'd be useful to have a small amount of it just as a proof of concept . It will  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . OK . 
G:  And  and they seem to  not be able to give enough of them away , so we could probably get more as well . 
B:  You know , what you can do with things . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  That 's true . So if it  if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me . 
B:  But not  not to rely on them for  basic modeling . 
G:  <mouth> Yeah , I 'm not sure . I think it it  it will again depend on Landay , and if he has a student who 's interested , and how much infrastructure we 'll need . 
G:  <breath> I mean , if it 's easy , we can just do it . <audible closure> 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  Um , but if it requires a lot of our time , we probably won't do it . <audible closure> 
D:  <inbreath> I guess a lot of the stuff we 're doing now really is pilot in one sense or another .  And so we try it out and see how it works . 
A:  Right . 
B:  <mike noise> 
G:  Yeah . Yeah , we have to sort of figure out what we 're gonna do . Right . <audible closure> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  I just wouldn't base any of the modeling on having those . 
G:  Right . I ag I think I agree with that . 
A:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  It 's just   
G:  <audible closure> 
A:  Right . 
A:  OK . 
G:  I think , though , the importance marking is a  good idea , though . 
G:  That if  if people have something 
B:  I 'd be sort of cool . 
B:  I mean , it would  
G:  in front of them  
C:  <clears throat> 
B:  Yeah . That w shouldn't be hard for  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Do it on pilots or laptops or something . 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  OK , if something 's important everyone clap .  
G:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  OK . So CrossPads , we 're just gonna try it and see what happens . 
D:  OK . 
G:  Yeah . Um , I think that 's right . <audible closure> 
D:  OK .  
A:  OK . The note - taking  
A:  So , I  I think that this is 
A:  gonna be useful . So if we record data I will definitely ask for it . 
A:  So , I j I think we should just say this is not  we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , 
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  <inbreath> Yeah . 
E:  <mike noise> <breath> 
G:  Oh , OK . That 's fine . 
A:  could  could they send it to us ? 
G:  Absolutely . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  And then  
G:  Yeah . What I was gonna say is that I don't want to ask people to do something they wouldn't normally do in a meeting . 
G:  It 's ver I just want to keep away from the artificiality . But 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  I think it  definitely 
G:  if they exist . 


G:  And then Jane 's idea of summarization afterward I think is not a bad one . 
G:  Um , 
G:  picking out  basically to let you pick out keywords , 
G:  um , and , uh , construct queries . 
D:  <mouth> So who  who does this summarization ? 
H:  <mouth> Yeah , I 'm thinking that  Yeah . <mike noise> 
G:  People in the meeting . 
G:  You know , just at  at the end of the meeting , before you go , 
H:  Uh - huh . 
B:  Without hearing each other though , probably . 
G:  go around the table . 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
F:  Or even just have one or two people stay behind . 
G:  Ugh .  
G:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  <mouth> People with radio mikes can go into separate rooms and continue recording without hearing each other . That 's the nice thing . 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  Well , then you should try them a few weeks later and  
H:  How fascinating .  
E:  <laugh> 
G:  And see  score them ? 
B:  They have all these memory experiments about how little you actually retain and wasn't   
G:  <laugh> 
E:  That 's right . Well , that 's the interesting thing , though . If we do  if we collect four different summaries , you know , we 're gonna get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently . It 's like  
G:  Oh . 
G:  Hmm . 
E:  this is not what we meant to research .  
B:  Right , right . <audible closure> 
D:  Oh . Yeah . 
H:  That could be very interesting . 
A:  Mm - hmm .  
F:  Hmm . 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . 
D:  Ru - 
A:  But  but again , like the CrossPads , I don't think I would base a lot of stuff on it , because I think  
G:  I d yeah , I don't know how you would do it , though . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  I know when I see the  the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door . So , 
G:  Running to   Yeah , fff !  
E:  Hmm . 
A:  you 're probably not gonna get  a lot of people wanting to do this . 
G:  <long breath> 
H:  <mouth> Well , I think if  
G:  Maybe e Is email easier ? I mean , I  when you first said 
G:  do  do it , um , 
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  spoken , what I was thinking is , oh then people have to come up and you have to hook them up to the recorder . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  So , if they 're already here I think that 's good , but if they 're not already here for  I 'd rather do email . 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  <mike noise> 
A:  Right . 
H:  <inbreath> Yeah , I 'd just try  Well , however the least intrusive and  and quickest way is , and th and closest to the meeting time too , cuz people will start to forget it as soon as they l leave . 
G:  I 'm much faster typing than anything else . 
A:  <inbreath>  
G:  Yeah . 
A:  <inbreath> Yeah . I think that  I think doing it orally 
G:  I don't know . 
G:  At   
A:  at the end of the meeting is the best time . I just don't  because 
H:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  they 're kind of a captive audience . Once they leave , 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  <inbreath> 
A:  you know , forget it . But  but i 
G:  Yeah , read the digits , do the summary .  
G:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  <mike noise> 
A:  Right . But , uh , I don't think that they 'll necessarily  
D:  Hmm . 
A:  you 'll  you 'll get many people willing to stay . But , you know , if you get even one  
H:  <mouth> <inbreath> w 
H:  I would s Yeah .  
D:  Well , I think it 's like the note - taking thing , that  that y that you can't  certainly can't require it or people aren't gonna want to do this . But  but if there 's 
E:  <quick forceful outbreath> 
D:  some cases where they will , then it would be helpful . 
H:  <inbreath> And I 'm also wondering , couldn't that be included in the data sample so that you could increase the num you know , the words that are , 
D:  <mike noise> 
F:  Hmm . 
H:  uh , recognized by a particular individual ? If you could include the person 's meeting stuff and also the person 's summary stuff , maybe that would be 
E:  Yeah . 
H:  uh , 
H:  an ad addition to their database . 
E:  It 's kind of nice . Yeah . 
H:  <mike noise> 
D:  Hmm . <outbreath> 
H:  Under the same acoustic circumstance , cuz if they just walk next door with their set - up , 
E:  Right . 
H:  nothing 's changed , just  
H:  <laugh>  


F:  So I have a question about queries , 


G:  God , that 's bugging me . <laugh>  
F:  which is , um , 
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  <mouth> 
H:  You turn   
G:  Can we turn that light off ? 
F:  uh  
G:  If  can we turn that just  that  that let  
H:  <laugh> 
H:  Uh , let the record show the light is flickering . <laugh>  
D:  The fl the fluorescent light is flickering . Yeah . 
F:  I don't know . 
A:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah , there 's a  
B:  Oh , it is  it is like  OK . 
G:  Very annoying . Oh , much better . 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  There you go . OK . Good . 
C:  <mouth> Oh , yeah . That 's better . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  For a little while I thought it was just that I was really tired . <laugh> That and y  
E:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
C:  <breath> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> Too much caffeine . 
C:  <breath> 
A:  Too much caffeine and really tired , but then I thought " no , maybe that 's real " .  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  OK . 
G:  I thought it was the projector for a moment . It was like , " what 's going on ? " 


F:  So , 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  the question I had about queries was , um , so what we 're planning to do is have people look at the summaries and then generate queries ? 
G:  <mouth> We  we 've just been talking , how do we generate queries ? And so that was one suggestion . 
F:  Are  are we gonna try and o 
F:  Yeah . Well , I mean , 
F:  so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ? 
F:  I mean , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself , so that it may not be a feasible thing . But  
D:  Mmm . 
E:  <mike noise>  
G:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Hello . Dan here .  
F:  n 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Shouldn't Landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ? I mean , this is an issue 
B:  that goes a little bit beyond where  we are right now . They 're the expert  
G:  <inbreath>  
E:  OK .  


E:  Mari ?  
A:  Yeah ? 
E:  Someone wants to know when you 're getting picked up . Is someone picking you up ?  
A:  Um , <clears throat> what 's our schedule ? 
D:  <inbreath> Well , you still wanted to talk with Liz . 
A:  Let 's see , 
A:  <inbreath> you and I need dis Uh , no , we did the Liz talk . 
D:  And you and I need to 
D:  Oh , oh . You already did the Liz talk . OK . <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . So  so that was the prosody thing . 
H:  <mike noise> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh>  
B:  We - <laugh> I don't remember it .  
E:  <laugh>  
A:  Um , we need to finish the  It 's already four - fifteen . 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh , OK . 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  I have like no recall memory .  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh , after . We need to  finish this discussion , and you and I need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart . 
A:  So , 
G:  <mouth> And what ?  
D:  <mouth> I 'm at your disposal . So , up to you . 
A:  um  
A:  Um , what  what 's the plan for this discussion ? We should  
D:  Um , I think we should 
D:  be able to wind up in another half - hour or something , you think ? 
G:  At least . Yeah . 
B:  <mike noise> 
E:  <mike noise>  
G:  m i Even if that much ? Less . 
A:  Uh , less . 
A:  Yeah . So , I think  
D:  Less ? 
B:  It 's interesting that he 's got , like ,  this discussion free yet it 's separate .  
D:  Well , I mean , we still haven't talked about the action items from here and so on . And  
A:  Action  Yeah . So , 
B:  <mike noise> 
A:  e e why don't you say five - thirty ? 
E:  OK , five - thirty .  
A:  I don't  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Is that OK ? We 'll probably hit horrible traffic . 
E:  Sounds   
E:  OK . h Thanks , bye .  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  That 's not 
E:  That 's that .  
A:  a lot of time , but  
D:  Yeah . 


G:  <inbreath> Well , in answer to " is it Landay 's problem ? " , um , he doesn't have a student 
G:  who 's interested right now in doing anything . So he has very little manpower . 
G:  Um , there 's very little 
G:  allocated for him 
G:  and also he 's pretty focused on user interface . So I don't think he wants to do information retrieval , query generation , that sort of stuff . 
E:  <mike noise> 
D:  <breath>  
D:  Yeah , well there 's gonna be these student projects that can do some things but it can't be , yeah , very deep .  
D:  u I  I actually think that  that , 
D:  uh , again , just as a bootstrap ,  
D:  if we do have something like summaries , 
D:  then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , 
D:  come up with  with  with queries , uh , could at least give  
D:  give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know . 
H:  <mike noise> 
D:  I mean , ye Right ? If he doesn't know anything about the area , 
D:  and  the people are talking about and  and , uh  
B:  But the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries . That 's what I 'm worried about . So you might as well just give him the summaries . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  And  
D:  <mouth> Maybe . 
F:  Well , I 'm not sure  I 'm not sure that 's a solved problem . 
G:  y Well , but I think  
G:  <audible closure> 
F:  Right ? Of how to  how to generate queries from a  
B:  Oh , OK . How to do this 
G:  <inbreath> I , uh  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  from the summary . 
C:  <clears throat> 
F:  That was sort of what my  question was  aimed towards . 
B:  So what you want to h to do is , people who were there , 
A:  Hmm . 
B:  who later see , uh , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . There 's no way that can happen . 
G:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
B:  Are we gonna later go over it and , like , make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer , or  or a deeper  
G:  <mouth> Or  or just a memory refresher . 
B:  Yeah . I mean  
B:  But that 's done off  they have to do that off - line . 
G:  Yep . I agree . 
H:  <mouth> <inbreath> 


H:  I 'm also wondering if we could ask the  the people a  a question which would be 
B:  You - 
H:  " what was the most interesting 
H:  thing you got out of this meeting ? " 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
H:  Becau - in terms of like informativeness , it might be , you know , that the summary would  
B:  That 's a good one .  
H:  would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting 
D:  I would think that would be the most likely thing . 
H:  fact . 
B:  Dan doesn't know what sex he is .   
G:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> Yeah , really . <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  But actually I would say that 's a better thing 
C:  <clears throat> 
H:  <mike noise> 
A:  to ask than have them summarize the meeting . 
H:  <mouth> I think you get two different types of information .  
A:  You get two  Yeah , that 's true . 
E:  Yeah . 
H:  <inbreath> Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the  what the meeting was about . 
D:  Hey .  
I:  Oh , you 're still here . 
B:  <inbreath> Ah - 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  We 're still here . 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
H:  So you get the general structure , the important points of what the meeting was about  with the summary .  
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
H:  But with the " what 's the most interesting thing you learned ? "  
B:  <mike noise> 
H:  Uh , so the fact that , uh , I know that Transcriber uses Snack 
B:  Going to see the kids .  
E:  You  you can keep it on .  
H:  is something that I thought was interesting and that  and that Dan worked on  on that . 
B:  <mike noise>  
D:  <laugh> 
H:  So I thought that was really  
H:  you know . So , I mean , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings but could be very informative . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah , that 's actually a really good idea . 
H:  I think it wouldn't be too , uh , uh , cost - intensive either . You know , I mean , it 's like something someone can do pretty easily on the spur of the moment . 
C:  <mouth> Are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them ? 
G:  As many are willing to do it . 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  Make it a voluntary thing , and then   
E:  Yeah . Cuz you 'll get  cuz you 'll get very different answers from everybody , right ? So  
C:  Yeah . That 's why I was wondering . 
G:  <inbreath> Well , maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we 've already done  
G:  <inbreath> <mouth> 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  I mean , I  we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries . But , uh , 
G:  people could , like , listen to them a little bit and  generate some queries . 
H:  <inbreath> Yeah . 
G:  Of course Jane doesn't need to . I 'm sure you have that meeting memorized by now .  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  <inbreath> But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say  what was the most interesting thing you learned , 
G:  Mmm . 
G:  <mouth> 
H:  <mike noise> 
H:  Yeah . Yeah .  
A:  for those pe people willing to stay . 
H:  And that  I think it would pick up the micro - structure , the  
H:  some  some of the little things that would be hidden . 
A:  And  and that might be something people are willing to stay for . 
D:  <inbreath> 
H:  <laugh> That would be interesting .  
D:  Boy , I  I don't know how we get at this   
G:  Or want to get up and leave . 
C:  Yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get 
C:  the effect that somebody says something and then you go around the room and they say " yeah , me too , I agree . " 
G:  Me too , me too , me too .  
D:  Yeah . 
E:  <mouth> On the other hand people might try and come up with different ones , right ? They might say " oh , I was gonna say that one but now I have to think of something else " . 
A:  That 's fine . 
C:  So  
C:  <inbreath>  
D:  Well   
G:  <inbreath> Well , 
G:  you have the other thing , that  that they know why we 're doing it . 
G:  <audible closure>  
G:  We 'll  I mean , we 'll  we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is  
G:  is to d generate queries in the future , so try to pick things that other people didn't say . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  It 's gonna take some thought . I mean , 
D:  It seemed  
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  The kind of , uh , interest that I had in this thing initially 
D:  was , uh , that i 
D:  basically the form that you 're doing something else  later , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  and you want to pick up something 
D:  from this meeting related to the something else . 
D:  So it 's really the imp the  the list of what 's important 's in the something else <laugh> 
E:  Mmm . 
A:  Right . 
D:  rather than the   And it might be something minor  of minor importance to the meeting . 
G:  Right . <audible closure> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Uh , in fact if  if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and  and  and check on it even . 
D:  So it 's  it 's that you 're trying to find   You 're  you 've now  
D:  You weren't interested  Say I  I said " well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue , I 'm more of an acoustics person " . 
E:  Right . 
D:  But  but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm " well what is  what was that part that  that  that , uh , Mari was saying ? " 
G:  Yeah , like Jim Bass says " add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf " <laugh> 
A:  <inbreath> Uh  
D:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  And then I 'm trying to fi I mean , that 's  that 's when I look  in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that 
A:  Yeah . 
H:  <mike noise> 
D:  <breath> 
D:  didn't really stick in my head the first time around and  but for some  
D:  new reason I 'm  I 'm  I 'm interested in  in  in the old stuff . 
B:  <mike noise> 
G:  But that  that 's gonna be very hard to generate . <audible closure> 
D:  So , I don't  I don't know . 
A:  Well , I  That 's hard to generate and  and I think that 's half of what 
F:  Do we  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <mike noise> 
A:  i I would use it for . But I also a lot of times 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  um , make  you know , think to myself " this is interesting , I 've gotta come back 
A:  and follow up on it " . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  So , things that I think are interesting , 
A:  um , I would be , uh , wanting to do a query about . 
A:  And also , I like the idea of going around the room , 
A:  because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it and then I 'd want to follow up on it . 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . That  that might get at some of what I was  
D:  I was concerned about , 
D:  uh , being interested in something later 
D:  that w uh , I didn't consider to be important the first time , which for me is actually the dominant thing , because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if 
D:  I didn't , but some new  task comes along that makes me want to look up .  
G:  <mouth> But  
G:  But what 's interesting to me may not b have been interesting to you . By  so by going around  Yeah . 
D:  <inbreath> Yeah . So having multiple people might get at some of that . Yeah .  
G:  <mouth> Yeah , I  I think  you can't get at all of it , right ? 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  W we just need to start somewhere . 
D:  <inbreath> Yeah , and this is a starting point . 
H:  <mike noise> Uh - huh .  
F:  The question  the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by  you know , 
F:  introduce by saying , you know , this was important now and , you know , maybe tha something else is important later ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I mean , does it  
F:  does the bias matter ? I  I don't know . 
F:  I mean , uh , that 's , I guess , a question for you guys . But  
H:  <inbreath> Well , and  and one thing , we  we 're saying " important " and we 're saying " interesting " . 
H:  And  and those  those can be two different things . 
F:  Uh , yeah , yeah . 
F:  Sure , sure . But I  I  I guess that 's the question , really , is that  I mean , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <inbreath> W 
F:  does building queries based on what 's important now introduce an irreversible bias 
F:  on being able to do what Morgan wants to do later ? 
D:  <mouth> Well , irreversible . I  I  I mean , I guess what I what I  I keep coming back to in my own mind is that , um , 
H:  OK , good . 
F:  That 's  that 's  
H:  Yeah . 
F:  Right . 
D:  the soonest we can do it , 
D:  we need to get up some kind of system 
D:  so that people who 've been involved in the meeting 
D:  can go back later , 
D:  even if it 's a poor system in some ways , and , uh  and ask the questions that they actually want to know . 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  If  you know , if  uh , as soon as we can get that going at any kind of level , then 
D:  I think we 'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask than in any  anything we do before that . But obviously we have to 
D:  bootstrap somehow , and  
F:  Sure . 
A:  Right . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I agree . 
A:  Right . 
H:  <mike noise> 
A:  <audible closure> 
B:  <breath> 
H:  I will say that  that I  I chose " interesting " because I think it includes also " important " 
H:  in some cases . But , um , I  I  I feel like the summary gets  at a different type of information . 
F:  I think " important " can often be uninteresting . 
E:  Mmm . 
A:  Mmm . 
H:  Well , and  and also  
G:  Hmm .  
E:  <mouth> And " interesting " is more interesting than " important " . 
H:  i it puts a lot of burden on the person to  to evaluate . You know , I think inter " interesting " is  is non - threatening in  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 


A:  OK - OK . 
H:  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  In the interest of , um , <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . 
G:  Importance ?  
G:  <laugh> 
A:  generati  generating an interesting summary ,  um  
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  Mm - hmm .  
H:  Yeah .  
A:  No , i in the interest of generating some minutes here , 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  uh , and also moving on to action items and other things , 
A:  let me just go through the things that I wrote down as being important , 
A:  um , that we at least decided on . 
A:  CrossPads we were going to try ,  
A:  um , if Landay can get the , uh  get them to  to you guys , 
A:  um , and see if they 're interesting . And if they are , then we 'll try to get m do it more . 
A:  Um , 
A:  getting electronic summary from a note - taking person if they happen to do it anyway . 
D:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  Um , 
A:  <mouth> 
A:  getting  just , uh , digital pictures  
A:  a couple digital pictures of the  the table and boards to set the context of the meeting . 
A:  Uh , and then going around the room 
A:  at the end to just say  
A:  qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned . So rather than say the most interesting thing , 
H:  k <mike noise> 
A:  something interesting , and that way you 'll get more variety . 
H:  Sure .  
H:  <mike noise> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  That 's good . I like that . I like that . 
G:  I wouldn't even say that " that they learned " . 
A:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
G:  Uh , you might want to mention something that  that you brought up . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  " Thing  that was  discussed . "  
A:  And then the last thing c 
A:  would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards 
A:  and give an oral summary . 
H:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  OK ? Does that pretty much cover everything we talked about ? 
C:  <clears throat> 
H:  Mm - hmm . <inbreath> A <mouth> 
A:  That  well , that we want to do ? 
A:  <laugh> 
H:  And one  and one qualification on  on the oral summaries . They 'd be s they 'd be separate . They wouldn't be hearing each other 's summaries . 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath> 
B:  <breath> <mouth>  
A:  OK . 
G:  Yeah , that 's like  
G:  n <inbreath> 
G:  I think that 's gonna predominantly end up being whoever  takes down the equipment then .  <laugh> 
H:  <inbreath> And  and that would also be that the data would be included in the database . 
G:  Yeah , that would be , let 's see , me . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Mm - hmm . <mike noise> OK . 


E:  <mouth> I mean , there is still this hope that people might actually think of real queries they really want to ask at some point . 
E:  And that if  if that ever should happen , then we should try and write them down . 
H:  Mm - hmm .  
D:  Right . 
G:  Give them a reward , a dollar a query ? 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah , really . If they 're real queries .  
C:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  <inbreath> Well , and again , if we can figure out a way to jimmy a  a  a  a very rough system , say in a year , 
H:  Yeah .  
A:  OK . So  
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  <audible closure> 
D:  then  uh , so that in the second and third years we  we actually have something to  
D:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  Play with and generate real queries from .  
D:  ask queries . <laugh> Uh  
G:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . OK . So . Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
G:  <audible closure> 
B:  <inbreath> 


B:  I think  I just wanted to say one thing about queries . I mean , 
B:  <long inbreath> 
B:  <forceful outbreath> 
B:  the level of the query could be , you know , very low - level or very high - level .  And 
B:  it gets fuzzier and fuzzier as you go up , right ? 
G:  <inbreath> Well , we 're gonna  
B:  So you need to have some sort of  
B:  if you start working with queries , some way of identifying what the  
B:  you know , if this is something that requires a  a one - word answer or it 's one place in the recording versus was there general agreement 
E:  Hmm . 
B:  on this issue of all the people who ha You know , you can gen you can ask queries that are meaningful for people . In fact , they 're very meaningful cuz they 're very high - level . 
G:  Yep . 
B:  But they won't exist anywhere in the  a you know  
G:  Absolutely . So I think we 're gonna have to start 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  with keywords and  and if someone becomes more interested we could work our way up . But  
F:  <mike noise> 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  I I 'm  
C:  <breath> 
D:  I I 'm not so sure I agree with that . Because  uh , b because it depends on , uh , what our goal is . If our goal is Wizard of Oz - ish , 
B:  It  But it may well  
G:  Really ? 
G:  Oh , that 's true . 
D:  we might want to know what is it that people would really like to know about this data . And if it 's  if  if it 's something that we don't know how to do yet , th great , that 's , you know , research project for year four or something . You know ? 
E:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
E:  Research , yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Yeah , I was thinking about Wizard of Oz , but it requires the wizard to know all about the meetings . 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  We 'd have to listen to all the data . <laugh>  
D:  Um , 
D:  <inbreath> well , not  maybe not true Wizard of Oz because people are too 
G:  So . Oh , yeah . I  I understand . 
E:  Well just imagine if  Yeah .  
D:  uh , aware of what 's going on . But  but just  
E:  Get people to ask questions that they def the machine definitely can't answer at the moment , but  Yeah . 
G:  Yep . 
G:  <audible closure> 
D:  Yeah . w Just " what would you like to know ? " 
G:  But that  neither could anyone else , though , is what , uh , my point is . 
E:  Yes .  


H:  <inbreath> I I was wondering if  if there might be one s more source of queries which is indicator phrases like " action item " , 
H:  <mike noise> 
A:  OK . 
H:  which could be obtained from the text  from the transcript . 
G:  Right . Since we have the transcript . 
H:  Yeah . 
G:  Dates maybe . I don't know . That 's something I always forget . 
H:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
H:  Yeah , that 's something to be determined , something to be specified , but text - oriented . 
B:  <inbreath> Well , probably if you have to sit there at the end of a meeting 
B:  and say one thing you remember , it 's probably whatever action item was assigned to you .  
G:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  I mean , in gen that 's all I remember from most meetings . 
H:  I think you 'd remember that , yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  That  that 's all I wrote down . <laugh> 
B:  So , in general , I mean , that could be something you could say , right ? I 'm supposed to  do this . 
H:  <inbreath> Yeah , that 's true . Well , but then you could  you could prompt them to say , 
B:  It  it doesn't  
H:  you know , " other than your action item " , you know , whatever . But  but the action item would be a way to get , uh , maybe an additional query . So . 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  Well  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  I mean , that 's realistically what people might  well be remembering . So . 
D:  Hmm . 
H:  Yeah . Well , but  you know , but you could get again @ @  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Well , we 're piloting . We 'll just do it and see what happens . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I usually don't remember my action items . 
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  But  <laugh> I 'd  I  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 


A:  OK - OK . Speaking of action items , can we move on to action items ?  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm .  
H:  Yeah . yeah .  
G:  Sure . Can you hand me my note pad ? 
A:  Um , 
F:  <mike noise> 
A:  or maybe we should wait until the summary of this  until this meeting is transcribed and then we will hav  
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <mike noise> 
E:  Yeah . Then we 'll know . 
D:  We  we had  I mean , 
G:  Thanks .  
D:  somewhere up there we had milestones , but I guess  Did y did you get enough milestone , uh , from the description things ? 
H:  <mike noise> 
A:  <inbreath> I got  
A:  Yeah . In fact , why don't you hand me those transparencies so that I remember to take them . 
A:  eee ,  
D:  OK . 
A:  OK .   
D:  And , you know , there 's obviously  detail behind each of those , as much as is needed . So , you just have to  let us know .  
A:  OK . 
A:  What I have down for action items is we 're supposed to find out about our human subject , 
A:  um , 
A:  <mouth> requirements . 
H:  Good . 
G:  Yep . 
A:  Uh ,  
A:  people are supposed to send me U R Ls  
A:  for their  for web pages , to c and I 'll put together an overall cover . 
E:  <mouth> Right . We  
A:  And you 're s 
A:  Hmm ? 
E:  we need to look at our web page and make one that 's  
A:  And  and you also need to look at your web page and clean it up by mid - July .  
E:  that 's p 
G:  Right . 
E:  PDA - free . Yeah . 
A:  Um , 
D:  Right .  
A:  let 's see . Choo - choo - choo .  
G:  Mailing lists . 
A:  We  Mailing list ? Uh , you need to put together a mailing list .  
D:  Three of them . <laugh> Well  <laugh> I mean , 
A:  Uh , I think w <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  uh , 
A:  OK . Related to  to the conversation with Picheny , I need to email him , 
A:  uh , my shipping address and you need to email them something which you already did . 
H:  <mouth> I did . I  I m emailed them the Transcriber URL , 
H:  um , the on - line , uh , data that Adam set up ,  
H:  The URL so they can click on an utterance and hear it .  
H:  and I emailed them the str streamlined conventions which you got a copy of today . 
D:  <mouth> Right . And I was gonna m email them the  which I haven't yet , a pointer to  to the web pages that we  that we currently have , cuz in particular they want to see the one with the  the way the recording room is set up 
H:  Good . 
A:  <mouth> 
D:  and so on , your  your page on that .  
H:  Oh , excellent . Good . 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  And then p possibly  
H:  I C - I CC ' ed Morgan . I should have sent  I should have CC ' ed you as well . 
A:  <mouth> OK . 


A:  Um ,  
D:  mostly together .  
A:  uh , I need to email Adam or Jane ,  
A:  um , about getting the data .  Who should I email ? 
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  Uh , how quickly do you want it ? <audible closure> 
A:  Um .  
G:  My July is really very crowded . And so , uh  
E:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  How about if I just c Uh , Right now all I want  I personally only want text data . 
A:  I think the only thing Jeff would do anything with right now  
A:  But I 'm just speaking fr based on a conversation with him two weeks ago I had in Turkey .  But I think all he would want is the digits . 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  Um , but I 'll just speak for myself . I 'm interested in getting the language model data . 
A:  Eh , so I 'm just interested in getting transcriptions . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  OK . So y 
A:  So then just email you ? 
H:  Sure , sure , sure . 
A:  OK . 
D:  <inbreath> Wh - 
H:  You could email to both of us , uh , just  I mean , if you wanted to . I mean , I don't think 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  either of us would mind recei but  but in any case I 'd be happy to send you the  
A:  OK . 
D:  i 
G:  That 's right . <audible closure> 
A:  And your email is ? 
D:  i 
H:  Edwards at 
H:  ICSI . 
D:  <inbreath> w 
A:  OK . 
G:  Dot Berkeley dot EDU , of course . 
D:  In  in our phone call , uh , before , we  we , uh  It turns out the way we 're gonna send the data is by , uh , CD - ROMs. 
A:  And then  
C:  <mike noise> 
D:  And , uh  


D:  and then what they 're gonna do is take the CD - ROM and transfer it to analog tape and <breath> give it to a transcription service , uh , that will  Yeah . 
G:  Oh , is this IBM ? 
H:  Yeah , using foot pedals and  
D:  Yeah , foot  foot pedals and  
H:  <laugh> 
A:  <mouth> <clears throat> 
G:  Uh , so do they  How are they gonna do the multi - channel ? 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  See , that 's a good question . <mouth> 
H:  Yeah . They  they don't have a way . 
G:  I thought so . 
D:  <inbreath> No , I mean , it 'll be 
H:  But they have a verification . 
G:  Mix ? 
D:  probably about like you did , and then there will be some things  you know , many things that don't work out well . 
C:  <breath> 
D:  And that 'll go back to IBM and they 'll  
D:  they 'll , uh  they run their aligner on it and it kicks out things that don't work well , which  you know , the overlaps will certainly 
D:  be examples of that . And , uh  
D:  <vocal squeak> 
D:  <click> I mean , what w we will give them all of it . Right ? We 'll give them all the  the multi - channel stuff and  
G:  OK . That 's , uh , my question . So we 'll give them all sixteen channels and they 'll do whatever they want with it . <audible closure> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  But you also should probably give them the mixed  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  You know , equal sound - level  
D:  <mouth> 
D:  Good idea . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  I mean , they 're not gonna easily be able to do that , probably . 
A:  <mouth> 
G:  It 's not hard .  
D:  <inbreath> Well   
B:  Ah , yeah .  
G:  So . 
D:  <mouth> It 's also won't be adding much to the data to give them the mixed . 
F:  But w 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  <mike noise> 
F:  It 's not  Right . It doesn't  it isn't difficult for us to do , so we might as well just do it . 
G:  Yep . Absolutely . 
B:  I 
A:  Right . <audible closure> 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  i You should  
G:  Absolutely . So , sure . 
B:  Yeah . You should  that may be all that they want to send off to their  transcribers . <breath> 


G:  Not an immediate action item but something we do have to worry about is data formats for  for higher - level information . 
F:  <mike noise> 
A:  OK . 
F:  <mike noise> 
D:  Oh , yeah . We were gonna  
G:  Well , or d or not even higher level , different level , prosody and all that sort of stuff . We 're gonna 
G:  have to figure out how we 're gonna annotate that . 
H:  <mouth> 
D:  Yeah , we w 
A:  <mouth> Yeah . We never had our data format discussion . 
H:  <mouth> Oh , I thought we did . We discussed , uh , musi 
D:  Right . 
B:  <breath> 
H:  musical score notation and  
G:  But that 's not  That 's display . That 's different than format . 
A:  Oh , OK . 
H:  and its XML  
A:  That 's  
G:  <audible closure> 
H:  Well , um  
A:  <inbreath> W My  my u feeling right now on format is you guys have been doing all the work and whatever you want , we 're happy to live with . Um , 
E:  <mouth> Well  uh , yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  OK , excellent . 
D:  OK . So , what n 
A:  other people may not agree with that , but  Cuz I 'm not actually touching the data , so I shouldn't be the one to talk . But  
D:  important thing  
H:  Well , it c 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  Right . 
C:  <laugh> <inbreath>  
C:  No , I think that 's fine . 
D:  So a key thing will be that you  we tell you 
H:  Great . 
G:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> what it is . 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
F:  " Here 's a mysterious file and  "  
D:  Uh , we also had  
E:  Yeah . 
H:  <laugh> 


D:  We also had the , uh , uh  that we were s uh , that you were gonna get us the eight - hundred number and we 're all gonna  
A:  Oh , yeah . 
D:  we 're gonna call up your Communicator thing and  and we 're gonna be 
C:  <clears throat> 
F:  <loud outbreath>  <mike noise> 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  good slash bad , depending on how you define it , uh , users . <laugh> 
F:  <light clunk, as of object touching mike or object put on table> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  <mike noise> 
C:  Now , something that I mentioned earlier to Mari and Liz is that it 's probably important to get as many non - technical and non - speech people as possible 
C:  in order to get some realistic users . So if you could ask other people to call 
F:  <mike noise> 
C:  and use our system , that 'd be good .  
C:  Cuz we don't want people who already know how to deal with dialogue systems , who know that 
H:  <mike noise> 
A:  Yeah . Or , <clears throat> like if you have a  
C:  <breath> you shouldn't hyper - articulate , for instance , and things like that . So .  
A:  Or , like if you have somebody who makes your  your plane reservations for you , 
H:  <interval of low-level mike noise> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  um , which is 
D:  Yeah , we can do that . 
A:  the n 
G:  Get my parents to do it . 
C:  Yeah , for instance . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . Seriously . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  Your grandmother . <laugh> 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  e You know , it could  result in some good bloopers , which is always good for presentations . 
A:  So   
A:  <laugh, ingressive> 
D:  Yeah . @ @ 
A:  Um , anyway  
G:  I think my father would last through the second prompt before he hang  hung up . 
G:  <audible closure> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  My mother would have a very interesting conversation with it but it wouldn't have anything to do with the travel .  <laugh> 
A:  Mmm . 
G:  He would never use it . <audible closure> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 


A:  OK . <page turning> Um , other   
H:  <inbreath> 
D:  OK . 
A:  Let 's see , other action items . So I have the  
D:  We talked about that we 're getting the recording equipment running at UW . And so it depends , 
D:  w e e e 
D:  they 're  you know , they 're p m 
D:  If that comes together within the next month , there at least will be , uh , uh , 
D:  major communications between Dan and <breath> UW folks as to  
E:  <mouth> Yeah . I mean , 
A:  I 'm  I 'm shooting to try to get it done  
E:  we should talk about it , but  
A:  get it put together by  the beginning of August . So , um , 
H:  Mmm .  
D:  But we have  it  it 's  it 's pretty  We don't know . I mean , he  he s uh , he said that it was sitting in some room collecting dust and  and so we don't know , 
A:  you know , if 
A:  We don't know .  
B:  <mike noise> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  i e 
A:  i It 's probably unlikely that we 'll pull this off , but a at least it 's worth trying . 
G:  Mm - hmm . What is it ? 
D:  We don't know . 
G:  Oh , OK . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> " Recording equipment . "  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
G:  It 's a tape recorder .  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  W We know it 's eight channels . Uh , we know it 's digital . 
G:  It 's eight tape recorders . 
D:  We don't even know if there 're microphones . So , 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <mike noise> 
D:  we 'll find out . 


A:  OK . Um , and I will email 
A:  these notes  
A:  Um , I 'm not sure what to do about action items for the data stuff , 
A:  although , then somebody  I guess somebody needs to tell Landay that you want the pads . 
D:  Yeah , OK . I 'll do that . 
A:  OK . 
D:  Um , and he also said something about outside  there  that came up about the outside text sources , that he  he may have 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh ! 
D:  some text sources that are close enough to the sort of thing that we can 
C:  Hmm . 
D:  play with them for a language model . 
E:  <inbreath> Yeah , that was  uh , that was  What he was saying was this  he  this thing that , uh , Jason had been working on 
A:  <mouth> 
E:  finds web pages that are thematically related to what you 're talking about . Well , that 's the idea . 
E:  So that that  that would be a source of text which is  
E:  supposedly got the right vocabulary . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
E:  But it 's obviously very different material . It 's not spoken material , for instance , so  
D:  Yeah . But it 's p it might be  
A:  But  but that 's actually what I wanna do . That 's  that 's what I wanna work with , is  is 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  things that s the wrong material but the right 
G:  <breath> Yeah . 
A:  da the right source . 
E:  Yeah . 
G:  Un - unfortunately Landay told me that Jason is 
A:  Yeah . 
G:  not gonna be working on that anymore .  He 's switching to 
A:  Yeah . He seemed  when I asked him if he could actually supply data , he seemed a little bit more reluctant . 
G:  other stuff again . 
A:  So , I 'll  I 'll send him email . I 'll put it in an action item that I send him email about it . And if I get something , great . If I don't get something  
C:  <clears throat> 
G:  Who ? Landay or Jason ? 
A:  Landay . 
G:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
A:  And , uh , um , 


A:  you know , otherwise , if you guys have any papers 
A:  or  
A:  I could  I could use , uh  I could use your web pages .  That 's what we could do . 
A:  You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor - 
D:  <laugh> Yeah , why search for them ? They 're  we know where they are . Yeah , that 's true . 
G:  True . 
A:  Yeah ! 
G:  Absolutely . 
E:  Sure . 
A:  Oh , forget this ! 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  Well , but that 's not very much . 
A:  I  One less action item . <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <mike noise> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  I can use what web pages there are out there on meeting recorders . 
G:  Yep . 
G:  <audible closure> 
G:  <inbreath> I mean , that  that 's  Yeah . Basically what his software does is h it picks out keywords and does a Google - like 
E:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
G:  search . So you could  
D:  Yeah . So we can  we can  we can do better than that . Yeah . 
E:  We can do that . 
E:  Yeah .  
G:  Yeah . 
D:  There 's  there 's some , uh , Carnegie Mellon stuff , right ? On  on meeting recording ,  and  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Yep . <audible closure> 
B:  And Xerox . 
A:  So , there 's  there 's ICSI , Xerox , 
D:  And Xerox . Yeah . 
B:  And there 's  You should l look under , like , intelligent environments , smart rooms , 
G:  Um , the " Georgia Tech Classroom Two Thousand " is a good one . 
B:  um  
A:  CMU ,  
B:  Right . And then  Right . J There 's  
B:  th 
B:  That 's where I thought you would want to eventually be able to have a board or a camera , because of all these classroom  
G:  <inbreath> Well , Georgia Tech did a very elaborate instrumented room . And I want to try to stay away from that . So  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <long inbreath> 
B:  <forceful outbreath> Yeah .  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Great . That solves that problem . One less action item . 


A:  <inbreath> Um  
A:  OK . I think that 's good enou that 's  that 's pretty much all I can think of . 
H:  <mouth> 
H:  Can I ask , uh , one thing ? It relates to data  data collection and I  and I 'd  and we mentioned earlier today , this question of  
E:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  <mike noise> 
H:  um , so , 
H:  <swish sound> 
G:  <mike noise> 
H:  um , I s I know that from  with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , 
G:  <mike noise> 
H:  uh , are lessened . 
H:  But I wonder if  
F:  <mike noise> 
H:  Uh , is that sufficient or should we consider 
F:  <mike noise> 
H:  maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , um , 
H:  u w we would c uh , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ? So either by rules of participation , or whatever . 
A:  <inbreath> <mouth> Oh , yeah . 
A:  <pages turning> 
H:  Now , I mean , you know , it 's true , I mean , we were discussing this earlier ,  that 
H:  depending on the task  so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap . But , um , 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  Adam !  
H:  i i uh , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway . 
H:  But , um , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field 
H:  mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ? 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  @ @ turn off  
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  I don't think we should have rules of participation , but I think we should try 
A:  to  get a variety of meetings . That 's something that if we get the  the meeting stuff going at UW , 
H:  OK . 
A:  that I probably can do more than you guys , cuz you guys 
A:  are probably mostly going to get ICSI people here . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  But we can get anybody in EE , 
A:  uh , over  and  and possibly also some CS people , 
A:  uh , over at UW . So , I think that  
H:  OK . 
A:  that there 's a good chance we could get more variety . 
H:  Just want to be sure there 's enough data to  OK , good . 
B:  They 're still gonna overlap , but  
A:  Um , 
B:  Mark and others have said that there 's quite a lot of found data  from the discourse community that has this characteristic and also the political  
A:  <clears throat> 
B:  Y you know , anything that was televised for a third party 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  has the characteristic of not very much overlap . 
D:  <mouth> Wasn - but w I think we were saying before also that the natural language group here had less overlap . So it also depends on the style of the group of people . 
H:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  So . 
F:  <mike noise> 
A:  <inbreath> 
B:  <inbreath> Like the , um , dominance relations of the people in the meeting .  
A:  Right . 
H:  Mm - hmm . On the task , and the task . 
H:  It 's just  
G:  Mm - hmm . <laugh> 
H:  I just wanted to  uh , because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if  if they 're asked to . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
H:  Not  not entirely modify it , but lessen it if  if it 's desired . 
H:  <mike noise> 
H:  But if  if that 's sufficient data  I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed . 
A:  OK . So I 'm just writing here , 
A:  we 're not gonna try to specify rules of interaction but we 're gonna try to get more variety by 
H:  Time .  
A:  i using different  groups of people 
A:  and different sizes .  
H:  Fine . And I  you know , I  I know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree . I just wanted to be sure . 
A:  e e 
A:  Yeah .  
A:  And then the other thing might be , um , 
H:  <very long inbreath> 
H:  <very long outbreath> 
A:  uh , technical 
A:  versus administrative . 
A:  Cuz if I recorded some administrative meetings 
A:  then that may have less overlap , because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever . 
H:  Mm - hmm .  
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  <mouth> Well , I  just as  as  as a contributary  
H:  eh , so I  I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are 
H:  prevented from overlapping . They 'll just say , you know  you know , " wait till each person is finished before you say something " . 
H:  So it is possible to lessen if we wanted to . But  but these other factors are fine . I just wanted to raise the issue . 
A:  <inbreath> Well , the reason why I didn't want to is be why I personally didn't want to  is because I wanted it to be  as , 
H:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  uh , 
A:  unintrusive as possi as you could be with these things hanging on you .  
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  <mouth> Oh , yeah . 
H:  Yeah , I think that 's always desired . I just want to be sure we don't  that we 're able to process , 
H:  i u 
H:  uh , you know , as much data as we can . 
H:  Yeah .  <mike noise> 


D:  Yeah . <inbreath> Did they discuss any of that in the  the meeting they had with L Liberman ? What  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  What  what do they  
B:  And there was a big division , so 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Liberman and others  were interested in a lot of found data . So there 's lots of recordings that  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  They 're not close - talk mike , but  
B:  And  and there 's lots of television , you know , stuff on , um , 
B:  political debates and things like that , congre congressional hearings . 
B:  Boring stuff like that . 
B:  Um , 
B:  and then the CMU folks and I were sort of on the other side in  cuz they had collected a lot of 
B:  meetings that were sort of like this and said that those are nothing like these meetings . 
B:  Um , so there 're really two different kinds of data . And , I guess we just left it as  
D:  <inbreath> 
B:  @ @  
B:  that  if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it , 
D:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  but newly collected data would  would be natural meetings . 
D:  <inbreath> Actually , th @ @  the CMU folk have collected a lot of data . Is that  is that going to be publicly available , or  ?  
B:  So . 
B:  As far as I know , they h have not . Um , but e 
D:  OK . 
G:  <mouth> It 's also  it 's not  
D:  <mouth> 
G:  it 's not near - far , right ? 
G:  <audible closure> 
B:  I 'm not sure .  Um , 
B:  if people were interested they could talk to them ,  but I  I got the feeling there was some politics involved . 
G:  I think @ @ gonna add that to one of my action items . <cough> 
B:  No . 
D:  Just to check . Yeah . W we should know what 's out there certainly . Yeah . 
B:  I  I don't know . 
G:  Yeah . 
B:  <breath> I mean , the  
G:  Cuz I had thought they 'd only done far - field , 
B:  I think you need to talk to Waibel and  
G:  intelligent - room sorts of things . I hadn't known that then  they 'd done any more than that . 
E:  Oh , really ? It 's those guys . 
D:  <inbreath of surprise> Oh , they only did the far - field ? I see . 
G:  <audible closure> 
G:  Yeah . 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  But they had multiple mikes and they did do recognition , and they did do real conversations . 
B:  But as far as I know they didn't offer that data to the community at this meeting . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  But that could change cuz Mark  
B:  you know , Mark 's really into this . We should keep in touch with him . 
D:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah , I think  


D:  Well , once we send out  
H:  <laugh> 
D:  I mean , we still haven't sent out the first note saying " hey , this list exists " . But  but , uh , once we do that  
A:  Is that an action item ? 
D:  Yeah . It 's on  I already added that one on my board to do that .  So , uh  <outbreath> 
G:  <laugh> 
D:  uh , 
D:  hopefully everybody here is on that list . We should at least check that everybody here  ?  
G:  I think everyone here is on the list . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <mouth> I 'm not . 
H:  u e e 
G:  I think you are . 
D:  We haven't sent anything to the list yet . <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  <mike noise> 
F:  Oh ! OK . 
H:  Yeah . 
D:  We 're just compiling the list . 
G:  <mouth> I  I added a few people who didn't  who I knew had to be on it even though they didn't tell me .  
F:  I see . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm - hmm . <breath-laugh> 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  Who specifically ask not to be . 
G:  Like Jane , for example . 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  You are on it , aren't you ?  
H:  <mike noise> Yeah , I am . 
D:  Yeah . 


H:  <inbreath> So , I w uh , just  just for clarification . So " found data " , they mean like established corpora of linguistics and  and other fields , right ? 
H:  It sounds like such a t <laugh> 
B:  What they mean is stuff they don't have to fund to collect , and especially good  
G:  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah , OK . <laugh> 
B:  Well , I mean , " found " has , uh , also the meaning that 's it very natural . It 's things occur without any  
H:  <laugh> 
B:  You know , the pe these people weren't wearing close - talking mikes , 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  but they were recorded anyway , like the congressional hearings and , you know , for legal purposes or whatever . 
H:  OK . 
H:  But it includes like standard corpora that have been used for years in linguistics and  other fields . 
C:  <mike noise> 
E:  " Hey , look what we found ! "  
B:  Mark 's aware of those , too . That would be found data because they found it <laugh> and it exists . They didn't have to collect it . 
H:  OK . <laugh> Exactly . 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  Hmm . 
E:  " I found this great corpora . "  Yeah .  
G:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
G:  " Psst .  Want to buy a corpora ? "  
B:  Of course it 's not " found " in the sense that at the time it was collected for the purpose . But what he means is that  
E:  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . OK , OK . That 's interesting . 
B:  You know , Mark was really a fan 
B:  of getting as much data as possible from  you know , reams and reams of stuff , of broadcast stuff , web stuff , TV stuff , radio stuff . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  But he well understands that that 's very different than these  this type of meeting . But , 
G:  It 's not the same . 
B:  so what ? It 's still  it 's interesting for other reasons . 
H:  OK . 
H:  Yeah . Just wanted to know . 


D:  So , seems like we 're winding down . Right ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Many  ways .  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  So we should go  go around and s 
B:  You can  tell  by the  prosody .  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah .  
G:  <laugh> 
C:  <breath-laugh> 


E:  We should go around and say something interesting that happened at the meeting ? 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh . Yes , we should do that . 
B:  <mike noise> 
B:  Rrrh !  
G:  <mouth> Now , I was already thinking about it , so  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  <mock groan> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh ! Good man . 
B:  This is painful task . I  
C:  Hmm . 
G:  <laugh> 
G:  So , um , 
G:  I really liked the idea of  what I thought was interesting was the combination of the CrossPad and the speech . Especially , 
G:  um , the interaction of them rather than just note - taking . 
G:  So , can you  determine the interesting points by who 's writing ? 
G:  Can you do special gestures and so on that  that have , 
G:  uh , special meaning to the corpora ? I really liked that . 
H:  <mouth> Well , I  I just realized there 's another category of interesting things which is that , um , 
H:  I  I found this discussion very , uh , i this  this question of how you get at queries really interesting . And  
H:  and the  and I  and the fact that it 's sort of , 
H:  uh , nebulous , what  what that  what kind of query it would be because it depends on what your purpose is . So I actually 
H:  found that whole process of  
H:  of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting . But 
H:  that 's not really a specific fact . <laugh> I just sort of thought we  we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there , which I thought 
B:  <mike noise> 
H:  was worthwhile . 
E:  I had a real revelation about taking pictures . I don't know why I didn't do this before and I regret it . So that was very interesting for me . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh>  
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  Did you take pictures of the boards ? 
E:  <mouth> Not that I  
H:  Yeah . 
E:  The boards aren't really related to this meeting . I mean , I will take pictures of them , but  
H:  That 's a good point . Yeah . 
A:  They 're related to this morning 's meeting . 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  But  
G:  To the pre previous meeting . That 's right . 
E:  OK . Well , that 's why I 'll take pictures of them , then . 
G:  <laugh> 
F:  I 'm gonna pass because I can't  I mean , of the  Jane took my answer .  
G:  <inbreath> Ah ! 
H:  <mouth> Oh . 
F:  So . Um , 
F:  so I 'm gonna pass for the moment but y come  come back to me . 
E:  <laugh> For the moment . 
B:  Pass . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  I think  I think " pass " is socially acceptable . But I will say  uh , I will actually  
A:  uh , a spin on different  slightly different spin on what you said , this issue of , uh , realizing that we could take 
H:  <mike noise> 
A:  minutes , and that actually may be a goal . So that  that may be kind of the test  in a sense , test data , 
A:  uh , the  the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary . So that 's an interesting new twist on what we can do with this data . 
C:  <mouth> I agree with Jane and Eric . I think the question of how to generate queries automatically was the most interesting question that came up , and 
C:  it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself , so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it because we don't have funding on it , 
C:  uh , in this project . But , um , 
C:  <mouth> it 's definitely something I would  want to do something on . 
G:  I wonder if work 's already been done on it . 
H:  Like e expert systems and stuff , or  ?  
D:  Hmm . 
H:  Uh - huh .  
G:  <breath-laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  Well , being more management lately than  <breath-laugh> than research , I think the thing that impressed me most was the people dynamics <inbreath> 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  and not any of the facts . That is , I  I really enjoyed 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  hanging out with this group of people today . <laugh> So that 's what really impressed me . 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
E:  How are we gonna find that in the data ?  <laugh> 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  <inbreath> Well , if we had people wearing the wireless mikes all the time  
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Oh , yeah . 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  Yeah , I think  
F:  Well , I mean , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot . Right ? So . 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  Right . 
D:  <mouth> Yeah . I 'd probably search for something like that . 
E:  How happy were they ? 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh, hiss-type> 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  <mouth> That actually has come up a couple times in queries . I was talking to Landay and that was one of his examples . When  when did people laugh ? 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
E:  That 's great . 
D:  <mouth> Find me a funny thing that Jeff said . Yeah . <laugh> 
G:  So we need a laugh detector . 
E:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah .  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Perfect . 
G:  Cuz that seems to be pretty common . 
D:  <long inbreath> 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  Not in the congressional hearings . 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  No . <laugh, outbreath-type> 
G:  <inbreath> Quiet sobbing . <laugh> 
A:  <breath-laugh> 


D:  So I think we 're done . 
E:  OK . Great . 
A:  OK . 
G:  I think we 're done . 
H:  <mike noise> 
F:  OK . 
H:  @ @ 
A:  Great . 
F:  <mike noise> 
D:  Great . 
H:  <mike noise> <mouth> h Do we need  do I need to turn something off here , or I do unplug this , or  ?   
E:  <mike noise>  
C:  <mike noise> 
G:  <mike noise> 
B:   
A:   
E:  No . Just  just leave it . 
H:  <mike noise> 
D:  Now these we turn off . 
C:  <mike noise> 
D:  Right ? 
H:  <mike noise> 
D:   
G:  Now they even have working L E Ds . 
H:  Oh ! Hey , that 's cool . 
D:  Do they ? 
G:  Yeah . Absolutely . 
B:  Huh . 
C:  <clunk> Very nice . 
H:  That 'd be nice . OK . 
E:  @ @ knows . 
G:  You don't think John  uh , Jim would make 
B:  They 're using my  
G:  a box that didn't have a 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  flashing light on it , do you ?
