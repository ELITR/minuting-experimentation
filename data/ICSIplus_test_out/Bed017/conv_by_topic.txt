B:  <outbreath> 
A:  Why ? 
E:  I 'm known . I  
D:  Um . 
A:  No , cuz she already told me it , before she told you . 
B:  <outbreath> 
E:  No , she told me a long time ago . She told me  she told me like two weeks ago . 
A:  Oh , well , it doesn't matter what time . 
B:  OK . <outbreath> 
B:  @ @ You know how to toggle the display width  function  
D:  Wow . 
A:  Well maybe she hadn't just started transcribing me yet . 
C:  <outbreath> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  Anyway . 
D:  What is it ? 
E:  Let me explain something to you . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Um , 
E:  My laugh is better than yours . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  there .  
B:  Yo .  
A:  I beg to differ . 
D:  Um , OK . 
A:  But you have to say something genuinely funny before you 'll get an example . <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  The thing is I don't know how to get to the next page . Here . 
E:  No . 
E:  @ @ You should be  at least be self - satisfied enough to laugh at your own jokes . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Actually I thought  
D:  There . 
A:  No , it 's a different laugh . 
D:  How weird . 
A:  Ooh , wow ! 
E:  Oh ! Holy mackerel . 
A:  Wow . Whoa ! <laugh> 
D:  What ? !  
D:  Oh .  
D:  OK . I 
C:  <mike noise>  
D:  wasn't even doing anything . <laugh> OK . 
A:  Uh .  
E:  Eva 's got a laptop , she 's trying to show it off . 
D:  That was r actually Robert 's idea . But anyhow . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Um 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <outbreath> 
B:  <mouth> 


F:  O K . So , here we are . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Once again . 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  Once again , right , together . 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Um , so we haven't had a meeting for a while , and  and 
F:  probably won't have one next week , I think a number of people are gone . 
F:  Um , so Robert , why don't you bring us up to date on 
F:  where we are with EDU ? 
B:  Um , <outbreath> 
B:  Um , <outbreath> 
B:  the uh , <outbreath> 
B:  uh I don't think we need to discuss the formalism that 'll be done officially s once we 're done . 
B:  Um , <outbreath> 
B:  something happened , in  on Eva 's side with the PRM that we 're gonna 
B:  look at today , and um , 
B:  we have a visitor from Bruchsal from the International University . Andreas , I think you 've met everyone except Nancy . 
E:  <mike noise> 
B:  So my scientific director of the EML is also the dean of the International University , 
B:  one of his many occupations that 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  just contributes to the fact that he is very occupied . 
B:  And , um , 
B:  the  
B:  um , he @ @ might tell us a little bit about what he 's actually doing , and 
A:  <mike noise> 
B:  why it is s somewhat related , and  by uh using maybe some of the same technologies that we are using . 
B:  And um . Was that enough of an update ? 
F:  I think so . 


B:  <mouth> uh in a  in a smaller group we had uh , talked and decided about continuation of the data collection . 
D:  <mike noise> 
B:  So Fey 's time with us is almost officially over , 
B:  and she brought us some thirty subjects and , t collected the data , and 
D:  <mike noise> 
B:  ten dialogues have been transcribed and can be looked at . If you 're interested in 
B:  that , talk to me . 
B:  Um , and we found another uh , cogsci student who 's interested in playing wizard for us . 
B:  Here we 're gonna make it a little bit more 
B:  complicated for the subjects , uh this round . 
E:  <mike noise> 
B:  She 's actually suggested to 
B:  look um , at the psychology department students , because they have to partake in two experiments in order to 
B:  fulfill some requirements . 
B:  So they have to be subjected , <breath-laugh>  before they can actually graduate . 
E:  <mike noise> 
A:  <cough> 
B:  And um , 
B:  we want to design it so that they really have to think about having some time , 
B:  two days , for example , 
C:  <outbreath> 
A:  <sniff> 
B:  to plan certain things and figure out which can be done at what time , and , 
B:  um , 
B:  sort of package the whole thing in a  in a re in a few more complicated 
B:  um , structure . 


B:  That 's for the data collection . As for SmartKom , I 'm  the last SmartKom meeting I mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis , which 
B:  as of this morning should be resolved . 
F:  Good . 
B:  And , so , 
B:  " should be " means they aren't yet , but  but I think I have the info now that I need . 
B:  Plus , Johno and I are meeting tomorrow , so 
A:  <clears throat> 
B:  maybe uh uh , when tomorrow is over , 
B:  we 're done . <outbreath> And ha n hav we 'll never have to look at it again 
B:  Maybe it 'll take some more time , 
B:  to be realistic , but at least we 're  
B:  we 're seeing the end of the tunnel there . <outbreath> 
B:  That was that . 


C:  Yeah . <outbreath> Hi . <laugh> <overlapping mike noise> 
A:  Sorry . Hi . Hi . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Hi . Hi . 
B:  And , um , <outbreath> 
A:  So when you said " Andreas " I thought you were talking about Stolcke . 
A:  Now I know that we aren't , OK . 
B:  <mouth> Andy , you actually go by Andy , right ? Oh , OK . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Eh  <outbreath> 
C:  Cuz there is another Andreas around , so , to avoid some confusion . <laugh> 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  That will be  Reuter ?  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh , OK . 


F:  So that was pretty quick . She 's ac uh uh Eva 's got a little write - up on it that 
F:  uh , probably gives the  the details to anybody who needs them . Um , 
F:  <mouth> so 
F:  the  
F:  You  you didn't look at all yet to see if there 's anybody has a implementation . 
D:  No , not yet , um  <outbreath> 
B:  OK . 
B:  <outbreath> 
B:  OK . 


B:  In what order shall we proceed ? 
B:  Maybe you have your on - line  
D:  OK . 
D:  Uh , 
D:  yeah , sure . 
D:  Um , so , I 've be just been looking at , um , 
A:  <clears throat> 
D:  Ack !   
D:  What are you doing ?   
D:  Yeah .   
D:  OK . Um , 
B:  <loud outbreath> 
D:  Um , so anyhow , using those intermediate nodes then , 
D:  this  this would be the class that 
D:  represent the intermediate nodes . 
D:  And that would  basically it 's just another class in the model , 
D:  with , you know , references to the user and the site and 
D:  the time . 
D:  And then , after you group them together this  
D:  no the dependencies would  
D:  of the queries would be 
D:  reduced to this . And so , you know , it 's easier to specify the CPT and all . 
D:  Um , so I think that 's about as far as I 've gone 
D:  on the PRM stuff . 
F:  Well  
D:  Right . 
F:  No .  
D:  So . <lateral tongue click>  
D:  Anything else I missed ? 
E:  <laugh> 


D:  I 've been looking at the PRM stuff . Um , 
D:  so , this is , sort of like the latest 
D:  thing I have on it , and 
D:  I sorta constructed a couple of classes . Like , a user class , a site class , and  
D:  and you know , a time , a route , and then  and a query class . 
D:  And I 
D:  tried to simplify it down a little bit , so that I can actually 
D:  um , look at it more . It 's the same paper that 
D:  I gave to Jerry last time . Um , 
D:  so basically I took out a lot of stuff , a lot of the decision nodes , 
D:  and then 
D:  tried to  The red lines on the , 
D:  um , graph are the um , 
D:  relations between the different 
D:  um , 
D:  classes . Like , a user 
D:  has like , a query , 
D:  and then , also has , you know 
D:  um , reference slots to its preferences , um , the special needs and , you know , money , and 
D:  the user interest . 
D:  And so <outbreath> 
D:  this is more or less similar to the flat Bayes - net that I have , you know , with 
D:  the input nodes and all that . 
D:  And  
D:  So I tried to construct the dependency models , and 
D:  a lot of these stuff I got from the flat Bayes - net , and what they depend on , 
D:  and it turns out , you know , the CPT 's are really big , if I do that , so I tried to see 
D:  how I can do , um  put in the computational nodes in between . 
D:  And what that would 
D:  look like in a PRM . 
D:  And so I ended up 
D:  making several classes  
D:  Actually , you know , a class of  with different attributes that 
D:  are the intermediate nodes , and one of them is like , time affordability 
D:  money affordability , site availability , and 
D:  the travel compatibility . 


D:  And so some of these classes are  
D:  s some of these attributes only depend on stuff from , say , the user , or s f just from , I don't know , like the site . 
D:  S like , 
D:  um , these here , it 's only like , 
D:  user , but , if you look at travel compatibility 
D:  for each of these factors , 
D:  you need to look at a pair of , you know , what the 
D:  um , preference of the user is 
D:  versus , you know , what type of an event it is , or 
D:  you know , 
D:  which form of transportation the user has 
D:  and whether , you know , the onsite parking matters to the user , in that case . 
D:  And 
D:  that makes the scenario a little different in a PRM , because , um , 
D:  then you have one - user objects and potentially you can have many different sites 
D:  in  in mind . 
D:  And so 
D:  for each of the site you 'll come up with this 
D:  rating , of travel compatibility . 
D:  And , they all depend on the same users , but different sites , and that makes a  
D:  I 'm tr I w I wa have been trying to see 
D:  whether the PRM would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that . 
D:  And so , 
D:  I guess you end up having 
D:  fewer number of nodes than in a flat Bayes - net , cuz otherwise you would  
D:  c well , 
D:  it 's probably the same . But um , 
D:  No , you would definitely have  
D:  be able to 
D:  re - use , like , <outbreath> um , 
D:  all the user stuff , and not  
D:  not having to recompute a lot of the stuff , because it 's all from the user side . So if you changed sites , you  
D:  you can , you know , save some work on that . 
D:  But , 
D:  you know , in the case where , it depends on both the user and the site , then 
D:  I 'm still having a hard time trying to see how 
D:  um , using the PRM will help . 


F:  So y you didn't yet tell us what the output is . 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  The output . 
F:  So what decisions does this make ? 
D:  OK . So it only makes two decisions , in this model . 
C:  <outbreath> 
D:  And one is 
D:  basically how desirable a site is 
D:  meaning , um , 
D:  how good it matches the needs of a user . And the other is the mode 
D:  of the visit , whether th It 's the EVA decision .  
A:  <clears throat> <sniff> 
D:  Um , 
D:  so , instead of um , 
D:  <mouth> doing a lot of , you know , 
D:  computation about , you know , which one site it wants of  the user wants to visit , I 'll come  
D:  well , try to come up with like , sort of a list of sites . 
D:  And for each site , you know , where  h how  how well it fits , and basically a rating of how well it fits and 
D:  what to do with it . 


F:  OK . So one  so one of the questions , you know , about these P R Ms is 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  uh , we aren't gonna build our own 
F:  interpreter , so if  if we can't find one , then we uh , go off and do something else and wait until s one appears . 
F:  Uh , so one of the things that Eva 's gonna do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down . 
F:  Uh , 
F:  the people at Stanford write papers as if they had one , 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  but , 
F:  um , we 'll see . So w Anyway . So that 's 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  <sniff> 
F:  a  a major open issue . 
F:  If there is 
F:  an interpreter , it looks like 
F:  you know , what Eva 's got should run and we should be able to actually 
F:  um , try to solve , you know , the problems , to actually take the data , and do it . 


F:  Uh , and we 'll see . Uh , I actually think it is 
F:  cleaner , and the ability to instantiate , you know , instance of people and sites and stuff , um , 
F:  will help in the expression . Whether the inference gets any faster or not I don't know . Uh , it wouldn't surprise me if it  if it doesn't . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  You know , it 's the same kind of information . I think there are things that you can express 
F:  this way which you can't express in a normal belief - net , 
D:  <mike noise> <cough> <mike noise> 
F:  uh , without going to some incredible hacking of  sort of rebuilding it on the fly . I mean , the notion of instantiating 
F:  your el elements from 
D:  <mike noise> 
F:  the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very well into 
F:  the extended belief - net . So that was one of the main reasons for doing it . 
A:  <clears throat> 
F:  Um . 
F:  I don't know . So , uh , people who have thought about the problem , like Robert 
F:  i it looked to me like if  
F:  Eva were able to come up with 
F:  a <mouth> 
F:  you know , value for each of a number of uh , sites plus its EVA thing , 
F:  that a travel planner should be able to take it from there . 
F:  And  
F:  you know , with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever ,  
F:  and then plan a route . 
B:  <outbreath> 
B:  Um - hmm , um , <outbreath> well , first of all uh , 
B:  uh , great looks , 
B:  mu much cleaner , nnn , nnn , 
B:  Certain  certain beauty in it , so , um , if beauty is truth , then , uh we 're in good shape . 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  But , 
B:  the um , 
B:  as , uh , mentioned before we probably should look at t the details . So if you have a write - up then uh , I 'd love to read it and uh  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  because , um , i Can you go all the way back to the  the very top ? 
C:  <outbreath> 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So , uh , the  the plan is  is when Daphne gets back , 
F:  we 'll get in touch and supposedly , 
F:  um , 
F:  we 'll actually 
F:  get s deep  seriously connected to  to their work and 
B:  Yep . 
F:  somebody 'll  Uh , you know  If it 's a 
F:  group meeting once a week probably someone 'll go down and , whatever . 
F:  So , we 'll actually figure all this out . 


B:  Um , <outbreath> uh these  @ @  these  w w when these are instantiated they take on the same values ? that we had before ? or are they  
D:  I can't really see the whole thing .  <outbreath> 
B:  have they changed , 
B:  in a sense ? 
D:  Well I think I basically leave them to similar things . 
B:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Some of the things might  
D:  that might be different , maybe like  
D:  are that the hours for the site . 
B:  <clears throat> Hmm . 
D:  And , 
D:  eventually I meant that to mean whether they 're open at this hour or not . 
D:  And status would be , you know , more or less like , whether they 're under construction , and  and  or 
B:  Uh - huh . <outbreath> 


B:  And the , uh , 
D:  stuff like that . 
B:  other question I would have is that presumably , from the way the Stanford people talk about it , 
B:  you can put 
B:  the probabilities also on the relations . 
B:  If  
D:  Which is the structural uncertainty ? 
A:  <clears throat> 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , I  that 's  
F:  That I think was actually in the previous  
F:  the Ubenth stuff . I don't remember whether they carried that over to this or not , 
A:  Mmm . 
F:  uh , structural uncertainty . 
B:  It 's sort of in the definition or  in the  in Daphne 's definition of a PRM is that 
F:  OK . 
B:  classes and relations , and you 're gonna have CPT 's over the classes and their relations . 
F:  Alright . 
B:  More uncertainty , or  or  
F:  Uh , 
D:  I remember them learning when , you know , you don't know the structure for sure , but I don't remember reading how you specify 
B:  I should say . 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , that would be exactly my question . Well  
F:  Right . 
D:  wh to start with . Yeah . Yeah . 


B:  Then 
B:  I think the w <clears throat> long term perspective is  is pretty clear . 
B:  We get 
B:  rocking and rolling on this again , once we get a package , if , when , and how , then 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  this becomes 
B:  foregrounded 
B:  profiled , focused , again . 
E:  <outbreath> 
E:  Designated ? 
A:  <laugh> Of course . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  And um , 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <outbreath> 
B:  until then we 'll come up with a something that 's  @ @  
B:  that 's way more complicated for you . 
B:  Right ? <laugh> 
D:  OK . 
B:  Because this was laughingly easy , right ? 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Actually I had to 
D:  take out a lot of the complicated stuff , cuz I  I made it really complicated in the beginning , and 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Jerry was like , <laugh> " this is just too much " . 
F:  <inbreath> Anyway . 
A:  Mmm . 
F:  So . So there i there are some  some u uh , you know , 
F:  uh , elaborations of this 
F:  that 
F:  you could try to put in 
F:  to this structure , but I don't think it 's worth it now . 
F:  Because we 're gonna see what  what else uh  
F:  what else we 're gonna do . 
F:  Anyway . But uh , 
F:  it 's good , yeah and  and 
F:  there were a couple other ideas of  of 
F:  uh , things for Eva to look at 
F:  in  in the interim . 


F:  Yeah . So , um , 
F:  you could , 
F:  from this , go on and say suppose there 's a group of people traveling together 
C:  <outbreath> 
F:  and you wanted to plan something that somehow , 
F:  with some Pareto optimal 
A:  <laugh> That 's good . <laugh> 
F:  uh , <laugh> uh , thing for  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  That 's definitely a job for artificial intelligence . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  uh , or  
B:  Well that 's not  not even something humans  yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Except for humans can't really solve it either , so . 
F:  Right . Right . Well that 's the  that would  that would be a  uh , you could sell it , as a  OK , eh you don't have to fight about this , just give your preferences to the  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  And then you can blame the computer . So . 
F:  w Exactly . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <sniff> 
B:  But what does it  uh  Would a pote potential result be to  to split up and never talk to each other again ? You know .  
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  That should be one of them . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . Right .  
E:  That 'd be nice . 


B:  <mouth> Good . Then , we can move on and 
B:  see what Andreas has got out his sleeve . 
B:  Or Andy , for that matter ? 
C:  OK . 
C:  So uh , uh , well , thanks for having me here , first of all . Um , so maybe just a  a little background on  on my visit . So , uh , I 'm not really involved in any project , that 's uh  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  that 's relevant to you uh , a at the moment , uh , the  the reason is really for me 
A:  <clears throat> 
C:  uh , to have an opportunity to talk to some other researchers in the field . And  and so I 'll just n sort of give you a real quick introduction to what I 'm working on , and 
C:  um , I just hope that you have some comments or , maybe you 're interested in it to find out more , and  and so I 'll be uh , happy to talk to you and  and uh , I 'd also like to find out some more and  and maybe I 'll just walk around the office and 
C:  and then  and ask some  some questions , uh , in a couple days . So I 'll be here for uh , tomorrow and then uh , the remainder of uh , next week . 
C:  OK . 
A:  <clears throat> 
A:  So , you 're not  
A:  I guess I 'm trying to figure out how  how it maps to the kinds of things 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  that we 've talked about in this group , and , actually associated groups , cuz 
A:  some of us do pretty detailed linguistic analyses , and 
A:  I 'm guessing that you  you won't be doing that ? 
C:  No . 
A:  OK . Just checking . So , <laugh> OK . 
B:  <outbreath> Hmm . 
C:  No . <laugh> 
A:  So , you take the query , and  
A:  and  
F:  Right . Yeah . 
C:  Mmm . 
F:  Right . Anyway . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Right . So I thi tha that 's  that 's one of the things that might be worth looking into while you 're here . 
E:  <outbreath> 
C:  Mm - hmm . <outbreath> 
F:  Uh , unfortunately , 
F:  Srini , who is heavily involved in DAML and all this sort of stuff 
F:  is himself out of town . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Well I 'll go to the uh , Semantic Web Workshop , uh , 
F:  Right , and  
C:  in two weeks . 
A:  @ @ 
F:  Yeah , for  for some reason he 's not doing that . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  I don't know why he @ @  oh , I , who knows ? Anyway , s yeah , you 'll see  you 'll certainly see a lot of the people there . 
A:  Well , he had other things to do . 
A:  The uh  
C:  OK , great . 
A:  <cough> 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Well , if you fal solve the problem , <laugh> hope you can do one for us too . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> <mike noise> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  <clears throat> 
F:  Alright , was there anything else for this ? 


C:  OK , so , um , what I started looking at , uh , to begin with is just uh , content management systems uh , i i in general . So 
C:  um , uh what 's uh  Sort of the state of the art there is to um  uh you have a bunch of  of uh documents or learning units or learning objects , 
C:  um , and you store meta - data uh , associate to them . So there 's some international standards like the I - triple - E , uh  There 's an I - triple - E , LON standard , 
C:  and um , these fields are pretty straightforward , you have uh author information , you have uh , size information , format information and so on . 
C:  Now , what this uh  a standard like this would give us is we could um , sort of uh with a search engine just query uh , different repositories all over the world . But we can't really  


C:  Uh , but they 're two uh fields that are um , more interesting . One is uh you store keywords associated with the uh  with the document , and one is uh , you have sort of a , um , 
C:  well , what is the document about ? So it 's some sort of taxonomic 
C:  uh , ordering of  of the  of the units . Now , 
C:  if you sort of put on your 
C:  semantic glasses , 
C:  uh you say , well that 's not all that easy , because there 's an implicit um , uh , assumption behind that is that uh , all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of 
C:  uh , whichever taxonomy is used , and uh , 
A:  <clears throat> 
C:  I think that 's a  that 's a very  that 's a key point of these systems and they sort of always 
C:  brush over this real quickly without 
C:  really elaborating much of that and uh  As a matter of fact , the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes , which are very , very coarse grain , so you have some like , 
C:  science , biology , and then  But that 's really all that we have at the moment . So I think there 's a huge , 
C:  um , uh need for improvement there . 


C:  Um , so what I 'm  what I try to do is um , 
C:  to have um , uh  So . So the scenario is the following , you you 're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem . Now , 
C:  what  what we have at our university quite a bit is that uh , students um , try to u 
C:  program a certain assignment , for example , they always run into the same 
C:  problems , 
C:  uh , and they always come running to us , and they 'll say why 's it not  it 's not working , and we always give out the same answer , so we thought , well , it 'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this , and 
C:  so , what I want to build is basically a  a smart F A Q system . 
C:  Now , what you 
A:  <cough> 
C:  So these are some of the  just in a nutshell , some of the 
C:  ideas . And I think a lot of the  
C:  even though it 's a  it 's a very different domain , but I think a lot of the , um , issues are  are fairly similar . So . 


C:  uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information which is more elaborate than " I 'm looking for this and this and this keyword . " So . 
C:  And I think that I don't need to tell you this . I 'm  I 'm sure you have the same  when  when somebody utters a sentence in a certain , 
C:  uh , context it , and  and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference . So , 
C:  I want to be able to model information like , um , so in the  in the context of  in the context of developing distributed systems , of a at a computer science school , um , 
C:  what kind of software is the person using , which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment , 
C:  um , maybe what 's the background of that student 's um , which um , which error message was encountered . 
C:  So this sort of information I think should be transmitted , uh , when a certain document is retrieved . 
A:  <clears throat> 
C:  Now , 
C:  um , 
C:  basically giving this um  Uh so we somehow need to have a formalized um , way of writing this down basically , 
C:  and that 's where the shared interpretation of  of certain terms and keywords comes in again . 
C:  And , 
C:  using this and some  some uh , knowledge about the domain I think you can do some  some simple inferences . Like you know that when somebody 's working about  uh , working on  on servlets for example , he 's using Java , cuz servlets are used  
C:  are written in Java . So some  some inferences like that , now , 
C:  um , u using this you can infer more information , and you could then match this to the meta - data of um  off the documents you 're  you 're searching against . 
A:  <mike noise> 
C:  So , uh what I wanna do is basically have some sort of um  
C:  given these inputs , and then I can compute how many documents match , 
C:  and use this as a metric in the search . 
C:  Now , what I plan to do is I want to uh sort of do a uh  
C:  uh  try to improve the quality of the search results , and I want to do this by having a depth uh , um , um  steepest descent approach . 
C:  So if I knew which operating system the person was working on , would this improve my search result ? And  and having uh , uh a symbolic formalized model of this I could simply compute that , 
C:  and find out which um  
C:  which questions are worth um , asking . 
C:  And that 's what I then propagate back to the user , and  and sort of try to optimize the search in this way . 


C:  Now , the big 
C:  problem that I 'm facing right now is um , 
C:  it 's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly , that  that works in the small domain , but the problem is obviously the scalability . 
B:  <outbreath> 
C:  And uh uh , so Robert was mentioning uh , earlier today is that uh , Microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a Bayesian network , 
C:  which does exactly this , but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend . 
C:  And so , uh what I 'm  What I try to do is basically try to model this uh , in a way that you could really combine 
C:  uh , knowledge from very different sources , and  and um , sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community uh , came up with . 
C:  Trying to  to have uh , an approach how to integrate s uh certain uh  representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules , 
A:  <mike noise> 
C:  um , what you can do with those . 
C:  Um . 
C:  What I 'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure , so it 's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic 
A:  <mike noise> 
C:  uh , computational model . That  that probably isn't expressive enough . So . So that 's another thing , 
C:  um , which I think you 're also uh , uh looking into right now . 
C:  And then um , uh sort of as an add - on to this whole idea , um , uh that would be 
C:  now , depending on what the search engine or the content repository  depending on which  
C:  um , uh , which uh , rules and which ontologies it  it uses , or basically its view of the world , 
C:  uh you can get very different results . So it might ma make a lot of sense to actually query a lot of different search engines . 
C:  And there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a  a peer to peer approach , where 
C:  we 're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves , 
C:  and um , if you have a question about a homework , it 's  probably makes sense to ask somebody who 's in your class with you , sort of the guru in the certain area ,  
C:  rather than going to some Yahoo - like uh , search engine . 


A:  And so some of the  I don't know how much you know about the larger Heidelberg project , I  Are you  
C:  Uh I know , yeah I know abou about it . 
A:  So it seems like a lot of  some of the issues are 
A:  the same . It 's like , um , 
A:  you know , the c context - based factors that influence how you interpret , 
C:  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
A:  um , s 
A:  how to interpret . In  in this case , infer in in knowing  wanting to know what kinds of things to ask . We - we 've kind of talked about that , but we haven't 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  worried too much about that end of the discourse . But maybe you guys had that in the previous 
B:  <clears throat> 
B:  Well , in a  in one  t one s mmm , small difference in a  in a way , is that 
A:  models . 
B:  he doesn't have to come up with an answer , but he wants to point to the places w w 
A:  <cough> 
C:  Yeah , so . So I 'm  I 'm not  I 'm not building an expert  Uh , I want to build a smart librarian , basically that can point you to the right reference . I don't wanna compute the answer , 
A:  Documents that have the answers .  
A:  Mm - hmm . Right . 
A:  Right . 
C:  so it 's a little bit easier for me . 


B:  <outbreath> Well . Uh , you have to s still m 
B:  understand what the content says about itself , and then match it to 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  what you think the informational needs  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  So you also don't have to figure out what the content is . You 're just taking the keywords as a topic 
A:  text , as  
C:  I  I assume that  that the there will be learning systems that  that tag their  their content . 
A:  OK . 
C:  And um , um , 
A:  Right . 
C:  m @ @ and basically what I  what I envision is that you  rather than just supplying a bunch of keywords you could basically  for  for an FAQ for example you could state 
C:  sort of like a logic condition , when this document applies . So " this document 
C:  explains how to set up your uh , mail account on Linux " or 
A:  <mike noise> 
C:  something like this . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  So . So something  something very specific that you can then  


C:  But the  I think that the key point with these uh , learning systems is that uh , a learning system 
C:  is only as good as uh the amount of content it  it carries . You can have the best learning system with the best 
A:  Mmm , mm - hmm . 
C:  search interface , if there 's no content inside of it , 
C:  it 's not very useful . So I think ultimately because 
C:  um , uh developing these  these rules and these inference uh  inferences I think is very costly , so 
C:  um , uh I think you must be able to reuse some  
C:  some existing 
C:  um , domain  domain information , or  or  or ontologies that  that uh other people wrote and then try to integrate them , and then also search the entire web basically , rather than just the small 
C:  uh , content management system . 
A:  OK .  Mm - hmm . 
C:  So I think that 's  that 's crucial for  for the success of  or @ @  


F:  On the other hand , 
F:  uh , 
F:  FrameNet 
F:  could well be useful . So do you know the FrameNet story ? 
C:  Um , yeah . Uh , not  not too much , but uh , 
F:  OK . 
F:  Oh . Th - that 's another thing you might wanna look into while you 're here . 
C:  I have a rough overview . 
F:  Because , um , 
F:  you know , the standard story is that keyworks  keywords evoke frames , and the frames may 
F:  well give you additional keywords or 
F:  uh , if you know that  that  that a  a bunch of keywords uh , 
F:  indicate a frame , then you can find documents that actually have the whole frame , rather th than just 
C:  Mmm . Mmm . 
F:  uh , individual  So there 's a lot of stuff , and people are looking at that . Most of the work here 
F:  is just trying to get the frames right . There 's linguists and stuff and there 's a lot of it and they 're  they 're busily working away . 
F:  But there are some application efforts trying to exploit it . 
F:  And this looks t it seems to be that this is a place where 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
F:  you might be able to do that . 
C:  Yeah . I 'm sure I could learn a lot about um , 
A:  Mmm . 
C:  yeah , just how to  how to come up with these structures , cuz it 's  it 's very easy to whip up something quickly , but it 
C:  maybe then makes sense to  to me , but not to anybody else , and  and if we want to share and integrate things , they must  
C:  well , they must be well designed really . 
F:  Yeah . <mike noise> 
A:  Hmm . 
B:  there as well . 
B:  And um . <outbreath> 
F:  Yeah , actually you guys never  
B:  And Srini 's doing information extraction also , right ? with that FrameNet base . Mm - hmm . 


B:  Remember the uh , Prashant story ? 
F:  Right . 
B:  The absolutely no  no linguistic background person that the IU sent over here . 
F:  Right . 
B:  And Andreas and I 
B:  tried to come up wi or we had come up actually with a eh  with him working on an interface for FrameNet , as it was back then , that would 
A:  <clears throat> 
F:  Right . 
B:  p do some of the work for this machine , 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  which uh , never got done because Prashant found a happy occupation which in the  
F:  W yeah , I know , I mean it  it  he  w he did w what  what he did was much more s sensible for him . I think uh , 
B:  Absolutely . Yeah . 
B:  But so  I 'm just saying , the uh , we had that idea 
F:  you know  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  The idea was there . Yeah , OK . 
B:  uh to  to exploit FrameNet 


F:  So you  you guys never sent anybody else from I U . 
F:  You were y no  
C:  Except  except Prashant ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Uh , this was supposedly an exchange program , and  I  we  you know , it 's fine . We don't care , but it just  I 'm a little surprised that 
C:  Um , <outbreath> 
C:  @ @ 
E:  <laugh> <mike noise> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  uh , Andreas didn't come up with anyone else he wanted to send . 
C:  @ @ 
C:  @ @ 
C:  Uh I don't know , I mean the uh  
F:  Alright . I mean I had forgotten a I  To be honest with you , I 'd totally forgotten we had a program . 
A:  Hmm . 
B:  Uh it 's in the program ? 
C:  Uh I  I think it 's  it 's really the lack of students uh , at IU at the moment . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . No , no . There was a whole co There was a little contract signed . It was  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . I think it 's ju it 's more the lack of  of students , 
C:  really , and w we have all these sponsors that are always sort of eager to get some teams . But  
F:  Yeah , I know . 
A:  Mmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Right . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Well I mean if  if I were a student , I 'd love to come here , rather than 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  work for some German <outbreath> <mike noise> company , or  
F:  Right . 
B:  You are being recorded right now , so beware . <laugh> 
F:  Oh , right !  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  Well , I didn't say anybody to  anything to offend  well , except for the sponsors maybe , but  <laugh> 


A:  The other person I thought of is Dan Gildea ? because he did some work on topic 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  St - statistical stuff . That would be a very good idea . 
A:  spotting 
A:  w um , 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  which is , I mean , you  I mean . I don't  Depending on how well you wanna integrate with that end , you know , like , taking the data and fig you said the learning systems that 
A:  figure out  We  There 's someone in ICSI who actually has been working on  
A:  has worked on that kinda stuff , and he 's worked with frame net , so you could talk to him about , you know , both of those things at once . So . 
C:  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
A:  And he just finished writing a draft of his thesis . So . 
C:  So , uh , who is that again ? 
A:  I u <laugh> Dan Gildea , GILDEA . 
A:  And , he 's in one of the rooms on the fifth floor and stuff , and  
B:  Who ? 
B:  I can take you to his office . It 's just around the corner . 


F:  One of these times soon 
F:  we 're gonna hear about construal . 
B:  Yeah . I 'm sure . I have um  I think it was November two thousand three or some  
A:  <outbreath> <sigh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  No . Wh - I had something in my calendar . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Oh , OK . Right .  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Um , 
E:  Wait a second . That 's a long way away . 
F:  <laugh> Good thinking ! <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Uh well , maybe I can  I can bribe my way out of this . So . 
B:  So I did some double checking and it seems like spring break in two thousand <laugh> one . <laugh> No . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Talk about changing the topic . <laugh> 
F:  Well , no , but he 's  he 's  he 's  he 's  as you said , he 's , like the state legislature , he 's trying to offer us bribes . 
A:  At least this is a private meeting . 
A:  Right , exactly , OK , that 's the link . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  This uh  


B:  Oh , they refused the budget again ? Is it  so about CITRIS ? Yeah , still nothing . 
F:  Uh , this  this  this  t the s  we 're , uh , involved in a 
F:  literally three hundred million dollar 
F:  uh , program . 
F:  Uh , with the State of California . And , the State of California is now 
F:  a month and a half behind its legis its legally required date to approve a budget . 
F:  So the budget has not been approved . 
F:  And two days ago  
F:  There 's two l you know , so , two branches of legislature . One branch approved it , 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  and , um , 
F:  yesterdayday  there was this uh  uh I thought that the other branch would just approve it , but now there 's actually a little back sliding to people who  
F:  who approved it got flak from there , eh anyway . So , 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  um  
A:  <clears throat> 


F:  Oh ! I have to tell you a wonderful story about this , OK ? 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  And then we 'll go . <mouth> So , I  it turns out I wound up having lunch today 
F:  with a guy named Tom Kalil . 
A:  <clears throat> 
F:  KILL  KALIL . <mouth> 
F:  And , uh , he now 
F:  works at 
F:  Berkeley . In fact he 's hired to 
F:  run a lot of CITRIS , even though we don't have the money they  
F:  So they 've been hiring people right and left , so , 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  uh , they think the money 's coming . So  and he was , I think , 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  the chief staffer to Clinton on technology matters . 
F:  He was in the White House , I don't remember what he was saying . A anyway , like that . 
F:  And , is now 
F:  doing all the politics for CITRIS , but also , has a uh , a lot of interest in 
F:  uh , actually doing things for society , so digital divide and stuff like that . So that 's 
F:  s interesting to me but maybe not to you . But the really interesting thing was , 
F:  he st he s he s said something about , 
F:  you know I 'm interested in things that have high social multiplier , something that is of great social value . He said , 
F:  " for example " , 
F:  this was his only example ,  
F:  " if you had a 
F:  adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor , 
F:  and as compelling as a video game , 
F:  then that would have a huge social impact " . 
F:  I said , " Oh great ! That 's a good problem to work on . " Anyway . So it was nice that 
F:  uh , 
F:  he 's got this view , 
F:  of A , that 's what you should try to do , and B , 
F:  uh , language would be a good way to do it . 
F:  So that 's  
A:  Mmm . Definitely . 
A:  <sniff> 
F:  So anyway , that 's the end of the story . 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  But for adults and not for the 
F:  This was  Yeah . I didn't push him on the ch on the child thing , but , uh , 
A:  children . Uh - huh . 
F:  you know , a again , if  if you  if you 
A:  Oh . 
F:  um , 
F:  and this was  this was literacy , which actually is somewhat different problem . Maybe easier . I don't know . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So this is reading , rather than teaching  
F:  Another project we started on , and  and didn't get funded for was , 
F:  uh , to try to build an automatic tutoring program , 
F:  for kids 
F:  whose first language wasn't English . 
F:  Which is like half the school population in California . 
F:  Something like that , isn't it ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah . So , 
A:  <clears throat> 
F:  enormous 
F:  problem in California , 
F:  and the idea was if we 're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding , couldn't we build 
F:  <mouth> uh , programs that would 
F:  be tutors for the kids . 
F:  We think we could . 
F:  Anyway . So  so  But this is a slightly different problem , and <sniff> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  um , 
F:  I know none of us have the spare time to look at it right now , but it i it 's  
F:  it 's interesting and I may 
F:  um , talk to him some more about is em somebody already doing this , and stuff like that . 
F:  So anyway , that was  that was today 's little story . 
E:  Hmm . 
F:  <mouth> 


B:  OK . So I  I did manage to 
B:  get  pull my head out of the sling by sidetracking into CITRIS , but uh or  a temporarily putting it out of the sling but , I  I 'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that 
F:  No , no . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  Right . 
B:  I am 
B:  n uh among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings , 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  and also revising , 
B:  thanks for all the comments ,  
B:  the c the original construal proposal . 
B:  And , if I put one and one together , I may end up with a number that 's greater than one and that I  I can 
B:  potentially present once you get back . 
A:  Greater than two ? 
F:  You 're good . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Nnn .  s sometimes , you know the sum is not uh less than the  
A:  Uh , right , right . <laugh> 
F:  Right . 
D:  <laugh> <mike noise>  
F:  Right . 
F:  Anyway . Yeah , so  OK , so that 'd be great , but I 'd  


F:  I think it 's  
F:  it 's 
F:  time again , right ? 
B:  Absolutely . Yeah . But um , and hopefully all sidetracking 
F:  Yeah . OK . 
B:  um , other 
B:  things will have disappeared , soon . 
F:  Good . Yep . 
F:  Done ? 
C:  <mike noise>  
A:  <sigh>
