C:  Hmm . 
C:  Test .

C:  Uh , to try to found , nnn , robust feature for detect between voice and unvoice . 
C:  And we  w we try to use <breath> the variance <inbreath> of the es difference between the FFT spectrum and mel filter bank spectrum . 
C:  Uh , also the  another parameter is  relates with the auto - correlation function . 
C:  R - ze energy and the variance a also of the auto - correlation function . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  But we don't have res we don't have result of the AURO for Aurora yet . 
C:  We need to train the neural network 
C:  and  
C:  No , 
C:  not yet . 
C:  Well , we work in the report , too , 
C:  because we have a lot of result , 
C:  they are very dispersed , 
C:  and was necessary to  to look in all the directory to  to  to give some more structure . 
C:  Hm - hmm . 
C:  No . 
C:  For ICSI . 
C:  Just summary of the experiment and the conclusion 
C:  and 
C:  something like that . 
C:  Uh , in July . 
C:  First of July . 
C:  Mm - hmm .
