D:  Yeah . 
D:  Ooh , Thursday . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Rank . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Dar 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  S 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  No , just , uh , looking into some  some of the things that , um , <mouth> uh , John Ohala and Hynek , um , gave as feedback , 
D:  um , as  as a starting point for the project . 
D:  Um . 
D:  In  in my proposal , I  I was thinking about starting from a set of , uh , phonological features , <breath> or a subset of them . 
D:  Um , but that might not be necessarily a good idea according to , um , John . 
D:  He said , uh , um , these  these phonological features are  are sort of figments of imagination also . 
D:  Um . S 
D:  Ye 
D:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . So , um , a better way would be something more  more data - driven , 
D:  just looking at the data and seeing what 's similar and what 's not similar . 
D:  So , I 'm  I 'm , um , taking a look at some of , um , <mouth> Sangita 's work on  on TRAPS . 
D:  She did something where , um  <mouth> w where the TRAPS learn 
D:  She clustered the  the temporal patterns of , um , certain  certain phonemes in  in m averaged over many , many contexts . 
D:  And , uh , some things tended to cluster . 
D:  Right ? You know , like stop  stop consonants clustered really well . 
D:  Um , silence was by its own self . 
D:  And , uh , um , <mouth> v vocalic was clustered . 
D:  And , <breath> um , so , <breath> those are  interesting things to  
D:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Just to see where  where I could start off from , 
D:  uh , you know ? 
D:  A  a  a set of small features and continue to iterate and find , uh , a better set . 
D:  Yeah .
