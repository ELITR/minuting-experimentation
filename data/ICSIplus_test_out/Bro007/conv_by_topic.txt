B:  OK 
B:  So 
B:  uh 
B:  today 
B:  we 're looking at a 
B:  number of uh 
B:  things we 're trying 
B:  and uh 
B:  fortunately for listeners to this uh 
B:  we lost some of it 's visual 
B:  but um 
B:  got tables in front of us . 


B:  And what  and what 's OGI forty - five ? 
C:  Uh it 's o it 's OGI two , it 's  so the  th it 's the features from the first line 
B:  The bottom one there ? 
D:  It 's in fact OGI two . 
C:  and  yeah . 
B:  S 
B:  Right , but I mean what 's the  what does the last row mean ? 
C:  So it 's uh basically this but without the KLT 
C:  on the  from the left path . 
B:  I thought that was the one  I thought that was the second row . 
B:  So what 's the difference between the second 
C:  Uh the second line you don't have this combo stuff so you just 
B:  Oh . 
C:  uh 
B:  So this is like the second line but with  with the combo stuff . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  And with the  all the output of the combo . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh 
B:  OK , so  
B:  alright so it looks to me  
B:  I guess the same  
B:  given that we have to take the filt ones out of the  the running because of this delay problem  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  so it looks to me like the ones you said 
C:  <cough> 
B:  I agree are  are the ones to look at but I just would add the  
B:  the  the second row one 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  and then um if we can um 
C:  Mmm . 
B:  oh yeah also 
B:  when  
B:  when they 're using this weighting scheme of forty , thirty - five , twenty - five 
B:  is that on the percentages or on the raw errors ? I guess 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  Uh 
B:  it 's probably on the percentages right ? 
C:  <whispering inaudibly> 
C:  I guess , yeah . 
B:  Yeah OK . 
C:  I guess , yeah . Mmm . 
B:  Alright . 
C:  It 's not clear here . 
B:  OK . <laugh> Maybe  maybe they 'll argue about it . 


B:  Um 
B:  what is  what does combo mean ? 
C:  So combo is um 
C:  a system where we have these features 
C:  that go through a network and then 
C:  this same string of features but low - pass filtered with the low - pass filter used in 
C:  the MSG features . 
C:  And so these low - pass filtered 
C:  goes through M eh  another MLP 
C:  and then the linear output of these two MLP 's are combined 
C:  just by adding the values and then there is this KLT . 
C:  Um 
C:  the output is used as 
C:  uh features as well . 
B:  Um 
B:  so 
B:  let me try to restate this and see if I have it right . 
B:  There is uh  
B:  there is the features 
B:  uh there 's the OGI features 
B:  and 
B:  then um 
B:  those 
B:  features 
B:  um 
B:  go through a contextual  uh l l let 's take this bottom arr 
B:  one pointed to by the bottom arrow . 
B:  Um those features 
B:  go through a contextualized KLT . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Then 
B:  these features also 
B:  uh get 
B:  um low - pass filtered 
C:  Yeah so 
C:  yeah I could perhaps draw this on the blackboard  
B:  Sure . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  The graph , yeah another one . 
A:  <whispers inaudibly> 
C:  @ @  
B:  Yeah , that 's good . 
C:  So we have these features from OGI 
B:  So 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  that goes through the three paths . 
B:  Three , OK . 
C:  The first 
C:  is a KLT using 
C:  several 
C:  frames 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  of the features . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  The second path 
C:  is uh MLP 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  also using nine frames  several frames of features 
B:  Uh - huh . 
C:  The third path 
C:  is this low - pass filter . 
B:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Uh , MLP 
B:  Aha ! aha ! 
C:  Adding the outputs just like in the second propose the  the proposal from  for the first evaluation . 
B:  Yeah ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  And then 
B:  No , the KLT . 
C:  the KLT 
B:  And those two together . 
C:  and then the two together again . 
D:  Two HTK . 
B:  That 's it . 
C:  Um . 
B:  OK so that 's  that 's this bottom one . 
C:  So 
C:  this is  yeah 
B:  And so uh 
B:  and then the  the  the one at the top  and I presume these things that uh are in yellow are in yellow because overall they 're the best ? 
C:  Yeah that 's the reason , yeah . 
B:  Oh let 's focus on them then so what 's the block diagram for the one above it ? 
C:  For the f the f first 
C:  yellow line you mean ? 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah 
C:  so it 's uh basically s the same except that we don't have this 
D:  Step . 
C:  uh low - pass filtering so we have only two streams . 
C:  Well . 
C:  There 's  there 's no 
C:  low  
C:  low - pass processing 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  used as additional feature stream . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Um 


B:  Do you e um they mentioned  made some  uh when I was on the phone with Sunil they  they mentioned some 
B:  weighting 
B:  scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh actually the way things seems to 
C:  um well 
C:  it 's uh 
C:  forty percent for TI - digit , sixty for 
C:  all the SpeechDat - Cars , well all these languages . 
C:  Ehm 
C:  the well match is forty , medium thirty five and high mismatch twenty - five . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Um and we don't have the TI - digits part yet ? 
C:  Uh , no . 
B:  OK . 
C:  But 
C:  yeah . 
C:  Generally what you observe with TI - digits is that the result are very close 
C:  whatever the  the system . 
B:  OK . 
B:  And so 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  have you 
B:  put all these numbers together 
B:  into a single number representing that ? I mean not  
C:  Uh not yet . No . 
B:  OK so that should be pretty easy to do and that would be good  then we could compare the two and say what was better . 
C:  Mmm yeah , yeah . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Yeah . 


B:  Um 
B:  and how does this compare 
B:  to the numbers  
B:  oh so OGI two is just the top  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  top row ? 
C:  So yeah to  
C:  actually OGI two is the  
C:  the baseline with the OGI features 
C:  but 
C:  this is not exactly the result that they have 
C:  because they 've  they 're still 
C:  made some changes in the 
C:  features 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  OK . <laugh> 
C:  and  well 
C:  but 
C:  uh 
C:  actually 
C:  our results are better than their results . 
C:  Um 
C:  I don't know by how much because they did not send us the new results <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> OK . <laugh> Uh 
C:  Uh 
B:  OK so the one  one place 
B:  where it looks like we 're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched Italian . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  <two coughs> 
A:  <cough> 
B:  An - 
C:  Yeah there is something funny happening here because  yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  But there are thirty - six and then 
C:  sometimes we are  we are  we are around forty - two and 
B:  Now up 
C:  but 
B:  Uh so 
B:  one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having a  a second um silence detection . 
C:  Yeah . So there are 
C:  some results here 
D:  For the Italian . For this one . 
C:  uh so the 
C:  third and the fifth line of the table 
B:  So filt is what that is ? 
C:  Filt , yeah 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  So 
C:  so we don't 
B:  Alright so for now at least that 's not 
B:  there 
B:  you have some results with low - pass filter cepstrum 
B:  doesn't have a huge effect but it  but it looks like it 
B:  you know maybe could help in a couple places . 
C:  I th 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Uh little bit . 
B:  Um 
B:  and um 
B:  um 
B:  Yeah 
B:  and uh 
B:  let 's see 
B:  What else did we 
B:  have in there ? Uh 
B:  I guess it makes a l um at this point this is 
B:  I  I guess I should probably look at these others a little bit uh 
B:  And you  you yellowed these out uh but uh 
B:  uh 
B:  Oh I see yeah that  that one you can't use because of the delay . 
B:  Those look pretty good . 
B:  Um 
B:  let 's see that one 
B:  Well even the  just the  the second row doesn't look that bad right ? That 's just uh 
C:  Yep . 
B:  yeah ? And  and 
D:  Mmm yeah . 
B:  that looks like an interesting one too . 
B:  Uh 
C:  Actually the  yeah the second line is 
C:  uh 
C:  pretty much like the first line in yellow 
C:  except that we don't have this KLT on the first  on the left part of the diagram . 
C:  We just have the features 
C:  as they are . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Um 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah so when we do this weighted measure we should compare the two cuz it might even come out better . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  And it 's  it 's  it 's a little  slightly simpler . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  So  
B:  so there 's  so I  I would put that one also as a  as a maybe . 
B:  Uh 
B:  and it  yeah and it 's 
B:  actually <laugh> does  does significantly better on the uh 
B:  uh highly mismatched Italian , so 
B:  s and little worse on the 
B:  mis on the MM case , but 
B:  uh 
B:  Well yeah it 's worse than a few things 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  so uh 
B:  let 's see how that c that c c see how that comes out on their  
B:  their measure and  are  are we running this uh for TI - digits or uh 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Now is TI di  is is that part of the result that they get for the uh development  th the results that they 're supposed to get at the end of  end of the month , the TI - digits are there also ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  It 's included , yeah . 
B:  Oh OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  And see what else there is here . 
B:  Um 
B:  Oh I see  the one  I was looking down here at the  the o the row below the 
B:  lower yellowed one . 
C:  Mm - hmm ? 
B:  Uh that 's 
B:  uh 
B:  that 's with the reduced uh KLT size  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  reduced dimensionality . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  What happens there 
B:  is it 's around the same 
B:  and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying 
B:  before a bit perhaps . 
C:  Yeah , it 's  it 's significantly worse well but  Mm - hmm . 
B:  It 's significantly worse  it 's  
C:  Exc - except for the HM 
B:  it 's uh 
D:  For many a mismatch it 's worse . 
C:  but 
B:  it 's  it 's mostly worse . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  But it is little . I mean 
B:  not  not by a huge amount , I don't know . 


C:  Um 
C:  yeah so it seems f for the  the well match and mismatched condition 
C:  it 's uh 
C:  it brings something . 
C:  Uh but 
C:  uh actually 
C:  apparently there are  there 's no 
C:  room left for any 
C:  silence detector 
C:  at the server side because of the delay . 
C:  Uh 
B:  Oh we can't do it . Oh OK . 
C:  well 
C:  No . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  For that  for that we  
B:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh . <laugh> Too bad . 
C:  Uh 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Good idea , but can't do it . OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Except I don't know because they  
C:  I think they are still working well . 
B:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Uh t two days ago they were still working on this 
C:  trying to reduce 
C:  the delay of the silence detector 
C:  so but 
C:  yeah if we had time perhaps we could try to find uh 
C:  some kind of compromise between the delay that 's on the handset and on the server side . 
C:  Perhaps try to reduce the delay on the handset and  
C:  but well hmm 
C:  For the moment they have this large delay on the  
C:  the feature computation and 
B:  OK . 


B:  What are  what are the sizes of any of these sets , I  I 'm  I 'm sure you told me before , but I 've forgotten . 
B:  So  you know how many words 
C:  Uh 
B:  are in 
B:  uh one of these test sets ? 
D:  I don't remember . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Um 
B:  About ? 
C:  it 's  
C:  it depends  well  
C:  the well matched is generally larger 
C:  than the other sets 
C:  and I think it 's around 
D:  Ye - 
C:  two thousand or three thousand words perhaps , at least . 
D:  But words  
C:  Hmm ? 
D:  well word  I don't know . 
C:  The words , yeah . 
D:  Sentences . 
C:  S sentences . 
C:  Some sets have five hundred sentences , 
C:  so . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mmm . 
B:  So the  so the sets  so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences , let 's say 
B:  and each sentence on the average has four or five digits or is it  most of them longer or 
D:  Yeah for the Italian 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  It  it d 
D:  even seven digits y more or less but sometime 
C:  Seven digits . 
D:  the sentence have only one digit and sometime 
D:  uh like uh the number of uh credit cards , something like that . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right , so between one and sixteen . See the  I mean the reason I 'm asking is  is  is we have all these small differences and I don't know 
C:  Mm - hmm ? 
B:  how seriously to take them , right ? So 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  uh i if  if you had uh just 
B:  you know  to give an example , if you had uh 
B:  um 
B:  if you had a thousand words 
B:  then uh a  a tenth of a percent would just be one word , right ? So  so it wouldn't mean anything . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Oh <laugh>  um 
B:  so um 
B:  yeah it be kind of  I 'd kind of like to know what the 
B:  sizes of these test sets were actually . 
D:  The size that we have ? 
C:  Yeah . We could  we could run  run some kind of significance tests or 
B:  Yeah since these  
B:  well also just to know the numbers , right . So these  these are word error rates so this is on how many words . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah we have the result that the output of the HTK 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  The number of  
D:  of sentences , no it 's the number isn't . 
C:  Yeah sure  sure . Yeah sure . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah so anyway if you could just mail out what those numbers are and then  then  that  that be great . 
D:  Yeah . 


B:  Um <laugh> 
B:  what else is there here ? 
B:  Um see the second  
B:  second from the bottom it says SIL , but this is some different kind of silence or thing or  
B:  what was that ? 
C:  Uh 
D:  It the  
D:  the output silence of the MLP . 
C:  Oh yeah I see . 
D:  It 's only one small experiment to know what happened . 
D:  To apply 
D:  also to in include also the  
D:  the silence of the MLP we have the fifty - six form and the silence to pick up the silence and we include those . 
B:  Yes . 
B:  Uh - huh , uh - huh . 
B:  The silence plus the KLT output ? 
B:  Oh so you 're only using the silence . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , because when we apply 
D:  the KLT 
C:  No they 're  I think there is this silence in addition to the um KLT outputs it is because we  we  we just keep 
B:  No . 
D:  in addition , yes . In addition t 
C:  uh we don't keep all the dimensions after the KLT 
C:  and  yeah . 
D:  and we not s we are not sure if we pick  we have the silence . 
C:  So 
C:  we try to add the silence also in addition to the  these twenty - eight 
B:  I see . 
C:  dimensions . 
B:  OK . 


B:  Um 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  OK so if we can know what  how many words are in each and then um Dave uh 
B:  Dave promised to get us something tomorrow 
B:  which will be there 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  as far as they 've gotten <laugh> Friday and then we 'll operate with that and 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  uh how long did it 
B:  I guess if we 're not doing all these things  if we 're only doing 
B:  um 
B:  um 
B:  I guess since this is development data it 's legitimate 
B:  to do more than one , right ? 
B:  I mean ordinarily if  in final test data you don't want to do 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  several 
B:  and  and take the best that 's  that 's  
C:  Mmm . 
B:  that 's not proper but if this is development data we could still 
B:  look at a couple . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  We can  yeah . Sure . But 
C:  we have to decide  I mean we have to fix the system 
C:  on this d on this data , to choose the best and 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I 
B:  Right . 
C:  these 
B:  But the question is when  when do we fix the system , do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on Tuesday ? 
C:  But we could 
C:  it d 
B:  I  
C:  I think we fixed on Tuesday , yeah . Yeah . Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah , OK except that we do have to write it up . <laugh> Also , so 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Um 
C:  Uh yeah well . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Well basically it 's this with 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  perhaps some kind of printing and some  some other @ @ . <laugh> 
B:  Right so maybe what we do is we  we  we uh as soon as we get the data from them 
C:  Yeah but 
B:  we start the training and so forth but we start the write - up right away 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  because as you say there  there 's only minor differences between these . 
C:  I think you  we could  we could start soon , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Write up something . 
B:  Yeah , and  
C:  Um yeah . Mm - hmm . 
B:  and I  I would  you know , I would  I 'd kind of like to see it maybe I can  I can edit it a bit 
B:  uh sure . 
B:  The  my  what in this si i in this situation is my forte which is English . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Uh 
B:  so 
C:  Mmm . 
B:  uh 
B:  H yeah . Have y have you seen alt d do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything ? 
C:  Uh not really . 
B:  OK . 
C:  Um 


C:  There is the format of the table which is <laugh> 
C:  quite impressive . 
B:  Yeah ? 
B:  Uh 
B:  I see . 
B:  Yes , for those who are listening to this and not looking at it uh it 's not really that impressive , it 's just tiny . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  It 's all these little categories 
B:  set a , set b , set c , multi - condition , clean . 
B:  Uh 
B:  No mitigation . 
B:  Wow . 
B:  Do you know what no  what no mitigation means here ? 
C:  Um 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  it should be the 
B:  Oh that 's probably the  
C:  the problem with the error  channel error or 
B:  this is probably channel error stuff huh ? Oh this is i right , it says right above here channel  channel error resilience , yeah . 
C:  well , you  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  So recognition performance is just the top part , actually . 
B:  Uh 
B:  and they have  yes , split between seen databases and non - seen so basically between development and  and evaluation . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  And <clears throat> so  
B:  right , it 's presumed there 's all sorts of 
B:  tuning that 's gone on on the 
B:  see what they call seen databases and 
B:  there won't be tuning for the uh unseen . 
B:  Multi - condition  multi - condition . 
B:  So they have  looks like they have 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  uh 
B:  uh 
B:  so they splitting up between the TI - digits and everything else , I see . 
B:  So the everything else is the SpeechDat - Car , that 's the 
C:  Yeah , so it 's not divided between languages you mean or  
B:  multi multilingual 
B:  Well , it is . It is , but there 's also  there 's these tables over here for the  for the TI - digits and these tables over here for the car 
C:  it just 
C:  Oh yeah . 
B:  data which is  which is I guess all the multilingual stuff 
B:  and then uh there 's  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  they also split up between multi - condition and clean only . 
C:  For TI - digits . 
B:  Yes . 
C:  Yeah , actually yeah . For the TI - digits they want to train 
C:  on clean 
C:  and on noisy 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  and  yeah . 
B:  So we 're doing that also , I guess . 
C:  Uh yeah . 
C:  But 
C:  uh we 
C:  actually  
C:  do we have the features ? Yeah . For the clean TI - digits but we did not test it yet . 
C:  Uh the clean training stuff . 
B:  OK . 
C:  Mmm . 


B:  Well anyway , sounds like there 'll be a lot to do just to <laugh> work with our partners to fill out the tables <laugh> over the next uh 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yes . 
B:  next few days I guess they have to send it out  
B:  let 's see the thirty - first is uh 
B:  uh Wednesday and I think the  it has to be there by some 
B:  hour 
B:  uh European time on Wednesday so <laugh> I think basically 
C:  Hmm - hmm . 
D:  We lost time uh Wednesday maybe because <laugh> 
B:  E excuse me ? 
D:  that the difference in the time may be  
D:  is a long different of the time . 
D:  Maybe the Thursday 
D:  the twelfth of the night of the Thurs - thirty - one 
D:  is  
D:  is not valid in Europe . <laugh> We don't know is happening . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  Yes , so I mean  I think we have to actually get it done Tuesday <laugh> right because I  I think 
D:  Tuesday . 
C:  Yeah , well . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Except if  if it 's the thirty - one at midnight or I don't know  
B:  uh 
C:  we can <laugh> still 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  do some work on Wednesday morning . 
B:  Uh yeah well . 
C:  Yeah , well . 
B:  W i is but is  is it midni I thought it was actually something like five PM 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  on  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  was like  I thought it was five PM or something , I didn't think it was midnight . I thought they said they wanted everything by 
D:  Yeah , five PM . 
B:  well , so five PM 
B:  their time 
B:  is  is  if 
D:  Not five PM , three PM . 
B:  three PM . 
D:  Three PM . 
B:  Alright , that 's six in the morning here . 
C:  It 's d 
D:  Uh no 
C:  no . 
D:  three  three A - three PM ? 
C:  No , we are wondering about the  the  the hour 
C:  that we have to 
C:  eh I don't know if it 's three PM  it 's 
D:  Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
D:  Three PM here is in Europe midnight . 
C:  Yeah , it 's  it 's midnight but 
B:  Yes , yes , but I didn't think it was midnight that it was due , I thought it was due at some hour during the day like five PM or something . 
D:  Oh OK . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm , maybe . 
B:  In which case <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  so I  I  uh well we should look but my assumption is that we basically have to be done Tuesday . <laugh> Um 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 


B:  so then next Thursday we can sort of have a 
B:  little aftermath but then  then we 'll actually have the new data which is the German and the Danish 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  but that really will be much less work because 
B:  uh the system will be fixed 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  so all we 'll do is 
B:  take whatever <laugh> they have and  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  and uh and run it through the process . Uh we won't be changing the training on anything 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  so there 'll be no new training , there 'll just be new HTK runs , so that 's 
B:  means in some sense we 
B:  can kind of relax from this after  
B:  after Tuesday and  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  and uh 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  maybe next meeting we can start talking a little bit about where we want to go from here uh in terms of 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  uh the research . 
B:  Um 
B:  you know what things 
B:  uh did you think of when you were 
B:  uh doing this process that uh you just didn't really have time to adequately 
B:  work on uh 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  uh 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  so <laugh> 
B:  What ? 
A:  Oh , Stephane always has these great ideas and  
C:  <laugh> Sure . <laugh> 
A:  oh , but uh we don't have time . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  I 'm not sure these are great ideas . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  But they 're ideas . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah ? 
B:  Oh , that was good . And  and uh also it 's still true that uh 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  But 
C:  <clears throat> 
B:  I think it 's true that  that we  we at least got fairly consistent 
B:  i improved 
B:  results 
B:  by running uh the uh neural net transformation in parallel with the features rather than 
B:  uh in sequence which was  was your suggestion and that  that  that seems to have been borne out . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  The fact that none of these are  are  you know , enormous is  is  
B:  is not 
B:  too surprising  most improvements aren't enormous and <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  uh some of them are 
B:  but uh 
B:  I mean you have something really really wrong <laugh> and you fix it <laugh> you can get big and really enormous improvements but 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> uh <laugh> 
B:  um 
B:  Cuz our best improvements over the years that we 've gotten from 
B:  finding bugs , but 
C:  <laugh> 


B:  Anyway 
B:  OK well I  I think  I see where we are and everybody knows what they 're doing and is there  is there anything else we should talk about or  or  are we done ? 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  I think it 's OK um . 
C:  We 
C:  so basically we will  I think we 'll try to  
C:  to focus on these three 
C:  architectures and  
C:  and perhaps I was thinking also a fourth one with 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  just  just a single KLT because we did not really test that  
C:  removing all these KLT 's and 
B:  Uh - huh . 
C:  putting one single KLT at the end . 
B:  Yeah , I mean that would be pretty 
B:  low maintenance to try it . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Uh if you can fit it in . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  K , uh if nobody has anything else maybe we should go around do  do our digits  
B:  do our digits duty . 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK I 'll start . 
B:  <clears throat> 
B:  OK . I guess we 're done . 


B:  Oh I have  yeah I do have one other piece of information which uh 
B:  I should tell people outside of this group too uh 
B:  I don't know if we 're gonna need it 
B:  uh but 
B:  uh Jeff up at the 
B:  uh University of Washington 
B:  has uh gotten a hold of a uh uh some kind of server farm of uh 
B:  of ten uh uh multiprocessor uh IBM machines RS six thousands 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  and  and uh so I think each one is four processors or something or  I don't know , eight hundred megahertz or something and 
B:  there 's four processors in a box and there 's ten boxes and there 's some kind of ti so if  you know he 's got a lot of processing power 
B:  and um we 'd have to schedule it but if we have some big jobs and we wanna  
B:  wanna  wanna run them he 's  
B:  he 's offering it . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  So . 
B:  It 's uh 
B:  when he was here eh uh he  he used i not only every machine here but every machine on campus as far as I could tell , so  <laugh> so in some ways he just got his payback , but 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  uh 
B:  again I  I don't know if we 'll end up with  
B:  if we 're gonna be CPU limited on anything that we 're doing in this group but  but if  if we are 
B:  that 's an offer . 
B:  OK well uh 
B:  you guys doing great stuff so that 's  that  that 's really neat and uh 
B:  we 'll uh 
B:  uh g don't think we need to uh 
B:  um 


B:  Oh well the other thing I guess that I will say 
B:  is that uh the digits that we 're gonna record momentarily 
B:  is starting to get  are starting to get into a pretty good size collection 
B:  and um in addition to the SpeechDat stuff we will have those to work with 
B:  really pretty soon now so that 's  that 's another 
B:  source of data . 
B:  Um 
B:  which is 
B:  s under somewhat better control and that we can  we can make measurements of the room the  uh that  you know if we feel there 's other measurements we don't have that we 'd like to have we can make them and 
B:  uh Dave and I were just talking about that a little while ago 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  so 
B:  uh that 's 
B:  another  
B:  another possibility for this  this kind of work .
