B:  Hmm . 
B:  Yeah , Oakland . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Other than the language , is there a reason not to use the TIMIT phone set ? 
B:  Cuz it 's larger ? 
B:  As opposed to the ICSI  phone set ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Well , we have that now , too , right ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Or Swiss . 
B:  Swiss - German . 
B:  Did the Aurora people actually corrupt it themselves , 
B:  or just specify the signal and the signal - t 
B:  OK . 
B:  From the deep South . 
B:  Or you just add it to the features . 
B:  It 's not a complete set of combinations , though , 
B:  right ? 
B:  It 's not a complete set of combinations , though , 
B:  right ? 
B:  There 's a computation limit , though , 
B:  isn't there ? 
B:  Isn't there like a limit  on the computation load , or d latency , or something like that for Aurora task ? 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  I don't know what a Ravioli is . 
B:  We can check really quickly , 
B:  I guess . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  It s also depends on the net . 
B:  How big is the net ? 
B:  How big are the nets you 're using ? 
B:  Uh - huh . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Huh . 
B:  SAMPA ? 
B:  What does " SAMPA " mean ? 
B:  So , I mean  
B:  I 'm sorry . 
B:  I was gonna say , does that mean IPA is not really international ? 
B:  Oh , I see . 
B:  Got it . 
B:  Fact , most confusions are within the phone  phone classes , right ? 
B:  I think , uh , Larry was saying like obstruents are only confused with other obstruents , et cetera , et cetera . 
B:  Um . 
B:  The soft training of the nets still requires the vector to sum to one , though , 
B:  right ? 
B:  So you can't really feed it , like , two articulatory features that are on at the same time with ones 
B:  cuz it 'll kind of normalize them down to one half or something like that , for instance . 
B:  Why don't you just choose linear ? 
B:  Right ? 
B:  Linear outputs ? 
B:  Isn't that what you 'll want ? 
B:  If you 're gonna do a KL Transform on it . 
B:  Oh , you  
B:  Yeah ? 
B:  Hmm .
