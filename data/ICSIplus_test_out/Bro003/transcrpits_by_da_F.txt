F:  About to be off the air . 
F:  So you think we 're going now , 
F:  yes ? 
F:  OK , good . 
F:  Alright 
F:  Going again 
F:  Uh  So we 're gonna go around as before , and uh do  do our digits . 
F:  Uh transcript one three one one dash one three three zero .  three two three  four seven six five  five three one six two four one  six seven  seven  eight  nine zero nine four zero zero three  zero one five eight  one seven three five three  two six eight zero  three six two four three zero seven  four  five zero six nine four  seven four  eight five seven  nine six one five  O seven eight O two  zero nine six zero four zero zero  one  two  Uh  Yeah , you don't actually n need to say the name . 
F:  That 'll probably be bleeped out . 
F:  So . 
F:  That 's if these are anonymized , 
F:  but <laugh> Yeah  
F:  uh  I mean  not that there 's anything defamatory about uh  eight five seven or <laugh> or anything , 
F:  but 
F:  Uh , anyway . 
F:  Uh  so here 's what I have for  I  I was just jotting down things I think th w that we should do today . 
F:  Uh  This is what I have for an agenda so far 
F:  Um , We should talk a little bit about the plans for the uh  the field trip next week . 
F:  Uh  a number of us are doing a field trip to uh Uh  OGI 
F:  And uh  mostly uh First though about the logistics for it . 
F:  Then maybe later on in the meeting we should talk about what we actually you know , might accomplish . 
F:  Uh  
F:  Uh , in and  kind of go around  see what people have been doing  talk about that ,  a r progress report . Um , Essentially . 
F:  Um  And then uh  Another topic I had was that uh  uh  Uh  Dave here had uh said uh " Give me something to do . " 
F:  And I  I have  I have uh  failed so far in doing that . 
F:  And so maybe we can discuss that a little bit . 
F:  If we find some holes in some things that  that  someone could use some help with , he 's  he 's volunteering to help . 
F:  OK , always count on a <laugh> serious comment from that corner . 
F:  So , um , 
F:  uh , and uh , then uh , talk a little bit about  about disks and resource  resource issues that  that 's starting to get worked out . 
F:  And then , anything else anybody has that isn't in that list ? 
F:  Uh  
F:  Uh I think that means the battery 's O K .  
F:  d  do you 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  It looks full of electrons . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Plenty of electrons left there . 
F:  OK , 
F:  so , um , 
F:  uh . 
F:  OK , 
F:  so , uh , I wanted to start this with this mundane thing . 
F:  Um  
F:  Uh  I  I  it was  it was kind of my bright idea to have us take a plane that leaves at seven twenty in the morning . 
F:  Um . 
F:  Uh <laugh> this is uh  The reason I did it uh was because otherwise for those of us who have to come back the same day it is really not much of a  of a visit . 
F:  Uh  
F:  So um the issue is how  how  how would we ever accomplish that ? 
F:  Uh  
F:  what  what  what part of town do you live in ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK , so would it be easier  
F:  those of you who are not , you know , used to this area , it can be very tricky to get to the airport at  at uh , you know , six thirty . 
F:  Um . So . Would it be easier for you if you came here and I drove you ? 
F:  Yeah ? 
F:  Yeah , yeah , OK . 
F:  OK , so if  if everybody can get here at six . 
F:  Yeah , I 'm afraid we need to do that to get there on time . 
F:  Yeah , so . 
F:  Oh boy . 
F:  Anyway , 
F:  so . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , so I 'll just pull up in front at six and just be out front . 
F:  And , uh , and yeah , that 'll be plenty of time . 
F:  It 'll take  it  it  it won't be bad traffic that time of day 
F:  and  and uh 
F:  Going to Oakland . 
F:  Bridge 
F:  oh , the turnoff to the bridge 
F:  Won't even do that . 
F:  I mean , just go down Martin Luther King . 
F:  And then Martin Luther King to nine - eighty to eight - eighty , 
F:  and it 's  it 'd take us , tops uh thirty minutes to get there . 
F:  So that leaves us fifty minutes before the plane  
F:  it 'll just  
F:  yeah . 
F:  So 
F:  Great , 
F:  OK 
F:  so that 'll 
F:  It 's  I mean , it 's still not going to be really easy 
F:  but  well Particularly for  for uh  for Barry and me , 
F:  we 're not  we 're not staying overnight 
F:  so we don't need to bring anything particularly except for <inbreath> uh  a pad of paper 
F:  and  <laugh> So , and , uh you , two have to bring a little bit 
F:  but uh  you know , don't  don't bring a footlocker and we 'll be OK 
F:  So . 
F:  W you 're staying overnight . 
F:  I figured you wouldn't need a great big suitcase , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  That 's sort of  <laugh> one night . 
F:  So . 
F:  Anyway . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Six AM in front . 
F:  Uh , I 'll be here . 
F:  Uh  I 'll  I 'll  I 'll  I 'll give you my phone number , 
F:  If I 'm not here for a few m after a few minutes then 
F:  Nah , I 'll be fine . 
F:  I just , uh  it  for me it just means getting up a half an hour earlier than I usually do . 
F:  Not  not  not a lot , 
F:  so 
F:  OK , 
F:  that was the real real important stuff . 
F:  Um , I  I  I figured maybe wait on the potential goals for the meeting uh  until we talk about wh what 's been going on . 
F:  So , uh , what 's been going on ? 
F:  Why don't we start  start over here . 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK 
F:  Uh , 
F:  So the HTK base lines  so this is using mel cepstra and so on , 
F:  or  ? 
F:  Yeah . OK . 
F:  And again , I guess the p the plan is , uh , to uh  then given this  
F:  What 's the plan again ? 
F:  With  
F:  So  So  Does i Just remind me of what  what you were going to do with the  what  what  what  what 's  
F:  y You just described what you 've been doing . 
F:  So if you could remind me of what you 're going to be doing . 
F:  Oh , this is  
F:  yeah , yeah . 
F:  Oh ! Cube . Yeah . 
F:  Yeah ? 
F:  So - so we had talked  I guess we had talked at one point about maybe , the language ID corpus ? 
F:  Is that a possibility for that ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  That 's really funny 
F:  isn't it ? 
F:  I mean cuz th this whole thing is for  developing new standards for the telephone . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah , I know , 
F:  but the reason  
F:  Oh I see , 
F:  so your point is that it 's  it 's  it 's uh  the features are computed locally , and so they aren't necessarily telephone bandwidth , uh or telephone distortions . 
F:  Yeah , that 's wh that 's wh that 's what I meant . 
F:  I said  @ @ , there 's  there 's  there 's an OGI language ID , not the  not the , uh  
F:  the CallFriend is a  is a , uh , LDC w thing , right ? 
F:  But I 'm not sure  
F:  I mean , we ' r e e The bandwidth shouldn't be such an issue 
F:  right ? 
F:  Because e e this is downsampled and  and filtered , 
F:  right ? 
F:  So it 's just the fact that it 's not telephone . 
F:  And there are so many other differences between these different databases . 
F:  I mean some of this stuff 's recorded in the car , 
F:  and some of it 's  
F:  I mean there 's  there 's many different acoustic differences . 
F:  So I 'm not sure if  . I mean , unless we 're going to include a bunch of car recordings in the  in the training database , I 'm not sure if it 's  completely rules it out 
F:  if our  if we  if our major goal is to have phonetic context and you figure that there 's gonna be a mismatch in acoustic conditions does it make it much worse f to sort of add another mismatch , if you will . 
F:  Uh , i i I  I guess the question is how important is it to  for us to get multiple languages uh , in there . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So that 's what you 're thinking of using is sort of the multi the equivalent of the multiple ? 
F:  And for the difference in phonetic context  that you  ? Provide that . 
F:  Well , we also have this Broadcast News that we were talking about taking off the disk , which is  <laugh> is microphone data for  for English . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Yeah , so there 's plenty of stuff around . 
F:  OK , so anyway , th the basic plan is to , uh , test this cube . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  To fill i fill it in , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  But that 's  
F:  Uh , depen it depen it depends how you mean " using the net " . 
F:  So , if you 're talking about for producing these discriminative features  that we 're talking about  you can't do that . 
F:  Because  because the  what they 're asking for is  is a feature set . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  And so , uh , we 're the ones who have been weird by  by doing this training . 
F:  But if we say , " No , you have to have a different feature set for each language , " I think this is ver gonna be very bad . 
F:  So  
F:  Oh yeah . 
F:  Yeah . I mean , in principle , I mean conceptually , it 's sort of like they want a re @ @  well , they want a replacement for mel cepstra . 
F:  So , we say " OK , this is the year two thousand , 
F:  we 've got something much better than mel cepstra . 
F:  It 's , you know , gobbledy - gook . " 
F:  OK ? And so <inbreath> we give them these gobbledy - gook features 
F:  but these gobbledy - gook features are supposed to be good for any language . 
F:  Cuz you don't know who 's gonna call , 
F:  and you know , I mean so it 's  it 's  it 's , uh , 
F:  uh  how do you know what language it is ? 
F:  Somebody picks up the phone . 
F:  So thi this is their image . 
F:  Someone picks up the phone , right ? 
F:  And  and he  he picks up the ph 
F:  Yeah . y y y 
F:  Well . 
F:  But , no but , y you  you pick up the phone , 
F:  you talk on the phone , 
F:  and it sends features out . 
F:  OK , 
F:  so the phone doesn't know what a  what  what your language is . 
F:  But that 's the image that they have . 
F:  It could be , 
F:  but that 's the image they have , 
F:  right ? 
F:  So that 's  that 's  
F:  I mean , one could argue all over the place about how things really will be in ten years . 
F:  But the particular image that the cellular industry has right now is that it 's distributed speech recognition , where the , uh , uh , probabilistic part , and  and s semantics and so forth are all on the servers , and you compute features of the  uh , on the phone . 
F:  So that 's  that 's what we 're involved in . 
F:  We might  might or might not agree that that 's the way it will be in ten years , 
F:  but that 's  that 's  that 's what they 're asking for . 
F:  So  so I think that  th th it is an important issue whether it works cross - language . 
F:  Now , it 's the OGI , uh , folks ' perspective right now that probably that 's not the biggest deal . 
F:  And that the biggest deal is the , um envir acoustic - environment mismatch . 
F:  And they may very well be right , 
F:  but I  I was hoping we could just do a test and determine if that was true . 
F:  If that 's true , we don't need to worry so much . 
F:  Maybe  maybe we have a couple languages in the training set and that gives us enough breadth uh , uh , that  that  that the rest doesn't matter . 
F:  Um , the other thing is , uh , this notion of training to uh  which I  I guess they 're starting to look at up there ,  training to something more like articulatory features . 
F:  Uh , and if you have something that 's just good for distinguishing different articulatory features that should just be good across , you know , a wide range of languages . 
F:  Uh , but  
F:  Yeah , so I don't th I know  unfortunately I don't  I see what you 're comi where you 're coming from , I think , 
F:  but I don't think we can ignore it . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  so , um , 
F:  there 's  there 's , uh  
F:  This is complex . 
F:  So , ultimately , uh , as I was saying , I think it doesn't fit within their image that you switch nets based on language . 
F:  Now , can you include , uh , the  the target language ? 
F:  Um , from a purist 's standpoint it 'd be nice not to 
F:  because then you can say when  
F:  because surely someone is going to say at some point , " OK , so you put in the German and the Finnish . 
F:  Uh , now , what do you do , uh , when somebody has Portuguese ? " 
F:  you know ? 
F:  Um , and  Uh , however , you aren't  it isn't actually a constraint in this evaluation . 
F:  So I would say if it looks like there 's a big difference to put it in , then we 'd make note of it , and then we probably put in the other , 
F:  because we have so many other problems in trying to get things to work well here that  that , you know , it 's not so bad as long as we  we note it and say , " Look , we did do this " . 
F:  Uh . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , cuz the truth is , is that it 's  it 's not like there are  I mean , al although there are thousands of languages , uh , from uh , uh , the point of view of cellular companies , there aren't . 
F:  There 's  <laugh> you know , there 's fifty or something , 
F:  you know ? 
F:  So , 
F:  uh , an and they aren't  you know , with the exception of Finnish , which I guess it 's pretty different from most  most things . 
F:  uh , it 's  it 's , uh  most of them are like at least some of the others . 
F:  And so , our guess that Spanish is like Italian , and  and so on . 
F:  I guess Finnish is a  is  is a little bit like Hungarian , supposedly , 
F:  right ? 
F:  Or is  
F:  I think  
F:  well , I kn oh , well I know that H uh , H I mean , I 'm not a linguist , but I guess Hungarian and Finnish and one of the  one of the languages from the former Soviet Union are in this sort of same family . 
F:  But they 're just these , you know , uh  countries that are pretty far apart from one another , have  I guess , people rode in on horses and brought their  
F:  OK . 
F:  Your turn . 
F:  Oh , good . 
F:  So are  are you going to be assimilated ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And again , when y just to clarify , when you 're talking about training up a net , you 're talking about training up a net for a tandem approach ? 
F:  And  and the inputs are PLP and delta and that sort of thing , 
F:  or  ? 
F:  Yeah , but your initial things you 're making one choice there , 
F:  right ? 
F:  Which is PLP , or something ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . Um , 
F:  so  so you take PLP and you  you , uh , do it  uh , you  you , uh , use HTK with it with the transformed features using a neural net that 's trained . 
F:  And the training could either be from Digits itself or from TIMIT . 
F:  And that 's the  
F:  and , and th and then the testing would be these other things which  which  which might be foreign language . 
F:  I see . 
F:  I  I  I get in the picture about the cube . 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Um , 
F:  I mean , those listening to this will not have a picture either , 
F:  so , um , I guess I 'm  I 'm not any worse off . 
F:  But 
F:  but at some point  somebody should just show me the cube . 
F:  It sounds s 
F:  I  I get  I think I get the general idea of it , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  Ah , but which Dan ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Well , especially when you go over the different languages again , 
F:  because you 'd  the different languages have different words for the different digits , 
F:  so it 's  
F:  I  I think it would , 
F:  but  but on the other hand it might be better . 
F:  Oh yeah , 
F:  but still @ @ probably use it . 
F:  I mean , 
F:  you know , I  I  I guess I 'm sounding cavalier , 
F:  but I mean , I think the point is you have , uh , a bunch of labels and  and they 're han hand uh  hand - marked . 
F:  Uh , I guess , actually , TIMIT was not entirely hand - marked . 
F:  It was automatically first , and then hand  hand - corrected . 
F:  But  but , um , uh , it  it , um , it might be a better source . 
F:  So , i it 's  
F:  you 're right . 
F:  It would be another interesting scientific question to ask , " Is it because it 's a broad source or because it was , you know , carefully ? " 
F:  uh . And that 's something you could ask , 
F:  but given limited time , I think the main thing is if it 's a better thing for going across languages on this training tandem system , 
F:  then it 's probably  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  You mean a superset , sort of . 
F:  Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Um , I forget if that happened starting with you , or was it  o or if it was Eric , afterwards who did that . 
F:  But I think , basically , there were several of the phones that were just hardly ever there . 
F:  Yeah , especially in a system like ours , which is a discriminative system . 
F:  You know , you 're really asking this net to learn . 
F:  It 's  it 's kind of hard . 
F:  i It 's actually pretty common that a lot of the recognition systems people use have things like  like , say thirty - nine , phone symbols , 
F:  right ? 
F:  Uh , and then they get the variety by  by bringing in the context , the phonetic context . 
F:  Uh . So we actually have an unusually large number in  in what we tend to use here . 
F:  Um . 
F:  So , a a actually  maybe  now you 've got me sort of intrigued . 
F:  What  there 's  
F:  Can you describe what  what 's on the cube ? 
F:  I mean  
F:  Yeah , yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  OK , 
F:  so even  even though the meeting recorder doesn't  doesn't , uh  
F:  and since you 're not running a video camera we won't get this , 
F:  but if you use a board it 'll help us anyway . 
F:  Uh , point out one of the limitations of this <laugh> medium , 
F:  but you 've got the wireless on , 
F:  right ? 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  so you can walk around . 
F:  Uh , he can't , actually , 
F:  but  
F:  He 's tethered . 
F:  Yeah and again  
F:  Yeah . So the  the training for HTK is always  that 's always set up for the individual test , 
F:  right ? 
F:  That there 's some training data and some test data . 
F:  So that 's different than this . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Uh - huh . Ah . Ah . 
F:  Well , y you do have a baseline system that 's m that 's mel cepstra , 
F:  right ? 
F:  So . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Probably should . 
F:  I mean at least  at least conceptually , you know , it doesn't meant you actually have to do it , 
F:  but 
F:  conceptually it makes sense as a  as a base line . 
F:  Um , I think OGI folks have been doing that , too . 
F:  D Because I think that for a bunch of their experiments they used , uh , mel cepstra , actually . 
F:  Um , of course that 's there and this is here and so on . 
F:  OK ? 
F:  Italian . 
F:  The newer one . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  so Carmen brought the Spanish , 
F:  and Stephane brought the French . 
F:  Is it French French or Belgian French ? 
F:  There 's a  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  probably so . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , Herve always insists that Belgian is  i is absolutely pure French , 
F:  has nothing to do with  
F:  but he says those  those  those Parisians talk funny . 
F:  Yeah they  
F:  they do , yeah . 
F:  Yeah .  But then he likes Belgian fries too , 
F:  so . 
F:  OK . 
F:  y And I think Stephane was saying there 's  there 's some broader s material in the French also ? 
F:  Spanish  
F:  I 'm just curious , Carmen  
F:  I mean , I couldn't tell if you were joking or  
F:  i Is it  is it Mexican Spanish , 
F:  or is it  
F:  Oh , no , no . 
F:  It 's  it 's Spanish from Spain , Spanish . 
F:  Yeah , OK . 
F:  Alright . 
F:  Spanish from Spain . 
F:  Yeah , we 're really covered there 
F:  now . OK . 
F:  And the French from France . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  From TI . 
F:  From  i It 's from Texas . 
F:  So may maybe it 's  
F:  So - s so it 's not really from the US either . 
F:  Is that  ? OK . 
F:  I think what they were saying was that , um , for this next test there 's gonna be some of the cases where they have the same type of noise as you were given before hand and some cases where you 're not . 
F:  So , presumably , that 'll be part of the topic of analysis of the  the test results , is how well you do when it 's matching noise and how well you do where it 's not . 
F:  I think that 's right . 
F:  Well , not if it 's not seen , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  OK . I mean , i i i i it does seem to me that a lot of times when you train with something that 's at least a little bit noisy it can  it can help you out in other kinds of noise 
F:  even if it 's not matching 
F:  just because there 's some more variance that you 've built into things . 
F:  But , but , uh , 
F:  uh , exactly how well it will work will depend on how near it is to what you had ahead of time . 
F:  So . OK , so that 's your training corpus , 
F:  and then your testing corpus  ? 
F:  Well , so , 
F:  yeah , 
F:  the final test , on a guess , is supposed to be German and Danish , 
F:  right ? 
F:  Oh , there 's a  there 's Spanish testing in the Aurora ? 
F:  OK , 
F:  so , uh , 
F:  something like seven things in each , uh  each column . 
F:  So that 's , uh , three hundred and forty - three , uh , <laugh> different systems that are going to be developed . 
F:  There 's three of you . 
F:  Uh , 
F:  so that 's 
F:  hundred and  <laugh> hundred and fourteen each . 
F:  What ? 
F:  Are you just trying to be difficult ? 
F:  I 'm just kidding . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So , 
F:  um  
F:  Yeah , 
F:  so I guess the question is how long does it take to do a  a training ? 
F:  I mean , it 's not totally crazy 
F:  t I mean , these are  a lot of these are built - in things 
F:  and we know  we have programs that compute PLP , 
F:  we have MSG , 
F:  we have JRA 
F:  you know , a lot of these things will just kind of happen , 
F:  won't take uh a huge amount of development , 
F:  it 's just trying it out . 
F:  So , we actually can do quite a few experiments . 
F:  But how  how long does it take , do we think , for one of these   trainings ? 
F:  Oh yeah , 
F:  that 's right . 
F:  I mean , cuz , 
F:  so , for instance , I think the major advantage of MSG  
F:  Yeah , 
F:  good point . 
F:  A major advantage of MSG , I see , th that we 've seen in the past is combined with PLP . 
F:  Um . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  so , I mean , 
F:  you don't wanna , 
F:  uh  
F:  Let 's see , 
F:  seven choose two would  <laugh>  be , uh , twenty - one different combinations . 
F:  Um . 
F:  Probably  
F:  What ? 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  I hope not . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  there 's  
F:  Uh , 
F:  yeah , 
F:  so PLP and MSG I think we definitely wanna try 
F:  cuz we 've had a lot of good experience with putting those together . 
F:  Um . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Well , so  
F:  I mean , 
F:  so i it doesn't increase the number of trainings . 
F:  Uh , I don't think so . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  I mean , it 's just more compu 
F:  Excuse me ? 
F:  Oh yeah , 
F:  we haven't talked about any of that at all , 
F:  have we ? 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  so , there 's not really a limit . 
F:  What it is is that there 's  there 's , uh  it 's just penalty , 
F:  you know ? 
F:  That  that if you 're using , uh , a megabyte , then they 'll say that 's very nice , 
F:  but , of course , it will never go on a cheap cell phone . 
F:  Um . 
F:  And , 
F:  u uh , I think the computation isn't so much of a problem . 
F:  I think it 's more the memory . 
F:  Uh , and , expensive cell phones , exa expensive hand - helds , and so forth , are gonna have lots of memory . 
F:  So it 's just that , uh , these people see the  the cheap cell phones as being still the biggest market , 
F:  so . 
F:  Um . 
F:  But , yeah , 
F:  I was just realizing that , actually , it doesn't explode out , 
F:  um  
F:  It 's not really two to the seventh . 
F:  But it 's  but  but  i i it doesn't really explode out the number of trainings 
F:  cuz these were all trained individually . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  So , 
F:  uh , if you have all of these nets trained some place , then , uh , you can combine their outputs and do the KL transformation and so forth 
F:  and  and , uh  
F:  So , what it  it blows out is the number of uh testings . 
F:  And , you know  and the number of times you do that last part . 
F:  But that last part , I think , is so  has gotta be pretty quick , 
F:  so . 
F:  Uh . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  I mean , it 's just running the data through  
F:  Well , you gotta do the KL transformation , 
F:  but  
F:  Good question . 
F:  One would think one net , 
F:  but we 've  I don't think we 've tested that . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  so , I guess the first thing is if w if we know how much a  how long a  a training takes , 
F:  if we can train up all these  these combinations , uh , then we can start working on testing of them individually , and in combination . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  Because the putting them in combination , I think , is not as much computationally as the r training of the nets in the first place . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  So y you do have to compute the KL transformation . 
F:  Uh , 
F:  which is a little bit , 
F:  but it 's not too much . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So it 's  
F:  Uh , right . 
F:  Right . 
F:  So if you do have lots of combinations , it 's  
F:  How long does it take for an , uh , HTK training ? 
F:  For HTK ? 
F:  Really ? 
F:  Running on what ? 
F:  No , 
F:  I 'm sorry , 
F:  ru running on what machine ? 
F:  Uh , 
F:  I don't know what Ravioli is . 
F:  Is it  is it an Ultra - five , 
F:  or is it a  ? 
F:  It 's a few hours . 
F:  Yeah . <inbreath> Right , 
F:  so , 
F:  I mean , 
F:  clearly , there  there 's no way we can even begin to do an any significant amount here unless we use multiple machines . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  So  so  w we  
F:  I mean there 's plenty of machines here 
F:  and they 're n they 're often not in  in a great  great deal of use . 
F:  So , I mean , I think it 's  it 's key that  that the  that you look at , uh , you know , what machines are fast , what machines are used a lot  
F:  Uh , are we still using P - make ? 
F:  Is that  ? 
F:  Well , you have a  
F:  I mean , once you get the basic thing set up , you have just all the  uh , a all these combinations , 
F:  right ? 
F:  Um . 
F:  It 's  it 's  let 's say it 's six hours or eight hours , or something for the training of HTK . 
F:  How long is it for training of  of , uh , the neural net ? 
F:  Uh , 
F:  but on what machine ? 
F:  OK , 
F:  again , we do have a bunch of SPERT boards . 
F:  And I think there  there  there 's  I think you folks are probably go the ones using them right now . 
F:  Uh , don't know . 
F:  Used to be . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So you could be  
F:  we have quite a few SPERT boards . 
F:  You could set up , uh , you know , ten different jobs , or something , to run on SPERT  different SPERT boards 
F:  and  and have ten other jobs running on different computers . 
F:  So , it 's got to take that sort of thing , 
F:  or  or we 're not going to get through any significant number of these . 

F:  So this is  
F:  Yeah , I mean , 
F:  I kind of like this because what it  
F:  No  
F:  uh , no , what I like about it is 
F:  we  we  we do have a problem 
F:  that we have very limited time . 
F:  You know , 
F:  so , with very limited time , we actually have really quite a  quite a bit of computational resource available 
F:  if you , you know , get a look across the institute and how little things are being used . 
F:  And uh , 
F:  on the other hand , almost anything that really i you know , is  is new , where we 're saying , " Well , let 's look at , like we were talking before about , uh , uh , voiced - unvoiced - silence detection features and all those sort  " that 's  
F:  I think it 's a great thing to go to . 
F:  But if it 's new , then we have this development and  and  and learning process t to  to go through on top of  just the  the  all the  all the work . 
F:  So , I  I  I don't see how we 'd do it . 
F:  So what I like about this is you basically have listed all the things that we already know how to do . 
F:  And  and all the kinds of data that we , at this point , already have . 
F:  And , uh , you 're just saying let 's look at the outer product of all of these things 
F:  and see if we can calculate them . 
F:  a a Am I  am I interpreting this correctly ? 
F:  Is this sort of what  what you 're thinking of doing in the short term ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  So  so then I think it 's just the  the missing piece is that you need to , uh , you know  you know , talk to  talk to , uh , Chuck , talk to , uh , Adam , 
F:  uh , sort out about , uh , what 's the best way to really , you know , attack this as a  as a  as a mass problem in terms of using many machines . 
F:  Uh , 
F:  and uh , then , you know , set it up in terms of scripts and so forth , and  uh , in  in kind o some kind of structured way . 
F:  Uh . 
F:  Um , and , you know , when we go to , uh , OGI next week , uh , we can then present to them , you know , what it is that we 're doing . 
F:  And , uh , we can pull things out of this list that we think they are doing sufficiently , 
F:  that , you know , we 're not  we won't be contributing that much . 
F:  Um . 
F:  And , uh  
F:  Then , uh , like , we 're there . 
F:  Broader class ? 
F:  Oh , 
F:  it 's not actually broader class , 
F:  it 's actually finer class , 
F:  but you mean  y You mean <laugh> more classes . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Carmen , did you  do you have something else to add ? 
F:  We  you haven't talked too much , 
F:  and  
F:  Well , um , JRASTA has the potential to do better , 
F:  but it doesn't always . 
F:  It 's  i i JRASTA is more complicated . 
F:  It 's  it 's , uh  instead of doing RASTA with a log , you 're doing RASTA with a log - like function that varies depending on a J parameter , 
F:  uh , which is supposed to be sensitive to the amount of noise there is . 
F:  So , it 's sort of like the right transformation to do the filtering in , is dependent on how much noise there is . 
F:  And so in JRASTA you attempt to do that . 
F:  It 's a little complicated 
F:  because once you do that , you end up in some funny domain 
F:  and you end up having to do a transformation afterwards , 
F:  which requires some tables . 
F:  And , uh , 
F:  so it 's  it 's  it 's a little messier , 
F:  uh , there 's more ways that it can go wrong , 
F:  uh , but if  if  if you 're careful with it , it can do better . 
F:  So , it 's  
F:  So . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I  I didn't understand . 
F:  Oh , 
F:  " l labeled " . 
F:  I 'm sorry , 
F:  I have a p I had a problem with <laugh> the pronunciation . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  OK . 
F:  So , 
F:  OK , 
F:  so let 's start over . 
F:  So , TI TIMI TIMIT 's hand - labeled , 
F:  and  and you 're saying about the Spanish ? 
F:  Oh , I see . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  OK , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  So you 
F:  Sure . 
F:  So it 's just usual kind of uh  sometimes say housekeeping , 
F:  right ? 
F:  To get these  get these things sorted out . 
F:  So it seems like there 's  there 's some peculiarities of the , uh  of each of these dimensions that are getting sorted out . 
F:  And then , um , if  if you work on getting the , uh , assembly lines together , and then the  the pieces sort of get ready to go into the assembly line 
F:  and gradually can start , you know , start turning the crank , more or less . 
F:  And , uh , uh , 
F:  we have a lot more computational capability here than they do at OGI , 
F:  so I think that i if  
F:  What 's  what 's great about this is it sets it up in a very systematic way , 
F:  so that , uh , once these  all of these , you know , mundane but real problems get sorted out , we can just start turning the crank 
F:  and  and push all of us through , 
F:  and then finally figure out what 's best . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Oh , yeah , yeah , 
F:  sure . 
F:  No , I 'm just saying , I 'm just thinking of it like loops , 
F:  right ? 
F:  And so , y y y if you had three nested loops , that you have a choice for this , a choice for this , and a choice for that , 
F:  right ? 
F:  And you 're going through them all . 
F:  That  that 's what I meant . 
F:  And , uh , the thing is that once you get a better handle on how much you can realistically do , uh , um , <mouth> concurrently on different machines , different SPERTs , and so forth , uh , and you see how long it takes on what machine and so forth , you can stand back from it and say , " OK , if we look at all these combinations we 're talking about , and combinations of combinations , and so forth , " you 'll probably find you can't do it all . 
F:  OK , 
F:  so then at that point , uh , we should sort out which ones do we throw away . 
F:  Which of the combinations across  you know , what are the most likely ones , 
F:  and  
F:  And , uh , 
F:  I still think we could do a lot of them . 
F:  I mean , it wouldn't surprise me if we could do a hundred of them or something . 
F:  But , probably when you include all the combinations , you 're actually talking about a thousand of them or something , 
F:  and that 's probably more than we can do . 
F:  Uh , 
F:  but a hundred is a lot . 
F:  And  and , uh , um  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  His  his stuff is somewhere else , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  I mean , my point 
F:  I  I want to  
F:  Yeah , 
F:  thanks for bring it back to that . 
F:  My  th I want to clarify my point about that  that  that Chuck repeated in his note . 
F:  Um . 
F:  We 're  over the next year or two , we 're gonna be upgrading the networks in this place , 
F:  but right now they 're still all te pretty much all ten megabit lines . 
F:  And we have reached the  this  the machines are getting faster and faster . 
F:  So , it actually has reached the point where it 's a significant drag on the time for something to move the data from one place to another . 
F:  So , you  you don't w especially in something with repetitive computation where you 're going over it multiple times , you do  don't want to have the  the data that you 're working on distant from where it 's being  where the computation 's being done if you can help it . 
F:  Uh . 
F:  Now , we are getting more disk for the central file server , 
F:  which , since it 's not a computational server , would seem to be a contradiction to what I just said . 
F:  But the idea is that , uh , suppose you 're working with , uh , this big bunch of multi multilingual databases . 
F:  Um , 
F:  you put them all in the central ser at the cen central file server . 
F:  Then , when you 're working with something and accessing it many times , you copy the piece of it that you 're working with over to some place that 's close to where the computation is and then do all the work there . 
F:  And then that way you  you won't have the  the network  you won't be clogging the network for yourself and others . 
F:  That 's the idea . 
F:  So , uh , it 's gonna take us  
F:  It may be too late for this , uh , p precise crunch we 're in now , 
F:  but , uh , 
F:  we 're , 
F:  uh  
F:  It 's gonna take us a couple weeks at least to get the , uh , uh , the amount of disk we 're gonna be getting . We 're actually gonna get , 
F:  uh , I think four more , uh , thirty - six gigabyte drives 
F:  and , uh , put them on another  another disk rack . 
F:  We ran out of space on the disk rack that we had , 
F:  so we 're getting another disk rack and <laugh> four more drives to share between , uh  primarily between this project and the Meetings  Meetings Project . 
F:  Um . 
F:  But , uh , 
F:  we 've put another  I guess there 's another eighteen gigabytes that 's  that 's in there now to help us with the immediate crunch . 
F:  But , uh , 
F:  are you saying  
F:  So I don't know where  you 're  
F:  Stephane , where you 're doing your computations . 
F:  If  i so , you 're on an NT machine , 
F:  so you 're using some external machine 
F:  Do you know these yet ? 
F:  Yeah , OK . 
F:  Uh , 
F:  are these  are these , uh , computational servers , or something ? 
F:  I 'm  I 've been kind of out of it . 
F:  Unfortunately , these days my idea of running comput of computa doing computation is running a spread sheet . 
F:  So . 
F:  Uh , 
F:  haven't been  haven't been doing much computing personally , 
F:  so . 
F:  Um . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  so those are computational servers . 
F:  So I guess the other question is what disk there i space there is there on the computational servers . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  Well , you 're the  you 're the disk czar now . 
F:  So 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , so basically , uh , Chuck will be the one who will be sorting out what disk needs to be where , and so on , 
F:  and I 'll be the one who says , " OK , spend the money . " 
F:  So . <laugh> Which , I mean , n 
F:  these days , uh , if you 're talking about scratch space , it doesn't increase the , uh , need for backup , 
F:  and , uh , I think it 's not that big a d 
F:  and the  the disks themselves are not that expensive . 
F:  Right now it 's  
F:  But wasn't it , uh  
F:  I think Dave was saying that he preferred that people didn't put stuff in slash - scratch . 
F:  It 's more putting in d s XA or XB or , 
F:  right ? 
F:  I see . 
F:  Right , 
F:  so es so especially if you 're  right , if you 're  if you 're taking some piece of the training corpus , which usually resides in where Chuck is putting it all on the  on the , uh , file server , uh , then , yeah , it 's fine if it 's not backed up 
F:  because if it g g gets wiped out or something , y I mean it is backed up on the other disk . 
F:  So , 
F:  yeah , 
F:  OK . 
F:  Sure . 
F:  Um , 
F:  yeah , 
F:  I  I just  
F:  an another question occurred to me is  is what were you folks planning to do about normalization ? 
F:  This being  ? 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  I think that 's a good idea . 
F:  I mean it 's i i we  we seem to have enough dimensions as it is . 
F:  So probably if we <laugh> sort of take their  
F:  probably the on - line  line normalization 
F:  because then it   it 's  if we do anything else , we 're gonna end up having to do on - line normalization too , 
F:  so we may as well just do on - line normalization . 
F:  So . 
F:  Um . So that it 's plausible for the final thing . 
F:  Good . 
F:  Um . 
F:  So , I guess , 
F:  yeah , th the other topic  
F:  I  maybe we 're already there , or almost there , is goals for the  for next week 's meeting . 
F:  Uh . i i i it seems to me that we wanna do is flush out what you put on the board here . 
F:  Uh . 
F:  You know , maybe , have it be somewhat visual , a little bit . 
F:  Uh , 
F:  so w we can say what we 're doing , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  And , um , also , if you have  sorted out , um , this information about how long i roughly how long it takes to do on what and , you know , what we can  how many of these trainings , uh , uh , and testings and so forth that we can realistically do , uh , then one of the big goals of going there next week would be to  to actually settle on which of them we 're gonna do . 
F:  And , uh , when we come back we can charge in and do it . 
F:  Um . 
F:  Anything else that  
F:  I a a Actually  started out this  this field trip started off with  with , uh , Stephane talking to Hynek , 
F:  so you may have  you may have had other goals , uh , for going up , 
F:  and any anything else you can think of would be  we should think about  accomplishing ? 
F:  I mean , I 'm just saying this because  maybe there 's things we need to do in preparation . 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Uh . 
F:  Alright . 
F:  And uh  and the other  the  the last topic I had here was , um , uh d Dave 's fine offer to  to , uh , do something  <laugh> on this . 
F:  I mean he 's doing  <laugh>  he 's working on other things , 
F:  but to  to do something on this project . 
F:  So the question is , " Where  where could we , uh , uh , most use Dave 's help ? " 
F:  Yeah . 

F:  The only problem  
F:  I mean , maybe that 's the right thing  
F:  the only problem I have with it is exactly the same reason why you thought it 'd be a good thing to do . 
F:  Um , I  I think that  
F:  Let 's fall back to that . 
F:  But I think the first responsibility is sort of to figure out if there 's something  that , uh , an  an additional  
F:  Uh , 
F:  that 's a good thing you  remove the mike . 
F:  Go ahead , 
F:  good . 
F:  Uh , 
F:  uh . 
F:  What an additional clever person could help with when we 're really in a crunch for time . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  Cuz Dave 's gonna be around for a long time , 
F:  right ? 
F:  He 's  he 's gonna be here for years . 
F:  And so , um , 
F:  over years , if he 's  if he 's interested in , you know , voiced - unvoiced - silence , he could do a lot . 
F:  But if there  if in fact there 's something else  that he could be doing , that would help us when we 're  we 're sort of uh strapped for time  
F:  We have  we  we 've , you know , only ,  uh , another  another month or two  to  you know , with the holidays in the middle of it , um , to  to get a lot done . 
F:  If we can think of something  some piece of this that 's going to be  
F:  The very fact that it is sort of just work , and i and it 's running programs and so forth , is exactly why  it 's possible that it  some piece of could be handed to someone to do , 
F:  because it 's not  
F:  Uh , yeah , 
F:  so that  that 's the question . 
F:  And we don't have to solve it right this s second , 
F:  but if we could think of some  some piece that 's  that 's well defined , that he could help with , 
F:  he 's expressing a will willingness to do that . 
F:  Uh . 
F:  Uh . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  that 's something that needs to be done 
F:  in any event . 
F:  So what we were just saying is that  that , um  I was arguing for ,  if possible , coming up with something that  that really was development and wasn't research 
F:  because we  we 're  we have a time crunch . 
F:  And so , uh , if there 's something that would  would save some time that someone else could do on some other piece , then we should think of that first . 
F:  See the thing with voiced - unvoiced - silence is I really think that  that it 's  to do  to do a  a  a  a poor job is  is pretty quick , 
F:  uh , 
F:  or , you know , a so - so job . 
F:  You can  you can  you can throw in a couple fea 
F:  we know what  what kinds of features help with it . 
F:  You can throw something in . 
F:  You can do pretty well . 
F:  But I remember , in fact , when you were working on that , 
F:  and you worked on for few months , as I recall , 
F:  and you got to , say ninety - three percent , 
F:  and getting to ninety - four  <laugh> really really hard . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  So , 
F:  um  
F:  And th th the other tricky thing is , since we are , 
F:  uh , even though we 're not  we don't have a strict prohibition on memory size , and  and computational complexity , uh , clearly there 's some limitation to it . 
F:  So if we have to  if we say we have to have a pitch detector , say , if we  if we 're trying to incorporate pitch information , or at least some kind of harmonic  harmonicity , or something , this is another whole thing , 
F:  take a while to develop . 
F:  Anyway , it 's a very very interesting topic . 
F:  I mean , one  I think one of the  a lot of people would say , and I think Dan would also , uh , that one of the things wrong with current speech recognition is that we  we really do throw away all the harmonicity information . 
F:  Uh , we try to get spectral envelopes . 
F:  Reason for doing that is that most of the information about the phonetic identity is in the spectral envelopes are not in the harmonic detail . 
F:  But the harmonic detail does tell you something . 
F:  Like the fact that there is harmonic detail is  is real important . 
F:  So . 
F:  Um . 
F:  So , uh . 
F:  So I think  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So  wh that  so the  the other suggestion that just came up was , well what about having him  work on the , uh ,  multilingual super f superset  kind of thing . 
F:  Uh , coming up with that and then , you know , training it  training a net on that , say , um , from  from , uh  from TIMIT or something . 
F:  Is that  or uh , for multiple databases . 
F:  What  what would you  what would you think it would  
F:  wh what would this task consist of ? 
F:  Uh , creating a superset from looking at the multiple languages , 
F:  and then creating i m changing labels on TIMIT ? 
F:  Or on  or on multiple language  <hiccup> multiple languages ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Uh . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  What  
F:  Go ahead . 
F:  What , uh  
F:  Has OGI done anything about this issue ? 
F:  Do they have  Do they have any kind of superset that they already have ? 
F:  Aha . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  Uh , and that 's an interesting  way to go too . 
F:  So that does make an interesting question , though . 
F:  Is there 's some way that we should tie into that with this . 
F:  Um . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  I mean , if  if in fact that is a better thing to do ,  should we leverage that , rather than doing ,  um , our own . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  So , if i if  if they s 
F:  I mean , we have   i we have the  the trainings with our own categories . 
F:  And now we 're saying , " Well , how do we handle cross - language ? " 
F:  And one way is to come up with a superset , 
F:  but they are als they 're trying coming up with clustered , 
F:  and do we think there 's something wrong with that ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  What w 
F:  I see . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Although , you are not using this for the  
F:  You 're using this for the feature generation , 
F:  though , not the  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  But that 's what I thought they were gonna  
F:  Did they not do that , 
F:  or  ? 
F:  So  
F:  They 're talking about it , 
F:  but that 's sort of a question whether they did 
F:  because that 's  that 's the other route to go . 
F:  Instead of this , you know  
F:  Instead of the  the  the  the superclass thing , 
F:  which is to take  
F:  So suppose y you don't really mark arti 
F:  To really mark articulatory features , you really wanna look at the acoustics and  and see where everything is , 
F:  and we 're not gonna do that . 
F:  So , 
F:  uh , the second class way of doing it is  to look at the , uh , phones that are labeled 
F:  and translate them into acoustic  uh , uh  articulatory , uh , uh , features . 
F:  So it won't really be right . 
F:  You won't really have these overlapping  things and so forth , 
F:  but  
F:  Articulatory feature . 
F:  Right . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  You either do that or you have multiple nets . 

F:  Um . And , um 
F:  I don't know if our software  this  if the qu versions of the Quicknet that we 're using allows for that . 
F:  Do you know ? 
F:  Multiple targets being one ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  So that  that 'll work , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  OK . 
F:  So , um , 
F:  that 's another thing that could be done  
F:  is that we could  we could , uh , just translate  instead of translating to a superset ,  just translate to articulatory features , some set of articulatory features and train with that . 
F:  Now the fact  even though it 's a smaller number ,  it 's still fine 
F:  because you have the  the , uh , combinations . 
F:  So , in fact , it has every , you know  it had  has  has every distinction in it that you would have the other way . 
F:  But it should go across languages better . 
F:  No . 
F:  This was the guy that we were just talking a that we saw on campus . 
F:  So , this was Larry Saul who did this  did this . 
F:  He used sonorants . 
F:  Was what he was doing . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  He  he di he didn't mention that part . 
F:  But . 
F:  I see . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Should be . 
F:  Because if you get all of them in there , that defines all of the phones . 
F:  So that 's  that 's equivalent to saying that you 've got  <laugh> got all the phones right . 
F:  So , if that doesn't help , there 's  
F:  Although , yeah , it would be  make an interesting cheating experiment 
F:  because we are using it in this funny way , 
F:  where we 're converting it into features . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Did we just run out of disk , 
F:  or  ? 
F:  So , we 're  we 're  we 're off the air , 
F:  or  ? 
F:  About to be off the air .
