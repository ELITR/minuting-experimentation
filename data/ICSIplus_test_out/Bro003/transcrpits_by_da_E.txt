E:  Yeah . 
E:  Hello . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  At six . 
E:  Fill in the cube . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  To fill in the cube . 
E:  Oh . 
E:  Sixty - one . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I th I looks the SAMPA SAMPA phone . 
E:  SAMPA phone ? For English  uh American English , and the  the  the language who have more phone are the English . 
E:  Of the  these language . 
E:  But n for example , in Spain , the Spanish have several phone that d doesn't appear in the E English and we thought to complete . 
E:  But for that , it needs  we must r h do a lot of work <laugh> because we need to generate new tran transcription for the database that we have . 
E:  Yeah . Yeah . 
E:  Yeah databases . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Without the  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And Italian . 
E:  Uh , no , Italian no . 
E:  Italian no . 
E:  I Italian yes . 
E:  Italian ? 
E:  Like Mexican Spain and Spain . 
E:  I think that is more important , 
E:  Mexican Spain . 
E:  Because more people  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  And Spanish too . 
E:  Albayzin is the name . 
E:  Spanish stories ? 
E:  No . 
E:  No . 
E:  No . Albayz 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  No no no no . 
E:  No no no no . 
E:  Spanish from Spain . 
E:  Finnish . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  it 's preparing . 
E:  They are preparing . 
E:  Also , we can clean that . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  No . 
E:  Here . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Necessary to put in . 
E:  Database three . 
E:  The  the model  
E:  the HTK model . 
E:  It depends on the  
E:  More than six hours . 
E:  For the Italian , 
E:  yes . 
E:  Maybe one day . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Well . 
E:  Uh , M  MFCC . 
E:  Uh , Ravioli . 
E:  mmm 
E:  Um . Who is that ? 
E:  I don't know . 
E:  I don't know . 
E:  It depends . 
E:  Depends on the corpus . 
E:  For Albayzin I trained on neural network , 
E:  uh , was , um , one day also . 
E:  Uh . 
E:  I  I think the neural net SPERT . 
E:  Yes . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  D I begin to work with the Italian database to  nnn , to  with the f front - end and with the HTK program and the @ @ . 
E:  And I trained eh , with the Spanish two neural network with PLP and with LogRASTA PLP . 
E:  I don't know exactly what is better if  if LogRASTA or JRASTA . 
E:  Hm - hmm . 
E:  Hm - hmm . 
E:  It 's a bit  I 'll do better . 
E:  Um , and I think to  to  to recognize the Italian digits with the neural netw Spanish neural network , 
E:  and also to train another neural network with the Spanish digits , 
E:  the database of Spanish digits . 
E:  And I working that . 
E:  But prepa to prepare the  the database are difficult . 
E:  Was for me , n it was a difficult work last week with the labels 
E:  because the  the program with the label obtained that I have , the Albayzin , is different w to the label to train the neural network . 
E:  And  <mouth> that is another work that we must to do , to  to change . 
E:  Uh , for example Albayzin database was labeled automatically with HTK . 
E:  It 's not hand  
E:  it 's not labels by hand . 
E:  Labels . 
E:  I 'm sorry , 
E:  I 'm sorry . 
E:  The labels . 
E:  I 'm sorry . 
E:  The labels . 
E:  Oh , also that  
E:  Yes . 
E:  The Spanish labels ? 
E:  That was in different format , 
E:  that the format for the em  the program to train the neural network . 
E:  I necessary to convert . 
E:  And someti 
E:  well  
E:  It 's  it 's  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  but n 
E:  yes , 
E:  because they have one program , Feacalc , 
E:  but no , l LabeCut , 
E:  l LabeCut , but don't  doesn't , eh , include the HTK format to convert . 
E:  And , 
E:  I don't know what . 
E:  I ask  e even I ask to Dan Ellis what I can do that , 
E:  and h they  he say me that h he does doesn't any  any s any form to  to do that . 
E:  And at the end , I think that with LabeCut I can transfer to ASCII format , 
E:  and HTK is an ASCII format . 
E:  And I m do another , uh , one program to put ASCII format of HTK to ase ay ac ASCII format to Exceed 
E:  and they used LabCut to  <laugh> to pass . 
E:  Actually that was complicated , 
E:  but well , I know how we can did that  do that . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yes , 
E:  maybe to , mmm , put together the  the label  the labels between TIMIT and Spanish or something like that . 
E:  Yes . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  No . 
E:  The multiple language . 
E:  Maybe for the other language 
E:  because TIMIT have more phone . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  the tr the transcription , though , for Albayzin is n the transcription are of SAMPA the same , uh , how you say , symbol that SAMPA appear . 
E:  But I don't know if TIMIT o how is TIMIT . 
E:  Yeah .
