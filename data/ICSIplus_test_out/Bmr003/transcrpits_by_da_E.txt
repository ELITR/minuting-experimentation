E:  OK . 
E:  OK , this is Jane on channel five . 
E:  Oh , darn , what am I doing wrong ? 
E:  Uh , screen no ,  
E:  it is , 
E:  oh , maybe it just warmed up ? 
E:  Oh , darn , 
E:  can you can't see channel five yet ? 
E:  Oh , this would be k 
E:  OK , 
E:  is that better ? 
E:  Hello , 
E:  hello . 
E:  Alright . 
E:  Would you like to join the meeting ? 
E:  I bet  
E:  This is abou we 're  we 're mainly being taped but we 're gonna talk about , uh , transcription for the m future meeting meetings . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  e 
E:  OK . 
E:  Y you 'd be welcome . 
E:  You 'd be welcome . 
E:  Why didn't I  you were saying that 
E:  but I could hear you really well on the  on the transcription  on the , uh , tape . 
E:  It 's badly designed . 
E:  So that 's what you 're d He 's got it on his temples so it cuts off his circulation . 
E:  Try it . 
E:  We could do it with noise . 
E:  Uh , this is the same one I had before . 
E:  No 
E:  Now , just to be sure , the numbers on the back , this is the channel ? 
E:  That 's the microphone number . 
E:  Uh - oh . 
E:  OK , good . 
E:  Five  
E:  Good . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Well , this is Jane , on mike number five . 
E:  Um . 
E:  I just start ? 
E:  Do I need to say anything more ? 
E:  Uh , you said turn off the what ? 
E:  Oh . 
E:  Oh , I see . 
E:  I See . 
E:  Oh , OK . 
E:  I do wish there were big booms coming down from the ceiling . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
E:  You know . 
E:  Oh , that 'll be good . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  that 's right . 
E:  Oh , that 's better . 
E:  That 's better . 
E:  Yeah , it 's noticeable . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  I think candles would be nice if they don't make noise . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  I saw it . 
E:  I 've been watching for that corpus . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  They had people come in to a certain degree and they  and they have DAT recorders . 
E:  I  I assume so , actually , 
E:  I hadn't thought about that . 
E:  Unless they added close field later on 
E:  but , um , I 've listened to some of those data 
E:  and I , um , I 've been  I  I was actually on the advisory board for when they set the project up . 
E:  I 'm glad to see that it got released . 
E:  So it it 's a very nice thing . 
E:  How do you mean  do you mean mechanical adaptation or  
E:  OK . 
E:  Great idea . 
E:  And  and their recording conditions are really clean . 
E:  I mean , I 've  I 've heard  I 've listened to the data . 
E:  It sounds  
E:  well but what I mean is that , um  
E:  Um , oh , 
E:  good question 
E:  and I can't ans answer it . 
E:  I don't know . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  The other thing too is from  from a  
E:  The other thing too is that their their jus their transcription format is really nice and simple in  in the discourse domain . 
E:  But they also mentioned that they have it time aligned . 
E:  I mean , I s I  I saw that write - up . 
E:  It 's very nice . 
E:  CSAE . 
E:  Corpus of Spoken American English . 
E:  Yeah , sp I 've been  I was really pleased to see that . 
E:  I knew that they  <breath> they had had some funding problems in completing it 
E:  but , um , 
E:  this is clever . 
E:  Got it through the LDC . 
E:  Great . 
E:  Great . 
E:  Super . 
E:  Super . 
E:  Great . 
E:  Yeah , that  I mean , they 're really well respected in the linguistics d side too and the discourse area , 
E:  and  
E:  So this is a very good corpus . 
E:  OK . 
E:  I did include a glo  uh , a certain first pass . 
E:  My  my view on it was when you have a repair <breath> then , uh  it seems  
E:  I mean , we saw , there was this presentation in the  one of the speech group meetings about how  
E:  and I think Liz has done some stuff too on that , that it , uh  <breath> that you get it bracketed in terms of like  
E:  well , if it 's parenthetical , which I know that Liz has worked on , then <breath> uh  y y you 'll have different prosodic aspects . 
E:  And then also <breath> if it 's a r if it 's a repair where they 're  like what I just did , <laugh> then it 's nice to have sort of a sense of the continuity of the utterance , 
E:  the start to be to the finish . 
E:  And , uh , it 's a little bit deceptive if you include the repai the pre - repair part  
E:  and sometimes or of it 's in the middle . 
E:  Anyway , <breath> so what I was doing was bracketing them to indicate that they were repairs 
E:  which isn't uh , very time - consuming . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  As a pilot study . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  as a pilot study . 
E:  That 's right , 
E:  that 's right . 
E:  I wanna hear about these  uh , we have a g you were s continuing with the transcription conventions for s 
E:  No , <laugh> that 's  
E:  I object to that characterization ! 
E:  Oh , thank you . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Well th there is als 
E:  Yeah , really . 
E:  There is also the o other possibility which is if you can provide not money but instructional experience or some other perks , <breath> you can  you could get people to  to um , to do it in exchange . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  I 'm afraid I haven't made any progress in that front yet . 
E:  I should 've sent email and I haven't yet . 
E:  And I do have  
E:  I have  a bunch of hours , 
E:  yeah . 
E:  Actually that 's the  the one people usually use , ten X . 
E:  And I haven't really calculated  
E:  How fast am I ? 
E:  I haven't done a 
E:  s see , I 've been at the same time doing kind of a boot strapping in deciding on the transcription conventions that  that are  <breath> you know , and  and stuff like , you know , how much  
E:  There 's some interesting human factors problems like , <breath> yeah , what span of  of time is it useful to segment the thing into in order to uh , transcribe it the most quickly . 
E:  Cuz then , you know , you get like  <breath> if you get a span of five words , that 's easy . 
E:  But then you have to take the time to mark it . 
E:  And then there 's the issue of <breath> it 's easier to  <breath> hear it th right the first time if you 've marked it at a boundary instead of <breath> somewhere in the middle , 
E:  cuz then the word 's bisected or whatever 
E:  and  
E:  And 
E:  so I mean , I 've been sort of playing with , uh , different ways of mar cuz I 'm thinking , you know , I mean , if you could get optimal instructions you could cut back on the number of hours it would take . 
E:  No , it doesn't 
E:  but what a super tool . 
E:  It 's a great environment . 
E:  That 's an interesting idea . 
E:  Hey ! 
E:  That 's interesting . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  I 
E:  That 'd be fun . 
E:  No , 
E:  uh the  the boundary  
E:  boundary . 
E:  That 's ideal . 
E:  Although I was  I  you know , the alternative , which I was sort of experimenting with before I ran out of time , <laugh> recently was , <breath> um  <breath> that , you know , ev if it were like an arbitrary segment of time  i t pre - marked 
E:  cuz it does take time to put those markings in . 
E:  It 's really the i the interface is wonderful 
E:  because , you know , the time it takes is you listen to it , <breath> and then you press the return key . 
E:  But then , you know , it 's like , <breath> uh , you press the tab key to stop the flow and  <breath> and , uh , the return key to p to put in a marking of the boundary . 
E:  But , you know , obviously there 's a lag between when you hear it and when you can press the return key 
E:  so it 's slightly delayed , 
E:  so then you  you listen to it a second time and move it over to here . 
E:  So that takes time . 
E:  Now if it could all be pre - marked at some , <breath> l you know , good  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  uh , not in this case . 
E:  It has other  
E:  Oh , interesting point . 
E:  Ah !  Interesting point . 
E:  OK , that would make a difference . 
E:  I mean , it 's not bad 
E:  but it does  take twice . 
E:  Oh , good point ! 
E:  Ah ! 
E:  We 've got volume . 
E:  Wow . 
E:  But  but it op 
E:  I 'm sorry . 
E:  I wish you had told me  
E:  wish you 'd told me . 
E:  At what part ? 
E:  OK , 
E:  I 'm alright . 
E:  Could you get it so that with  so it would  it would detect volume on a channel and insert a marker ? 
E:  And the  the format 's really transparent . 
E:  It 's just a matter of <breath> a very c clear  
E:  it 's XML , isn't it ? 
E:  It 's very  I mean , I looked at the  the file format and it 's just  it has a t a time  <breath> a time indication and then something or other , and then an end time or something or other . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yes I have . 
E:  S I 'm not sure if it 's that 's much 
E:  but anyway , enough to work with . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Good idea . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah , that 's what I was thinking . 
E:  I 'd  I 'd be cheating a little bit g with familiarity effect . 
E:  No . 
E:  Now , there 's a plan . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Oh , yeah . 
E:  I 'll do that tomorrow . 
E:  I should have it finished by the end of the day . 
E:  Exactly . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Well , uh but there 's an extra problem which is that I didn't really keep accurate  
E:  uh , it wasn't a pure task the first time , 
E:  so  <breath> uh , it 's gonna be an upper bound in  in that case . 
E:  And it 's not really strictly comparable . 
E:  So I think though it 's a good proposal to be used on a new  a new batch of text that I haven't yet done yet in the same meeting . Could use it on the next segment of the text . 
E:  Well , but couldn't I do it for the next  
E:  Oh , I see what you mean . 
E:  Well , but the oracle boundaries would come from volume on a partic specific channel wouldn't they ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh , I see what you mean . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I see . 
E:  OK . 
E:  That 's good . 
E:  I like that . 
E:  And the other thing too is with  with speaker identification , 
E:  if  if that could handle speaker identification that 's a big deal . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah , I mean , that 's a nice feature . 
E:  That 's a major  that 's like , one of the two things that  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  That 'd be so great . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  We didn't finish the  the part of work already completed on this , 
E:  did we ? 
E:  I mean , you  <breath> you talked a little bit about the transcription conventions , 
E:  and , I guess you 've mentioned in your progress report , or status report , that you had written a script to convert it into  
E:  So , <breath> I  when I  i the  it 's quickest for me in terms of <breath> the transcription part <breath> to say <breath> something like , you know , if  <breath> if Adam spoke to , um  to just say , " A colon " , 
E:  Like who could be , you know , I mean at the beginning of the line . 
E:  and E colon <breath> instead of entering the interface for speaker identification and clicking on the thing , uh , indicating the speaker ID . 
E:  So , and then he has a script that will convert it into the  the thing that , uh , would indicate speaker ID . 
E:  If that 's clear . 
E:  It 's Perl script . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's right . 
E:  Yeah , well that 's true , 
E:  but  
E:  What  i just approximately , what did you find out in terms of price or  or whatever ? 
E:  Of  of tape ? 
E:  Or of action ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Oh , of their  
E:  Oh ! 
E:  OK . 
E:  Interesting . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And then there 's the problem also that  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's very interesting . 
E:  Talk <breath> slowly but with few words . 
E:  There you go . 
E:  We could have some telegraphic meetings . 
E:  That might be interesting . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I think uh that would give us a  a good  good estimate . 
E:  I 'd  I 'd say  
E:  yeah , I was gonna say eight  
E:  you 'd say ten ? 
E:  Yeah , that 's right . 
E:  That 's right . 
E:  And there 's another aspect too . 
E:  The other thing too is that , uh , if they were linguistics they 'd be  you know , in terms of like the post editing , i uh  tu uh content wise they might be easier to handle 
E:  cuz they might get it more right the first time . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Good point . 
E:  Good point . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Oh , interesting . 
E:  Um , now would this involve some manner of uh , monetary compensation 
E:  or would I be the voluntary , uh , coordinator of multiple transcribers for checking ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  Oh , 
E:  I don't wanna stop working for Dave . 
E:  Oh , cool . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  We 'll see . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Oh , I see . 
E:  Well  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , I see . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Boy , if I wanted to increase my income I could start doing the transcribing again . 
E:  I see . 
E:  Good . 
E:  Yeah , no , that  I  I would be interested in that  in becoming involved in the project in some aspect like that  
E:  more . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yes . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  What  Well , you know what I thought was right now we have p 
E:  So I gave him the proposal for the transcription conventions . 
E:  He made his , uh , suggestion of improvement . 
E:  The  the  It 's a good suggestion . 
E:  So as far as I 'm concerned those transcription conventions are fixed right now . 
E:  And so my next plan would be  
E:  They 're very minimal . 
E:  So , <breath> it would be good to  just to summarize that . 
E:  So , um , <breath> one of them is the idea of how to indicate speaker change , 
E:  and this is a way which meshes well with  with , uh , making it <breath> so that , uh , you know , on the  At the  
E:  Boy , it 's such a nice interface . 
E:  When you  when you get the , um  you  you get the speech signal you also get <breath> down beneath it , <breath> an indication of , <breath> uh , 
E:  if you have two speakers overlapping in a s in a single segment , you see them <breath> one  displayed one above each other . 
E:  And then at the same time <breath> the top s part of the screen is the actual verbatim thing . 
E:  You can clip  click on individual utterances and it 'll take you immediately to that part of the speech signal , and play it for you . 
E:  And you can , eh you can work pretty well between those two  these two things . 
E:  Oh . 
E:  Ho 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah , I do too . 
E:  Pre - lay . 
E:  Well , and they 've thought about things . 
E:  You know , I mean , they  they do have  
E:  So you have  when you  when you play it back , um , it 's  it is useful to have , uh , a  a break mark to  se segment it . 
E:  But it wouldn't be strictly necessary 
E:  cuz you can use the  uh , the tabbed key to toggle <breath> the sound on and off . 
E:  I mean , it 'll stop the s speech you know if you if you press a tab . 
E:  And , um . 
E:  And so , 
E:  uh , that 's a nice feature . 
E:  And then also once you 've put a break in then you have the option of <breath> cycling through the unit . 
E:  You could do it like multiply 
E:  until you get  crazy and decide to stop cycling through that unit . 
E:  Or  or  
E:  or  
E:  Why , that 's  
E:  That 's not something I wanted to have happen . 
E:  I see . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  I  I agree . 
E:  They  they have several options . 
E:  So , uh , you know , I mentioned the looping option . 
E:  Another option is it 'll pause when it reaches the end of the boundary . 
E:  And then to get to the next boundary you just press tab 
E:  and it goes on to the next unit . 
E:  I mean , it 's very nicely thought out . 
E:  They thought about  
E:  and also it 'll <breath> go around the c the , uh , 
E:  I wanna say cursor 
E:  but I 'm not sure if that 's the right thing . 
E:  Anyway , you can  so they thought about different ways of having windows that you c uh work within , 
E:  and  But so in terms of the con the conventions , then , <breath> uh , basically , <breath> uh , it 's strictly orthographic 
E:  which means with some w provisions for , uh , w uh , <breath> colloquial forms . 
E:  So if a person said , " cuz " instead of " because " then I put a  <breath> an apostrophe at the beginning of the word and then in  in double ang angle brackets what the full lexical item would be . 
E:  And this could be <breath> something that was handled by a table or something 
E:  but I think <breath> to have a convention marking it as a non - standard or wha I don't mean standard  but a  a  a non <breath> uh , ortho orthographic , uh , whatever . 
E:  " Gonna " or " wanna " , 
E:  you know , the same thing . 
E:  And  and there would be limits to how much refinement you want in indicating something as non - standard pres pronunciation . 
E:  Backchannels ? 
E:  Um , 
E:  you know  
E:  oh , yes , 
E:  there was some  
E:  in my view , when i when you 've got it densely overlapping , um , I didn't worry about  I didn't worry about s specific start times . 
E:  I sort of thought that this is not gonna be  easily processed anyway 
E:  and <breath> maybe I shouldn't spend too much time getting exactly when the person said <breath> " no " , or , you know , uh , i " immediate " . 
E:  And instead just sort of rendered " within this time slot , <breath> there were two people speaking during part of it 
E:  and <breath> if you want more detail , figure it out for yourself " , 
E:  was sort of the way I felt @ @  
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  That happened very seldom . 
E:  Oh , well , thank you Dan . 
E:  Appreciate it . 
E:  Well , if it  if there was a word like " right " , you know , then I wou I would indicate <breath> that it happened within the same tem time frame 
E:  but wouldn't say exactly when it happened . 
E:  A lot of overlapping , yeah . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  well that 's true . 
E:  That 's another issue . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Only when it was otherwise gonna be puzzling 
E:  because he was in the other room talking . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's true . 
E:  I know . 
E:  Well he was 
E:  so  so he was checking the meter levels 
E:  and  and we were handling things while he was labeling the  the whatever it was , 
E:  the PDA ? 

E:  And  and so he was  in  sort of  you were sort of talking  
E:  you know , 
E:  so I was saying , like  <breath> " and I could label this one left . 
E:  Right ? " 
E:  And he  and he said , " I don't see anything " . 
E:  And he said  <breath> he said , <breath> " I wasn't talking to you " . 
E:  Or  it wasn't  it didn't sound quite that rude . 
E:  But really , no , uh  w you know in the context if you know he can't hear what he 's saying  
E:  Uh , yeah , 
E:  I know . 
E:  Well , you 'll see . 
E:  You can listen to it . 
E:  Oh , I thought it was you who was . 
E:  No , well , but you were  you were asking off the wall questions . 
E:  And that 's w that 's where I added comments . 
E:  The rest of the time I didn't bother with who was talking to who 
E:  but  but this was unusual circum circumstance . 
E:  Well and part of it was funny , uh  reason was because it was a mixed signal 
E:  so you couldn't get any clues from volume <breath> that , you know , he was really far away from this conversation . 
E:  You couldn't do that symmetrically in any case . 
E:  That 's a good idea . 
E:  But I thought it would be  you know , I  I didn't wanna add more contextual comments than were needed 
E:  but that , it seemed to me , clarified that the con what was going on . 
E:  And , uh  
E:  OK , 
E:  so normalization  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK , my  my focus was to try and maintain conten con content continuity and , uh , to keep it within what he was saying . 
E:  Like <breath> I wouldn't say breath groups but prosodic or intonational groups as much as possible . 
E:  So <breath> if someone said " mm - hmm " in the middle of a  of someone 's , <breath> uh , uh , intonational contour , <breath> I  I indicated it as , like what you just did . 
E:  then I indicated it as a segment which contained <breath> @ @  this utterance plus an overlap . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  that 's right . 
E:  And you know , it could be made more precise than that 
E:  but I just thought  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh , I see what you mean . 
E:  And then  " hesitation " . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK , 
E:  and so then , uh , in terms of like words like " uh " and " um " I just wrote them 
E:  because I figured there 's a limited number , 
E:  and I keep them to a  uh , limited set 
E:  because it didn't matter if it was " mmm " or " um " ,  <breath> you know , versus " um " . 
E:  So I just always wrote it as U M . 
E:  And " uh - huh " , you know , " UHUH . " I mean , like a s set of like five . 
E:  But in any case  <breath> I didn't mark those . 
E:  I 'd be happy with that . 
E:  That 'd be fine . 
E:  It 'd be good to have that in the  in the conventions , what 's to be used . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  that 's a fine idea . 
E:  That 's a fine idea . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So I had  
E:  I d 
E:  Well , you see , that 's possible too . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Now that 's refinement that , uh , maybe it could be handled by part of the  part of the script or something more  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Well you were saying , I think it can read  
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Which allows five . 
E:  And it can be m edited after the fact , 
E:  can't it also ? 
E:  But their  but their format , if you wanted to in indicate the speakers right there instead of doing it through this indirect route , <breath> then i they  a c window comes up and it only allows you to enter two speakers . 
E:  So . 
E:  But . 
E:  And that  
E:  And that works nicely cuz this so quick to enter . 
E:  So I wouldn't wanna do it through the interface anyway adding which  worry who the speaker was . 
E:  And then , uh , let 's see what else . 
E:  Oh , yes , 
E:  I  I wanted to have  
E:  So sometimes a pers I  uh 
E:  in terms of like the continuity of thought <breath> for transcriptions , it 's  i it isn't just words coming out , 
E:  it 's like there 's some purpose for an utterance . 
E:  And <breath> sometimes someone will <breath> do a backchannel in the middle of it 
E:  but you wanna show that it 's continued at a later point . 
E:  So I have  I have a convention of putting like a dash <breath> arrow just to indicate that this person 's utterance continues . 
E:  And then when it uh , catches back up again then there 's an arrow dash , 
E:  and then you have the opposite direction <breath> to indicate continuation of ones own utterance versus , 
E:  um , 
E:  sometimes <breath> we had the situation which is  you know , which you  which you get in conversations ,  of someone continuing someone else 's utterance , 
E:  and in that case I did a tilde arrow versus a arrow tilde , <breath> to indicate that it was continuation 
E:  but it wasn't  
E:  Oh , I guess I did <breath> equal arrow for the  for the own  for yourself things 
E:  cuz it 's  the speakers the same . 
E:  And then tilde arrow if it was a different  if a different speaker , uh , con continuation .
