C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , go ahead . 
C:  Alright , and no crash . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Hmm , no connection . 
C:  I don't know when would be a good excuse for it , 
C:  but I just can't wait to be giving a talk t and  and  and use the example from last week with everybody t doing the digits at once . 
C:  I 'd love to play somebody that . 
C:  It was . 
C:  It was really efficient . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Everybody give the reports about what they were doing at exactly the same time , 
C:  yeah . 
C:  Actually isn't that what we have been doing ? 
C:  What are we doing ? 
C:  Yeah , and I 'm just  
C:  What conference ? 
C:  That is right . 
C:  The next weekend . 
C:  That 's when they 're coming . 
C:  That 's correct . 
C:  No , but that would be a good idea . 
C:  Why don't we w 
C:  They 're not even gonna be here until eleven or so . 
C:  Cuz they 're flying up that day . 
C:  Saturday . 
C:  Saturday . 
C:  S Saturday . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  No , I mean , they 're flying up from  from  
C:  down from Seattle . 
C:  Yeah , 
C:  and they 'll end up here . 
C:  So b and also Brian Kingsbury is actually flying from , uh , the east coast on that  that morning . 
C:  So , i I  I will be  I mean , he 's taking a very early flight 
C:  and we do have the time work difference running the right way , 
C:  but I still think that there 's no way we could start before eleven . 
C:  It might end up really being twelve . 
C:  So when we get closer we 'll find people 's plane schedules , and let everybody know . 
C:  Uh , So . That 's good . 
C:  Well we can start gathering those  those ideas , 
C:  but then we  we should firm it up by next  next Thursday 's meeting . 
C:  Yes 
C:  except that if they had  if there was a choice between having fifteen minutes that was fully the way you wanted it , and having a whole meeting that didn't get at what you wanted for them  
C:  It 's just dependent of how much  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Can we pipeline it so that say there 's , uh , the transcriber gets done with a quarter of the meeting and then we  you run it through this other  other stuff ? 
C:  Uh , 
C:  OK , so . 
C:  Oh , that 's right . 
C:  So the first thing is the automatic thing , 
C:  and then it 's  then it 's  then it 's the transcribers tightening stuff up , 
C:  and then it 's IBM . 
C:  OK , so you might as well ha run the automatic thing over the entire meeting , 
C:  and then  and then , uh , you would give IBM whatever was fixed . 
C:  Well , yeah , but start from the beginning and go to the end , 
C:  right ? 
C:  So if they were only half way through then that 's what you 'd give IBM . 
C:  Right ? 
C:  Why wouldn't we s @ @ w 
C:  i if they were going sequentially through it , why wouldn't we give them  
C:  I mean i are we trying to get something done by the time Brian comes ? 
C:  So if we  if we were , then it seems like giving them something , whatever they had gotten up to , would be better than nothing . 
C:  So you 're talking about tightening up time boundaries ? 
C:  So how do you  
C:  So I don't  
C:  I 'm  I 'm now entirely confused about what they do . 
C:  So , they 're  they 're looking at a mixed signal , 
C:  or they 're looking  
C:  what  what are they looking at visually ? 
C:  But the procedure that you 're imagining , I mean , people vary from this , is that they have the mixed signal wave form in front of them , 
C:  and they have multiple , 
C:  uh , well , let 's see , there isn't  we don't have transcription yet . 
C:  So  but there 's markers of some sort that have been happening automatically , 
C:  and those show up on the mixed signal ? 
C:  There 's a @ @ clicks ? 
C:  There 're separate ribbons . 
C:  And is there a line moving across the waveform as it goes ? 
C:  OK , so The way you 're imaging is they kind of play it , 
C:  and they see oh this happened , then this happened , then  and if it 's about right , they just sort of let it slide , 
C:  and if it  if it  there 's a question on something , they stop and maybe look at the individual wave form . 
C:  They  they might look at it , 
C:  right ? 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  So  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
C:  But right now , to do this limitation , the switching is going to be switching of the audio ? Is what she 's saying . 
C:  So  
C:  so they 're using their ears to do these markings anyway . 
C:  So , um , Done with that ? 

C:  Does any  I forget , 
C:  does anybody , uh , working on any  any Eurospeech submission related to this ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah there was that  we 
C:  that 's right , 
C:  we had that one conversation about , uh , what  what  what did it mean for , uh , one of those speakers to be pathological , 
C:  was it a  
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  There 's zero , a little bit , and a lot . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Y yeah . 
C:  Oh was it fifteen ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  What we 're calling . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  No , but there 's a little difference , 
C:  and we haven't looked at it for digits , 
C:  right ? 
C:  And so , 
C:  cuz  because what he was  what I was saying when I looked at those things is it  it  I was almost gonna call it quadrimodal because <laugh>  because there was a whole lot of cases where it was zero percent . 
C:  They just plain got it all right . 
C:  And then there  and then there was another bunch that were couple percent or something . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , 
C:  yeah . 
C:  I see . 
C:  I see . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Unless maybe we do this , uh , um , cancellation business . 
C:  Oh , the short amount of time thing , right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well 
C:  Yeah . 

C:  If you can feel confident that what the  yeah , that there 's actually something  
C:  that you 're not gonna miss something , 
C:  yeah . 
C:  That 's what he just said . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  Well I know what we 're not turning in to Eurospeech , 
C:  a redo of the HLT paper . 
C:  That  I don't wanna do that , 
C:  but . 
C:  Bleep . 
C:  You know , that wa that was the battery meter saying that it was fully charged , 
C:  yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  No I mean , i in  in your case , I mean , you were joking about it , but , I mean , your case the fact that your talking about similar things at a couple of conferences , it 's not  
C:  these are conferences that have d really different emphases . 
C:  Whereas HLT and  and Eurospeech , pretty  pretty  pretty similar , so I  I  I can't see really just putting in the same thing , 
C:  but  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Or some  or some  
C:  I mean , I would see Eurospeech  if we have some Eurospeech papers , these will be paper p p uh , submissions . 
C:  These will be things that are particular things , 
C:  aspects of it that we 're looking at , rather than , you know , attempt at a global paper about it . 
C:  Well . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  See ya . 
C:  I don't think we 'll go much longer . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK , 
C:  see ya . 
C:  Well , but I had it on  I had it on this morning and it was fine . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well , we should  We shou we should work on compressing the heads , and  
C:  Yeah 
C:  that 's good ! 
C:  Hang a five pound weight off the  off the back . 
C:  Weight . 
C:  Or maybe this could be helpful just for evening the conversation between people . 
C:  If people  those who talk a lot have to wear heavier weights or something , 
C:  and  
C:  and  um , 
C:  um , so , uh , what was I gonna say ? 
C:  Oh , yeah , I was gonna say , uh , I had these , uh , conversations with NIST folks also while I was there 
C:  and  and , uh , um , so they  they have their  their plan for a room , uh , with , um , mikes in the middle of the table , and , uh , close - mounted mikes , 
C:  and they 're talking about close - mounted and lapels , just cuz 
C:  sort of  and the array . 
C:  Yeah , so they were  
C:  And yeah , like multiple  multiple video cameras coverin covering every  everybody  every place in the room , 
C:  uh , the  yeah  the  the mikes in the middle , the head - mounted mikes , the lapel mikes , the array , uh , with  
C:  well , there 's some discussion of fifty - nine , 
C:  they might go down to fifty - seven 
C:  Because , uh , there is , uh , some pressure from a couple people at the meeting for them to use a KEMAR head . 
C:  I forget what KEMAR , uh , stands for , 
C:  but what it is is it 's dummy head that is very specially designed , 
C:  and  and  and , so what they 're actually doing is they 're really  there 's really two recording systems . 
C:  So they may not be precisely synchronous , but the but there 's two  two recording systems , 
C:  one with , I think , twenty - four channels , and one with sixty - four channels . 
C:  And the sixty - four channel one is for the array , 
C:  but they 've got some empty channels there , 
C:  and anyway they  like they 're saying they may give up a couple or something if  for  for the KEMAR head if they go  go with that . 
C:  So . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , I 'm not  too worried about that . 
C:  I was thinking  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  No , we just had some discussions , various discussions with them . 
C:  Um , yeah , we sh we should just have you  have you read it , but , I mea ba i i uh , we 've all got these little proceedings , 
C:  but , um , basically , it was about , um , uh , going to a new task where you have insufficient data and using  using data from something else , and adapting , and how well that works . 
C:  Uh , so in  in fact it was pretty related to what Liz and Andreas did , uh , except that this was not with meeting stuff , it was with 
C:  uh , like I think they s didn't they start off with Broadcast News system ? 
C:  And then they went to  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  TI - digits was one of them , and , uh , Wall Street Journal . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  Probably . 
C:  That might be hard . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , 
C:  sure . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , and they have  I mean  they have better adaptation than we had than that  that system , 
C:  so they  
C:  um , 
C:  yeah , we should probably what would  
C:  actually what we should do , uh , I haven't said anything about this , 
C:  but probably the five of us should pick out a paper or two that  that , uh , you know , got our interest , 
C:  and we should go around the room at one of the Tuesday lunch meetings and say , you know , what  what was good about the conference , 
C:  yeah . 
C:  Columbia have anything ? 
C:  No . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah , that was an interesting discussion , 
C:  uh , I 
C:  Well , I didn't have as much disagreement as I would have liked , 
C:  but I didn't wanna  I wouldn I didn't wanna get into it because , uh , you know , it was the application was one I didn't know anything about , 
C:  uh , it just would have been , you know , me getting up to be argumentative , 
C:  but  but , uh , 
C:  I mean , the missing thi 
C:  so  so what they were saying  it 's one of these things  is  you know , all you need is more data , sort of  
C:  But I mea i wh it  @ @ that 's  that 's dissing it , uh , improperly , 
C:  I mean , it was a nice study . 
C:  Uh , they were doing this  it wasn't word - sense disambiguation , it was  
C:  was it w was it word - sense ? 
C:  Yes . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Right . 
C:  And so , what they did was they had these different kinds of learning machines , and they had different amounts of data , 
C:  and so they did like , you know , eight different methods that everybody , you know , uh , argues about  about , " Oh my  my kind of learning machine is better than your kind of learning machine . " 
C:  And , uh , they were  started off with a million words that they used , 
C:  which was evidently a number that a lot of people doing that particular kind of task had been using . 
C:  So they went up , being Microsoft , they went up to a billion . 
C:  And then they had this log scale showing a  
C:  you know , and  and naturally everything gets  
C:  they  
C:  well , it 's a big company , 
C:  I didn't  I didn't mean it as a ne anything negative , 
C:  but i i i 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
C:  But , I mean , yes . 
C:  Of course there was the kind of effect that , you know , one would expect that  uh  that you got better and better performance with more and more data . 
C:  Um , but the  the real point was that the  the different learning machines are sort of all over the place , 
C:  and  and by  by going up significantly in data you can have much bigger effect then by switching learning machines 
C:  and furthermore which learning machine was on top kind of depended on where you were in this picture , 
C:  so , 
C:  uh , 
C:  That  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , 
C:  could well be . 
C:  So  so , I mean , that was  that was kind of , you know , it 's a good point , 
C:  but the problem I had with it was that the implications out of this was that , uh , the kind of choices you make about learning machines were therefore irrelevant 
C:  which is not at  n t as for as I know in  in tasks I 'm more familiar with @ @ is not at all true . 
C:  What i what is  is true is that different learning machines have different properties , 
C:  and you wanna know what those properties are . 
C:  And someone else sort of implied that well we s you know , a all the study of learning machine we still don't know what those properties are . 
C:  We don't know them perfectly , but we know that some kinds use more memory and  and some other kinds use more computation 
C:  and some are  are hav have limited kind of discrimination , but are just easy to use , and others are  
C:  You would guess  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  It w 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Eventually . 
C:  O one would 
C:  Well  
C:  well that 's getting cl 
C:  I mean , 
C:  yeah , the spread was still pretty wide that 's th that 's true , 
C:  but  but , uh , I think it would be irntu intu intuition that this would be the case , 
C:  but , uh , to really see it and to have the intuition is quite different , 
C:  I mean , I think somebody w w let 's see who was talking about earlier that the effect of having a lot more data is quite different in Switchboard than it is in  in Broadcast News , 
C:  yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  But anyway , I  I  I think it 's  it 's just the  the i it 's  it 's  it 's not really the conclusion they came to so much , as the conclusion that some of the , uh , uh , commenters in the crowd <laugh> came up with 
C:  that , uh , you know , this therefore is further evidence that , you know , more data is really all you should care about , 
C:  and that I thought was just kind of going too far the other way , 
C:  and  and the  the , uh , 
C:  one  one person ga g g got up and made a  a brief defense , 
C:  uh , but it was a different kind of grounds , 
C:  it was that  that , uh , i w the reason people were not using so much data before was not because they were stupid or didn't realize data was important , but in fact th they didn't have it available . 
C:  Um , but the other point to make a again is that , uh , machine learning still does matter , 
C:  but it  it matters more in some situations than in others , 
C:  and it  and also there 's  there 's not just mattering or not mattering , but there 's mattering in different ways . 
C:  I mean , you might be in some situation where you care how much memory you 're using , 
C:  or you care , you know , what recall time is , 
C:  or you care , you know , and  and  
C:  Yeah , 
C:  or  or , uh  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  And there 's cost ! 
C:  There 's just plain cost , 
C:  you know , 
C:  so  so these , I mean th the  in the  in the speech side , the thing that @ @ always occurs to me is that if you  
C:  if you  uh  
C:  one person has a system that requires ten thousand hours to train on , and the other only requires a hundred , 
C:  and they both do about the same because the hundred hour one was smarter , 
C:  that 's  that 's gonna be better . 
C:  because people , I mean , there isn't gonna be just one system that people train on 
C:  and then that 's it for the r for all of time . 
C:  I mean , people are gonna be doing other different things , and so it  these  these things matters  matter . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Anyway , 
C:  tea is  tea is , uh , starting . 
C:  Let 's do it all at once . 
C:  We  @ @  let 's try that again . 
C:  Boy , is that ever efficient . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah .
