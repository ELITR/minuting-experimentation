D:  Scratch that . 
D:  It  it doesn't  
D:  It didn't move yesterday either when I started it . 
D:  So I don't know if it doesn't like both of us  
D:  You know , I discovered something yesterday on these , um , wireless ones . 
D:  You can tell if it 's picking up  breath noise and stuff . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  So if you  
D:  yeah , if you breathe under  breathe and then you see AF go off , then you know  it 's p picking up your mouth noise . 
D:  Can I see it ? 
D:  Lattices are big , too . 
D:  But what  what 's the advantage of doing that versus just putting it into this format ? 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Yeah , I was thi 
D:  I was thinking the advantage is that we can share this with other people . 
D:  But , wait a minute , 
D:  P - file for each frame is storing a vector of cepstral or PLP values , 
D:  right ? 
D:  Right . 
D:  I mean , it must be the equivalent of whatever you guys used to store feat your computed features in , right ? 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  And I think there 's  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  But , I mean , people don't typically share this kind of stuff , right ? 
D:  I mean  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Is  is the sharing part of this a pretty important  consideration 
D:  or does that just sort of , uh  a nice thing to have ? 
D:  You could probably translate between them . 
D:  It probably wouldn't be a waste . 
D:  It would mean that at some point if we wanted to switch , we 'd just have to translate everything . 
D:  But that 's  
D:  I don't think that 's a big deal . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  See , that 's the question . 
D:  I mean , how stable is their  
D:  Are they ready to go , 
D:  or  ? 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  So each thing refers to the  utterance that it belongs to . 
D:  So it 's  it 's not hi it 's sort of bottom - up . 
D:  You would just have a r 
D:  You would refer up to the sentence . 
D:  What about  
D:  what about , um , the idea of using a relational database to , uh , store the information from the XML ? 
D:  So you would have  
D:  XML basically would  
D:  Uh , 
D:  you  you could use the XML to put the data in , 
D:  and then when you get data out , you put it back in XML . 
D:  So use XML as sort of the  the transfer format , 
D:  uh , but then you store the data in the database , 
D:  which allows you to do all kinds of  good search things in there . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  No . 
D:  I don't remember what the " P " is , though . 
D:  Probably stands for " Phil " . 
D:  Phil Kohn . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That 's my guess . 
D:  I  I just  I don't quite understand what these things are . 
D:  Uh . 
D:  Well , th overlap codes . 
D:  I 'm not sure what that @ @  
D:  It probably doesn't matter . 
D:  No , I d 
D:  What 's  what 's wrong with  doing times ? 
D:  I  
D:  But can they change the words without changing the time of the word ? 
D:  Scratch that .
