F:  That 's looks strange . 
B:  OK , now we 're on and it seems to be working . 
E:  Oh there we go . 
C:  One two three four five six 
B:  <outbreath> 
E:  This looks good . 
B:  <inbreath> 
A:  That is weird . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  So , I mean  
A:  It 's like when it 's been sitting for a long time or something . 
B:  I don't know what it is . 
B:  But all  all I know is that it seems like every time I 
B:  am up here after a meeting , 
B:  and I start it , 
B:  it works fine . 
B:  And if I 'm up here and I start it and we 're all sitting here waiting to have a meeting , it 
B:  gives me that error message and I have not yet sat down with  
B:  been able to get that error message in a point where I can sit down and find out where it 's occurring in the code . 
A:  Next time you get it maybe we should write it down . 
B:  Yep , we will .  
D:  <breath> Yeah . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  Was it a pause , or  ? 
B:  One of these days . 
E:  OK . Was it on " pause " 
E:  or something ? 
B:  No . <outbreath> 
E:  OK . 
E:  Don't know . 
D:  So uh  so the uh , 
D:  the new procedural change that just got suggested , which I think is a good idea is that um , 
D:  we do the digit recordings at the end . 
D:  And that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's uh meeting , 
D:  and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time , 
D:  uh , then they can run off . 
D:  It 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer 
D:  uh , sets of digits , but um , I think that way we 'll 
D:  cut into people 's time , um , 
D:  if someone 's on strict time 
D:  uh , less . 
D:  So , I th I think  I think we should start doing that . 


D:  Um , 
D:  so , uh , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , 
D:  maybe we should bring that up , 
D:  about uh , the nature of the data that we are collecting . 
D:  uh 
D:  @ @ 
D:  that uh , we should have a fair amount of data that is 
D:  um , collected for the same meeting , 
D:  so that we can , uh  
D:  I don't know . Wh - what  what were some of the points again about that ? 
D:  Is it  
F:  Uh , well , OK , I 'll back up . <laugh> Um , at the previous  at last week 's meeting , this meeting 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  I was griping <laugh> 
F:  about wanting to get more data and I  I talked about this with Jane and 
F:  Adam , um , and was thinking of 
F:  this mostly just so that we could do research 
F:  on this data 
F:  um , since we 'll have a new  this new student di does wanna work with us ,  th the guy that was at the last meeting . 
A:  Well , great . 
A:  Great . 
F:  And he 's already funded part - time , so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time , 
F:  uh  
A:  What a deal . 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  And what 's he interested in , specifically ? 
F:  So 
F:  he 's  comes from a signal - processing background , but I liked him a lot cuz he 's very interested in 
F:  higher level things , like language , and 
F:  disfluencies and all kinds of eb 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  maybe prosody ,  so he 's just getting his feet wet in that . 
B:  Great . 
F:  Anyway , I thought OK , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts  
F:  he 'd be starting in 
F:  January , next semester 
F:  that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with .  
B:  Right . 
F:  But , um , Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that 
F:  just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers 
F:  are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth . 
F:  So , I thought about that and I think it 's still possible , um , 
F:  but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of 
F:  types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a 
F:  mish - mosh of a bunch of one  
B:  One offs ?  
F:  one - time  
F:  Yeah , just because it would be very hard to 
F:  process the data in all senses , both 
F:  to get the , 
F:  um  
F:  to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like 
F:  well , I was talking to Morgan about 
F:  things like summarization , or what 's this meeting about . 
F:  I mean 
F:  it 's very different if you have a group that 's just 
F:  giving a report on what they did that week , versus coming to a decision and so forth . So . 


F:  Then I was um , talking to Morgan about some  new proposed work in this area , 
F:  sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on 
F:  where 
F:  I was thinking of doing 
F:  some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues 
F:  in both the 
F:  utterances and in the 
F:  utterance patterns ,  like in 
F:  numbers of overlaps and amount of speech , 
F:  sort of raw cues 
F:  from the interaction that can be measured from 
F:  the signals and from the diff 
F:  different microphones 
F:  that point to 
F:  sort of hot spots in the meeting , or things where stuff is going on that might be important 
F:  for someone who didn't attend to  listen to . 
F:  And in that 
F:  uh , regard , I thought we definitely w will need  
F:  it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data 
F:  from a few different domains , or a few different kinds of meetings . So this  this meeting is one of them , although I 'm not sure I can participate if I  
F:  You know , I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Um , and then there are some others that menti that Morgan mentioned , like the front - end meeting  and maybe a networking  group meeting .  
B:  Right . 
B:  Yep . 
F:  So  
B:  Yeah , we 're  we 're hoping that they 'll let us start recording regularly . So . 
F:  So if that were the case then I think we 'd have enough . But basically , for anything where you 're trying to get 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  a summarization of some kind of meeting    meaning out of the meeting , um , 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  it would be too hard to have 
F:  fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really 
B:  Yeah .  
F:  have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize , but  
F:  rather we should have 
F:  different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries .  


C:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  And then we need a couple that  of   We don't wanna just have one group because that might be specific to that particular group , but 
F:  @ @ 
D:  S So  
F:  three or four different kinds . 
B:  Yeah , we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  morning meeting . 
F:  See , I 've never listened to the data for the front - end  meeting . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , we  we 've only had three . So . 
F:  OK . 
F:  But maybe that 's enough . So , in general , I was thinking more data but also 
F:  data where we hold some parameters 
F:  constant or fairly similar ,  like a meeting about 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  of people doing a certain kind of 
F:  work where at least half the participants each time are the same . 
B:  Um  
D:  Now , let  l l let me just 
D:  give you the other side to that cuz I ca because I  I don't disagree with that , 
D:  but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too . 
D:  Uh , for other kinds of research , 
D:  particularly the acoustic oriented research , 
D:  I actually feel the opposite need . 
D:  I 'd like to have lots of different people . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Right . 
D:  As many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that 
D:  you were just talking about 
D:  it would have uh too few people from my point of view . I 'd like to have many different speakers . 
D:  So , um 
D:  I think I would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  and uh , I mean , sure , if we can 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
D:  get more from them , fine , but if we only get one or two from each group , 
D:  that still could be useful acoustically just because we 'd have 
F:  Yeah , I definitely agree with that . Definitely . 
D:  close and distant microphones with different people . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Can I  can I say about that  that the  the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers . 
E:  Because I think if you just say  an And in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because 
E:  there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in English that  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  that uh , it would be useful for  for purposes  You know . 
E:  But you know , I think 
E:  I 've been  I 've I  I 've gathered data from undergrads at  on campus and if you just post randomly to undergrads I think you 'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you 'd have at all . 
D:  Well , you want to i 
E:  And  and the English you 'd have  The language models would be really hard to build because it would not really be  it would be an interlanguage rather than  than a  
D:  Well , 
D:  OK , uh , first place , I  I  I don't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another , I think 
E:  OK . 
D:  there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz I  I think that 's what we 're 
D:  investigating , so 
F:  It has to be a  
F:  a pre - existing meeting ,  like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway . That 's I think what we  and I agree with . 
D:  Yeah , 
B:  Right . 
E:  OK . 
B:  <clears throat> 
D:  yeah . 
B:  @ @  
D:  So I was  
B:  Yep . 
D:  I was thinking more in terms of talking to professors 
D:  uh , and  and  and uh , senior uh , uh , d and 
E:  Oh , interesting ! 
D:  uh , doctoral students who are leading projects 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  and offering to them 
E:  Oh , I see . 
D:  that they have their  hold their meeting down here . 
E:  Oh , interesting ! 
D:  Uh , that 's the first point . The second point is 
D:  um 
D:  I think that for some time now , going back through BeRP I think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents 
E:  Oh , oh . I 'm not saying accents . 
D:  and I th I think that  
E:  u The accent 's not the problem . 
D:  Oh , OK . 
E:  No , it 's more a matter of uh , proficiency , 
E:  e e just simply fluency . 
E:  I mean , I deal with people 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  on  on campus who  
E:  I think sometimes people , 
E:  undergraduates um in computer science 
E:  uh , have language skills that make , you know  that their  their fluency and writing skills 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  are not so strong . 
D:  Oh ! You 're not talking about foreign language at all . You 're just talking about  
B:  Yeah . Yeah , just talking about . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  Well , e I just think , but you know , it 's like when you get into the graduate level , 
B:  We all had the same thought . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  uh , no problem . 
E:  I mean , I 'm not saying accents . I 'm say I 'm saying fluency . Well , yeah . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Yeah , then we 're completely gone . It 's  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  The  the habits are already burnt in . But  
E:  I 'm just saying fluency . 
B:  <inbreath> Well , I think that , um  
B:  I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  And  and I think 
B:  if it 's a pre - existing meeting and it 's held in English ,  
B:  I  I think it 's probably OK if a few of the people don't have 
B:  uh , g particularly good English skills . 
E:  OK , now can I  can I say the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that 
C:  <loud breath> 
E:  um , there 's  there 's this  this issue , you have a corpus out there , it should be used for  for multiple things cuz it 's so expensive to put together . 
B:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
E:  And if people want to approach  
E:  Um , i so I know  e e  
E:  You know this  The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group , 
D:  Uh - huh . 
E:  but the idea of language models , which are fund you know 
E:  generally speaking uh , you know , t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  or an hour invested in preparing the data , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  if you have a choice between people who are 
E:  pr more proficient in  <tap> 
E:  um , 
E:  i more fluent , more  more 
E:  close to being academic English , then it would seem to me to be a good thing . 
D:  I guess  I maybe  Hmm . 
E:  Because otherwise y you don't have the ability to have  
D:  I 
E:  Uh , so if  if you have a bunch of idiolects that 's the worst possible case . If you have people who are using English as a  as an interlanguage because they  they don't  
E:  uh , they can't speak in their native languages and  
E:  but their interlanguage isn't 
D:  Uh - huh . 
E:  really a match to any existing , 
E:  uh , language model , 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> this is the worst case scenario . 
D:  Well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group . 
E:  And  
B:  Right . 
D:  because  because they  most  the network group is almost entirely Germans and Spaniards . 
E:  Well I 
E:  Oh . 
E:  But the thing is , I think that these people are of high enough level in their  in their language proficiency that   And I 'm not objecting to accents .  I  I 'm  I 'm just thinking that we have to think at a  at a higher level view , could we have a language model , a  a grammar  
D:  I see . 
D:  OK . 
E:  a grammar , basically , 
D:  Uh - huh . 
E:  that um , wo would be 
E:  a  a possibility . So y so if you wanted to bring in a model like Dan Jurafsky 's model , an 
E:  and do some top - down stuff , it  to help th the bottom - up and merge the things or whatever , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  uh , it seems like 
E:  um , I don't see that there 's an argument  
E:  I 'm  I  what I think is that why not have the corpus , since it 's so expensive to put together , uh , useful for the widest 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  range of  
E:  of central corp 
E:  things that people generally use corpora for and which are , you know , used in computational linguistics . 
E:  That 's  that 's my point . 
E:  Which  which includes both top - down and bottom - up . 
D:  OK . 
C:  It 's difficult . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  OK , well , i i let 's  let 's see what we can get . 
D:  I mean , it  it  I think that if we 're aiming at  at uh , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together , 
E:  Yes , that 's fine . 
E:  That 's fine . 
D:  and it 's from the Berkeley campus , probably most of it 
D:  will be OK , but  
E:  Exactly . And my point in m in my note to Liz was 
D:  OK . 
E:  I think that undergrads are an iff iffy population . 
F:  I definitely agree with that , I mean , for this purpose . 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
E:  Grads and professors , fine . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Well , not to mention the fact that I would be 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen , probably even an anyone under twenty - one . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  So . 
D:  Oh , you age - ist ! 
B:  What 's that ? 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Age - ist . <laugh> 
B:  Well , age - ist .  The " eighteen " is because of the consent form . 
C:  <inbreath> Yeah . <laugh> " Age - ist " .  
F:  Right , 
B:  We 'd hafta get  find their parent to sign for them . <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yes . 
E:  Yeah , that 's true . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  So . 


F:  I have a  uh , um , question .  Well , Morgan , you were mentioning that Mari may not 
F:  use the k equipment from IBM 
F:  if they found something else , cuz 
D:  They 're  they 're  yeah , they 're d they 're uh  
D:  assessing whether they should do that or y do something else , 
F:  there 's a  
D:  hopefully over the next few weeks . 
F:  Cuz I mean , one remote possibility is that 
F:  if we st if we inherited that equipment , if she weren't using it , could we set up a room in the linguistics department ? 
F:  And  and 
F:  I mean , there  there may be a lot more  or  or in psych , or in comp wherever , in another building 
F:  where we could 
F:  um , record people there . I think we 'd have a better chance of  
B:  I think we 'd need a real motivated 
B:  partner to do that . We 'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this . 
F:  Right , but  
F:  Right . 
F:  But if there were such a  I mean it 's a remote possibility , then 
B:  So . 
F:  um , you know , one of us could you know , go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here . So it 's just a 
B:  Yep . 
D:  Well , the other thing  
F:  just a thought if they end up not using the  the hardware . 
C:  <loud breath> 
D:  Yeah , I mean the other thing that I was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around . Uh . 
B:  Right . 
D:  But . 
D:  Um , 
D:  and  
B:  Well , I know that space is really scarce on  at least in CS . 
D:  Uh  
B:  You know , to  to actually find a room that we could use regularly might actually be very difficult . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  But you may not need a separate room , you know , the idea is , if they have a meeting room 
B:  That 's true . True . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  and 
F:  they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth , and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yep . 
D:  Well , maybe John would let us put it into the phonology lab or something . You know . 
F:  Huh . 
B:  Yep . 
F:  I  I think it 's not out of the question . Um . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting . 
F:  So . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  another 
B:  type of meeting . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Right . 
C:  But I  I  I think you need , uh , another portable thing 
C:  a another portable equipment to  to do , eh , more e easier the recording process , eh , out from ICSI . 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Eh and probably . I don't know . Eh , if you  you want to  to record , eh , a seminar or a class , eh , in the university , you  you need  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  It - it would be eh eh very difficult to  to put , <laugh> 
C:  eh , a lot of , eh , head phones eh in different people when 
B:  <inbreath> <mouth> 
B:  Yeah , but  
C:  you have to  to record only with , eh , this kind of , eh , d device . 
B:  I think if we  if we wanna just record with 
B:  the tabletop microphones , that 's easy . 
C:  Oh - yeah . 
C:  Ye - Yeah , yeah . 
B:  Right ? That 's very easy , but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Actually , that 's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that 's maybe worth repeating . 
D:  We realized that , um , when we were talking about this that , OK , there 's these different things that we want to do with it . 
D:  So , um , it 's true that we wanna be selective in some ways , uh , the way that you were speaking about with , uh , not having an interlingua and uh , these other issues . 
D:  But on the other hand , it 's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it . 
D:  So , a a as per the example that we wanna have a fair amount that 's done with a small n recorded with a small , uh , typ number of types of meetings <inbreath> 
D:  But we can also have another part that 's , uh , just one or two meetings of each of a  of a range of them and that 's OK too . 
D:  Uh , 
D:  i 
D:  We realized in discussion that the other thing is , 
D:  what about this business of distant and close microphones ? 
D:  I mean , we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way , that 's why we did it . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  But  what about  
D:  For th for these issues of summarization , a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone . 
F:  Right , I mean , I c I think there 's  
D:  You actually don't . 
B:  And you don't really need the close microphone , you mean . 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  Yea - yeah yeah , you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone .  You can use found data . 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Which one did you mean ? 
D:  You d 
D:  You don't ne it doesn't  you just need some microphone , somewhere . 
B:  Ye - Yeah . Yep . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Tape recorder . 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
E:  Oh . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> You need some microphone , but I mean  <laugh> 
F:  @ @ You  you can . You can use  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Um , 
F:  but I think that any  data that we spend a lot of effort <click> to collect , 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  you know , each person who 's interested in  I mean , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , um , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for , 
F:  um , they need to be 
F:  taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want . 
D:  Right . 
F:  And  
F:  So in my case , um , 
F:  I think there w 
F:  there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others .  
B:  Not enough for others , right .  
F:  And so <click> I 'm looking and thinking , " Well I 'd be glad to 
F:  walk over and record people and so <click> forth if it 's  
F:  to help th in my interest . " 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And other people need to do that for themselves , uh , h 
D:  Right . So that  
F:  or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal   
C:  Yeah . 
D:  But I think that  I 'm raising that cuz I think it 's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about , " Well , gee , we have this really complicated setup to do , " well maybe you don't . 
D:  Maybe if  if  If really all you want is to have a  a  a recording that 's good enough to get a  <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah . For some of it . 
F:  Right . 
D:  uh , a transcription from later , 
D:  you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording . 
D:  I mean , we  we could have a fairly  We could just get a DAT machine and  
B:  Yep . 
F:  Well , I agree with <click> Jane , though , on the other hand that  
C:  Yeah . 
F:  So that might be true , you may say for instance , summarization , or something that 
F:  sounds very language oriented . You may say well , 
F:  " Oh yeah , you just do that from transcripts of a radio show . " I mean , you don't even need the speech signal .  <inbreath> But 
D:  Right . 
F:  what you  what I was thinking is long term what would be neat is 
F:  to be able to pick up on 
F:  um  
F:  Suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to 
F:  be able to determine this . There 's lots of cues you 're not gonna have . 
F:  So 
B:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  I  do think that long term you should always try to 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  satisfy the greatest number of  
F:  of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this 
F:  corpus powerful . 
B:  Special ?  
D:  I  I  
B:  Yep . 
F:  Otherwise , you know , lots of other sites can propose  
D:  I  I  I agree . Uh 
F:  individual studies , so  
D:  but I  I think that 
D:  the uh <inbreath> i 
D:  We can't really underestimate the difficulty  
D:  shouldn't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up . 
B:  Yep . 
D:  And so ,  uh it took quite a while to get that together and to say , " Oh , we 'll just do it up there , "  
F:  OK . 
D:  If you 're talking about something simple , where you throw away a lot of these dimensions , then you can do that right away . 
D:  Talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  it won't happen quickly , it won't be easy , and there 's all sorts of issues about th you know 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  keeping the equipment safe , or else hauling it around , and all sorts of o 
F:  So 
F:  then maybe we should <mike noise>  
D:  <inbreath> 
F:  try to bring people here . <mike noise> 
D:  I think the first priority should be to pry  to get  try to get people to come here . 
B:  Here .  
F:  I mean , that 's that 's  <mike noise> 
F:  OK , so that 's 
F:  OK . 
D:  We 're set up for it . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  The room is  is really , uh , underused . 
F:  Right . 
D:  Uh  
E:  I thought the free lunch idea was a great idea . 
F:  <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah , I thought so too . 
F:  Yeah , I  And I think we can get people to come here , that  
D:  Free lunch is good . 
E:  <inbreath>  
C:  Yeah . 
E:  <breath> 


F:  But the issue is you definitely wanna make sure that the kind of group you 're getting is the right group so that you don't waste a lot of 
F:  your time <mike noise> and the overhead in bringing people down . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  No crunchy food . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  So   
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . <laugh> 
F:  Well , it would be  lunch afterwards . Right . 
B:  Well , I was thinking , lunch after . 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  And they 'd have to do their digits or they don't get dessert . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , they have to do their digits or they don't  get  they don't  get their food . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> 
D:  Yeah  
D:  <inbreath> 
B:  Um , I had a  I spoke with some people up at Haas Business School who volunteered . 
B:  Should I pursue that ? 
F:  Oh , definitely , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  So . They  they originally  
B:  They 've decided not to do  go into speech . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  So I 'm not sure whether they 'll still be so willing to volunteer , but I 'll send an email and ask . I 'll tell them about the free lunch . And they 'll say there 's no such thing .  
D:  <breath> 
D:  Tell them about the free lunch . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  So .  
F:  I 'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers , 
D:  <inbreath> 
B:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  cuz these are both weird  
D:  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  The  the  
F:  well , I know , I shouldn't say that .  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  The oth the other h <laugh-breath> 
B:  That 's alright . No , the they  they 're very weird . 
F:  We need a wider sampling .  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  " Beep . "  
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh , <laugh> " beep "  
C:  Yeah .  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh , the  the  
B:  The problem with engineers is " beep . "  
D:  <laugh> <inbreath> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <vocal squeak> They make funny sounds . 
A:  <imitating buzzer sound by ingressive air over vocal chords> 
D:  The o the o the other  
D:  The other thing is , 
D:  uh , that we  we talked about is give to them  uh , burn an extra CD - ROM . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  <breath> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  Yep . 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  and give them  So if they want a  <noise> basically and audio record of their  
B:  Let them have their meeting . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  Well , I thought that was  
F:  I thought he meant , " Give them a music CD , " like they g 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <inbreath> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh .  
F:  <laugh> 
F:  Then he said a CD of the  of their speech and I guess it depends of what kind of audience you 're talking to , but  
C:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  You know , I personally <mike noise> would not want a <mike noise> CD  of my meeting , but 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Of the meeting ? 
F:  <inbreath> 
D:  <breath> 
F:  maybe  yeah ,  maybe you 're right .  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  If you 're having some planning meeting of some sort and uh you 'd like  
A:  Oh , that 's a good idea . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Right . 
B:  It 'd be fun . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  I think it would just be fun , you know , if nothing else , you know . 
F:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <breath> 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  But it als 
B:  It 's a novelty item . 
F:  Right . 
D:  It  it  it also I think builds up towards the goal . We 're saying , " Look , you know , you 're gonna get this . Is - is isn't that neat . Then you 're gonna go home with it . It 's actually p 
A:  <inbreath> <clears throat> 
D:  It 's probably gonna be pretty useless to you ,  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yep . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  but you 'll ge appreciate , you know , where it 's useful and where it 's useless , 
F:  Right . 
D:  and then , we 're gonna move this technology , so it 'll become useful . " 
F:  No , I think that 's a great idea , actually . But we might need a little more to incentivize them ,  that 's all . 
D:  So . 
A:  <sniff> 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  <inbreath> 
A:  What if you could tell them that you 'll give them the  the transcripts when they come back ? 
E:  Alth - <laugh> 
F:  <breath> 
B:  Oh , yeah . 
E:  <inbreath> Yeah .  
B:  I mean , anyone can have the transcripts . So . 
D:  Oh yeah . 
F:  <squeak> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  Well , that 's interesting . 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  I hav I have to uh raise a little eensy - weensy concern about doing th giving them the CD immediately , 
B:  I thought we could point that out . 
E:  because of these issues of , you know , this kind of stuff ,  
E:  where maybe  
E:  <inbreath> 
D:  <inbreath> 
E:  You know ? 
D:  Good point . 
D:  That 's a very good point . So we can  so we can  
E:  So . 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  We could burn it after it 's been cleared with the transcript stage . 
D:  <breath> 
D:  r Right . 
E:  And then they  they get a CD , but just not the same day . 
F:  Oh , right . 
F:  If  It should be the same CD - ROM that we distribute publically , right ? 
B:  Yeah , that 's right . 
B:  That 's a good point . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  <mouth> 
B:  Right , it can't be the internal one . 
F:  Otherwise they 're not allowed to 
D:  Although it 's  
E:  There we go . Oh , I like that . 
B:  That 's right . 
F:  play it for anyone . 
E:  Well put . Well put . 
E:  So , after the transcript screening phase . 
D:  <breath> 
B:  Yeah , that 's true . 
E:  Things have been weeded out . 
F:  Otherwise we 'd need two lawyer stages . 
E:  Yeah , that 's right , say  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  " Yeah , well , I got this CD , and , Your Honor , I  " 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <breath> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  That 's a good point . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> 
D:  Yeah so that 's  so let 's start with Haas , and 
F:  Sorry to have to  <mike spike> 
F:  Sorry I have to  leave . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  <inbreath> 
F:  I will be here full - time next week . 
D:  Oh , that 's fine . 
E:  <mike noise> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  OK , see you . 
F:  <mike noise>  
D:  <breath> 
D:  OK . 
B:  No . 
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  Bye .  
D:  That 's alright . 
E:  <mike noise> 
F:  <mike noise> 
D:  <breath> 
A:  See you . 
D:  OK . 
C:  See you . 
D:  <mouth> 
C:  <loud breath> 


D:  So , uh  
D:  Let 's see . So that was that topic , 
D:  and 
D:  <breath> 
D:  then um , I guess another topic would be 
D:  <breath> 
D:  where are we in the whole disk resources  question for  
B:  <laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  We are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough sp room to record meetings . 
D:  <breath> 
B:  <inbreath> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  So I uh did a bunch of archiving , and 
B:  still doing a bunch of archiving , I  I 'm in the midst of doing 
B:  the P - files from uh , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Broadcast News .  
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  and it took eleven hours  
B:  <inbreath> 
C:  Eleven ? 
B:  to do  to uh copy it .  
B:  And it 'll take another eleven to do the clone . 
A:  Where did you copy it to ? 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Well , it 's Abbott . 
B:  It 's Abbott , so it just  
B:  But it 's  it 's a lot of data .  
D:  Sk - 
D:  It 's copying from one place on Abbott to another place on Abbott ? 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  Tape . 
C:  Tape ? 
B:  I did an archive . 
D:  Oh ! I 'm sorry . 
A:  Oh , on the tape . Ah ! 
C:  Oh . 
B:  So I 'm archiving it , and then I 'm gonna delete the files . 
B:  So that will give us 
C:  Eleven hours ? 
A:  Wow ! 
B:  ten gigabytes of free space .  
C:  Oh . 
E:  <mouth> 
E:  Yeah , the archiving m  program does take a long time . 
B:  And  and  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yep . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  And so one 
B:  That  that will be done , like , 
B:  in about two hours . And so uh , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  at that point we 'll be able to record five more meetings . So .  
C:  Yeah . 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  One thing  The good news about that  that is that once  once it 's archived , it 's pretty quick to get back . I mean , it  it  it  The other direction is fast , 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Is it ? 
B:  Right . 
E:  but this direction is really slow . 
D:  Hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Well , especially because I 'm generating a clone , also . 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  Yeah , OK . 
B:  So . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  And that takes a while . 
A:  Generating a clone ? 
D:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
E:  Yeah , that 's a good point . 
B:  Two copies . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  One offsite , one onsite . 
A:  Oh ! 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh ! 
D:  <inbreath> 
E:  <inbreath> 
A:  Hunh ! 
E:  Now , what will uh  Is the plan to g  to  
D:  S  
D:  <breath> 
E:  So  
E:  stuff will be saved , it 's just that you 're relocating it ? 
E:  I mean , so we 're gonna get more disk space ? Or did I  ? 
B:  No , the  the  these are the P - files from Broadcast News , which are regeneratable  regeneratable 
E:  OK . 
E:  Oh , good . 
B:  <inbreath> 
E:  I see . 
B:  um , if we really need to , but we had a lot of them . 
B:  And  for the full , uh , hundred forty hour 
E:  OK . 
B:  sets . 
B:  <inbreath> 
D:  <inbreath>  
B:  And so they  they were two gigabytes per file and we had 
E:  Wow . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  six of them or something .  
E:  Wow . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  W w we are getting more space . We are getting , uh , another disk rack and  and four thirty - six gigabyte disks . 
D:  Uh  so  uh  but 
E:  Wonderful .  
D:  that 's not gonna happen instantaneously . 
B:  Or maybe six . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Or maybe six ? 
B:  The SUN , ha uh , takes more disks than the Andatico one did . 
D:  How many  
B:  The SUN rack takes   
D:  How much  
B:  Th - 
B:  One took four and one took six , or maybe it was eight and twelve . Whatever it was , it was ,  you know , fifty percent more . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Is there a difference in price or something ? 
B:  Well , what happened is that 
B:  we  we bought all our racks and disks from Andatico for years , according to Dave , and Andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices . 
A:  Oh !  
C:  Oh . 
B:  And so , uh , we 're looking into other vendors . 
B:  " We "  
E:  Wow . 
B:  By " we " of course I mean Dave . So .  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Hmm . I 've been looking at the , uh , 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Aurora data 
A:  and , um , 
A:  first  first look at it , 
A:  there were basically three 
A:  directories on there that could be moved .  
A:  One was called Aurora , one was Spanish , which was Carmen 's Spanish stuff , and the other one was , um , 
B:  SPINE .  
A:  SPINE . 
A:  And so , um , 
A:  I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that 
A:  the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk . 
C:  <loud breath> 
A:  So , um , 
A:  I realized that 
A:  well , probably not all of that should be moved , just  
A:  the  
A:  CD - ROM type data , the   
A:  the static data . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  So I moved that , 
A:  and then um , 
A:  I asked him to check out and see if it was OK .  
A:  before I actually deleted the old stuff , 
A:  um , but I haven't heard back yet . 
A:  I told him he could delete it if he wanted to , I haven't checked  
A:  today to see if he 's deleted it or not . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  And then Carmen 's stuff , I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to XA , 
A:  I had copied stuff there that was 
A:  dynamic data . 
A:  And so , 
C:  <loud breath> 
A:  I had to redo that one and just copy over the static data . 
C:  <loud breath> 
A:  And so I need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk . 
A:  And then I lo haven't done any of the Aurora stuff . I have to meet with , uh , Stephane 
A:  to do that . So . 
D:  So , but , uh y 
D:  you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the Broadcast News , 
D:  but , we have some 
D:  other disks , some of which you 're using for Aurora , but 
D:  are we g do we have some other  
B:  Yep . 
D:  other space now ? 
B:  So , so , 
B:  uh , we have space on the current disk right now , where Meeting Recorder is , 
B:  <inbreath> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  and that 's probably enough for about four meetings . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Is that the one that has  is that DC ? 
B:  So . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  No , no ,  well , it 's wherever the Meeting Recorder currently is . I think it 's DI . 
A:  OK , I  but the stuff I 'm moving from Aurora is on the DC disk that we  
B:  I don't remember . 
B:  Th - I think it 's DC - It 's whatever that one is . 
A:  OK , DC . Yeah . 
B:  I just don't remember , it might be DC . 
B:  And 
B:  that has enough for about four more meetings right now . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah , I mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Um , someone deleted something somewhere . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  And so we have some room again . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  And then 
B:  with Broadcast News , that 's five or six more meetings , so , you know , we have a couple weeks . 
B:  Uh , so , yeah , I think  I think we 're OK , until we get the new disk . 
C:  OK .  
A:  So should , um  
A:  One question I had for you was , 
A:  um , 
A:  we need   
A:  we sh probably should move the Aurora an 
A:  and all that other stuff off of 
A:  the Meeting Recorder disk . 
A:  Is there another backed - up  disk that you know of that would  ? 
B:  We should put it onto the Broadcast News one . 
B:  That 's probably the best thing to do . And that way we consolidate Meeting Recorder onto one disk  rather than spreading them out . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . Do you know what  happen to know what disk that is off  ? OK . 
B:  No . 
B:  I mean , I can tell you , I just don't know off the top of my head . 
A:  Yeah . OK . 
A:  Alright , I 'll find out from you . 
B:  But , so we could ' jus just do that at the end of today , once the archive is complete , and I 've verified it . 
A:  OK . 
D:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
B:  Cuz that 'll give us plenty of disk . 


D:  Uh , OK , 
D:  @ @  So , uh , 
C:  <clears throat> 
D:  then I guess th the last thing I 'd had on my  
D:  my agenda was just to hear  hear an update on 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  what  what Jose has been doing , so that 's  
C:  Uh - huh . 
D:  OK . 
C:  OK . 
C:  I have , eh , <clears throat> 
C:  The result of my work during the last days . 
C:  Thank you for your information because I  
C:  I read . 
C:  Eh , and the  the last , eh , days , eh , I work , eh , in my house , 
B:  Yeah .  
C:  eh , in a lot of ways and 
C:  thinking , reading eh , different things about the  the Meeting Recording project . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
C:  And I have , eh , some ideas . 
C:  Eh , this information is very  very useful .  
E:  I 'm glad to hear it . Glad to hear it . 
C:  Because <laugh> you have the  the  the distribution , now . But 
C:  for me , eh is interesting because , eh , eh , 
C:  here 's i is the demonstration of the overlap , eh ,  problem . It 's a real problem ,  
B:  I 've seen it already . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  a frequently problem  
E:  Yeah . 
C:  uh , because you have overlapping zones eh , eh , eh , all the time .  
B:  Yep . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Throughout the meeting . 
C:  Eh , by a moment I have , eh , nnn , the , eh ,  n I  I did a mark of all the overlapped zones in the meeting recording , 
C:  with eh , a exact  mark . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Oh , you did that by hand ? 
C:  Heh ? 
C:  That 's eh , 
C:  yet 
C:  b b Yeah , by  b b by hand  by hand because , 
B:  Can I see that ? 
B:  <laugh> Can I get a copy ? 
D:  Oh . 
C:  eh , <mouth> eh  
C:  " Why . "  
C:  My  my idea is to work  
C:  I  I  I do I don I don't @ @  
A:  Wow !  
C:  I don't know , eh , if , eh , it will be possible because I  I  I haven't a lot  eh , enough time to  to  to work . 
C:  uh , only just eh , six months , as you know , 
C:  but , eh , my idea is , eh , 
C:  is very interesting to  to work  in  in the line of , eh , automatic segmenter . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Eh but eh , eh , 
C:  in my opinion ,  we need eh , eh , a reference  eh session 
B:  Yes , absolutely . 
C:  to  t to  to evaluate 
B:  And so are you planning to do that or have you done that already ? 
C:  the  the  the tool . 
C:  And  
C:  No , no , with i Sorry ? With  ?  
B:  Have you done that or are you planning to do that ? 
C:  No , I  I  plan to do that . 
B:  OK . Darn !  
C:  <laugh> I plan  I plan , but eh , 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  eh , the idea <laugh> is the  is the following . 
C:  Now , <mouth> eh , 
C:  I need ehm , 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  to detect eh all the overlapping zones exactly . 
C:  I  I will  I will eh , talk about eh ,  in the  in the blackboard 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Duration .  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  about the  my ideas . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Eh , um , 
C:  <breath> <mouth> 
C:  eh  
C:  This information 
C:  eh , with eh , exactly time marks 
C:  eh , for the overlapping zones 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  eh  
C:  overlapping zone , and eh , a speaker  
C:  a  a pure speech eh , eh , speaker zone . 
C:  I mean , eh zones eh of eh speech of eh , one speaker 
C:  without any  any eh , noise eh , any  any acoustic event eh that eh , eh , w eh , is not eh , speech , real speech . 
C:  And , I need t true eh , silence 
C:  for that , because my  my idea is to  to study the nnn  the  
C:  <mouth> the set of parameters 
C:  eh , what , eh , are more m more discriminant 
B:  Right . 
C:  to eh , classify . 
C:  the overlapping zones in cooperation with the speech  eh zones . 
C:  The idea is 
C:   to eh  to use  
C:  eh , I 'm not sure to  eh yet , 
C:  but eh my idea is 
C:  to use a  a cluster  <mouth> eh algorithm or , nnn , 
C:  a person strong in neural net algorithm 
C:  to eh  
C:  to eh study 
C:  what is the , eh , the property of the different feat eh feature , eh , to classify 
C:  eh speech and overlapping eh speech . 
A:  Mmm . 
C:  And my idea is eh , 
C:  it would be interesting to  to have 
C:  eh , <mouth> a control set . 
C:  And my control set eh , will be the eh , silence , 
C:  silence without eh , any  any noise . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <laugh> 
E:  Which means that we 'd still  You 'd hear the  Yeah .  That 's interesting . This is like a ground level , with  It 's not it 's not total silence . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah , acoustic with this .  
B:  Yeah , fans . 
C:  With  with , yeah , the background . Eh , 
C:  I  I mean eh , noise eh , 
C:  eh claps eh , tape clips , eh , the difference eh , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  eh , eh , event eh , which , eh , eh , has , eh eh , a hard effect of distorti spectral distortion in the  in the eh  speech . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  So  so you intend to hand - mark those and exclude them ? 
C:  Yeah , I have mark 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  in  in  in  in that  Not in all  in all the  the file , 
C:  only eh , eh , nnn ,  mmm , 
C:  I have eh , 
C:  ehm  
C:  I don't remind  what is the  the  the  the quantity , but eh , 
C:  I  I have marked enough speech on over and all the overlapping zones . 
C:  I have , eh ,  two hundred and thirty , 
C:  more or less , overlapping zones , and 
B:  Whew !  
C:  is similar to  to this information ,   because with the program , I cross  
E:  Great . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Great . 
C:  the information of uh , of Jane  
C:  with eh , my my segmentation by hand . 
C:  And  is eh , mor more similar . 
E:  Excellent . Glad to hear it . Good . 
C:  @ @ 
C:  But  
D:  @ @ Go ahead .  
C:  Sorry , sorry .  


C:  And the  the idea is , eh , 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  I  I will use , eh ,  
C:  I want   
C:  My idea is , eh , 
C:  <clears throat> 
C:  <cough> 
C:  to eh  
C:   
B:  I should 've  got the digital camera . Oh well . 
C:  <noises from writing on whiteboard> 
C:  to classify . 
C:  I  I need eh , the exact eh , mark 
C:  of the different , eh , 
C:  eh , zones because I  I want to put , eh , for eh , each frame a label  indicating . 
C:  It 's a sup supervised and , eh , hierarchical clustering process . 
C:  I  I  I put , eh , eh , 
C:  for each frame 
C:  <noises from writing on whiteboard> 
C:  a label 
C:  indicating what is th the type , 
C:  what is the class , eh , which it belong . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Eh , I mean , the class you will 
C:  <noises from writing on whiteboard> 
C:  overlapping speech 
C:  " overlapping " is a class , 
C:  eh , " speech " 
C:  <noises from writing on whiteboard> 
B:  Nonspeech .  
C:  @ @ 
C:  the class  
A:  These will be assigned by hand ? 
C:  that 's a 
A:  Based on the   
C:  I  I  I ha I h I  I put the mark by hand , 
A:  Uh - huh . 
C:  because , eh , 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  my idea is , eh , 
C:  in  in the first session , 
C:  I need , eh ,  I  I need , eh , to be sure 
C:  that the information 
C:  eh , that , eh , I  I will cluster , 
B:  Well , training , and validation . 
B:  Sure . 
C:  is  is right . Because , eh , 
C:  eh , if not , eh , I will  I will , eh , return to the speech file to analyze eh , what is the problems , eh . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  And <mouth> I  I 'd prefer  I would prefer , the to  to have , eh , this labeled automatically , but , eh , 
E:  <inbreath> 
C:  eh , fro th 
A:  You need truth . 
C:  I need truth . 
B:  Yeah , but this is what you 're starting with . 
A:  Hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  I 've gotta ask you . So , 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
E:  uh , the difference between the top two , 
E:  i So  so  I start at the bottom , so " silence " is clear . 
E:  By " speech " do you mean speech by one sp by one person only ? 
C:  Speech  
E:   So this is un 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Is  
E:  OK , and then and then the top includes 
C:  <inbreath>  
E:  people speaking at the same time , or  or a speaker and a breath overlapping , someone else 's breath , or  or clicking , overlapping with speech  So , 
B:  One or two or more . 
C:  One , two , three .  
C:  but 
C:  <loud breath> 
C:  No , by th by the moment n 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  that  that 's all those possibilities in the top one .  OK . 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Eh , in the first moment , because , eh , eh , I  I have information , eh , of the overlapping zones , 
C:  eh , information about if the , eh , overlapping zone is , eh , from a speech , clear speech , from a one to a two eh speaker , 
C:   or three speaker , or is  is the zone where the breath of a speaker eh , overlaps eh , onto eh , a speech , another , 
E:  So it 's basi it 's basically speech wi som with  with something overlapping , which could be speech but doesn't need to be . 
C:  especially speech . 
C:  No , no , es especially  eh , overlapping speech 
C:   from , eh , different eh , eh , speaker . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  No , but there 's  but , I think she 's saying " Where do you  In these three categories , where do you put the instances 
C:  Eh  
D:  in which there is one person speaking 
D:  and other sounds which are not speech ? " 
C:  Ah ! 
D:  Which category do you put that in ? 
E:  Yeah , that 's right . That 's my question . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , he here I  I put eh speech from eh , 
C:  from , eh , one speaker 
E:  Oh ! 
C:   without , eh , 
C:  eh , any  any  any events more . 
D:  Right , 
D:  so where do you put speech from one speaker 
D:  that does have a nonspeech event at the same time ? 
D:  Which catege which category ? 
E:  Like a c 
C:  Where ? Where  What is the class ? 
C:  No . By the moment , no . 
E:  Oh . 
B:  Yeah , yeah , that 's what he was saying before . 
C:  For  for the  by the @ @ 
D:  Oh , so you  
E:  So you don't  i i it 's not in that  
D:  not  not marked . 
C:  no , @ @ because I  I  I  I want to limit 
D:  OK . 
D:  Got it . 
C:  the  the  nnn , <laugh> the  the study . 
D:  Fine . So  so  
B:  Yeah , so that 's what he was saying before , is that he excluded those . 
A:  So you 're not using all of the data . 
C:  The  All  I  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Exactly . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , you mean  
E:  So you 're ignoring overlapping events unless they 're speech with speech . 
C:  Yeah , be 
D:  Yeah , that 's fine . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
C:  " Why ? Why ? What 's the reason ? "  because 
D:  @ @ 
C:   i it 's the first study . 
D:  Oh , no  no , it 's a perfectly sensible way to go . We just wondered  
C:  the first 
E:  We 're just 
D:  trying to understand what  what you were doing . OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah cuz you 've talked about other overlapping events in the past . So , 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  this is  this is  a subset . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  In the  in the future , the  the idea is to  to extend  the class , 
A:  Is  is  
C:  to consider all the  all the information , you  you mentioned before 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I  I don't think we were asking for that . We were jus just trying to understand  
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  but eh , the  the first idea  Because eh , I don't know 
E:  Yeah , we just wanted to know what the category was here .  
C:   what hap what will happen  with the study . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
D:  Sure . 
A:  Is your silence category pure silence , or  ? What if there was a door - slam or something ? 
C:  i it 's pure  
C:  <mouth> 
C:  No , no , it 's pure silence . 
A:  Pure silence . 
C:  It 's the control set . 
A:  OK . 
C:  OK ? 
C:  It 's the control set . 
D:  What you  Well  w 
C:  It 's pure si pure silence  with the  with the machine on the  on the roof .  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  With the fan . 
D:  I  I think what you m 
D:  I think what you mean <laugh> is that it 's nonspeech segments that don't have impulsive noises . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Right ? Cuz you 're calling  what you 're calling " event " is somebody coughing 
D:  <breath> or clicking , or rustling paper , or hitting something , which are impulsive noises . 
D:  <breath> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  But steady - state noises are part of the background . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Which , are being , included in that . Right ? 
C:  @ @ h here yet , 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  <inbreath>  
E:  So it 's like a signal - noise situation . 
C:  yet 
C:  I  I  I  I  I think  I  I think , eh , 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  Well  
C:  there are  that  some kind of noises that , eh , 
C:  don't  don't wanted to  to be in that , eh , 
D:  Yeah . <vocal squeak> 
C:  in that control set . 
C:  But I prefer , I prefer at  at the first , eh , 
C:  the  the silence with eh , this eh this kind 
E:  Well , steady state . 
C:  of the  of eh  of noise . 
D:  Right , it 's  I mean , it 's  " Background " might be  might be a better word than " silence " . It 's just sort of that  the  the background acoustic   
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . So  
C:  Is  is  is only  
B:  Fine . Go on . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Well , we needed to get the categories , yeah . <laugh> 
C:  And , um , with this information 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  The idea is eh , eh , nnn , 
C:  I have 
C:  a label for  for each , eh , frame and , eh with a cluster 
C:  eh  algorithm 
C:  I  and  
C:  Sorry . 
C:  And eh 
C:  I am going  to prepare 
C:  a test bed , eh , well , eh , 
C:  a  a set of  feature structure eh , eh , models . 
B:  Right . 
C:  And  my idea is  
C:  <writing on whiteboard, audible in background> 
B:  " Tone " , whatever . 
C:  @ @ 
C:  so  so  on  
D:  Right . 
C:  because I have a pitch extractor yet .  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  I have to  to test , but eh 
A:  You have your own ? 
C:  I   
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  Oh ! 
C:  I ha I have prepare . 
C:  Is a modified version of  of  of a 
C:  pitch tracker , 
C:  eh , from , eh , Standar - eh Stanford University  in Stanford ? No . 
C:  From , eh , em , <mouth> 
C:  Cambridge  University . 
A:  Oh ! 
A:  What 's it written in ? 
C:  Eh , em , I  I  I don't remember what is the  the name of the  of the author , 
C:  because I  I have several  I have eh , eh , em , 
C:  eh , library tools , from eh , Festival 
A:  Ah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  and  of  from Edinburgh 
C:  eh , from Cambridge , eh , and from our department . And  And 
C:  I have to  because , <mouth> in general the pitch tracker , doesn't work  
B:  Bad .  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Right . 
C:  very well and  
B:  But , you know , as a feature , it might be OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  So , we don't know . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  This  this is  And 
C:   th the idea is to  to , eh , 
C:  to obtain , eh , 
C:   for example , 
C:  eh , 
C:   <mouth> 
C:  eh 
C:  diff eh , eh , different  well , no , a great number of eh FEC for example , 
C:  eh ,  eh , twenty - five , eh , thirty  thirty parameters , 
C:  eh , for  for each one . 
C:  And 
C:  in a first eh , nnn , step 
C:  in the investi in the research in 
C:  eh , my idea is 
C:  try to , eh , 
C:  to prove , 
B:  Supervised clustering .  
C:  what is the performance of the difference parameter , 
C:  eh  to classify 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:   the different , eh , what is the  
C:  the  the  the front - end approach 
C:  to classify eh , the different , eh , frames of each class  
C:  eh and what is the  the , nnn , nnn , 
C:  nnn , eh , what is the , the error 
C:   eh , of the data 
E:  <inbreath>  
C:  This is the  the eh , first idea 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:   and the second 
C:   is try to  eh , to use 
C:   some ideas eh , similar to the linear discriminant analysis . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Eh ? 
C:  Eh , similar , because the the idea is to  to study 
C:   what is the contribution of eh , each parameter 
C:  to the process of classify correctly the different  the different parameters . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  What sort of classifier ar ? 
C:  Eh , the  the  the classifier is  nnn by the moment is eh  is eh , similar , nnn , that the classifier used eh , in 
C:  a quantifier  vectorial quantifier 
C:  is eh , used to  to eh , some distance  to  to put eh , a vector eh , in  in a class different . 
B:  @ @ Unimodal ? So is it just one cluster per  
C:  Is  Yeah ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  W with a model , is  is only to cluster using a eh , @ @ or a similarity . 
C:  A another possibility it to use eh a netw netw a neural network . 
B:  Right . 
C:  But eh what 's the p 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  What is my idea ? What 's the problem I  I  I  I see in  in  in  
C:  <mouth> 
C:  if you  you use the  the neural network ?  If  
C:  w when  this kind of eh , mmm , cluster , clustering algorithm 
C:  to can test , to can eh observe what happened 
C:  you  you can't  
C:  you can't eh , 
C:  eh put up with your hand  
B:  Right , you can't analyse it . 
C:  in the different parameter , but eh  
C:  If you use a neural net is  is a good idea , but eh 
C:  you don't know what happened in the interior of the neural net . 
D:  Well , actually , you can do sensitivity analyses 
D:  which show you what the importance of the different parce pieces of the input are . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  It 's hard to  w w what you  It 's hard to tell on a neural net is what 's going on internally . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  But it 's actually not that hard to analyse it and figure out the effects of different inputs , especially if they 're all normalized . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Um , 
B:  Well , using something simpler first I think is probably fine . 
D:  but  
D:  Well , this isn't tru if  if  if you really wonder what different if  if  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  But  
B:  Decision tree .  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , then a decision tree is really good , but the thing is here he 's  he 's not  he 's not like he has one 
D:  you know , a bunch of very distinct variables , like pitch and this  he 's talking about , like , a all these cepstral coefficients , and so forth , in which case 
B:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  And  
D:  a a any reasonable classifier is gonna be a mess , and it 's gonna be hard to figure out what  what uh  
B:  Right . 
C:  I  I  I will include too the  the  the differential de derivates 
D:  Yeah . <inbreath> <vocal squeaks> 
B:  Deltas , yeah . So . 
D:  I  I mean , I think the other thing that one  I mean , this is , I think a good thing to do , to sort of look at these things at least  
C:  too . 
A:  <yawn> 
D:  See what I 'd  I 'd  Let me tell you what I would do . <breath> 
D:  I would take 
D:  just a few features . Instead of taking all the MFCC 's , or all the PLP 's or whatever , 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  I would just take a couple . 
D:  OK ? Like  like C - one , C - two , something like that , so that you can visualize it . 
C:  Yeah .  
D:  and look at these different examples and look at scatter plots . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  OK , so before you do  build up any kind of fancy classifiers , 
D:  just take a look in two dimensions , at how these things are split apart . 
D:  <breath> 
D:  That I think will give you a lot of insight of what is likely to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <breath> 
D:  And the second thing is , once you actually get to the point of building these classifiers , <breath> 
D:  @ @ 
D:  what this lacks so far is the temporal properties . <breath> 
D:  So if you 're just looking at a frame and a time , you don't know anything about , you know , the structure of it over time , and so 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  you may wanna build @ @  build a Markov model of some sort 
B:  Context window ?  
D:  uh , or  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  or else have features that really are based on 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  um 
D:  on  on some bigger chunk of time . <breath> 
D:  But I think this is a good place to start . <breath> 
D:  But don't uh anyway , this is my suggestion , is don't just , you know , 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  throw in twenty features at it , the deltas , and the delta del and all that 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  into some classifier , even  
D:  even if it 's K - nearest - neighbors , you still won't know what it 's doing , even  You know it 's not a neural net . 
D:  Uh , I think to know what it 's  to have a better feeling for what it 's doing , you wanna look at it . 
D:  So you wanna look at  at som some picture that shows you , " Here 's  These things uh , uh are  offer some separation . " <breath> 
B:  Yep .  
D:  And , uh , in LPC , uh , the thing to particularly look at is , I think  is something <breath> 
D:  like , uh , the residual  the energy in the residual . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Um 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Can I ask ? It strikes me that there 's another piece of information 
D:  So . 
C:  S 
E:  um , that 
E:  might be useful and that 's simply the transition . 
E:  So , w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech , 
C:  Yeah , because  
C:  Yeah yeah . 
E:  there 's gonna be a b a big informative area there , it seems to me . 
C:  <clears throat> 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I  Yeah . But eh I  I  Is my my  my own vision , <laugh> of the  of the project . 
B:  So , some sort of   
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  That 's  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  I  
C:  eh the  the Meeting Recorder project , for me , 
C:  has eh , two 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  eh , w has eh several parts , several p <laugh> objective eh , because it 's a  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  a great project . But eh , at the first , in the acoustic , eh , eh , parts of the project , 
C:  eh I think  
C:  you eh  we have eh 
C:  <mouth>  
C:  two main eh objective . 
C:  One  one of these is to  eh to detect the change , the acoustic change . 
C:  And <mouth> for that , if you don't use , eh , 
C:  <mouth> eh , a speech recognizer , 
C:  eh broad class , or not broad class 
C:  to  to try to  to  
C:   <mouth> 
C:  to label the different frames , 
C:  I think  the Ike criterion 
C:   or BIC criterion 
E:  OK . 
C:  eh 
C:  will be enough 
C:  to detect the change . 
C:  And  Probably .  
C:  I  I  I  I would like to  to t prove . 
C:  Uh , probably . 
C:  When you 
C:  you have , eh , eh s eh the transition of speech or  or silence 
C:  eh to overlap zone , 
C:  this criterion is enough 
C:  with  
C:   probably with , eh , this kind of , eh , 
C:  eh the  the  the more eh use eh  use eh  used eh 
C:  em  normal , regular eh parameter MF - MFCC . 
C:  you  you have to  to  to find  you can find 
C:  the  the mark . 
C:  You can find the  nnn , the  the acoustic change . 
C:  But eh eh 
C:  I  I understand that you  your objective is  to eh classify , 
C:  to know that eh that zone 
C:   not is only  a new zone in the  in the file , 
C:  that eh you have eh , but you have to  to  to know that this is overlap zone . 
C:  because in the future you will eh 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  try to  to process that zone 
C:  with a non - regular eh eh speech recognizer model , I suppose .  
C:  you  you will pretend  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  to  to  to process the overlapping z eh zone 
C:  with another kind of algorithm because it 's very difficult to  
C:  to  to obtain the transcription  
C:  from eh using eh eh a regular , normal speech recognizer . 
C:  That , you know ,  I  I  I think is the idea . 
C:  And so 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  eh 
C:  the , nnn  the  
C:  <writing on whiteboard> 
E:  Clustering .  
C:  the system 
C:   eh will have 
C:  two models . 
C:  A model to detect 
C:  more acc the mor most accurately possible 
C:  that is p uh , will be possible 
C:  the , eh  
C:  the mark , the change  
E:  OK . 
C:  and another  
C:  another model will @ @  
C:  or several models , to try s but  
C:  eh several model eh robust models , sample models 
C:  to try to classify 
C:  the difference class . 
B:  I 'm  I 'm  I 'm sorry , I didn't understand you  what you said . What  what model ? 
E:  @ @  
C:  Eh , the  the classifiers 
C:  of the of the n 
C:  to detect the different class 
C:  to the different zones 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  before try to  to recognize , eh 
C:  with eh  to transcribe , with eh 
C:  a speech recognizer . 
E:  <inbreath> So p 
C:  And my idea is to use eh , for example , a neural net 
E:  <mike noise> 
C:  <writing on whiteboard> 
C:  with  the  information we obtain from this eh  this eh study 
B:  Features .  Yeah . 
C:  of the parameter with the  selected  parameter to try to eh  to put 
A:  <yawn> 
C:  the class of each frame . 
C:  Eh  for  the difference  zone 
C:  you  you eh , eh  
C:  have obtained 
C:  in the first 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  eh , step 
C:   with the  for example , BIC eh , eh  criterion 
C:  compare model 
C:  And  
C:  <laugh> You - I don't - u 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  OK , but , I  I think  in any event we 're agreed that the first step is  
E:  Yeah . 
C:  i 
C:  <cough> 
D:  Because what we had before for  for uh , speaker change detection did not include these overlaps . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  So the first thing is for you to  to build up something that will detect the overlaps . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Right ? So again , I think 
D:  the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these uh , in  in  in  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Features ?  
D:  in  Well , I  
D:  again , the things you 've written up there I think are way too  way too big . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  OK ? If you 're talking about , say , twelfth  twelfth - order uh MFCC 's or something like that it 's just way too much . You won't be able to look at it . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  All you 'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Whereas I think if you have things  if you pick one or two dimensional 
D:  things , or three of you have some very fancy display , 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  uh , and look at how the  the different classes separate themselves out , you 'll have much more insight about what 's going on . 
C:  It will be enough . 
D:  Well , you 'll  you 'll get a feeling for what 's happening , you know , so if you look at  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <breath> Suppose you look at first and second - order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things 
D:  and you find that the first - order is much more effective than the second , 
D:  <breath> and then you look at the third and there 's not  and not too much there , 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <breath> you may just take 
D:  first and second - order cepstral coefficients , right ? And with LPC , I think LPC per se isn't gonna tell you much more than  than  than the other , maybe . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <breath> Uh , and uh on the other hand , the LPC residual , the energy in the LPC residual , 
D:  <breath> 
D:  will say how well , uh 
D:  <breath> 
D:  the low - order LPC <breath> 
D:  model 's fitting it , which should be <breath> 
D:  pretty poorly for two two or more <breath> 
D:  people speaking at the same time , and it should be pretty well , for w for  for one . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  And so <breath> I  i again , if you take a few of these things that are  are <breath> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  prob um   promising features and look at them in pairs , <breath> 
D:  uh , I think you 'll have much more of a sense of " OK , I now have  
D:  <breath> 
D:  uh , doing a bunch of these analyses , I now have ten likely candidates . " 
D:  And then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they combine . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . <inbreath> This - 
A:  I 've got a question . 
E:  Interesting .  
E:  Hmm .  


C:  Sorry .  
C:  but eh , eh 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  eh eh eh I don't know it is the first eh way to  to  do that <laugh> 
C:  and I would eh like to  to know what eh , your opinion . 
C:  Eh 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  all this study in the f in the first moment , 
C:  I  I w I  I will pretend to do  with eh eh 
C:  equalizes speech . 
B:  With  
C:  The  the equalizes speech , the speech eh , the mixes of speech . 
E:  With what ? With what ? 
C:   the  the mix , mixed speech . 
B:  Right . Mixed . 
E:  " Mixed " . Thank you . 
C:  Eh , why ? Because eh the spectral distortion is    
C:  more eh  a lot eh clearer , 
C:  very much clearer if we compare with the PDA . 
B:  Right . 
C:  PDA speech file is eh  it will be eh difficult . I  
E:  So it 's messier . 
E:  The  the PDA is messier . 
C:  Yeah , fff !  
C:  Because the n the noise eh to sp the signal - to - noise relation is eh  is  is low . 
D:  OK . 
C:  And , <mouth> I don't know  
B:  Yeah , I think that that 's a good way to start . But . 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  I don't know eh uh i i that eh the  
B:  <inbreath>  
C:  <mouth> the result of the  of the study eh with eh  with eh this eh  this speech , the mix speech 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  It would be interesting in itself to see . 
C:  eh  will work  exactly  with the  eh PDA files . 
C:  eh What , I  I mean , what what is the effect 
B:  Well , I think that would be an interesting result . 
D:  N u 
D:  We - 
C:  of the low 
C:  ' signal to  to  to noise relation , you know , eh with  
D:  Well , I think  I think  I think it 's not a  it 's not at all unreasonable . It makes sense to start with the simpler signal 
D:  because if you have features which don't  aren't even 
D:  helpful 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  in the high signal - to - noise ratio , then there 's no point in putting them into the low signal ratio , one would think , anyway . <breath> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  And so , if you can get  
D:  @ @  
D:  Uh again , my prescription would be 
D:  that you would , with a mixed 
D:  signal , you would take a collection of possible uh , features 
D:  <breath> 
D:  look at them , 
D:  look at how these different classes that you 've marked , separate themselves ,  <breath> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  and then collect , uh in pairs , 
D:  <breath> 
D:  and then collect ten of them or something , and then proceed <breath> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  with a bigger classifier . 
D:  <breath> 
D:  And then if you can get that to work well , 
D:  then you go to the other signal . 
D:  And then , and you and you know , they won't work as well , but 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
D:  how m you know , how much   
C:  Yeah . 
D:  And then you can re - optimize , and so on . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . But it I think it would be interesting to try a couple with both . 
B:  Because it  I think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed , and  
D:  Hmm . 
C:  Ah , yeah , yeah yeah yeah . @ @ 
D:  That 's  well , the  
B:  And don't  
D:  It  it 's  it 's true that it also , it could be <breath> useful to do this exploratory analysis where you 're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases . Sure . 
C:  But  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  I  I  I  I think that the  the eh parameter we found , eh , 
E:  That 's good .  
C:  eh <mouth> 
C:  worked 
C:  with both 
C:  eh , speech file , but eh what is the  the  
C:  the relation of eh  of the 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  performance when eh you use eh the , eh 
D:  Hmm . 
C:  eh speech file the PDA speech files . Yeah , I don't know . But it  
D:  Right . 
C:  I  I  I  I think it will be important . 
C:  Because eh people eh eh , different groups eh has eh experience with this eh kind of problem . Is  eh is not easy 
C:  eh to  to solve , because if you  <mouth> I  I  <mouth> 
C:  I have seen the  the  the speech file from eh PDA , and s 
C:  some parts is  very difficult because you  you don't see the spectrum  the spectrogram .  <laugh> Is very difficult to apply 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah , they 're totally hidden . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  eh , eh 
C:  a parameter to detect change when you don't see . But I suppose  
D:  Well , that  
D:  that  that 's another reason why very simple features , things like energy , and things  
D:  things like harmonicity , and <breath> residual energy are 
B:  Are probably better , yep .  
C:  Yeah , yeah yeah , I  I  I will put eh the energy here . 
D:  uh , yeah are  are better to use than very complex ones because they 'll be more reliable . <breath> 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Ch - Chuck was gonna ask something I guess . 
C:  Yeah . You have a question . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , I  maybe this is a dumb question , but 
A:  w I thought it would be  <laugh> I thought it would be easier if you used a PDA because can't you , couldn't you like use 
D:  Nah . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  beam - forming or something to detect speaker overlaps ? 
A:  I mean  
B:  Well , if you used the array , rather than the signal from just one . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Yeah , no , you you 're  you 're right that  
B:  But that 's  
D:  In fact , if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones , you do have some location information . 
D:  which we don't have with the one 
D:  and  and so that 's  
A:  Is that not allowed with this project ? 
D:  Uh , well , no , I mean , we we don't have any rules , r really . I think  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  But I didn't mean  I w  Given  given the goal . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  I mean , is  is that violation of the   
C:  Oh . 
D:  I  I think  I think it 's  it 's  it 's a  it 's an additional interesting question . 
C:  No . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  I mean , I think you wanna know whether you can do it with one , because 
D:  you know it 's not necessarily true that every device that you 're trying to do this with will have two . 
A:  Mm - hmm 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh , if , on the other hand , we show that there 's a huge advantage with two , well then that could be a real point . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  But , we don't n even know yet what the effect of detecting  having the ability to detect overlaps is . You know , maybe it doesn't matter too much . 
A:  Right . Right . 
D:  <breath> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  So , this is all pretty early stages . But no , you 're absolutely right . That 's  a good thing to consider . 
A:  OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  I see . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  OK . 
E:  There  there is a complication though , and that is if a person turns their back to the  to the PDA , then some of the positional information goes away ? 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Well , it  it  it does , i it d it does , but the  
E:  <laugh> And then , 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  No , it 's not  it 's not that so much as  
D:  the  the issue is that  that  
E:  And if they 're on the access   on the axis of it , that was the other thing I was thinking . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  He  You mentioned this last time , that  that if  if you 're straight down the midline , 
B:  Yeah , we hav need to put it on a little turntable , and  
C:  I  I  <breath> I  
E:  then  then  the r the left - right 's gonna be different , and  and  and in his case , 
C:  I  I th  
A:  Well , it 's - 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  I mean , he 's closer to it anyway . It seems to me that  that it 's not  a p uh , you know , it 's  this  the topograph the topology of it is  is a little bit complicated . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  But it 's another source of information . 
C:  I  I  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  I don't  I don't know ho 
C:  I  I  I think  Sorry . 
C:  I  I  I think because the the the distance between the two microph 
C:  eh , microphone , eh , in the PDA is 
C:  very near . But it 's uh  
C:  from my opinion , it 's an interesting idea 
C:  to  to try to study the binaural 
C:  eh problem eh , with information , because I  I found 
A:  I would guess  
B:  Yep . 
C:  difference between the  the speech from  from each micro 
C:  eh , in the PDA . 
D:  Yeah , it 's timing difference . It - it 's not amplitude , right ? 
E:  Oh yeah ! Oh I agree ! And we use it ourselves . 
D:  S 
E:  I mean , I know  I n I know that 's a very important cue .  
B:  Yep . 
D:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  But I 'm just  I 'm just saying that 
E:  the way we 're seated around a table , 
E:  is not the same 
E:  with respect to each  to each person with respect to the PDA , so we 're gonna have 
C:  No .  No . 
C:  No , no , no . 
D:  That 's  
E:  a lot of differences with ref respect to the speaker . 
A:  But th I don't think that matters , though . 
D:  That 's fine . 
C:  But  
D:  That 's  So  so i @ @  
D:  I think the issue is , 
D:  " Is there a clean signal coming from only one direction ? " 
A:  Right . 
E:  <inbreath> 
D:  If it 's not coming from just one direction , if it  if th if there 's a broader pattern , it means that it 's more likely there 's multiple people speaking , 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  wherever they are . 
A:  So it 's sort of like how  how confused is it 
D:  Is it a  is it  
D:  Yeah , is there a narrow  
A:  about where the beam is . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  Is there a narrow beam pattern or is it a  a distributed beam pattern ? 
D:  So if there 's a distributed beam pattern , then it looks more like it 's  it 's uh , multiple people . <breath> 
E:  OK . 
D:  Wherever you are , even if he moves around . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK , it just  it just seemed to me that  
E:  uh , 
E:  that this isn't the ideal type of separation . I mean , I  I think it 's  
D:  Oh , ideal would be to have the wall filled with them , but I mean  <laugh> 
E:  I can see the value o 
E:  Yeah , OK .  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  But the thing is just having two mikes  If you looked at that thing on  on Dan 's page , 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  it was  When  when there were two people speaking , and it looked really really different . 
E:  <inbreath> Oh yeah yeah . OK . Yeah . 
B:  Yep . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  What looked different ? 
D:  Uh , well , basic he was looking at correlation . 
B:  Cross - co cross - correlation .  
D:  Just cross - correlation between two sides . 
C:  Correlation , yeah . 
D:  <breath> So cross - correlation is pretty sensitive . 
A:  Did - Sorry , b uh 
A:  I 'm not sure what Dan 's page is that you mean . He was looking at the two  
E:  Uh , his a web page . 
D:  You take the signal from the two microphones and you cros and you cross - correlate them with different lags . 
B:  Subtract them .  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  OK . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
D:  OK . 
B:  And you find  
D:  So when one person is speaking , then wherever they happen to be at the point when they 're speaking , 
D:  <breath> then there 's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the l in  in the lag . 
B:  They get peaks .  
D:  So if  at whatever angle you are , <breath> 
A:  OK . OK . 
A:  So  so if there 's two  
D:  at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there , 
D:  you get this boost in the  in  in the cross - correlation value  function . 
B:  And if there are multiple people talking , you 'll see two peaks . 
E:  <inbreath> 
D:  It 's spread out . 
E:  Well , let me ask you , if  if both people were over there , 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across , catty - corner ? No ?  
D:  The - the  Oh , I 'm sorry , if they 're right next to one another ? i i 
A:  If I was  if I was here and Morgan was there and we were both talking , 
E:  Next  next one over n over  on this side of the P  PDA . 
E:  There we go . 
B:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  it wouldn't work . 
E:  Good example , the same one I 'm asking . 
D:  Yeah , e I see . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Versus you  versus  you know , and we 're catty - corner across the table , and I 'm farther away from this one and you 're farther away from that one . 
A:  Yes . 
B:  Or  or even if , like , 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
E:  It seems like that would be pretty strong . 
D:  Yeah . Oh , yeah .  <breath> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  if people were sitting right across from each other , you couldn't tell the difference either . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Across  the same axis , you don't have as much to differentiate . 
E:  And so my point was just that it 's  it 's gonna be differentially  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , 
D:  we d yeah , we don't have a third dimension there . Yeah , so it 's  
B:  Right . 
E:  differentially varia valuable . 
E:  I mean , it 's not to say  I mean , I certainly think it 's extremely val  And we  we humans  n n depend on  you know , these  these binaural cues . But . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  But it 's almost  but it 's almost a  
D:  <breath> 
B:  Must do .  
D:  I think what you 're talking about i there 's two things . There 's a sensitivity issue , and then there 's a pathological error uh issue . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  So th the one where someone is just right directly in line is sort of a pathological error . If someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it . 
E:  Yes . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . and i and if there  So it  And if it 's the two of you guys on the same side  
D:  Uh , if they 're  if they 're close , it 's just a question of the sensitivity . 
B:  Yep . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
D:  So if the sensitivity is good enough  and we just  we just don't have enough , uh , experience with it to know how  
E:  Yeah yeah , OK . 
B:  But  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <breath> 
E:  Yeah . Oh I 'm not  I 'm not trying to argue against using it , by any means . I just wanted to point out that  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  that weakness , that it 's topo topologically impossible 
B:  And I think Dan is still working on it . So . He actually  
E:  to get it perfect for everybody . 
B:  he wrote me about it a little bit , so . 
E:  Great . No , I don't mean to discourage that at all . 
D:  I mean , the other thing you can do  uh , if  I mean , i We 're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody  convince somebody to put two microphones in the PDA . 
C:  <cough> 
D:  But if you h put a third in , <laugh> 
C:  <cough> 
D:  you could put in the other axis . And then you know  then you 're sort of  
A:  Once you got two   
E:  Interesting .  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , then  then you pretty much could cover  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Well what about just doing it from these mikes ? 
E:  Interesting . 
A:  You know ? 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yep . 
C:  It will be more interesting to study the PZM because the  the  the separation  I  I think  
D:  Uh 
D:  @ @  
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  But - but that 's  
B:  Then they 're much broader . 
D:  I mean , we can we 'll be  all of this is there for us to study . 
B:  Yeah , we can do whatever we want . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  But  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  but  but the thing is , uh , one of the  at least one of the things I was hoping to get at with this is what 
B:  Whatever you 're interested in .  
D:  can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a PDA . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  That 's what I was asking about , what are the constraints ? 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Well , that 's  that 's the constraint of one question that I think both Adam and I were  were  were interested in . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Well  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yep . 
D:  <breath> Uh , but  you know if you can instrument a room , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  this is really minor league compared with what some people are doing , right ? Some people at  at  uh , yeah , at Brown and  and  and  and  at uh  
B:  Big micro @ @ arrays . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Didn't they have something at Cape ? Uh . 
D:  um and at Cape , 
D:  they both have these , you know , big arrays on the wall . And you know , if you could do that , you 've got microphones all over the place 
B:  Very finely . 
C:  <sniff> 
D:  uh , you know p tens of microphones , and  and uh  <breath> 
A:  Oh ! I saw a demo . 
C:  Oh , right , oh , yeah . 
D:  And if you do that then you can really get very nice uh kind of selectivity  
A:  Yeah .  
B:  Oh , I saw one that was like 
B:  a hundred microphones , a ten by ten array . And they had very precision .   
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Hundred . 
A:  And you could  In a noisy room , they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom right in on somebody . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
C:  Very complex , uh  
D:  Ye - Pretty much . Yeah . 
B:  It was all in software and they  and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  That is cool . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  It was  yeah , it was interesting . 
D:  But , 
D:  the reason why I haven't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because 
D:  um , I 'm interested in what happens for people , random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion . 
D:  And you can't just always go , " well , let 's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up " . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <breath> 
A:  No , what you need to do is you 'd have 
A:  a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall . It has all these mikes and it has a plug - in jack to the PDA . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Interesting . 
D:  The other thing actually , that gets at this a little bit of something else I 'd like to do , is what happens if you have two P D As  and they communicate with each other ? 
B:  But I think  
B:  Yep . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  And then  You know , they 're in random positions , the likelihood that  I mean , basically there wouldn't be any  l likely to be any kind of nulls , if you even had two . 
A:  Ooo !  
B:  That 's on my web pages . Yeah . 
A:  Network ! 
E:  Interesting . 
D:  If you had three or four it 's  
B:  Though  
D:  Yeah .  
B:  All sorts of interesting things you can do with that , I mean , not only can you do microphone arrays , but you can do all sorts of um 
E:  Interesting . 
E:  Hmm . 
B:  multi - band 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  as well . 
E:  Ah ! 
B:  So it 's  it would be neat . 
A:  I still like my rug on the wall idea , so if anybody patents that , then   
D:  <laugh> 
B:  But  I think  in terms of  
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Well , you could have strips that you stick to your clothing . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah .  
A:  Yeah ! 
A:  Hats ? 
B:  In terms of the research  th research , it 's really  
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  it 's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do . 
A:  Shirts . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  So if  if Jose is interested in that , that 's great . But if  if 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  he 's not , that 's great too . 
D:  Yeah .  
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 


D:  Um , I  i I  i 
D:  I would actually kind of like us to wind it down , see if we can still 
D:  get to the end of the , uh , birthdays thing there . 
B:  Catch some tea ?  
D:  <breath-laugh> So th 
B:  Um . 
D:  OK . 
B:  Well , I had a couple things that I did wanna bring out . One is , do we need to sign new  these again ? 
E:  Well , it 's slightly different . So I  I would say it would be a good idea . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  Cuz  it  it 's slightly different . 
A:  Are they new ? 
B:  Yep . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  <mike spike> 
D:  Oh , this morning we didn't sign anything cuz we said that if anybody had signed it already , we didn't have to . 
B:  Yeah , I  I should 've checked with Jane first , but the ch the form has changed . 
E:  It 's slightly different . 
C:  <scratching sound> 
D:  Ah - oh .  
B:  So we may wanna have everyone sign the new form . 
C:  OK . 
E:  I had to make one   
B:  Um , I had some things I wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff I 'm doing . 
B:  But , if we 're in a hurry , we can put that off . 
B:  Um 
B:  and then also anonymity , how we want to anonymize the data . 
E:  Well , should I  
B:  Uh . 
E:  I mean I have some results to present , but I mean I guess we won't have time to do that this time . 
E:  But it seems like um the anonymization is uh , 
E:  is also something that we might wanna discuss in greater length . 
D:  Um . I mean , wha what  
E:  If  if we 're about to wind down , I think  what I would prefer is that we uh , delay the anonymization thing till next week , and I would like to present 
E:  the results that I have on the overlaps . 
A:  We still have to do this , too , right ? 
D:  Right . 
A:  Digits ? 
D:  Right . 
B:  No - well , we don't have to do digits . 
D:  <breath> Well , why don't we  
C:  <cough> 
D:  <mouth> 
D:  Uh , 
D:  so 
D:  @ @ 
D:  OK . @ @  
D:  It sounds like u 
D:  uh , there were  there were a couple technical things people would like to talk about . Why don't we just take a couple minutes to  to briefly  
D:  do them , and then  and then  and then  and then  and then we  
B:  OK , go ahead , Jane . 
E:  I 'd  Oh , I 'd prefer to have more time for my results . e 
E:  Could I do that next week maybe ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  Oh , yeah . Sure . 
E:  OK , that 's what I 'm asking . 
D:  Oh yeah , yeah . 
E:  And I think the anonymization , if y if you want to proceed with that now , I just think that that 's  that 's a discussion which also 
E:  n 
E:  really deserves a lo a  you know , more that just a minute . I really do think that , because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself , you and I have discussed it previously , and there are different ways that people approach it , e and I think we should  
D:  We could s 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Alright . We 're  we 're just  
B:  We 're getting enough data now that I 'd sort of like to do it now , before I get overwhelmed with  once we decide how to do it 
B:   going and dealing with it . 
E:  Well , OK . 
E:   <laugh> It 's just  Yeah . OK . 
C:  <laugh or cough> 
E:  I  I 'll give you the short version , but I do think it 's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 


E:  OK , so  
E:  the  the short thing is 
E:  um , we have 
E:  uh , tape recording uh , uh , sorry , digitized recor recordings . 
E:  Those we won't be able to change . If someone says " Hey , Roger so - and - so " . 
B:  Right . 
E:  So that 's gonna stay that person 's name . 
B:  Yep . 


E:   Now , in terms of like the transcript , 
E:  the question becomes what symbol are you gonna put in there for everybody 's name , 
E:  and whether you 're gonna put it in the text where he says " Hey Roger " or are we gonna put that person 's anonymized name in instead ? 
B:  No , because then that would give you a mapping , 
B:  and you don't wanna have a mapping . 
E:  OK , so first decision is , we 're gonna anonymize the same name 
E:  for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker 's name is mentioned . 
B:  No . 
A:  I don't  
B:  Because that would give you a mapping between the speaker 's real name and the tag we 're using , 
E:  I  I don't think you understood what I  what I said . So  
B:  and we don't want  
B:  OK . 
E:  uh , so in  within the context of an utterance , someone says " So , Roger , what do you think ? " 
E:  OK . 
E:  Then , uh , it seems to me that  
E:  Well , maybe I  uh it seems to me that if you change the name , 
E:  the transcript 's gonna disagree with the audio , and you won't be able to use that . 
B:  We don't  we wanna  we ha we want the transcript to be " Roger " . 
A:  Right , you don't wanna do that . 
B:  Because if we made the  the transcript be the tag that we 're using for Roger , 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping 
B:  between the anonymized name and the real name , and we wanna avoid that . 
E:  OK , well , but then 
E:  there 's this issue of if we 're gonna use this for a discourse type of thing , 
E:  then  
E:  and , you know , Liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who 's  who 's the addressee and all , 
B:  Oh . 
E:  then to have " Roger " be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was " Roger " be " Frank " , 
E:  that 's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis . 
E:   Now , if you want to , you know , I mean , in some cases , I  I  I know that Susan Ervin - Tripp in some of hers , uh , actually did do uh , um , a filter of the s signal where the person 's name was mentioned , except 
B:  Ugh !  That 's a good point . 
A:   
B:   
C:   
D:   
E:   
F:   
D:  Yeah 
E:  And  and I  cer and I  So , I mean , the question then becomes one level back . 
E:  Um , how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name ? 
E:  Well , 
E:  on the one hand , 
E:  uh , it 's not a full identity , we 're taking all these precautions , 
E:  um 
E:  and they 'll be taking precautions , which are probably even the more important ones , to  they 'll be reviewing the transcripts , to see if there 's something they don't like   OK . 
E:  So , maybe , uh , maybe that 's enough protection . On the other hand , 
E:  this is a small  this is a small pool , and people who say things about topic X 
E:  e who are researchers and well - known in the field , they 'll be identifiable and simply from the  from the first name . 
E:  However , taking one step further back , they 'd be identifiable anyway , even if we changed all the names . 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  Right . 
E:  So , is it really , um   
C:  Mmm . 
B:  Ugh !  
E:  You know ? 
E:  Now , in terms of like  so I  I did some results , which I 'll report on n next time , 
A:  <long breath> 
E:  which do mention individual speakers by name . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Now , there , the Human Subjects Committee is very precise . 
E:  You don't wanna mention subjects by name 
E:  in published reports . 
E:  Now , it would be very possible for me to take those data 
E:  put them in a  in a study , and just change everybody 's name for the purpose of the publication . 
D:  Yeah , once you get to the publication you can certainly do that . You can go , you know , uh , " Z " <laugh> uh , for instance . Uh . 
E:   And someone who looked  
C:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  Yeah , exactly . Doesn't matter if  
D:  Um , yeah , I mean , t it doesn't  
D:  I mean , I 'm not knowledgeable about this , but it certainly doesn't bother me to have someone 's first name in  in the  in the transcript . 
E:  That 's the same thing you saw . 
B:  OK . @ @ 
D:  Uh , I think  you don't wanna have their full name to be uh , 
E:  Yeah , and  and in the form that they sign , 
D:  listed . And so  
B:  Yeah . 
E:  it does say " your first name may arise in the course of the meetings " . 
A:  Well  
A:  <outbreath> 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So again , th the issue is if you 're tracking discourse things , you know , if someone says , uh , uh , " Frank said this " and then you wanna connect it to something later , you 've gotta have this part where that 's " Frank colon " . Right ? 
E:  Or " your name " . 
B:  Yeah , shoot !  
E:  Yeah , and  and  you know , even more i i uh , immediate than that just 
E:  being able to , 
E:  uh  
E:  Well , it just seems like to track  track from one utterance to the next utterance who 's speaking and who 's speaking 
E:  to whom , cuz that can be important . S 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  i You know , " You raised the point , So - and - so " , it 's be kind of nice to 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Shoot !  
E:  be able to know who " you " was . And ac  
B:  I  I 'm thinking too much . 
E:  and actually you remember  furthermore , you remember last time we had this discussion of how 
E:  you know , I was sort of avoiding mentioning people 's names , 
B:  <laugh> 
E:   and  and it was  and we made the decision that was kind of artificial . Well , I mean , if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people 's names in the transcript , we 've basically done something one step worse . 
D:  Yeah , I was too . Yeah . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  <noise> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Well , I would sug I  I  don't wanna change the names in the transcript , but that 's because I 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse , and so I think that 's a really good point . 
E:  Misleading . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  You 're right , this is going to require more thought . 
D:  Yeah . 


D:  L let me just back up this to make a  a brief comment about the , uh , what we 're covering in the meeting . 
D:  Uh I realize when you 're doing this that uh  
D:  I mean , I didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about . 
C:  <loud breath> 
D:  <breath> Uh , and so , uh  
D:  and so I was proceeding some somewhat at random , 
D:  frankly . So I think what would be helpful would be 
D:  uh , 
D:  i 
D:  and I 'll  I 'll mention this to  to Liz and Andreas too , 
D:  that um , 
D:  before the meeting if anybody could send me , any  any , uh , uh , 
D:  agenda items that they were interested in 
E:  OK . 
E:  Sure . 
D:  and I 'll  I 'll take the role of organizing them 
D:  uh , into  into the agenda , 
D:  but I 'd be very pleased to have everyone else <breath> 
D:  completely make up the agenda . I 've no desire to  <laugh> to make it up , but 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  if  if no one 's told me things , then I 'm just proceeding from my  my guesses , and  
D:  and uh , 
D:  and i ye yeah , I  I 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Oh , it 's not a problem . Not a problem . Yeah . 
D:  I mean , I 'm just always asking Jose what he 's doing , you know , and  <laugh> and so it 's   There 's uh , there 's obviously other things going on . 
E:  I just  I just couldn't do it in two minutes . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 


B:  How will we  how would the person who 's doing the transcript 
B:  even know who they 're talking about ? 
B:  Do you know what I 'm saying ? 
E:  <inbreath> 
A:  " The person who 's doing the transcript  "  The IBM people ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I mean , so so  how is that information gonna get labeled anyway ? 
E:  How do you mean , who  what they 're  who they 're talking about ? 
E:  How do you mean ? 
B:  I mean , so if I 'm saying in a meeting , " oh and Bob , by the way , wanted  wanted to do so - and - so " , 
A:  They 're just gonna write " Bob " on it or do @ @  
B:  if you 're doing  
B:  Yeah , @ @ they 're just gonna write " Bob " . 
B:  And so . 
E:  They won't be able to change it themselves . 
B:  If you 're  if you 're doing discourse analysis ,  a 
D:  What ar how are they gonna do any of this ? 
B:  <outbreath> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah , really . 
E:  Well , I  I 'm betting we 're gonna have huge chunks that are just totally un 
D:  I mean , they 're gonna say speaker - one , or speaker - two or speaker I mean I  I  
E:  untranscribable by them . 
C:  Yeah , I think  
B:  Well , the current one they don't do speaker identity . 
A:  They can't do that . 
B:  because in NaturallySpeaking , or , excuse me , in ViaVoice , it 's only one person . 
B:  and so in their current conventions there are no multiple speaker conventions . 
E:  <mouth> <inbreath>  
D:  So it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words . 
E:  Oh . <inbreath> I think that  My understanding from Yen - 
B:  Yep . 
E:  Is it Yen - Ching ? Is that how you pronounce her name ? Oh , uh Yu - Ching ? Yu - Ching ?  
D:  Uh  Yu - Ching , Yu - Ching . Yeah . 
B:  y Yu - Ching . 
E:  was that um , they will  that they will adopt the  part of the conventions that  that we discussed , 
E:  where they put speaker identifier down . 
E:  But , you know , h they won't know these people , so I think 
E:  it 's  Well , they 'll  they 'll adopt some convention but we haven't specified 
E:  to them  So they 'll do something 
E:  like speaker - one , speaker - two , is what I bet , but I 'm betting there 'll be huge variations in the accuracy of  of their labeling the speakers . We 'll have to review the transcripts in any case . 
D:  And it  and it may very well be  I mean , since 
D:  they 're not going to sit there and  and  and worry ab about , uh , it being the same speaker , 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  they may very well go the  eh the  the first se the first time it changes to another speaker , that 'll be speaker - two . And the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it 's actually speaker - one . 
E:  You know  Uh - huh .  
E:  You know , that would be a very practical solution on their part . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . It 's a good idea . 
E:  And  and  but then we would need to label it . And that 's OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , I think  
B:  Yeah we  we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close - talking mikes . 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  Yes , I was thinking , the temp the time values of when it changes . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  So . But I mean that doesn't  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  But that  
E:  That 'd be very efficient . 
B:  This doesn't answer the  the question . 
B:  The p 
B:  It 's a good point , " which  what do you do for discourse tracking ? " 
C:  Because y y you don't know to know , eh  
C:  you don't need to know what i what is the iden identification of the  of the speakers . You only 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  eh want to know  
B:  For  for acoustics you don't but for discourse you do . 
D:  Well , you do . 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  Ah , for discourse , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . If  if  if  if someone says , uh , " what  what is Jose doing ? " and then Jose says something , you need to know that that was Jose responding . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah , yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> Uh , so . 
C:  Yeah , 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  @ @ Yeah . 
B:  Ugh ,  that 's a problem . 
E:  Unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not id to make a point of not identifying people by name , which then leads you to be more contextually ex explicit . 
A:  That would be hard . 
E:  Well , people are very flexible . You know ? I mean , so when we did this las last week , I felt that you know , now , Andreas may , uh , 
E:  @ @  
E:  uh , he  he  
E:  i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something , and  
E:  and because he missed something , then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about , and was  was unable to do the tracking . But I felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name . So , people are really flexible . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  But , you know , like , at the beginning of this meeting  
A:  Or , you I think said ,  you know , or s Liz , said something about um , uh , " is Mari gonna use the equipment ? " 
E:  Yeah ? 
A:  I mean , how would you say that ? 
A:  I mean , you have to really think , 
B:  if you wanted to anonymize .  
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <mouth> <inbreath>  
A:  you know , about what you 're saying bef 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  " Is you know who up in you know where ? " Right ? Use the  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  I think it would be really hard if we made a policy where we didn't say names , 
B:  Yeah , darn ! I mean , what I was gonna say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names . 
C:  Yeah , is  
E:  Well , it 
A:  plus we 'd have to tell everybody else . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  but then , again that kills your discourse analysis . Ugh !  
A:  Right . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Yeah .  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's  that 's the issue . 
A:  I  I think the  I think  
A:  I don't know , my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what 's in 
A:  the recordings , 
A:  you only anonymize 
A:  to the extent you can , 
E:  <inbreath>  
A:  the speakers have signed the forms and all . 
B:  Well , but that but that  as I said , that  that  that works great for the acoustics , but it  it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse . 
E:  Well . 
E:  Mm - hmm . <inbreath>  
D:  Yeah . Th - 
A:  Why ? 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Bec - 
B:  Because you don't have a map of who 's talking versus  their  name that they 're being referred to . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  I thought we were gonna get it labelled speaker - one , speaker - two  
B:  Sure but , h then you have to know that Jose is speaker - one and  
A:  Why do you have to know his name ? 
D:  OK , so suppose someone says , " well I don't know if I really heard what  
D:  uh , what Jose said . " 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  And then , Jose responds . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  And part of your learning about the dialogue is Jose responding to it . 
D:  But it doesn't say " Jose " , it says " speaker - five " . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
D:  So  uh  u 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh , I see , you wanna associated the word " Jose " in the dialogue with 
A:  the fact that then he responded . 
D:  Right . 
D:  And so , if we pass out the data to someone else , 
B:  Someone who 's doing discourse would wanna do that . 
D:  and it says " speaker - five " there , we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker - five is Jose , 
D:  and if were gonna do that we might as well  give them " Jose "  say it was " Jose " .  


B:  And that violates our privacy . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
B:  And that violates our privacy issue . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Now , I  I think that we have these two phases in the  in the data , which is the one which is o our use , University of Washington 's use , IBM , SRI . 
B:  <mike noise> 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  And within that , 
E:  it may be that it 's sufficient to not uh change the  to not incorporate anonymization yet , 
D:  <breath> 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  but always , always in the publications we have to . 
E:  And I think also , when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world , we have to . 
E:  But I  but I don that 's  that 's a long way from now and  and it 's a matter of  
B:  <laugh> 
E:  between now and then of d of deciding how  <inbreath> 
B:  Making some decisions ?  
E:  i i it  You know , it may be s that we we 'll need to do something like actually X out that part of the um  the audio , and just put in brackets " speaker - one " . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  For the public one . 
C:  the ? ? 
E:  You know . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  You know , what we could do also is have more than one version of release . One that 's public 
B:  and one  one that requires licensing . 
B:  And so the licensed one would  w we could  it would be a sticky limitation . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
B:  You know , like  Well , we can talk about that later . 
E:  I think that 's risky . I think that the public should be the same .  
E:  I think that when we do that world release , it should be the same . 
D:  I  I agree . 
D:  I  I agree with Jane . I  I think that we  we have a  need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort , 
E:  For a bunch of reasons , legal . 
E:  But I also think a consistent licensing policy is important . 
D:  and  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , one thing to to take into consideration is 
A:  w are there any 
A:  um  For example , the people who are funding this work , 
A:  they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse . If we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it 's not longer useful for discourse , 
A:  you know   
B:  Well , depending on how much editing we do , you might be able to  still have it useful . 
B:  because for discourse you don't need the audio . 
B:  Right ? So you could bleep out the names in the audio . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  and use the anonymized one through the transcript . 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  Excuse me . We  we do need audio for discourse . <laugh> 
D:  Uh . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  But if you release both  
D:  She  
B:  But , n excuse me , but you could bleep out just the names . 
D:  No , but she 's saying , from the argument before , she wants to be able to say if someone said " Jose " in their  in their thing , and then connect to so to what he said later , then you need it . 
B:  Right . But in the transcript , you could say , everywhere they said " Jose " 
B:  that you could 
B:  replace it with " speaker - seven " . 
D:  Oh I see . 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  Yeah . But I   I also wanna say that people  
D:  I see . 
B:  And then it wouldn't meet  match the audio anymore .  But it would be still useful for the  
E:  Uh - huh . 
A:  But if both of those are publically available   
E:  Yeah . That 's good . 
B:  But they  
B:  Right . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  And th and the other thing is if  if  if Liz were here , <laugh> what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue , and so , <breath> uh , <breath> yeah . 
E:  Well , you see ? So , it 's complicated . 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . I think we have to think about w 
D:  Sorry . 
E:  @ @  
E:  how . I think that this can't be decided today . 
B:  Yeah , OK , good point . 
E:  But it 's g but I think it was good to introduce the thing and we can 
C:  <clears throat> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <mouth> 
D:  OK .  
B:  I didn't think  when I wrote you that email I wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms , but I guess it is . 
E:  do it next time .  
C:  OK . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , a lot of these things are . 
E:  <inbreath> Well it  Discourse , you know  Also I wanted to make the point that  that discourse is gonna be more than just looking at a transcript . It 's gonna be looking at a t 
B:  Discourse . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , ab absolutely . 
B:  Oh , yeah , sure . 
E:  You know , and prosod prosodic stuff is involved , and that means you 're going to be listening to the audio , and then you come directly into this  confronting this problem . 
A:  Maybe we should just not allow anybody to do research on discourse , 
E:  So . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  and then , we wouldn't have to worry about it . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  OK . 
E:  Yeah , we should just market it to non - English speaking countries . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh , maybe we should only have meetings between people who don't know one another and who are also amnesiacs who don't know their own name . <laugh> 
C:  OK . 
A:  <laugh>

B:  Did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables ? 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  They were di they they had the utterances . and they would extract out the syllables and they would play them backwards . 
A:  But  so , the syllables were in the same order , with respect to each other , but the acous 
B:  Everything was in the same order , but they were  the individual syll  syllables were played backwards . 
B:  And you could listen to it ,  and it would sound the same . <laugh> 
A:  What did it sound like ? 
B:  People had no difficulty in interpreting it . 
B:  So what we need is something that 's the reverse , that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people can't understand it . 
A:  What ? 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh , well that 's  there 's an easy way to do that . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Jus - jus just play it all backwards .  
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh right . The speech recognizer 's totally symmetric , isn't it . 
D:  What , what does the speech recognizer care ? <laugh> 
B:  Ah , anyway .

B:  OK , go off here . 
A:  I think it would be fun sometime to read them with different intonations . 
A:  like as if you were talking 
A:  like , " nine eight six eight seven ? " 
E:  Well , you know , in the  in the one I transcribed , I did find a couple instances   I found one instance of contrastive stress , where it was like the string had a  
E:  li So it was like " nine eight two four , nine nine two four " . 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh , really . So they were like looking ahead , huh ? 
E:  And  
E:  Well , they differed . I mean , at that  that session I did feel like they did it more as sentences . 
E:  But , um , sometimes people do it as phone numbers .  I mean , I 've  I  
E:  am sort of interested in  in  And sometimes , you know , I s 
B:  Yep . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
E:  And I  I never know . When I do it , I  
E:  I ask myself what I 'm doing each time . and I  
A:  Well , I was thinking that it must get kind of boring for the people who are gonna have to transcribe this 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Well , except , yeah .  We have the transcript . We have the actual numbers they 're reading , so we 're not necessarily depending on that . OK , I 'm gonna go off . 
A:  They may as well throw in some interesting intonations . 
E:  I like your question intonation . That 's very funny . I haven't heard that one . 
E:  <laugh>
