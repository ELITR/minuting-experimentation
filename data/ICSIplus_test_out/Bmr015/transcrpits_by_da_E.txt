E:  But  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Eight eight two two two nine . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah .

E:  Tomorrow ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . Yeah . 
E:  I said something , yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Very  very , 
E:  yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , but those backchannels will always be a problem I think . 
E:  Uh especially if they 're really short 
E:  and they 're not very loud 
E:  and so it  it can  it  it will always happen that also the automatic s detection system will miss some of them , 
E:  so . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I 'm not too experienced with <laugh> harmonics 
E:  and  
E:  To get the pitch , yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  No . 
E:  No  i 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Oops . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , and that 's  that  that quite co corresponds to the way I  I try to train the speech - nonspeech detector , 
E:  as I really try to  not to detect those breaths 
E:  which are not within a speech chunk but with  which are just in  in a silence region . 
E:  And they  so they hopefully won't be marked in  in those channel - specific files . 
E:  But
