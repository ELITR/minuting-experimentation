F:  <breath> 
A:  <breath> OK <breath> 


D:  <mouth> <breath> Uh . <breath> Alright . So . I <breath> uh <breath> 
F:  <clear throat> 
F:  <mike noise> 
C:  <breath> 
D:  uh wanted to mention a couple little bits of news . <breath> 
C:  <breath> 
D:  Um Hynek is supposed to come for a couple days next week . <breath> 
D:  Don't know which days yet . <breath> So hopefully he 'll have some intensive time to  to work with people . 
D:  <breath> 
D:  Um . <breath> The second thing is that um <breath> 
E:  <breath> <breath> 
D:  we 're starting to talk about maybe having Sunil come here uh for some chunk of the summer . 
D:  So that may or may not happen but <breath> if he does since actually Pratibha is going to be off at IBM <breath> um <breath> the <breath> uh effort will pretty much 
A:  <breath> 
D:  shift here , 
A:  <breath> 
D:  cuz Sunil will be here and <breath> other people are working on other things I think . So . <breath> <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
D:  So . 
D:  <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
D:  Uh . <breath> 
D:  That 's my news . 
D:  <breath> <laugh> 
E:  <breath> 
C:  <breath> <breath> 
C:  Alright . <breath> 
F:  Cool . I need a new office mate . 
A:  <breath> 
D:  <breath> 
D:  Oh , OK . <laugh> <breath> 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  That 's cool . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> <breath> <laugh> 
D:  There you go . <laugh> 
F:  Right . <laugh> <breath> 
C:  It will be some sometime in summer . July or August , or . 
D:  <breath> 
D:  Yeah , I mean it may not happen . I mean he wants  uh I think he wants some experience someplace else and he 's  he 's uh <breath> thinking of going someplace , but it 's  I mean Pratibha is getting her experience going to IBM and he may come here . So . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  But y I don't know maybe June . <breath> Maybe earlier . But uh . Anyway , Hynek will be here next week and maybe he 'll know more about it . 
C:  <breath> 
D:  <breath> <breath> 


C:  <mouth> <breath> Oh yeah . <breath> Well , the news <breath> <breath> 
A:  <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
C:  more specifically t for Aurora um <mouth> 
E:  <breath> 
C:  <breath> So I guess there was again a <breath> conference call but 
E:  <breath> 
F:  <clear throat> 
E:  <breath> 
C:  uh they are not decide on <breath> everything yet . 
E:  <breath> <breath> 
C:  <breath> 


C:  For the VAD they  probably they will do something like <clear throat> having some kind of idealized VAD that they could <breath> run on the channel zero <breath> 
C:  of the SpeechDat - Car <breath> and then take the same um end points 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  and apply them on channel one so it 's  
D:  Oh so take a real VAD but apply it to  to  to the clean  
C:  <breath> 
C:  Uh g 
C:  Yeah , to the clean and take the end points for the noisy . Mmm . 
D:  clean data . <breath> OK . 
A:  <breath> 
C:  <breath> But I am not sure this is decided yet . Um . 
A:  <breath> 
D:  And  and i when they 're talking about it , do you have the impression that they 're talking about <breath> 
A:  <breath> 
D:  a particular VAD which everybody would use ? or  or just that everybody would use the same procedure ? 
C:  <breath> 
C:  Well , probably uh s the same VAD <breath> for everybody . <breath> 
D:  <scratchy noise> 
A:  <breath> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <breath> 
D:  <breath> 
C:  Um . 
A:  So they would just provide that as part of the data . 
C:  <mouth> Maybe . But this is still  
D:  Yeah . Sounds like they 're still arguing . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , they 're still <breath> not decided . 
D:  <breath> Yeah . <breath> 
C:  <breath> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Um I don't know what  
C:  Yeah . <breath> 
C:  Nothing much . Yeah . Probably the um  <breath> 
C:  these weight things , they will <breath> 
C:  apply the same kind of weighting scheme for <mouth> 
C:  TI - digits than for the SpeechDat - Car . <breath> 
C:  So it would be weighting of <breath> um  
C:  It would be an average of improvements rather than an average of <breath> word error rates which would make <breath> the more clean 
A:  <breath> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  parts of TI - digits more important than they are right now . 
D:  <breath> <breath> <breath> 
C:  <breath> <breath> 
D:  <breath> OK . 
D:  <breath> 
D:  Uh but it sounds like none of this is really decided , that this is how things are leaning and  
C:  This <breath> 


C:  They  they t I think they will tend to go this way , but hmm . <breath> Uh . <cough> 
D:  <breath> <breath> 
C:  Yeah , if we have the result for the tandem with um MSG also 
C:  <page turning> 
C:  So @ @ <breath> it was t <laugh> <breath> 
C:  <clear throat> Yeah there is no surpri there is no surprise . Well , 
C:  so there is nor significant improvement . 
C:  <breath> 
C:  Um . <breath> <mouth> <breath> <breath> 
C:  Yeah , basically that 's all . <breath> 
C:  We 've started to work on some kind of report for the work <breath> so we 've not much 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <breath> 
D:  Yeah you have a uh  you have a lunch talk sometime in  <breath> When is it ? 
C:  more results . Hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  It 's next week , yeah . 
E:  <breath> 
D:  Next week ? Oh , OK . 
E:  <breath> 
A:  <breath> How about the um  the thing that you guys were working on before the uh 
D:  <breath> <noise> <breath> 
A:  Uh <clear throat> voiced - unvoiced uh  
C:  <breath> 
E:  Oh yes . But , <breath> <breath> 
E:  no . This week I 'm  <breath> I am begin to  to write the report on  
A:  Ah . 
E:  I stopped it . Interfered . Yeah . 
A:  You stopped working on it I see 
D:  OK . Uh . 
C:  <breath> 
D:  So it sounds like basically things are slowing down a bit ? And  and  and trying to 
A:  <breath> 
D:  collate results ? and <breath> get something from it ? 
C:  Mm - hmm . <breath> Yeah . <breath> 
D:  Yeah . 


C:  Um . Yeah . Right now , Sunil seems i is in India actually . <breath> Uh so <breath> there is no progress apparently from their side neither . 
D:  Right . 
C:  <breath> 
D:  Right . But that sort of puts it on us to do it . But . <breath> 
C:  Um . And  
C:  I 'm sorry ? <breath> 
D:  Kind of puts it on us to put more in , then , really . <breath> 
C:  Yeah . <breath> 
D:  I mean . Uh . Who 's  who 's  was uh looking at the combination of uh spectral s subtraction approaches with what we had for instance . 
E:  <breath> 
C:  Sunil was <breath> working on this . <breath> 
D:  OK . 
E:  <breath> 
C:  Um . <breath> 
C:  He sent a bunch of  a bunch of results uh but I don't know what 's the status of this . I guess it was just the result that he sent , so . <breath> Um . 
D:  What was that again ? 
C:  <breath> He just used the spectral subtraction and the LDA filters I guess <breath> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <breath> Mmm . 
C:  And it was not 
D:  And  
C:  better than what we had before . <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
C:  Then he tried to put the on - line normalization and <clear throat> 
C:  it did not improve further , putting the on - line normalization , so . 
C:  <breath> Um . <breath> 
C:  Yeah . <breath> 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  <breath> Huh . 
D:  <breath> 
D:  OK . Well  <breath> <laugh> <breath> 
C:  Hmm .  
F:  <breath> <noise> 
D:  Yeah . I  uh , I g so I guess nothing has ever happened about uh making a standardized uh place where the software sits so that people can work with it , and <breath> upgrade it ? 
A:  <breath> 
C:  No . Well , I  I sent mails to start the  the process and I guess we should have to  <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
C:  <breath> 
C:  Well , we know most what we have to  to put in  in this . <breath> And . 
A:  <breath> 
C:  <clear throat> Yeah . 
C:  So , I guess . Yeah , we m 
D:  OK . <breath> 
D:  Well , uh . Let 's  let 's come back to this uh later . <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
D:  Um . <breath> OK . 
E:  <breath> 


D:  Um . <breath> Chuck , did you get a chance to do anymore stuff with the uh 
A:  No . I didn't . Um , are you talking about  
D:  HTK , or  ?  
A:  Uh , no . This week I haven't . I 've been  my whole time 's been taken up with uh <breath> Meeting Recorder stuff . 
A:  <breath> Uh , disk crash and uh 
D:  OK . <breath> 
D:  u 
D:  OK . <breath> 
A:  covering things . <breath> 
D:  This may be a very short meeting . Uh . <breath> <breath> Um . 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  <breath> 
D:  Anything from <breath> 
D:  your side ? 
F:  Uh , continuing readings we come <breath> 
C:  <sniff> 
C:  <clear throat> 
F:  Uh . We 're doing some background reading on phonetics . 
D:  Uh - huh . 


D:  OK . <breath> Dave ? <breath> 
F:  Yeah .  
B:  Well um . <breath> 
B:  One thing in  in the paper Avendano and his collaborators wrote <breath> is that  is that um <breath> they tried doing channel normalization on the reverberant in speech by um <breath> 
A:  <breath> 
F:  <clear throat> 
B:  subtracting the mean of the log spectral magnitude <breath> over a two second window . But they didn't do anything with the phase , 
B:  and they said perhaps that limited their approach that it did not try to normalize the phase in any way . <breath> 
D:  <breath> 
C:  <sniff> 
B:  So I 'm  I 'm going to start thinking about <breath> um ways that the ph that the phase could be used . 
B:  Um . Si - if  if the um channel <breath> and the reverberation is multiplicative in the frequency domain with the speech spectrum then the <breath> phases should be additive . 
D:  <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
B:  So um perhaps just subtracting the mean of the phase would  would help . 
C:  <breath> 
B:  Um but I don't know I th I get the impression that they tried to do some things with the phase and they weren't successful . 
A:  <breath> 
C:  <sniff> 
D:  <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
D:  OK . 




A:  <breath> Oh . You know , there is one other thing . Um Stephane showed me a paper yesterday <breath> um 
E:  <breath> 
A:  where th uh for the Italian system they had done a series of experiments playing around with the um  <breath> the number of iterations , that I talked about last week ? <breath> And , um , so , there was a whole series of those that they had done . They didn't , I don't think , reported timing <breath> for those , but um <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
B:  <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
B:  <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <sniff> 
D:  <noise> 
E:  <breath> 
B:  <breath> 
D:  <sniff> 
D:  <breath> 
E:  <breath> <cough> <cough> <cough> 
B:  <breath> 
A:  it turns out that the one that they 're actually using was not the best , uh in  in their series of experiments , which I uh  Maybe it 's because they <breath> uh wanted to use the same number of iterations across all different languages and this was only done on Italian or something . <breath> 
D:  Sure . Wh - who 's they  they ? 
A:  Uh , I don't know who did it do you know , Stephane ? Who did that ? 
F:  <noise> 
C:  Um . 
C:  I don't know but it 's the company who prepared the Italian database , so it was  Is it Alcatel , or  ?  <breath> 
E:  I think so . <breath> 
C:  I  
D:  Mmm . 
F:  <noise> 
C:  I don't know . <breath> 
A:  So um <breath> you know there wasn't a huge difference in terms of the performance across all the different experiments that they did . <breath> Um . But it varied a little bit . <breath> And uh  So I guess the main thing that I take out of that is that I think that for our purposes here we could definitely <breath> you know decrease the number of iterations that we do <breath> and um , at least while we 're , you know , working on uh <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
B:  <breath> 
B:  <breath> 
F:  <noise> <noise> 
A:  all different of kinds of variations , and that would let us , you know , pump through a lot more experiments . <breath> So um I still have to  to send everybody a 
F:  <scratchy noise> 
E:  <breath> 
B:  <breath> 
A:  pointer about uh <breath> how to run the um <mouth> HTK system <breath> on the Linux boxes and about changing these number of iterations so that  
E:  <breath> 


A:  so that you can do that . <breath> Um . <breath> So the  the other thing that that I was thinking about maybe trying out next is um  
B:  <breath> <breath> <breath> 
A:  Oh ! 
A:  The other th the other experiment that they had in that paper was uh uh playing with the number of Gaussians per state . 
A:  And so . 
C:  Uh . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  I think it 's  was playing with the number of states per word . They had sixteen , seventeen , eighteen . 
C:  Yeah , because it was around  between sixteen and twenty or  
A:  OK . I should look at that more carefully cuz I wonder 
B:  <breath> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <breath> 
A:  what 
A:  they did about  
A:  Oh , OK . I was thinking it was Gaussians but it 's states . OK . 
C:  So , and  
C:  Yeah , apparently , 
A:  <breath> 
C:  um <mouth> they had better results when they increased the number of states . 
E:  <breath> 
C:  From  from eighteen to twenty , or  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So . <breath> The thing I was thinking about was uh , you know , the number of insertions really goes up when you <breath> start adding all the noise in , and maybe the thing to do next would be to try to um <breath> 
B:  <breath> 
A:  uh make the silence model more powerful , you know , increasing the number of Gaussians to the number of states , different  different things like that , so . <breath> That 's probably the next little thing I 'll play with when I get a chance 
D:  <breath> 


D:  OK . <breath> 


D:  Um . <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
D:  <mouth> Let 's see . 
D:  <breath> <breath> 
D:  Um . 
D:  Why don't  why don't we uh  if there aren't any other major things , why don't we do the digits , and then  then uh turn the mikes off . 
A:  <breath>
