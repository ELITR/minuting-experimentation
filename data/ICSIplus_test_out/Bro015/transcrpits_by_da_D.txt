D:  OK . 
D:  Uh . <breath> Alright . 
D:  So . I <breath> uh <breath> uh wanted to mention a couple little bits of news . 
D:  Um Hynek is supposed to come for a couple days next week . 
D:  Don't know which days yet . 
D:  So hopefully he 'll have some intensive time to  to work with people . 
D:  Um . <breath> The second thing is that um <breath> we 're starting to talk about maybe having Sunil come here uh for some chunk of the summer . 
D:  So that may or may not happen 
D:  but <breath> if he does since actually Pratibha is going to be off at IBM <breath> um <breath> the <breath> uh effort will pretty much shift here , 
D:  cuz Sunil will be here and <breath> other people are working on other things I think . 
D:  So . <breath> <breath> So . 
D:  Uh . <breath> That 's my news . 
D:  Oh , OK . 
D:  There you go . 
D:  Yeah , I mean it may not happen . 
D:  I mean he wants  uh I think he wants some experience someplace else and he 's  he 's uh <breath> thinking of going someplace , 
D:  but it 's  I mean Pratibha is getting her experience going to IBM and he may come here . 
D:  So . 
D:  But y I don't know maybe June . 
D:  Maybe earlier . 
D:  But uh . 
D:  Anyway , Hynek will be here next week and maybe he 'll know more about it . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Oh so take a real VAD but apply it to  to  to the clean  clean data . 
D:  OK . 
D:  And  and i when they 're talking about it , do you have the impression that they 're talking about <breath> a particular VAD which everybody would use ? 
D:  or  or just that everybody would use the same procedure ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Sounds like they 're still arguing . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Uh but it sounds like none of this is really decided , that this is how things are leaning 
D:  and  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah you have a uh  you have a lunch talk sometime in  
D:  When is it ? 
D:  Next week ? 
D:  Oh , OK . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Uh . 
D:  So it sounds like basically things are slowing down a bit ? 
D:  And  and  and trying to collate results ? 
D:  and <breath> get something from it ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
D:  But that sort of puts it on us to do it . 
D:  But . <breath> Kind of puts it on us to put more in , then , really . 
D:  I mean . Uh . Who 's  who 's  was uh looking at the combination of uh spectral s subtraction approaches with what we had for instance . 
D:  OK . 
D:  What was that again ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And  
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Huh . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Well  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I  uh , I g so I guess nothing has ever happened about uh making a standardized uh place where the software sits so that people can work with it , and <breath> upgrade it ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  Well , uh . Let 's  let 's come back to this uh later . 
D:  Um . <breath> OK . 
D:  Um . <breath> Chuck , did you get a chance to do anymore stuff with the uh HTK , 
D:  or  ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  u 
D:  OK . 
D:  This may be a very short meeting . 
D:  Uh . <breath> <breath> Um . 
D:  Anything from <breath> your side ? 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Dave ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Sure . 
D:  Wh - who 's they  they ? 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Um . 
D:  Let 's see . 
D:  Um . Why don't  why don't we uh  if there aren't any other major things , why don't we do the digits , and then  then uh turn the mikes off . 
D:  So I 'll start . 
D:  Uh . 
D:  OK .
