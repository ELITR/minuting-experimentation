C:  Maria Carmen ? 
C:  Alright . 
C:  It will be some sometime in summer . 
C:  July or August , or . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Oh yeah . 
C:  Well , the news <breath> <breath> more specifically t for Aurora 
C:  um 
C:  So I guess there was again a <breath> conference call but uh they are not decide on <breath> everything yet . 
C:  For the VAD they  probably they will do something like <clear throat> having some kind of idealized VAD that they could <breath> run on the channel zero <breath> of the SpeechDat - Car 
C:  and then take the same um end points and apply them on channel one 
C:  so it 's  
C:  Uh g 
C:  Yeah , to the clean and take the end points for the noisy . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  But I am not sure this is decided yet . 
C:  Um . 
C:  Well , probably uh s the same VAD <breath> for everybody . 
C:  Um . 
C:  Maybe . 
C:  But this is still  
C:  Yeah , they 're still <breath> not decided . 
C:  Um I don't know what  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Nothing much . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Probably the um  <breath> these weight things , they will <breath> apply the same kind of weighting scheme for <mouth> TI - digits than for the SpeechDat - Car . 
C:  So it would be weighting of 
C:  um  
C:  It would be an average of improvements rather than an average of <breath> word error rates which would make <breath> the more clean parts of TI - digits more important than they are right now . 
C:  This 
C:  They  they t I think they will tend to go this way , but hmm . 
C:  Uh . 
C:  Yeah , if we have the result for the tandem with um MSG also 
C:  So @ @ <breath> it was t 
C:  Yeah there is no surpri there is no surprise . 
C:  Well , so there is nor significant improvement . 
C:  Um . <breath> <mouth> <breath> <breath> Yeah , basically that 's all . 
C:  We 've started to work on some kind of report for the work <breath> so we 've not much more results . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  It 's next week , yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Um . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right now , Sunil seems i is in India actually . 
C:  Uh so <breath> there is no progress apparently from their side neither . 
C:  Um . And  
C:  I 'm sorry ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Sunil was <breath> working on this . 
C:  Um . <breath> He sent a bunch of  a bunch of results 
C:  uh 
C:  but I don't know what 's the status of this . 
C:  I guess it was just the result that he sent , 
C:  so . <breath> Um . 
C:  He just used the spectral subtraction and the LDA filters I guess <breath> <breath> Mmm . 
C:  And it was not better than what we had before . 
C:  Then he tried to put the on - line normalization and <clear throat> it did not improve further , 
C:  putting the on - line normalization , 
C:  so . 
C:  Um . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  No . 
C:  Well , I  I sent mails to start the  the process and I guess we should have to  
C:  Well , we know most what we have to  to put in  in this . 
C:  And . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  So , I guess . Yeah , we m 
C:  Um . 
C:  I don't know 
C:  but it 's the company who prepared the Italian database , 
C:  so it was  
C:  Is it Alcatel , 
C:  or  ? 
C:  I  
C:  I don't know . 
C:  Uh . 
C:  I think it 's  was playing with the number of states per word . 
C:  They had sixteen , seventeen , eighteen . 
C:  Yeah , because it was around  between sixteen and twenty 
C:  or  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  So , and  
C:  Yeah , apparently , um <mouth> they had better results when they increased the number of states . 
C:  From  from eighteen to twenty , or  
C:  D ' you put two ? 
C:  Oh , yeah . 
C:  Maria Carmen ?
