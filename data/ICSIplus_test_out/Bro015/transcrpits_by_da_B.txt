B:  Um but I don't know I th I get the impression that they tried to do some things with the phase and they weren't successful . 
B:  Well um . <breath> One thing in  in the paper Avendano and his collaborators wrote <breath> is that  is that um <breath> they tried doing channel normalization on the reverberant in speech by um <breath> subtracting the mean of the log spectral magnitude <breath> over a two second window . 
B:  But they didn't do anything with the phase , and they said perhaps that limited their approach that it did not try to normalize the phase in any way . 
B:  So I 'm  I 'm going to start thinking about <breath> um ways that the ph that the phase could be used . 
B:  Um . 
B:  Si - if  if the um channel <breath> and the reverberation is multiplicative in the frequency domain with the speech spectrum then the <breath> phases should be additive . 
B:  So um perhaps just subtracting the mean of the phase would  would help . 
B:  Um but I don't know I th I get the impression that they tried to do some things with the phase and they weren't successful .
