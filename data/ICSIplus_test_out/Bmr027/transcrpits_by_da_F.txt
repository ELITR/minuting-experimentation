F:  Thank you . 
F:  OK . 
F:  It 's the ear - plug mike . 
F:  No . 
F:  Huh ? What ? Huh ? 
F:  It  it 's a fairly good mike , actually . 
F:  Well , I shouldn't say it 's a good mike . 
F:  All I really know is that the signal level is OK . 
F:  I don't know if it 's a  
F:  the quality . 
F:  Ugh ! 
F:  So I didn't send out agenda items 
F:  because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item 
F:  and now we have two . 
F:  So . <inbreath> And , uh . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Well  We haven't really started , 
F:  but I thought we more  we more or less did Meeting Recorder stuff last week , 
F:  so I thought we could do , uh  
F:  But I figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each . 
F:  So . 
F:  I seem to be having difficulty getting this adjusted . 
F:  Here we go . 
F:  So , uh , as most of you should know , I did send out the consent form thingies 
F:  and , uh , 
F:  so far no one has made any  Ach !   any comments on them . 
F:  So , no on no one has bleeped out anything . 
F:  So . 
F:  I don't expect anyone to . 
F:  But . 
F:  No . 
F:  We had spoken w about this before 
F:  and we had decided that they have  they only needed to sign once . 
F:  And the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity . 
F:  So as long as we do that , we 're covered . 
F:  Uh , July fifteenth . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  Jane told me July fifteenth . 
F:  So , that 's what I set it . 
F:  Oh . I  I didn't understand that there was something specific . 
F:  You  y you had  
F:  I had heard July fifteenth , 
F:  so that 's what I put . 
F:  So . 
F:  Yeah . As I said , we  I just got one date 
F:  and that 's the one I used . 
F:  So . But I can send a follow - up . 
F:  I mean , it 's almost all us . 
F:  I mean the people who are in the meeti this meeting was , uh , these  the meetings that  in  are in set one . 
F:  Right . I mean , that 's fine . 
F:  I  we don't  My understanding of what we  had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that , uh , we don't actually need a reply . 
F:  We just need to tell them that they can do it if they want . 
F:  And so no reply is no changes . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Well  
F:  Yeah . The reason I did that it was just so that people would not censor  not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly , 
F:  as opposed to , uh  
F:  Right . 
F:  When they submit the form , it gets processed and emailed to me . 
F:  So . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Well , the only thing I said in the email is that  the data is going to be released on the fifteenth . 
F:  I didn't give any other deadline . 
F:  So my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says , " wow I suddenly found something " , we 'll delete it from our record . 
F:  We just won't delete it from whatever 's already been released . 
F:  What else can we do ? 
F:  If someone says " hey , look , I  found something in this meeting and  it 's libelous and I want it removed " . What can we do ? 
F:  We have to remove it . 
F:  Well , did you read the email and look at the pages I sent ? 
F:  No . OK , well why don't you do that 
F:  and then make comments on what you want me to change ? 
F:  I already did decide something , 
F:  and that 's what 's in the email . 
F:  And if you disagree with it , why don't you read it and give me comments on it ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  OK . 
F:  I don't know . 
F:  You should be . 
F:  You should be channel B . 
F:  Well , they 've already signed a form . 
F:  So . 
F:  And the s and the form was approved by Human Subjects , 
F:  so , eh , that 's gonna be a little hard to modify . 
F:  Here . 
F:  You can read what you already signed . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Oh , I just  I didn't wanna do that , 
F:  because I don't wanna have a discussion with every person  if I can avoid it . 
F:  So what I wanted to do was just send it out 
F:  and say " on the fifteenth , the data is released , 
F:  if you wanna do something about it , do something about it , 
F:  but that 's it " . 
F:  Well , OK . l Let me  Let me reverse this . 
F:  So let 's say someone  I send this out , 
F:  and someone doesn't respond . 
F:  Do we delete every meeting that they were in ? 
F:  I don't think so . 
F:  That will happen . 
F:  That will absolutely happen . 
F:  Because people don't read their email , 
F:  or they 'll read and say " I don't care about that , 
F:  I 'm not gonna delete anything " 
F:  and they don just won't reply to it . 
F:  No . 
F:  We have what they put on the speaker form , 
F:  which was just generic contact information . 
F:  Yeah . I mean I thought we had discussed this , like , a year ago . 
F:  And so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again . 
F:  So . 
F:  Well  
F:  OK . Well , why don't you talk  t 
F:  Morgan , can you talk to our lawyer about it , 
F:  and find out what the status is on this ? 
F:  Cuz I don't wanna do something that we don't need to . 
F:  Because 
F:  what  I 'm telling you , people won't respond to the email . 
F:  No matter what you do , you there 're gonna be people who  you 're gonna have to make a lot of effort to get in contact with . 
F:  And do we want to spend that effort ? 
F:  Well , we had talked about this before 
F:  and I thought that we had even gone by the lawyers asking about that 
F:  and they said you have to s they 've already signed away the f with that form  
F:  that they 've already signed once . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Well , it 's just , we 've gone from one extreme to the other , where at one point , a few months ago , Morgan was  you were saying let 's not do anything , 
F:  and now we 're  
F:  we 're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature ? 
F:  I mean , what are we gonna doing here ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Then I think we had better find out , 
F:  so that we can find a  
F:  Right . 
F:  For  for th 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Sending lots of spam . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  Well , so how far do we have to go ? 
F:  Do we need to get someone 's signature ? 
F:  Or , is email enough ? 
F:  Do we have to have it notarized ? 
F:  I mean  
F:  OK . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Uh . If they submit the form , I get it . 
F:  If they don't submit the form , it goes in the general web log . 
F:  But that 's not sufficient . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  Cuz if someone just visits the web site that doesn't  imply anything in particular . 
F:  Right . 
F:  I 'm already on it . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  W 
F:  For this set , I 'm not worried , 
F:  because  we basically know everyone on it . 
F:  You know , they 're all more or less here 
F:  or it 's  it 's Eric and Dan and so on . 
F:  But for some of the others , you 're talking about visitors who are  gone from ICSI , whose email addresses may or may not work , 
F:  and  
F:  So what are we gonna do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Other methods ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  Well , the qu the question is just whether  how active it has to be . 
F:  I mean , because they  they filled out a contact information 
F:  and that 's where I 'm sending the information . 
F:  And so far everyone has done email . 
F:  There isn't anyone who did , uh , any other contact method . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So my original impression was that that was sufficient , 
F:  that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate that  we fulfilled our burden . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Alright . 
F:  Yep . And we 'll see how many people respond to that email . 
F:  So far , two people have . 
F:  So . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Respond to the email .  Yep . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Well , and also if we want it ready by the fifteenth , that means we better give them deadline of the first , 
F:  if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Ugh ! 
F:  Disk space , 
F:  oh my god ! 
F:  I hadn't thought about that . 
F:  That for every meeting  
F:  any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of . 
F:  No , of course not . 
F:  You need all the channels . 
F:  Yes . Absolutely . There 's a lot of cross - talk . 
F:  Well , but you have to copy the whole file . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  Because we 're gonna be releasing the whole file . 
F:  Yeah . It 's just I hate deleting any data . 
F:  So I  I don't want  I really would rather make a copy of it , rather than bleep it out 
F:  and then  
F:  Overlapping . 
F:  So , it 's  it 's exactly a censor bleep . 
F:  So what I really think is " bleep " 
F:  and then I want to  
F:  I delete the old one , put the new one in . 
F:  There 's nothing left of the original signal . 
F:  Yeah . It would be qui quite easy to get it back again . 
F:  Say again ? 
F:  Yeah , that 's true . Yeah . Yep , that 's true . 
F:  Backwards . 
F:  But , 
F:  ha you 've seen the  this  the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments . 
F:  Did you read that paper ? 
F:  It wouldn't work . 
F:  The speech recognizer still works . 
F:  Forward but backward . That 's right . 
F:  Good point . 
F:  A point . 
F:  Well , I 'm sorry if I sound a little peeved about this whole thing . 
F:  It 's just we 've had meeting after meeting after meeting a on this 
F:  and it seems like we 've never gotten it resolved . 
F:  So . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Well , and that 's exactly why I did it the way I did it , 
F:  which is the default is if you do nothing we 're gonna release it . 
F:  Because , you know , I have my  stack of emails of to d to be done , 
F:  that , you know , fifty or sixty long , 
F:  and the ones at the top I 'm never gonna get to . 
F:  And , uh  So  so  
F:  Yeah , right . 
F:  So , i this is gonna mean  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . That 's actually definitely a good point . 
F:  The m email doesn't specify that you can just reply to the email , as op as opposed to going to the form 
F:  and  
F:  Yeah , release . 
F:  You  you can  
F:  A lot of mailers support return receipt . 
F:  But it doesn't confirm that they 've read it . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Oh , just a button . 
F:  Oh , yeah . 
F:  Yeah . Unfor - Yeah , we could do that . 
F:  But I hate that . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Well , I could put a URL in there without any difficulty 
F:  and  even pretty simple MIME readers can do that . 
F:  So . 
F:  Yeah . Reply . 
F:  Well , I  cuz I use a text mail reader . 
F:  You  you read email  in VI ? 
F:  You could put wed bugs in the email . 
F:  Well , what my s expectation is , is that we 'll send out one of these emails  every time a meeting has been checked and is ready . 
F:  So . Tha - that was my intention . 
F:  It 's just  
F:  yeah  
F:  that we just happened to have a bunch all at once . 
F:  I mean , maybe  
F:  Is that  the way it 's gonna be , you think , Jane ? 
F:  Yeah . Now we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting , to see whether the transcript is correct 
F:  and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff . 
F:  So at some point we need to do that . 
F:  I mean , the one thing I noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels . 
F:  There are a fair number of " yeahs " and " uh - huhs " that  it 's just  that aren't in there . 
F:  So . 
F:  Yes , absolutely . Yeah . 
F:  Yes , absolutely . Absolutely . 
F:  Yeah . They 're  they 're not in the segmented . 
F:  It 's not that the  IBM people didn't do it . 
F:  Just they didn't get marked . 
F:  There 's another meeting in here , what , at four ? 
F:  Right ? 
F:  Yeah , so we have to finish by three forty - five . 
F:  U uncertains . 
F:  Web master . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  Spit upon ? 
F:  No , these are  ours . 
F:  That 's cool . 
F:  Yeah , but I bet  I bet they 're acoustically challenging parts anyway , though . 
F:  Oh , really ? 
F:  Uh , it 's  
F:  Oh , so it 's just jargon . 
F:  It probably won't do any better . 
F:  Did I say that ? 
F:  Well , that 's exactly why I put the extra option in , 
F:  is that I was afraid people would say , " let 's censor that because it 's wrong " , 
F:  and I don't want them to do that . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Ugh ! 
F:  It 's probably impedance matching problems . 
F:  But  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  They 're just earphones . 
F:  They 're not headsets . 
F:  They 're not microphones . 
F:  But if you need it , just get it . 
F:  Come on . 
F:  W uh , could you email out the brand ? 
F:  Cuz I think  sounds like people are interested . 
F:  So . 
F:  Uh , the only one was Don wanted to , uh , talk about disk space yet again . 
F:  Oh , I thought you meant the disk space . 
F:  Yeah , we know disk space is short . 
F:  Yeah , it was really goo 
F:  Uh , well , we 'll give you one then . 
F:  Oh , no . 
F:  Soon ? 
F:  No . 
F:  Ne - new disks . 
F:  On  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Once they come in . Sure . 
F:  If you 're  if you 're desperate , I have some space on my drive . 
F:  But I  I vacillate between no space free and  a few gig free . 
F:  So . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  A hundred gig here , 
F:  a hundred gig there . 
F:  It 's eventually real disk space . 
F:  Oh , yeah . 
F:  Huh . 
F:  Or she 's getting a good early start . 
F:  When we remember to fill them out . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  And Don is  gonna be helping out with that . 
F:  So . 
F:  Did you wanna talk about that this afternoon ? 
F:  Not here , but later today ? 
F:  OK . OK . 
F:  Oh , OK . 
F:  So we were gonna do sort of status of speech transcription  
F:  automatic transcription , 
F:  but we 're kind of running late . 
F:  So . 
F:  Fifteen minutes . 
F:  So . 
F:  If you wanna do a quick 
F:  ten minute  
F:  Yeah . Well , we can skip the digits . 
F:  Whatever you want . 
F:  What do you have to say ? 
F:  I 'm interested , 
F:  so  
F:  Sorry . 
F:  No . We were just talking before about alternating the subject of the meeting . 
F:  And this week we were gonna try to do  t automatic transcription  status . 
F:  But we sort of failed . 
F:  No . 
F:  Did we ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . So now  now we have the schedule . 
F:  So next week we 'll do automatic transcription status , 
F:  plus anything that 's real timely . 
F:  Whew ! 
F:  Dodged that bullet . 
F:  Th 
F:  Excuse me ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh . Right , right . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  When 's it due ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I don't have a paper 
F:  but I 'd kinda like to go , 
F:  if I could . 
F:  Is that alright ? 
F:  OK . <laugh> I guess that 's " no " . 
F:  OK . Well , that th Hey , if that 's what it takes , that 's fine with me . 
F:  I 'll pick up your dry - cleaning , too . 
F:  Should we do digits ? 
F:  Uh . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  Go for it . 
F:  Hmm ! 
F:  Thanks . 
F:  Thank you .
