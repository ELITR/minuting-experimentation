E:  @ @ 
B:  We 're , 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  I mean 
C:  <cough> 
B:   we  
D:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
D:  <inbreath> <mouth> 
B:  We didn't have a house before . 
D:  We 're on again ? OK . <laugh> 
D:  <inbreath> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  That is really great . 
H:  Yeah , so if  uh  
D:  OK - 
D:  <outbreath> 
B:  Oh , yeah ! 
A:  That 's terrific . 
H:   So if anyone hasn't signed the consent form , 
H:  please do so . 
H:  The new consent form . 
H:  The new and improved consent form . 
A:  Now you won't be able to walk or ride your bike , huh ? 
H:  <inbreath>  
F:  Uh . 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
B:  Right . 
H:  And uh , shall I go ahead and do some digits ? <outbreath> 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Uh , we were gonna do that at the end , remember ? 
H:  OK , 
H:  whatever you want .  
D:  Yeah . 
D:   Just  just to be consistent , from here on in at least , that  
B:  The new consent form .  
D:   that we 'll do it at the end . 
H:  It 's uh   
H:  Yeah , it doesn't matter . 
H:  OK . 
D:  OK 
D:  <inbreath> 
F:  Testing , one , two , three .  
D:  Um 
D:  Well , it ju I mean it might be that someone here has to go , and  <outbreath> Right ? That was  that was sort of the point . 
D:  <inbreath> 


D:  So , uh 
D:   I had asked actually anybody who had any ideas for an agenda 
D:   to send it to me and no one did . So , 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  So we all forgot . 
D:  Uh , 
F:  From last time I wanted to  Uh  
F:   The  An iss uh  
F:  one topic from last time . 
D:  Right , s 
D:  OK , so one item for an agenda is uh  Jane has some uh 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  uh some research to talk about , 
D:  research issues . 
D:  Um 
D:   and 
H:  And I have some  short research issues . 
D:   Uh , Adam has some short research issues . 
D:   Um , I have a 
D:   list of things that I think were done over the last three months I was supposed to 
D:  <inbreath> <laugh> send off , uh 
D:   and , um  I  I sent a note about it to uh  to Adam and Jane but I think I 'll just run through it 
D:   also and see if someone thinks it 's inaccurate or 
D:   uh insufficient . 
A:  A list that you have to send off to who ? 
D:   Uh , to uh uh , IBM . 
A:  Oh . 
E:  @ @ 
D:  OK . They 're , you know  
D:  So . <inbreath> 
D:  Um , 
D:  So , uh  so , I 'll go through that . 
D:   Um , 
D:   And , 
D:  Anything else ? 
D:   anyone wants to talk about ? 
D:  No . OK . 
A:  What about the , um  your trip , yesterday ? 
D:  Um . 
D:   Sort of off - topic I guess . Cuz that 's  Cuz that was all  all about the , uh  
A:  Oh , OK . 
D:  I  I  I can chat with you about that  off - line . That 's another thing . <inbreath> 
D:  Um , 
D:  And , 
D:  Anything else ?  Nothing else ? 
D:  Uh , there 's a  I mean , there is a   a , um 
D:   uh 
D:   telephone call tomorrow , 
D:   which will be a conference call  that some of us are involved in 
D:   for uh a possible proposal . 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  Um , we 'll talk  we 'll talk about it next week if  if something  
H:  Do you want me to  be there for that ? 
H:  I noticed you C C ' ed me , but I wasn't actually a recipient .  
E:  <sniff> 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
H:  I didn't quite know what to make of that . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
H:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  Uh Well , we 'll talk  talk about that after our meeting . 
H:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Uh , OK . So it sounds like the  the three main things that we have to talk about are , uh this list , uh Jane and  Jane and Adam have some research items , and , other than that , anything , 
D:   as usual , 
D:   anything goes beyond that . 
E:  <sniff> 
D:  <inbreath> 




D:  OK , uh , Jane , since  since you were sort of cut off last time why don't we start with yours , make sure we get to it . 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  OK , it 's  it 's very  
F:  eh  it 's  very brief , I mean  just let me  just hand these out . Oops .  <inbreath> 
H:  Is this the same as the email or different ? 
F:  It 's slightly different . I  
C:  Thanks . 
H:  OK . 
F:   basically the same . 
A:  Same idea ? 
F:  But , same idea . So , if you 've looked at this you 've seen it before , so  Basically , <inbreath> um 
F:   as you know , uh 
F:   part of the encoding 
F:   includes a mark that indicates  an overlap . 
F:  It 's not indicated  
F:  with , um  uh , tight precision , it 's just indicated that  
F:  OK , so , 
F:  It 's indicated to  to  so the people know 
F:   what parts of sp 
F:  which  which stretches of speech were in the clear , 
F:  versus being overlapped by others . So , I 
F:   used this mark and , um 
F:   and , uh  uh , 
F:   divided the  
F:   I wrote a script 
F:   which divides things into individual minutes , 
F:   of which we ended up with forty  five , and a little bit . 
F:   And , uh 
F:   you know , minute zero , of course , is the first minute up to 
F:   sixty seconds . 
C:  OK .  
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And , um  
F:  What you can see is the number of overlaps 
F:   and then 
F:   to the right , 
F:   whether they involve two speakers , three speakers , or more than three speakers . 
F:  <inbreath> And , 
F:   um  and , 
F:  what I was looking for sp sp specifically was the question of 
F:   whether they 're distributed evenly throughout or whether they 're 
A:  <sniff> 
F:   bursts of them . 
F:  <inbreath> Um . 
F:  And  it looked to me as though  
F:   <inbreath> 
F:   uh , you know  y this is just  
F:   eh  eh , this would  this is not statistically 
F:   verified , 
F:   but it 
F:   did look to me as though there are bursts throughout , rather than being 
F:   localized to a particular region . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  The part down there , where there 's the maximum number of  
F:   of , um  overlaps is an area where we were discussing 
F:   <inbreath> whether or not it would be useful to indi to s to 
F:   code 
F:   stress , 
F:   uh , sentence stress 
F:   as possible indication of , uh  information retrieval . 
F:   So it 's like , 
F:   you know , rather , 
F:   lively discussion there . 
D:  What was  what 's the  the parenthesized stuff  that says , like  
F:  <inbreath> Oh , th <outbreath> 
D:  e the first one that says six overlaps and then two point eight ? 
F:   That 's the per cent . 
D:  Mmm .  
F:   So , six is , uh  two point eight percent  of the total number of overlaps in the  session . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Ah . 
F:  <inbreath> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  At the very end , 
F:  this is when people were , 
F:   you know , packing up to go basically , there 's 
F:   this final stuff , I think we  
A:  <sniff> 
F:   I don't remember where the digits  fell . I 'd have to look at that . But 
F:   the final three there are no overlaps at all . 
F:   And  couple times there  are not . So , i it seems like it goes through bursts 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:   but , um  that 's kind of it . Now , 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:   Another question is 
F:   is there  are there 
F:   individual differences in whether you 're likely to be overlapped with or to overlap with others . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And , again  I want to emphasize this is just one  particular 
F:   um  
F:   one particular meeting , and also there 's been no statistical testing of it all , but 
F:   I , um 
F:   I took the coding of 
F:   the  I , you know , my  I had this script 
F:   figure out , um 
F:   who 
F:   was the first speaker , who was the second speaker involved in a two - person overlap , I didn't look at the ones involving three or more . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And , um  
F:   this is how it breaks down in the individual cells of 
F:   who tended to be overlapping most often with who  
F:  who else , and 
F:   if you look at the marginal totals , which is the ones on the right side and across the bottom , you get 
F:   the totals for an individual . So , 
F:  <inbreath> um  If you 
F:   look at the bottom , those are the , um 
F:   numbers of overlaps in which 
F:   um  Adam was involved as the person doing the overlapping and if you look  
F:  I 'm sorry , but you 're o alphabetical , that 's why I 'm choosing you <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  And then if you look across the right , 
F:   then  that 's where he was the 
F:   person who was the sp first speaker in the pair 
F:   and got overlap 
A:  Hmm ! 
F:  overlapped with by somebody . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And ,  then if you look down in the summary table , 
F:   then you see that , um 
F:   th they 're differences in 
F:   whether a person got overlapped with or 
F:   overlapped 
H:  Is this uh  just raw counts or is it  
F:  by .  
F:  Raw counts . 
H:  So it would be interesting to see 
H:  how much each person spoke . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yes , 
E:  Yeah 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  very true  very true  it would be good to normalize with respect to that . Now on the table I did 
H:  Normalized to how much  
E:  <laugh> Yeah  
F:   take one step toward , uh  away from the raw frequencies by putting , 
F:   uh  percentages . So that the percentage of time 
F:   of the  of the times that a person spoke , 
F:   what percentage 
F:   eh , w so . 
F:  Of the times a person spoke and furthermore was involved in a two two - person overlap , 
F:  <laugh> <inbreath> what percentage of the time were they the overlapper and what percent of the time were they th the overlappee ? 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And there , it looks like you see some differences , 
F:   um , 
F:   that some people tend to be overlapped 
F:   with more often than they 're overlapped , but , of course , 
F:  uh i e <laugh> this is just one meeting , 
F:   uh  there 's no statistical testing involved , and that would be 
F:   required for a  for a finding  of  any  kind of 
D:  S so , i it would be statistically incorrect to conclude from this that Adam talked too much or something . 
F:   scientific  reliability . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  No  no actually , that would be actually statistically correct , but <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  No , no , no . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah , yeah .  
E:  Yeah , yeah . 
F:  Yeah , that 's right . 
F:   That 's right . And I 'm  you know , I 'm  I don't see a point of singling people out , 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Excuse me . 
F:  now , this is a case where obviously  
D:  B I  I  I rather enjoyed it , but  but this 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  But the numbers speak for themselves . 
E:  He 's  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
F:   Well , <laugh> you know , it 's like  I 'm not  I 'm not 
H:  Yes , that 's right , so you don't nee OK . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  saying on the tape who did 
F:   better or worse because  I don't think that it 's  I 
D:  Sure . 
F:   you know , and  and th here 's a case where of course , human subjects people would say be sure that you anonymize the results ,  and  and , so , might as well do this . 
H:  Yeah , when  this is what  
D:  Yeah . 
H:  This is actually  when Jane sent this email first , is what caused me to start thinking about 
H:  anonymizing the data .  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  Well , fair enough .  Fair enough . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:   And actually ,  you know , the point is not about an individual , it 's the point about  tendencies toward 
D:  Yeah . 
F:   you know , different styles , different speaker styles . 
D:  Oh sure . 
F:   <inbreath> 


F:  And  it would be , you know  of course ,  
F:  there 's also the question of what type of overlap 
F:  was this , and w what were they , and 
F:  i and I  and I know that I can distinguish at least three types and , probably more , I mean , the 
F:  <inbreath> general 
F:   <laugh> cultural idea which w uh , the conversation analysts originally started with in the seventies was that we have this <inbreath> strict model where politeness involves that you let the person finish th before you start talking , and 
F:   and you know , I mean , 
F:   w we know that  
F:   an and they 've loosened up on that too s in the intervening time , that 
F:   that that 's  that 's 
F:  viewed as being 
F:   a culturally - relative thing , I mean ,  that you have the high - involvement style from the East Coast where people 
F:  <inbreath> will overlap often as an indication of interest in what the other person is saying . 
F:   And 
H:  Uh - huh .  
F:   <laugh> Yeah , exactly ! Well , there you go . Fine , that 's alright , that 's OK . 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Exactly !  
E:  Yeah  
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And  and , 
F:   you know , in contrast , so Deborah  d and also Deborah Tannen 's  thesis she talked about differences of these types ,  that they 're just different styles , and it 's um 
H:  <clears throat> 
F:   you  you can't impose a model of  
F:   there  of the ideal being no overlaps , and 
F:   you know , conversational analysts also agree with that , so it 's 
F:   now , universally 
F:   a ag agreed with . 
F:  And  and , als I mean , 
F:  I can't say universally , 
F:  but anyway , the people who used to say it was strict , 
F:   um  now , uh 
F:   don't . I mean they  they  also 
F:   <inbreath> you know , uh  uh , 
F:  ack acknowledge the influence of 
F:   sub of subcultural norms and 
F:   cross - cultural norms and things . 
F:  <inbreath> So , um 
D:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
F:  Then it beco 
F:   though  so  just  just superficially to give  
F:  um  a couple ideas of the types of overlaps involved , I have at the bottom several that I noticed . So , 
F:   <inbreath> 
F:  uh , there are backchannels , like what Adam just did now and , um 
A:  <clears throat> 
F:   <inbreath> 
F:  um , anticipating the end of a question 
F:  and  simply answering it earlier , and there are several of those in this  in these data where  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:   because we 're 
F:   people who 've talked to each other , 
F:   um  we know 
F:   basically what the topic is , what the possibilities are and w and we 've spoken with each other so we know basically what the other person 's style is likely to be and so 
F:  <inbreath> and t there are a number of places where someone just answered early . 
F:  No problem . <inbreath> 
F:  And places  also 
F:  which I thought were interesting , where two or more people gave exactly th the same answer in unison  different words of course but you know , the  basically , 
F:   you know 
F:  everyone 's saying " yes " or  you know , or 
F:  ev even more sp specific than that . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  So , uh , the point is that , um 
F:   <inbreath> overlap 's not necessarily a bad thing and that it would be im 
F:   i useful to subdivide these further and see if there are individual differences in styles with respect to the types involved . 
F:   And that 's all I wanted to say on that , 
F:   unless people have questions . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Well , of course th the biggest ,  um 
D:   result here , which is one we 've  
D:   we 've talked about many times and isn't new to us , but which I think would be interesting to show someone who isn't familiar with this 
D:  <inbreath>  is just the sheer number of overlaps . 
H:  Yep . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Yes , yes ! <laugh> 
F:  Oh , OK  interesting . 
D:  That  that  
E:  Yeah . 
D:  Right ? 
D:   that  that , um 
D:   here 's a relatively short meeting , it 's a forty  
D:   forty plus minute 
D:   <inbreath> meeting , and not only were there two hundred and fifteen overlaps <laugh> 
H:  Hundred ninety - seven . 
D:   but , 
C:  <laugh> 
D:   uh 
D:  I think there 's one   
D:  one minute there where there  where  where there wasn't any overlap ? I mean , it 's  
H:  S n are  
D:   <inbreath> uh throughout this thing ? 
D:  It 's  
F:  Well , at the bottom , you have the bottom three . 
A:  It 'd be interesting  
E:  Yeah . 
F:   So four  four minutes all together with none  none . 
D:  You have  
D:  @ @ 
D:  Oh , so the bottom three did have s stuff going on ? 
A:  But it w 
F:  Yes , uh - huh . Yeah . But just no overlaps . 
D:  There was speech ? 
D:  OK , so if  the  this  


A:  It 'd be interesting to see what the total amount of time is in the overlaps , 
A:  versus  
F:  Yes , exactly and that 's  that 's where Jose 's pro project comes in . 
G:  I was about to ask  
E:  Yeah , yeah , 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  I h I have this that infor I have th that information 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  now . 
D:  Oh , about how much is it ? 
E:  The  the duration of eh  of each of the overlaps . 
D:  O oh , what 's  what 's the  what 's the average 
D:   length ? 
E:  M I  I haven't averaged it now but , uh  I  I will , uh 
E:  I will do the  the study of the   with the  with the program with the  uh , the different , uh  the , nnn ,  distribution of the duration of the overlaps . 
D:  You don't know ? 
E:  <inbreath> 
D:  OK , you  you don you don't have a feeling for roughly how  much it is ? Yeah . 
E:  mmm ,  Because the  the uh , @ @ is @ @ . 
E:  The duration is , uh  the variation  the variation of the duration is uh , very big 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I suspect that it will also differ , 
E:  on the dat 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  but eh  
F:   depending on the type of overlap  involved .  So backchannels will be very brief and  
E:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh , I 'm sure . 
E:  Because , on your surface eh  a bit of zone of overlapping with the duration 
E:  eh , overlapped and another very very short . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Uh , i probably it 's very difficult to  to  because the  the overlap is , uh on is only the  in the final " S " 
E:  of the  of the  the fin the  the end  the end word of the , um  previous speaker <inbreath> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  with the  the next word of the  the new speaker . <inbreath> 
E:  Um , I considered  that 's an overlap but it 's very short , it 's an " X " with a  
E:  and  the idea is probably , eh  when eh  when eh , we studied th th that zone , eh  
E:   eh , we h we have eh eh  confusion with eh eh noise . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  With eh  that fricative sounds , but uh  I have new information but I have to  to study . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Yeah , but I  I 'd  
G:  Can I  
D:  <inbreath> u  go ahead . 
F:  Yeah . 
G:  You split this by minute , um  so if an overlap 
F:  Yes . 
G:  straddles  the boundary between two minutes , that counts towards both of those minutes . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <inbreath> Actually , um 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  um  actually not . 
F:  Uh , so  le let 's think about the case where 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  A starts speaking 
F:   <inbreath> 
F:  and then B overlaps with A , 
F:   and then the minute boundary happens . 
F:   And let 's say that 
F:  <inbreath> after that minute boundary , 
F:  <inbreath> um  B is still speaking , 
F:   and A overlaps 
F:   with B , 
F:  <inbreath> that would be a new overlap . 
F:   But otherwise 
F:   um , let 's say B 
F:   comes to the conclusion of  of that turn without 
F:   anyone overlapping with him or her , 
F:  <inbreath> in which case there would be no overlap counted in that second minute . 
G:  No , but suppose they both 
G:  talk simultaneously 
G:  <inbreath>  
G:  both a  a portion of it is in minute one and another portion of minute two . 
F:  OK . In that case , um 
F:   my c 
F:   the coding that I was using  
F:  <inbreath> since we haven't ,  uh  incorporated Adam 's , uh  coding of overlap yets , the coding of 
F:  Yeah , " yets " is not a word . 
F:  <inbreath> Uh <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  since we haven't incorporated Adam 's method of handling overl overlaps yet 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  um  then  that would have fallen through the cra cracks . It would be an underestimate of the number of overlaps because , um  I wou I wouldn't be able to pick it up from the way it was 
F:   encoded so far . 
F:  We just haven't done th the precise second to sec you know , 
D:  I I 
F:   second to second coding of when they occur . 
D:  I I 
D:  I 'm  I 'm  I 'm confused now . So l l let me restate what I thought Andreas was saying and  and see . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Let 's say that in  in second fifty - seven 
D:   <inbreath> 
F:  Yep . 
D:  of one minute , 
D:   you start talking and I start talking 
F:  OK . 
D:  and  we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds . 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  So we go over  So we were  we were talking over one another , 
D:   and it 's just  
D:  in each case , it 's just sort of one  interval . 
F:  Mm - hmm ? 
D:  Right ? 
D:  So , um  we talked over the minute boundary . 
D:  Is this  considered as one overlap in each of the minutes , the way you have done this . 
F:  No , it wouldn't . 
F:  It would be considered as an overlap in the first one . 
D:  OK , so that 's 
D:   good , i I think , in the sense that I think Andreas meant the question , right ? 
B:  That 's   that 's good , yeah , cuz the overall rate is  
G:  Yeah . 
C:  @ @ 
H:  Statistical . 
B:  Yeah . 
H:  Yep . 
F:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . They 're not double counted . 
G:  Other - otherwise you 'd get double counts , here and there . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  Ah but , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  @ @ 
G:   And then it would be harder  <inbreath> 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  <inbreath>  I should also say I did a simplifying , uh  count in that 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  <inbreath> if A was speaking 
F:   B overlapped with A and then A came back again and overlapped with B again , 
F:  I  I didn't count that as a three - person overlap , I counted that as a two - person overlap , 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
F:   and it was A being overlapped with by D . 
F:  Because the idea was the first speaker 
F:   had the floor 
F:   and the second person 
F:   started speaking and then the f the first person reasserted the floor  kind of thing . <inbreath> 
F:  These are simplifying assumptions , didn't happen very often , there may be like three overlaps affected that way in the whole thing . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  <yawn> 


H:  I want to go back and listen to minute forty - one . 
F:  Yeah , yeah . 
H:  Cuz i i I find it interesting that there were a large number of overlaps and they were all two - speaker . 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  I mean what I thought  what I 
H:  would have thought in 
F:  That 's interesting . 
H:   is that when there were a large number of overlaps , it was because everyone was talking at once , 
F:  That 's interesting . 
E:  Yeah . 
H:  <inbreath> 
E:  Yeah . 
H:  but uh 
H:  apparently not . That 's really neat . 
E:  Mmm . 
F:  Yeah , there 's a lot of backchannel , a lot o a lot of  
D:  Yeah .  
H:  This is  really interesting data . <laugh> 
F:   Yeah , it is . I think so too , I think  
B:  I think what 's really interesting though , it is 
B:   before d 
B:   saying " yes , meetings have a lot of overlaps " is to actually 
B:  find out how many more 
B:   we have than two - party . 
B:  Cuz in two - party conversations , like Switchboard , there 's an awful lot too if you just look at 
B:  backchannels , if you consider those overlaps ? 
B:   it 's also ver it 's huge . 
B:  It 's just that people haven't been 
B:   looking at that because they 've been doing single - channel processing for 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
B:   speech recognition . 
D:  Mm - hmm ? 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  So , the question is , you know , how many more overlaps 
B:   <inbreath> do you have 
C:  <cough twice> 
B:   of , say the two - person type , by adding more people . 
B:  to a meeting , 
B:   and it may be a lot more but i it may  
B:   it may not be . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Well , but see , I find it interesting even if it wasn't any more , 
B:  So . 
D:  because 
D:   since we were dealing with this full duplex sort of thing in Switchboard where it was just all separated out 
D:  <inbreath> we just  everything was just nice , so that  so the issue is in  in a situation 
B:  Mm - hmm ? 
B:   Well , it 's not really  " nice " . 
D:   where th that 's  
B:  It depends what you 're doing . 
B:  So if you were actually 
B:   <inbreath> having , uh  
B:   depends what you 're doing , 
B:  if  
B:  Right now we 're do we have individual mikes on the people in this meeting . 
D:  Mm - hmm ? 
B:  So the question is , you know  
B:  " are there really more overlaps happening 
B:  than there would be in a two - person  party " . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Let  
B:  And  and there well may be , but  
D:  let m 
D:  let me rephrase what I 'm saying 
D:  cuz I don't think I 'm getting it across . 
D:  What  
D:  what I  what  
D:  I shouldn't use words like " nice " because maybe that 's too  i too imprecise . 
D:  But what I mean is 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  that , um in Switchboard , 
D:   despite the many  many other problems that we have , one problem that we 're not considering is overlap . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  And what we 're doing now is , 
D:   aside from the many other differences in the task , we are considering overlap 
D:  <inbreath> and one of the reasons that we 're considering it , 
D:   you know , one of them 
D:  not all of them , one of them is 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  that w uh at least , 
D:   you know I 'm very interested in 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  the scenario in which , uh 
D:   both people talking are pretty much equally  audible , 
D:  <inbreath> and from a single microphone . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  And so , 
D:   in that case , it does get mixed in , 
D:  <inbreath> and it 's pretty hard to jus 
D:   to just ignore it , to just do processing on one and not on the other . 
B:  I  I agree that it 's an issue here 
B:   but it 's also an issue for Switchboard and if you 
B:   think of meetings 
B:   being recorded over the telephone , which I think , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  you know , this whole point of studying meetings isn't just to have people in a room but to also have 
B:   meetings over different phone lines . 
B:  Maybe far field mike people wouldn't be interested in that but all the dialogue issues still apply , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  so if each of us was calling and having 
B:   <inbreath> a meeting that way 
B:   you kn you know like a conference call . 
B:   <inbreath> 
B:  And , just the question is , 
B:   y you know , in Switchboard 
B:   you would think that 's the simplest case of a meeting 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  of more than one person , and 
B:   <inbreath> I 'm wondering how much more  overlap 
B:   of 
B:   the types that  that Jane described happen with more people present . 
B:  So it may be that having three people 
D:  <inbreath> 
B:   <inbreath> is very different from having two people or it may not be . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  That 's an important question to ask . I think what I 'm  
B:  So . 
D:   All I 'm s really saying is that I don't think we were considering that in Switchboard . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Not you , me . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  But uh  
D:  Were you ? 
H:  Though it wasn't  in the design . 
B:  but  
B:  but 
D:  Were you  were you  were you  were you measuring it ? 
D:   I mean , w w were  
B:  <inbreath> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  There  there 's 
B:  actually 
B:  to tell you the truth , the reason why it 's hard to measure is because 
B:  of 
B:  so , from the point of view of studying dialogue , I mean , which  Dan Jurafsky and Andreas and I had some projects on , 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  you want to know the sequence of turns . 
B:  So what happens is if you 're talking and I have a backchannel in the middle of your turn , 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  and then you keep going 
B:  what it looks like in a dialogue model is your turn and then my backchannel , 
B:  even though my backchannel occurred completely inside your turn . 
B:   <inbreath> 
D:  Yeah ? 
B:  So , for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling 
B:   <inbreath> 
B:  it 's  
B:  We know that that 's wrong 
D:  Yeah ? 
B:  in real time . 
B:  But , because 
B:  of 
B:  the acoustic segmentations that were done and the fact that some of the acoustic data in Switchboard were missing , 
B:  people couldn't study it , 
B:   but that doesn't mean in the real world that people don't talk that way . 
D:  Yeah , I wasn't saying that . 
B:  So , 
B:  it 's  
D:  Right ? I was just saying that w now we 're looking at it . 
B:  um 
B:  Well , we 've als 
D:  And  and  and , you  you maybe wanted to look at it before but , for these various technical reasons in terms of how the data was you weren't . 
B:  Right . We 're looking at it here . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  So that 's why it 's coming to us as new 
D:  <inbreath> even though it may well be 
D:   you know , if your  if your hypothes The hypothesis you were offering 
D:  <inbreath> eh  Right ?  
B:  Um . 
D:  if it 's the null poth  hypothesis , 
D:  and if actually you have as much overlap in a two - person , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  we don't know the answer to that . 
D:  The reason we don't know the answer to is cuz it wasn't studied 
D:  and it wasn't studied because it wasn't set up . Right ? 
B:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah , all I meant is 
B:  that 
B:  if you 're asking the question from the point of view of 
B:   what 's different about a meeting , 
D:  Mm - hmm ? 
B:  studying meetings of , say , more than two people versus 
B:   what 
B:  kinds of questions you could ask with a two - person  meeting . 
B:  It 's important to distinguish 
B:   that , you know , this project 
B:   is getting a lot of overlap 
B:   but other projects were too , 
B:  but we just couldn't study them . 
D:  May have been .   
B:  And and so uh 
D:  May have been . Right ? 
D:  We do kn we don't know the numbers . 
B:  Well , 
B:  there is a high rate , 
B:  So .  
B:  It 's  but I don't know how high , 
B:  in fact 
A:  Well , here 
A:  I have a question . 
B:  that would be 
D:  <mouth> 
D:  See , I mean , i i le let me t 
B:  interesting to know . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  I mean , my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody , " what have we learned about overlaps here ? " 
D:  just never mind comparison with something else , 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <inbreath> 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  what we 've learned about is overlaps in this situation , is that  the first  
D:   the first - order thing I would say is that there 's a lot of them . 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  In  in the sense that i if you said 
B:  Yeah , 
D:  if  i i i 
B:  I  I don't di 
D:  In a way , I guess what I 'm comparing to is more the 
B:  I 
B:  agree with 
B:  that . 
D:  common sense notion of 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  how  how much people overlap . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Uh  you know the fact that when  when  when , uh , Adam was looking for a stretch of  of speech before , that didn't have any overlaps , and he w he was having such a hard time 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  and now I look at this and I go , " well , I can see why he was having such a hard time " . It 's happening a lot . 
B:  Right . 
B:  That 's also true of Switchboard . 
D:  <inbreath> 
B:  It may not be  
D:  I wasn't saying it wasn't . 
D:  <outbreath> 
B:  Right . So it 's just , 
D:  Right ? 
D:  I was commenting about this .  
B:  um 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  OK . 
D:  I 'm saying if I  
B:  All I 'm saying is that from the 
D:   I 'm saying if I have this complicated thing in front of me , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  and we sh which ,  you know we 're gonna get 
D:  much more sophisticated about when we get lots more data , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  But  Then , if I was gonna describe to somebody what did you learn 
D:   right here , about , you know , the  the modest amount of data that was analyzed I 'd say , " Well , the first - order thing was there was a lot of overlaps " . 
D:  In fact  
D:  <inbreath> and it 's not just an overlap  
D:  bunch of overlaps  second - order thing is 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  it 's not just a bunch of overlaps in one particular point , 
D:  <inbreath> 
H:  Right . 
D:  but that there 's overlaps , uh throughout the thing . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  And that 's interesting .  That 's all . 
B:  Right . 
B:  No , I  I agree with that . 
B:  I 'm just 
B:   <inbreath> 
B:  saying that it may  
B:   the reason you get overlaps may or may not be due to sort of the number of people in the meeting . 
D:  Oh yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  And 
D:  Yeah , I wasn't making any statement about that . 
H:  <mouth> 
B:  that 's all . 
B:  And  and it would actually be interesting to find out because 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  some of the 
B:  data say Switchboard , which isn't exactly the same kind of context , I mean these are two people who don't know each other and so forth , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  But we should still be able to 
B:  somehow 
B:  say what  what is the added contra contribution to sort of overlap 
B:  time 
B:  of each additional person , or something like that . 
H:  Yep . I could certainly see it going either way . 
F:  <inbreath> OK , now . 
D:  Yeah , that would be good to know , but w we  
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  What  
F:   Wh - yeah , I  I agree  I agree with Adam . And the reason is because I think there 's a limit  
B:  But yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:   there 's an upper bound 
F:   on how many you can have , simply 
F:   from the standpoint of audibility . When we speak we  we do make a judgment of 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
F:   " can  " 
F:  you know , as adults .  I mean , children don't adjust so well , 
H:  <laugh> 
F:   I mean , if a truck 
F:  goes rolling past , 
F:  <inbreath> adults will 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  well , depending , but mostly , adults will  will  
F:   will hold off to what  
F:   to finish the end of the sentence till the  till the noise is past . And I think we generally do 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  monitor things like that , 
F:   about  whether we  whether our utterance will be in the clear or not . 
B:  Right . 
F:  <inbreath> And partly it 's related to rhythmic structure in conversation , so , 
F:  <inbreath> you know , you  you t 
F:  Yeah , this is d also um , 
A:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
D:  <inbreath> 
F:  people tend to time their  their  
A:  Well  
F:  <inbreath> their , um 
F:   when they  come into the conversation based on the overall rhythmic ,  uh 
F:  uh , ambient thing . 
B:  Right . 
F:  <inbreath> So you don't want to be c cross - cutting . 
F:  <inbreath> And  
F:  and , just to finish this , 
F:  that um 
F:  That I think that 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  there may be an upper bound on how many overlaps you can have , simply from the standpoint of audibility and how loud the other people are who are already 
F:   in the 
F:  fray . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  But I  you know , 
F:  of certain types . 
F:   Now if it 's just backchannels , <inbreath> 
F:  people 
F:   may be doing that 
F:   with less  intention of being heard , 
F:   just sort of spontaneously doing backchannels , 
F:  <inbreath> in which case 
F:   that  those might  
F:  there may be no upper bound on those . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  I  I have a feeling that backchannels , which are 
G:  the vast majority of overlaps in Switchboard , 
G:   uh , don't play as big a role here , because it 's very unnatural 
G:  I think , to backchannel if  in a multi - audience  
G:  you know , in a multi - person 
G:  <inbreath>  
B:  If you can see them , actually . 
G:  audience . 
B:   It 's interesting , so if you watch people are going like    
G:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  Right  right , like this here , but 
D:  u 
B:  That may not be the case if you couldn't see them . 
G:  But  
G:   but , it 's sort of odd if one person 's speaking and everybody 's listening , and 
G:  it 's unusual to have everybody going " uh - huh , uh - huh " 
D:  Actually , I think I 've done it 
D:   a fair number of times today . @ @ But . 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  There 's a lot of head - nodding , 
H:  Um . 
B:  in this 
G:  Yeah . 
B:  @ @ 
H:  Yep , we need to put trackers on it . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  In  in the two - person  
E:  Yeah , yeah , yeah .  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  Plus  plus  plus the  
F:  He could , he could . 
G:   Yeah . So  so actually , um 
G:  That 's in part because the nodding , if you have visual contact , 
G:   the nodding has the same function , but on the phone , in Switchboard 
G:  <inbreath> you  you  that wouldn't work . So 
H:  Yeah , you don't have it . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  so you need to use the backchannel . 
H:  Your mike is   
G:  <mike noise> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  So , in the two - person conversations , 
A:   when there 's backchannel , 
A:  is there a great deal of 
H:  That is an earphone , so if you just put it  so it 's on your ear . 
A:   overlap 
A:   in the speech ? or  
A:   Cuz my impression is sometimes 
B:  Yes . 
H:  There you go . 
B:  Yeah . 
H:  Thank you . 
F:  E for example . 
A:  it happens when there 's a pause , 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  you know , like you  you 
B:  Yes . 
A:  get a lot of backchannel , when somebody 's pausing 
B:  Right . 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  She 's doing that . 
F:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  Sorry , what were you saying ?  
C:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  It 's hard to do both , huh ? 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  Um  
A:  no , when  when  when there 's backchannel , I mean , just  
B:  Oh . 
A:  I was just listening , and  
A:  and when there 's two people talking and there 's backchannel it seems like , 
A:   um the backchannel happens when , you know , the pitch drops and the first person  
A:  and a lot of times , the first person actually stops talking and then there 's a backchannel  
A:  and then they start up again , and so I 'm wondering about  
A:  h 
A:  I just wonder how much overlap there is . 
A:  Is there a lot ? 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  I think there 's a lot of the kind that Jose was talking about , where   
B:  I mean , this is called " precision timing " in  conversation analysis , 
B:  where 
B:   <inbreath> they come in 
B:  overlapping , 
B:   but at a point where 
B:  the  
B:  information is mostly 
B:   complete . 
B:  So all you 're missing is some last syllables or something or the last word or some highly predictable words . 
A:  Mmm . 
B:   So technically , it 's an overlap . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  But 
A:  But maybe a  just a small overlap ? 
B:   you know , from information flow point of view it 's not an overlap in  the predictable information . 
E:  More , yeah . 
H:  It 'd be interesting if we could do prediction . 
A:  I was just thinking more in terms of alignment , 
A:  alignment overlap . 
B:  Yeah . 
H:  Language model prediction of overlap , that would be really interesting . 
G:  So   so  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Well , that 's exactly , exactly why we wanted to study the precise timing of overlaps ins in 
G:  Right . 
H:  Right . 
B:  uh Switchboard , say , because there 's a lot of that . 
G:  So  so here 's a  here 's a first interesting  labeling task . <laugh> 
G:  Uh , to distinguish between , say , backchannels 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <inbreath>  
G:  precision timing  Sort of 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  you know , benevolent overlaps , 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  and  and  
G:  <inbreath>  and w and  
H:  Let 's pick a different word . 
G:  and sort of , um  I don't know , hostile overlaps , where 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  someone is trying to grab the floor from someone else . 
E:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  Uh , that  that might be an interesting , um  problem to look at . 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  Hostile takeovers . 
F:  <inbreath> 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  <inbreath> 
F:  Well , I mean you could do that . I ju I  I think that 
E:  Yeah . 
F:   in this meeting I really had the feeling that wasn't happening , that 
F:   the hostile  hostile type . 
F:   These were  these were 
G:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:   benevolent types , as people 
F:   finishing each other 's sentences , and 
G:  Um , I could imagine that as  there 's a fair number of 
F:   stuff . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  um 
G:  cases where , 
G:  and this is sort of , not  really hostile , but sort of competitive , where <inbreath> 
G:  one person is finishing something and 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  you have , like , two or three people jumping  trying to  
H:  Trying to get the floor .  
G:   trying to  
G:   trying to , uh grab the next turn . 
G:  <inbreath> 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  And so it 's not against the person who talks first 
G:   because actually we 're all waiting for that person to finish . 
D:  <inbreath> 
H:  <laugh> 
G:   But they all want to  be next . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <inbreath> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  I have a feeling most of these things are  that  
D:   that are not 
D:   a benevolent kind are  are 
D:  <laugh> 
D:   are , uh  
E:  <laugh> 
D:  um  
D:  <mouth> 
D:  are  are competitive as opposed to real really  really hostile . But . 
G:  Right . 
F:  Yeah , I agree . I agree . 
A:  I wonder what determines who gets the floor ? 
F:  Well , there are various things , you  you have the  
A:  I mean  
D:  Uh a vote  vote in Florida .  Yeah . 
H:  It 's been studied a lot . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Voting for   
G:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Um , o one thing  I  I wanted to  
D:  or you can tell a good joke and then everybody 's laughing and you get a chance to g break in . But . But . 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  Seniority . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  <inbreath> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Um . 
D:  You know , the other thing I was thinking was that ,  um  these  
D:  all these interesting questions are , of course , pretty hard to answer with , uh u 
D:   you know , a small amount of data . 
D:  @ @ 
H:  Ach .  
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  So , um  I wonder if what you 're saying 
D:  suggests that we should make a conscious attempt to have , 
D:  um 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  a  a fair number of meetings 
D:  with , uh 
D:  a smaller number of people . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  I mean 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  we  most of our meetings are 
D:   uh , meetings currently with say five , six , seven , eight people 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Should we 
D:   really try to have some two - person meetings ,  or some three - person meetings and re record them 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  just to  to  to 
D:  beef up the  the statistics on that ? 
F:  That 's a control . 
F:  Well , 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  it seems like there are two possibilities there , I mean 
F:   i it seems like 
F:  <inbreath> if you have just 
F:   two people it 's not 
F:   really , 
F:  y like a meeting , w 
F:  is not as similar as the rest of the  
F:   of the sample . 
F:   It depends on what you 're after , of course , but 
F:  <inbreath> It seems like that would be more a case of the control condition , compared to , uh  an experimental 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
F:   condition , with more than two . 
D:  <mouth> 
D:  Well , Liz was raising the question of  of whether i it 's the number  there 's a relationship between the number of people and the number of overlaps or type of overlaps there , 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  and , um 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  If you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance then you 'd still have the visuals . You wouldn't have that difference  also that you have in the 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  say , in Switchboard data . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Uh 
F:  Yeah , I 'm just thinking that 'd be more like a c control condition . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Well , but from the acoustic point of view , 
E:  Yeah . 
H:  it 's all good . 
E:  Is the same . 
D:  Yeah , acoustic is fine , but  
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  If  if the goal were to just look at overlap you would  
G:  you could serve yourself  save yourself a lot of time but not even transcri transcribe the words . 
H:  Yep . 
B:  Well , I was thinking you should be able to do this 
B:  from the  acoustics , on the close - talking mikes , right ? 
H:  Well , that 's  the  that was my  my status report , so <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:   Right , I mean Adam was  
F:  You 've been working on that . 
F:   Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:   right . I mean , not as well as what  I mean , you wouldn't be able to have any kind of typology , obviously , but 
H:   Once we 're done with this stuff discussing , 
D:  Yeah . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  you 'd get some rough statistics . 
D:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
D:  But  
B:  So . 
D:  what  what do you think about that ? 
D:   Do you think that would be useful ? I 'm just thinking that as an action item of whether we should try to record some two - person meetings or something . 
B:  I guess my  my first comment was , um  only that 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  um 
B:  we should n not attribute overlaps only to meetings , but maybe that 's obvious , maybe 
B:  everybody knew that , but that 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  in normal 
B:  conversation with two people there 's an awful lot of the same kinds of overlap , and that it would be interesting 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  to 
B:  look at  whether there are these kinds of constraints that Jane mentioned , that 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  what maybe the additional people add to this competition that happens right after a turn , 
B:  you know , because now you can have five people trying to grab the turn , but pretty quickly 
B:  there 're  they back off and you go back to this sort of 
B:  only one person at a time with one person 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  interrupting at a time . 
B:  So , I don't know . To answer your question I  it  I don't think it 's 
B:  crucial to have 
B:  controls but I think it 's worth recording all the meetings we  
H:  Can .  
B:  can . 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  <inbreath> 
D:  Well , <laugh> OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  So , um  
D:  <laugh> 
G:  I  I have an idea . 
B:  you know . 
B:  D I wouldn't not record a two - person meeting just because it only has two people . 
H:  Right . 


G:  Could we  
G:  Could we , um  
G:  we have  have in the past and I think continue  will continue to have a fair number of  uh phone conference calls . 
G:  <inbreath> 
H:  Yeah , we talked about this repeatedly .  
D:  Uh - huh . 
G:  And , <inbreath> 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  uh , 
G:   and as a  
E:  <sniff> 
G:  to , um 
G:  <outbreath> 
G:  as another c  c comparison  condition ,  we could 
G:  um 
G:  see what  what 
G:  what happens in terms of overlap , when you don't have visual contact . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  So , um  
B:  Can we actually record ? 
H:  It just seems like that 's a very different  thing than what we 're doing . 
D:  Uh 
B:  I mean  physically  can we record the o the other  
D:  Well , we 'll have to set up for it . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  <sounds like tumbling beans> 
B:  <mike noise> 
D:  Well , we 're not really set up for it 
D:   to do that . 
G:  <inbreath> 
D:  But . 
G:  Or , 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  this is getting a little extravagant , 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  we could put up 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  some kind of 
G:  blinds or something to  
H:  Barriers !  
C:  Yeah . 
G:   to remove , uh 
B:  That 's what they did on Map Task , 
G:   visual contact . 
B:  you know , this Map Task corpus ? 
B:  They ran exactly the same pairs of people with and without 
B:  visual cues and it 's quite interesting . 
D:  Well , we  we record this meeting so regularly it wouldn't be that  
D:  I mean  a little strange . 
H:  OK , we can record , but no one can look at each other . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Well , we could just put  b blindfolds on . 
C:  Yeah . 
H:  Close your eyes . 
G:  Well y no you  f Yeah , Yeah . 
F:  Blindf - 
H:  Turn off the lights . 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  and we 'd take a picture of everybody sitting here with blindfolds . 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  <breath> 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  That would  
B:  <inbreath> 
D:  <inbreath> 
C:  <laugh> 


D:  Oh , th that was the other thing , weren't we gonna take a picture 
D:   at the beginning of each of these meetings ? 
H:  Um , what  I had 
H:  thought we were gonna do is just take pictures of the whiteboards . 
H:  rather than take pictures of the meeting . 
H:  <inbreath> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Well , linguistic  
D:  <laugh> 
H:  And , uh  
E:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  Yes .  
F:  Linguistic anthropologists would  would suggest it would be useful to 
E:  <breath> 
D:  There 's a head nodding here vigorously , yeah .  
F:  also take a picture of the meeting . 
F:  The  
A:  Why  why do we want to have a picture of the meeting ? 
B:  Ee -  you mean , transc  
E:  @ @  
F:  because you get then the spatial relationship of the speakers . 
B:  no  
G:  Well , you could do that by just noting on the enrollment sheet the  
F:   And that 
E:  Yeah 
F:   could be 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
H:  Seat number , that 's a good idea . 
G:   the seat number . 
E:  <breath> 
H:  I 'll do that . I 'll do that on the next set of forms . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  <breath> 
G:  So you 'd number them somehow . 
E:  Yeah . Is possible to get information from the rhythmic  f from the ge , eh  uh , files . 
H:  I finally remembered to put , uh 
A:  We can  can't you figure it out from the mike number ? 
H:  put native language on the newer forms . 
H:  No . 
A:  OK . 
H:  The wireless ones . 
H:  And even the jacks , I mean , I 'm sitting here and the jack is  over  in front of you . 
A:  Oh . 
B:  But probably from these you could 've  infer it . 
H:  <inbreath> 
G:  Yeah , but 
H:  It would be another task . 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  It 's  it would be trivial  
B:  It would be a research task . 
H:  Having  having ground tu truth would be nice , so  seat number would be good . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  You know where you could get it ? 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  Beam - forming during the digit  uh stuff . 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
H:  So I 'm gonna put little labels on all the chairs with the seat number . That 's a good idea . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  <inbreath> 
G:  Not the chairs . The chairs are  
B:  But you have to keep the chairs in the same pla like here . 
H:  But , uh  
G:  Chairs are movable . 
G:  Put them   
E:  The chair  
G:  Like ,  put them on the table where they  
H:  Yep . 
C:  Yeah . 
H:  Yep . 
F:  <inbreath> 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  But you know , they  the  s 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  the linguistic anthropologists would say it would be good to have a digital picture anyway , because you get 
A:  Just remembered a joke . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:   a sense also of posture . 
G:  What people were wearing . 
H:  Yeah . 
F:  Posture , and we could like , 
F:   you know , 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:   block out the person 's face or whatever but  
B:  The fashion statement . 
F:  <inbreath> but , you know , these are important cues , I mean the  
G:  Oh , Andreas was  
A:  How big their heads are .  
D:  <inbreath> 
F:  the  
B:  <laugh> 
F:  how a person is sitting  is  
D:  But if you just f 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Andreas was wearing that same old sweater again . 
D:  But from one picture , I don't know that you really get that . Right ? 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> 
D:  You 'd want a video for that , I think . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  It 'd be better than nothing , is  is  
E:  A video , yeah . 
F:  i Just from a single picture I think you can tell some aspects . 
A:  <yawn> 
D:  Think so ? 
F:  I mean I  I could tell you I mean , if I if I 'm in certain meetings I notice that there are certain people who 
G:  And  
G:  And  
F:  really do  
F:  eh  
F:  The body language is very uh  
D:  Hmm . 
F:  is very interesting in terms of the dominance aspect . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  And  and 
G:  Morgan had that funny hair again . 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  <inbreath> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah .  
F:  Well , I mean you black out the  that part . But it 's just , you know , the  the body 
H:  Hmm . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  He agreed .  
F:  you know ? 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  Of course , the  where we sit at the table , I find is very interesting , that we do tend to  cong  to 
H:  gravitate to the same place each time . 
F:  Yeah . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  and it 's somewhat coincidental . I 'm sitting here so that I can 
H:  run into the room if the hardware starts , you know , catching fire or something . 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  Oh , no , you  you just like to be in charge , that 's why you 're sitting  
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  I just want to be at the head of the table . 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  Yeah . 
E:  <breath> 
F:  <laugh> <inbreath> 
H:  Take control . 
D:  <mouth> 


D:  Speaking of taking control , you said you had some research to talk about . 
F:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah , I 've been playing with , um 
F:  Yeah . 
H:  uh , using the close - talking mike to do  to try to figure out who 's speaking . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  So my first attempt was just using thresholding and filtering , that we talked about  about two weeks ago , 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  and so I played with that a little bit , and 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  it works O K ,  except that 
H:   it 's very sensitive to your choice of 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  your filter width and your 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  threshold . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  So if you fiddle around with it a little bit and you get good numbers you can actually do a pretty good job of segmenting when someone 's talking and when they 're not . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  But if you try to use the same paramenters on another speaker , it doesn't work anymore ,  even if you normalize it based on 
H:  the absolute loudness . 
H:  <inbreath> 
B:  But does it work for that one speaker throughout the whole meeting ? 
H:  It does work for the one speaker throughout the whole meeting . 
H:  Um 
H:  Pretty well . Pretty well . 
A:  How did you do it Adam ? 
H:  How did I do it ? What do you mean ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I mean , wh what was the  
H:  The algorithm was , uh 
A:  Yeah . 
H:  take 
H:  o every frame that 's over the threshold , 
H:  and then median - filter it , 
H:  <outbreath> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  and then look for runs . 
H:  So there was a minimum run length , so that  
A:  Every frame that 's over what threshold ? 
H:  A threshold that you pick . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  In terms of energy ? 
H:  Yeah . 
A:  Ah ! 
A:  OK . 
F:  <inbreath> <mouth> 
F:  Say that again ? 
F:  Frame over fres threshold . 
H:  So you take a  each frame , and you compute the energy and if it 's over the threshold you set it to one , and if it 's under the threshold you set it to zero , 
H:  <inbreath> 
F:  Hmm . 
H:  so now you have a bit stream  of zeros and ones . 
F:  OK . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  And then I median - filtered that 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  using , um  a fairly long  filter length . 
H:  Uh  well , actually I guess depends on what you mean by long , you know , tenth of a second sorts of numbers . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  Um 
H:  and that 's to average out 
H:  you know , pitch , 
H:  you know , the pitch contours , 
H:  and things like that . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  And then , uh 
H:  looked for long runs . 
F:  OK 
H:  And that works O K , if you fil if you tune the filter parameters , if you tune <inbreath> how long your median filter is and how high you 're looking for your thresholds . 
H:  <inbreath> 
A:  Did you ever try running the filter before you pick a threshold ? 
H:  No . 
H:  I certainly could though . 
H:  But this was just 
H:  I had the program mostly written already so it was easy to do . <inbreath> 


H:  OK and then the other thing I did , was I took 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  Javier 's speaker - change detector  acoustic - change detector , and I implemented that with the close - talking mikes , 
H:  <inbreath> and  unfortunately that 's not working real well , and it looks like it 's  
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  the problem is  he does it in two passes , the first pass 
H:  <inbreath> is to find candidate places to do a break . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  And he does that using a neural net doing broad phone classification and he 
H:  has the 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  the , uh  one of the phone classes is silence . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  And so the possible breaks are where silence starts and ends . 
H:  <inbreath> And then he has a second pass which is a modeling  a Gaussian mixture model . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  Um 
H:  looking for 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  uh 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  whether it improves or  or degrades to split at one of those particular places . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  And what looks like it 's happening is that the  
H:  even on the close - talking mike 
H:  the broad phone class classifier 's doing a really bad job . 
A:  Who was it trained on ? 
H:  Uh , I have no idea . I don't remember . 
A:  Hmm . 
H:  Does an do you remember , Morgan , was it Broadcast News ? 
D:  I think so , yeah . 
H:  Um  
H:  So , at any rate , my next attempt ,  which I 'm in the midst of and haven't quite finished yet was actually using the 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  uh , thresholding 
H:  as the way of generating the candidates . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  Because one of the things that definitely happens is if you put the threshold low <inbreath> you get lots of breaks . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  All of which are definitely acoustic events . 
H:  They 're definitely 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  someone talking . 
H:  But , like , it could be someone who isn't the person here , but the person over there or it can be the person breathing . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  <inbreath> And then feeding that into the acoustic change detector . 
H:  And so I think that might work . 
H:  But , I haven't gotten very far on that . 
H:  But all of this is close - talking mike , so 
E:  <laugh> Only with eh 
H:  <inbreath> it 's , uh  just  just trying to get some ground truth . 
C:  <loud breath or cough> 
E:  uh , but eh 
E:  I  I  I think , eh 
E:  when  when , y I  <inbreath> I saw the  the  the  the speech from PDA and , eh  close  <inbreath> talker . I  I think the 
E:  there is a  a great difference in the  in the signal . 
H:  Oh , absolutely . So  s my intention for this is  is as an aide for ground truth . 
E:   Um 
E:  but eh I  
H:  not  
E:  but eh 
E:  I  I  I mean that eh eh  in the  in the mixed file 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  you can find , uh  zone with , eh  
E:  great different , eh  level of energy . 
E:  <mouth> 
E:  Um <inbreath> 
E:  I  I think for , eh  algorithm based on energy , 
E:   eh , that um 
E:  h mmm ,  more or less , eh , like eh  
E:  eh , mmm , first sound energy detector . 
H:  Say it again ? 
E:  eh nnn . 
E:  When y you the detect the  the  the first at  at the end of  of the 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  detector of , ehm princ um . What is the  the name in English ? the  the , mmm , 
E:   <inbreath> 
E:  the de detector of , ehm of a word in the  in the s in  
E:  an isolated word 
E:  in  in the background 
H:  I 'm  I 'm not sure what you 're saying , can you try  
C:  <loud breath or cough> 
E:  That , uh 
E:  I mean that when  when you use , eh  eh  any 
A:  I think he 's saying the onset detector . 
E:  Yeah . 
H:  Onset detector , OK . 
E:  I  I think it 's probably to work well eh , because , eh  you have eh , in the mixed files a great level of energy . 
E:  eh  and great difference between the sp speaker . <inbreath> 
E:  And probably is not so easy 
E:  when you use the  the PDA , eh that  
H:  Right . 
E:  Because the signal is , eh  the  in the e energy level . <inbreath> 
E:  in  in that , eh  eh  speech file <inbreath> is , eh  more similar . 
H:  Right . 
E:  between the different eh , speaker , <inbreath> um  
H:  But different speakers . 
E:  I  I think is  eh , it will  i is my opinion . <inbreath> It will be , eh  more difficult to  to detect 
E:  bass - tone energy . 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  the  the change . <inbreath> 
E:  I think that , um  In the PDA . Yeah .  Yeah . And the  the another question , that when 
H:  Ah , in the clo in the P D A , you mean ?  Absolutely . Yeah , no question . It 'll be much harder . Much harder . 
D:  Yeah . 
H:  <laugh> 
E:  I review the  the  the work of Javier . I think the , nnn , the , nnn ,  that the idea of using a  neural network 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  to  to get a broad class of phonetic , eh  from , eh uh 
E:  a candidate from the  the  the speech signal . 
E:  If you have , eh <mouth> 
E:  uh , I 'm considering , only because Javier , eh  only consider , eh  like candidate , the , nnn , eh  the silence , because it is the  the only model , eh  eh , he used that , eh  <inbreath> eh  nnn , 
H:  Right . 
E:  to detect 
E:  the  the possibility of a  a change between the  between the speaker , <inbreath> Um  another  another research thing , different groups , eh  working , eh  on Broadcast News <inbreath> prefer to , eh  
E:  to consider hypothesis 
E:  eh  between each phoneme . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Yeah , when a  phone changes . 
E:  Because , I  I  I think it 's more realistic that , uh  only consider the  <inbreath> the <mouth> the  the silence between the speaker . <inbreath> Eh  there  there exists 
D:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
D:  <inbreath> 
E:  eh  silence between  between , eh  a speaker . <inbreath> 
E:  is  is , eh  eh  acoustic , eh  
E:  event , important to  to consider . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  I  I found that the , eh  silence in  in many occasions in the  in the speech file , <inbreath> but , eh  when you have , eh  eh , two speakers together 
E:  without enough silence between  between them , eh  <inbreath> 
E:  I think 
E:  eh  is better to use the acoustic change detector basically and I  I  I 
E:  IX or , mmm , BIC criterion for consider all the frames 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  in my opinion . 
D:  <inbreath> Yeah , the  you know , the reason that he , uh  just used silence 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  was not because he thought it was better , 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  it was  it was  it was the place he was starting . 
H:  Yep . 
D:  So , he was trying to get something going , and , uh e e you know , as  as  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
D:  <inbreath> as is in your case , if you 're here for only a modest number of months you try to 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  pick a realistic goal , 
H:  Do something . 
E:  Yeah , 
D:  <inbreath> But his  his goal was always to proceed from there to then allow broad category change also . 
E:  yeah , yeah , yeah . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  But , eh  do  do you think that if you consider all the frames 
E:  to apply 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  the  the , eh  
E:  the 
E:  BIC criterion 
E:  to detect the  the  the different acoustic change , <inbreath> eh  between speaker , without , uh  with , uh  silence or <inbreath> with overlapping , uh , I think like  like , eh  eh 
E:  a general , eh  
E:  eh  way of process the  the acoustic change . <inbreath> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  In a first step , I mean . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  An - and then , eh  
E:  <mouth> 
E:  eh  without considering the you  you  you , um  you can consider the energy 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  like a another parameter in the  in the feature vector , eh . 
H:  Right . Absolutely . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  This  this is the idea . And if , if you do that , eh  eh , with a BIC uh criterion for example , or with another kind of , eh  of distance in a first step , <inbreath> and then you , eh  you get the , eh  the hypothesis 
E:  to the  this change acoustic , <inbreath> eh  
E:  <swallow> to po process 
H:  Right . 
E:  Because , eh  eh , probably you  you can find the  the 
E:  <mouth> 
E:  eh  a small gap of silence between speaker <inbreath> with eh  eh  a ga mmm ,  
E:  <mouth> 
E:  small duration 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Less than , <inbreath> eh  two hundred milliseconds for example <inbreath> and apply another  another algorithm , another approach like , eh  eh  detector of ene , eh detector of bass - tone energy to  to consider that , eh 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  that , eh  zone . 
E:  of s a small silence between speaker , <inbreath> or 
E:  <mouth> 
E:  another algorithm to  to process , <inbreath> eh  the  the segment between marks 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  eh  founded by the  the 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  the BIC criterion and applied for  for each frame . I think is , eh  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  nnn , 
E:  it will be a an  an  a more general approach 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  the  if we compare  with use , eh  a neural net or another , eh  speech recognizer with a broad class or  or narrow class , because , in my opinion 
E:  eh  it 's in my opinion , <inbreath> eh 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  if you  if you change 
E:  the condition of the speech , I mean , if you adjust to your algorithm with a mixed speech file and to , eh 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <mouth> to , eh  <mouth> adapt 
E:  the neural net , eh  used by Javier with a mixed file . 
H:  With the what file ? 
E:  uh 
E:  With a m mixed file , 
E:  with a  the mix , 
F:  " Mixed . " 
A:  " Mixed " . 
H:  " Mixed ? " 
E:  mix .  Sorry . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And 
E:   and then you  you , eh 
E:  you try to  to apply that , eh , eh , eh , speech recognizer to that signal , to the PDA , eh  speech file , <inbreath> I  
E:  I think 
E:  you will have problems , because the  the  the  the  condition <inbreath> you  you will need t t I  I suppose that you will need to  
D:  <inbreath> Well , I  
H:  Oh , absolutely . This is  this is not what I was suggesting to do . 
D:  I  u 
E:  to  
E:  to retrain it . 
D:  <inbreath> Look , I  I think this is a  
E:  Really ? 
D:  One  once  
D:  It 's a  I used to work , like , on voiced  on voice silence detection , you know , and this is this  kind of thing . 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  <inbreath> Um  
D:  If you 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  have somebody who has some experience with this sort of thing , and they work on it for a couple months , <inbreath> 
D:  they can come up with something that gets most of the cases fairly easily . 
D:  <inbreath> Then you say , " OK , I don't just wanna get most of the cases I want it to be really accurate . " 
D:  Then it gets really hard no matter what you do . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  So , the p the problem is is that if you say , " Well 
D:  I  
D:  I have these other data over here , 
D:  <inbreath> that I learn things from , either explicit training of neural nets or of Gaussian mixture models or whatever . " 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Uh 
D:   Suppose you don't use any of those things . You say you have 
D:  looked for acoustic change . Well , what does that mean ? 
D:  That  that means you set some thresholds somewhere or something , right ? 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  <inbreath> 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  and  and so <inbreath> where do you get your thresholds from ? 
D:  From something that you looked at . So 
D:  <inbreath> you always have this problem , you 're going to new data 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  um  
D:  H how are you going to adapt whatever you can very quickly learn about the new data ? 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Uh , if it 's gonna be different from old data that you have ? 
D:  And I think that 's a problem  
H:  Well , also what I 'm doing right now is not intended to be an acoustic change detector for far - field mikes . What I 'm doing 
D:  with this . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  is trying to use the close - talking mike 
H:  <inbreath> 
E:  Yeah !  
H:  and just use  
G:  Actually  
H:   Can - and just generate candidate and just  try to get a first pass at something that sort of works . 
A:  You have candidates . 
G:  actually  actually   
E:  the candidate . 
G:  I  
A:  to make marking easier . 
G:  Or  
A:  Yeah . 
H:   and I haven't spent a lot of time on it and I 'm not intending to spend a lot of time on it . 
G:  OK . 
G:  I  
H:  So . <inbreath> 
G:  um , I , unfortunately , have to run , but , um  
G:  I can imagine  uh building  a  um 
G:   model of speaker change  detection  that 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  takes into account  both the far - field and the 
G:  <inbreath> 
H:  Yep . 
G:  uh  actually , not just the close - talking mike for that speaker , but actually for all of th 
H:  Everyone else . 
G:   for all of the speakers . 
G:  <inbreath> 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  um  
G:  If you model the  
G:   the  effect that 
G:   me speaking has on 
G:   your  microphone and everybody else 's microphone , as well as on that , 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  and you build , um  
G:   <inbreath> 
G:  basically I think you 'd  you would 
G:   build a  
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  an HMM that has 
G:  as a state space all of the possible speaker combinations 
H:  All the  Yep . 
E:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath>  
G:  and , um 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  you can control  
H:  It 's a little big . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  It 's not that big actually , um 
D:  <inbreath> 
H:  Two to the N . 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  Two to the number of people in the meeting .  
D:  <inbreath> But  
D:  Actually , Andreas may maybe  maybe just something simpler but  but 
H:  Anyway . 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  along the lines of what you 're saying , I was just realizing , I used to know this guy who used to build , uh 
G:  Mmm . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  um , mike mixers  automatic mike mixers where , you know , t in order to able to turn up the gain , 
E:  Yeah  
G:  Mmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  you know , uh 
D:  <inbreath> as much as you can , you  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  you  you lower the gain on  on the mikes of people who aren't talking , right ? 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And then he had some sort of <inbreath> 
D:  reasonable way of doing that , but <inbreath> 
D:  uh , what if you were just looking at very simple measures like energy measures but you don't just compare it to some threshold  overall but you compare it to the <inbreath> energy in the other microphones . 
H:  I was thinking about doing that originally to find out 
H:   who 's the loudest , 
H:   and that person is certainly talking . 
H:  <inbreath> 
D:  Yeah . 
H:  But I also wanted to find threshold  uh , excuse me , mol overlap . 
D:  Yeah . 
H:  So , not just  just the loudest . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  But , eh 
E:   I  I 
E:  Sorry . I  I have found that when  when I 
G:  Sorry , I have to go . 
H:  OK . 
G:   
E:  I analyzed the  the speech files from the ,  eh  mike , eh  from the eh close eh  microphone , eh  I found zones 
H:  Could you fill that out anyway ? 
H:   Just ,  put your name in . 
H:  <laugh> 
H:  Are y you want me to do it ? I 'll do it . 
A:  But he 's not gonna even read that . 
H:  I know . 
A:  Oh . 
E:  with a  a different level of energy . 
E:  including overlap zone . 
E:  including . 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  because , eh  eh  depend on the position of the  of the microph of the each speaker <inbreath> to , eh , to get 
E:  more o or less energy 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  i in the mixed sign in the signal . 
E:  and then , <inbreath> if you consider energy to  to detect overlapping 
E:  in  in , uh , and you process the  the  in  the  the  the speech file from the  the  the mixed signals . <inbreath> The mixed signals , eh . 
E:  <mouth> 
E:  I  I think it 's  it 's difficult , um <mouth>  only to en with energy to  to consider that in that zone 
E:  We have eh , eh , overlapping zone 
E:  Eh , if you process only the the energy of the , of each frame . 
D:  Well , it 's probably harder , but I  I think what I was s 
D:  nnn 
D:  noting 
D:  just when he  when Andreas raised that , was that there 's other information to be gained from looking at all 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  of the microphones and you may not need to look at very sophisticated things ,  
E:  Yeah . 
D:  because if there 's  <inbreath> 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  if most of the overlaps  
D:  you know , this doesn't cover , say , three , but if most of the overlaps , say , are two , <inbreath> 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  if the distribution looks like there 's a couple high ones and  and  the rest of them are low , you know , what I mean ,  there 's some information there about their distribution even with very simple measures . 
E:  Yeah . 
H:  And everyone else is low , yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 


D:  <inbreath> Uh , by the way , I had an idea with  while I was watching Chuck nodding at a lot of these things , is that we can all wear little bells on our heads , 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <inbreath> so that 
E:  Yeah .  
C:  <laugh> 
H:  Ding , ding , ding , ding . 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  " Ding " .  That 's cute ! <laugh> 
D:  then you 'd know that  
E:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  I think that 'd be really interesting too , with blindfolds . 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  Nodding with blindfolds , " what are you nodding about ? " 
B:  Then  
B:   Yeah . The question is ,  like  whether  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Well , trying with and  
H:  " Sorry , I 'm just  I 'm just going to sleep . " 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:   with and without , yeah . <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:   But then there 's just one @ @ , like . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Actually , I saw a uh  a woman at the bus stop the other day who , um , was talking on her cell phone 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  speaking Japanese , and was bowing . 
E:  Yeah  
A:  you know , profusely .  
B:  Oh , yeah , that 's really common . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  Ah .  
A:  Just , kept  
E:  Yeah . 
D:  Wow . 
B:  It 's very difficult if you try  while you 're trying , say , to convince somebody on the phone it 's difficult not to move your hands . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Not  
D:  Mm - hmm ? 
B:  You know , if you watch people they 'll actually do these things . So . 
B:   <inbreath> 
D:  <inbreath> 


B:  I still think we should try a  a meeting or two with the blindfolds , at least of this meeting that we have lots of recordings of 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah , I think th 
B:  Um , maybe for part of the meeting , we don't have to do it the whole meeting . 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  I think it 's a great idea . 
B:  That could be fun . 
B:  It 'll be too hard to make barriers , I was thinking because they have to go all the way 
D:  W 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  you know , I can see Chuck even if you put a barrier here . 
H:  Well , we could just turn out the lights . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  Actually  well also  
H:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  I  I can say I made barr barriers for  
F:  so that  
F:  the  stuff I was doing with Collin wha 
B:  Y Yeah ? 
F:   which  just used , um 
F:   this  kind of foam board . 
F:  R really inexpensive . You can  you can masking tape it together , these are  
F:  you know , pretty l large partitions . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  But then we also have these mikes , is the other thing I was thinking , so we need a barrier that doesn't disturb 
B:   the sound , 
F:  It 's true , it would disturb the , um  the  
H:  The acoustics . 
B:   um 
D:  <inbreath> 
F:  the long - range  it would  
D:  Blindfolds would be good . 
H:  I think , blindfolds . 
B:  I mean , it sounds weird but  but  
D:  Probably we should wait until after Adam 's set up the mikes , 
B:   you know it 's  
D:  But . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  it 's cheap and , uh 
F:  OK . 
B:  Be interesting to have the camera going . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  I think we 're going to have to work on the , uh  
A:  I 'll be peeking . 
F:   on the human subjects <laugh> form . 
H:  Yeah , that 's right , we didn't tell them we would be blindfolding . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  That 's  
F:   " Do you mind being blindfolded while you 're interviewed ? " 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <inbreath> that 's  that 's  that 's the one that we videotape . 
D:  So . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <inbreath> 


D:  Um , I  I wanna move this along . 
D:  Uh  
D:  I did have this other agenda item which is , uh @ @  it 's uh a list which I sent to uh  a couple folks , 
D:  but um I wanted to get broader input on it , 
D:  So this is the things that I think we did 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  in the last three months 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  obviously not everything we did but  but sort of highlights that I can  
D:   can  tell  s some outside person , you know , what  what were you  actually working on . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Um  in no particular order 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  uh , one , uh , ten more hours of meeting r meetings recorded , 
D:  something like that , 
D:  you know from  from , uh  
D:  three months ago . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Uh  
D:  XML formats and other transcription aspects sorted out 
D:   and uh  sent to IBM . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Um , 
D:  pilot data put together and sent to IBM for transcription , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  uh  next batch of recorded data put together on the CD - ROMs for shipment to IBM , 
D:  <inbreath> 
H:  Hasn't been sent yet , but  
D:  But 
D:  yeah , that 's why I phrased it that way , 
H:  It 's getting ready . 
D:  yeah OK . <inbreath> 
D:  Um  
D:  human subjects approval on campus , 
D:  uh  and release forms worked out so the meeting participants have a chance to request audio pixelization of 
D:  selected parts of the spee their speech . 
H:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Um 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  audio pixelization software written and tested .  
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Um  <mouth> 
D:  preliminary analysis of overlaps in the pilot data we have transcribed , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  and exploratory analysis of long - distance inferences for topic coherence , that was  I was  
D:   wasn't  sure if those were the right way  
D:   that was the right way to describe that because of that little exercise that  
D:  that you  and  and Lokendra did . 
D:  <inbreath> 
F:  What was that called ? 
F:   The , uh  say again ? 
D:  I  well , I I 'm probably saying this wrong , but what I said was exploratory analysis of long - distance inferences 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  for topic coherence . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Something like that . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Um  so , uh  
D:  I  <inbreath>  
D:  a lot of that was from , you know , what  
D:  what  what you two were doing so I  I sent it to you , and 
D:  you know , please mail me , you know , the corrections or suggestions for changing I  I don't want to make this twice it 's length but  
H:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  but 
D:  you know , just 
D:  im improve it . 
D:  Um 
D:  Is there anything anybody  
H:  I  I did a bunch of stuff for supporting of digits . 
D:  " Bunch of stuff for s " OK , maybe  maybe send me a sentence that 's a little thought through about that . 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  So ,  OK , I 'll send you a sentence that doesn't just say " a bunch of " ? 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  " Bunch of stuff " , yeah , 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  Yep . 
D:  " stuff " is probably bad too , 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  " Stuff "  is not very technical . 
D:  <laugh> 
D:   Yeah , well . 
H:   I 'll try to 
C:  <laugh> 
H:   phrase it in passive voice . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , yeah , 
A:  Technical stuff . 
D:  " range of things " , 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Um  
D:  and  and you know , I sort of 
D:  threw in 
D:  what you did with what Jane did on  in  under the , uh  
D:  uh 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  preliminary analysis of overlaps . 
D:  Uh 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  uh 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Thilo , can you tell us about all the work you 've done on this project in the last , uh  last three months ? That 's  
C:  So  what is  what  
H:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Um . <laugh> 
C:  Not really . 
C:  <laugh>  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  It 's too complicated . 


C:  Um ,  I didn't get it . Wh - what is " audio pixelization " ? 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh , audio pix wh he did it , so why don't you explain it quickly ? 
H:  It 's just , uh  beeping out parts that you don't want included in the meeting so , you know 
H:  you can say things like , " Well , this should probably not be on the record , but beep " 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  OK , OK . 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  I got that . 
D:  Yeah . We  we  we spent a  a  a fair amount of time early on just talk dealing with this issue about op w e e 
C:  @ @ 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <inbreath> we realized , " well , people are speaking in an impromptu way and they might say something that would embarrass them or others later " , and , 
C:  OK . 
D:  how do you get around that so in the consent form it says , well 
D:  you  
D:  we will look at the transcripts later and if there 's something that you 're 
C:  OK , and you can say   
D:   unhappy with , yeah . 
C:  OK .  
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  But you don't want to just totally excise it because 
D:  um 
D:  uh , well you have to be careful about excising it , how  how you excise it keeping the timing right and so forth so that at the moment 
D:  tho th the idea we 're running with is  is h putting the beep over it . 
H:  Yeah , you can either beep or it can be silence . I  I couldn't decide . 
C:  OK . 
E:  Ah , yeah . 
H:  which was the right way to do it . Beep is good auditorily , 
H:  <inbreath> if someone is listening to it , there 's no mistake that it 's been beeped out , 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
H:  <inbreath> but for software it 's probably better for it to be silence . 
A:  No , no . You can  you know , you could make a m 
F:  Hmm . 
A:  as long as you keep using the same beep , 
A:  people could make a model of that beep , and  
H:  Yep . 
H:   And I use  it 's  it 's , uh 
F:  I like that idea . 
B:  I think the beep is a really good idea . 
H:   it 's an A below middle C beep , so <laugh> 
F:  It 's very clear . Then you don't think it 's a long pause . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Also  
A:  Yeah , it 's more obvious that there was something there than if there 's just silence . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , that  I mean , he 's  he 's removing the old  thing and  and  and  
F:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah 
H:  Yep . 
A:  Yea - right . 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah , it 's not  
A:  Right . 
A:  But I mean if you just replaced it with silence ,  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  it 's not clear whether that 's really silence or  
E:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , I agree . 
H:  Yep . 
C:  @ @ 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  <inbreath> One  one question . Do you do it on all channels ? 
D:  Yeah . 
H:  Of course . 
F:  Interesting . I like that . 
H:  Yeah you have to do it on all channels because it 's , uh  audible . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , I like that . Very clear . 
D:  <laugh> 
H:   Uh , it 's  it 's potentially audible , you could potentially recover it . 
F:  Very clear . 
D:  Ke - keep a back door . 
F:  Well , the other thing that  you know , I mean the  the alternative might be to s 
H:  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  Well , I  I haven't thrown away any of the meetings that I beeped . Actually yours is the only one that I beeped and then , uh 
D:  <laugh> 
H:   the ar DARPA meeting . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:   Notice how quiet I am . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> Sorry , and then the DARPA meeting I just excised completely , so it 's in a private directory . 
B:   <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  You have some people who only have beeps as their speech in these meetings . <laugh> 
F:  That 's great . 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  OK . 
D:  <inbreath> 
A:  They 're easy to find , then . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Alright , so , uh  I think we should , uh  uh , go on to the digits ? 
H:  OK . 
F:  <inbreath> I have one concept a t I  I want to say , 
F:  which is that I think it 's nice that you 're preserving the time relations , 
F:  s so you 're  you 're not just cutting  you 're not doing scissor snips . You 're  you 're keeping the , uh  
H:  Right . 
F:  the time duration of a  de - deleted  deleted part . 
B:  Yeah , definitely . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  OK , good , digits . 
H:  Yeah , since we wanna  possibly synchronize these things as well . 
H:  Oh , I should have done that . Shoot .  Oh well . 
F:  It 's great . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh - 
B:  So I guess if there 's an overlap , 
B:   like , if I 'm saying something that 's  bleepable and somebody else overlaps during it they also get bleeped , too ? 
H:  You 'll lose it . There 's no way around that . 


D:  Yeah . 
D:  <inbreath> Um  
D:  I d I did  
D:  before we do the digits , I did also wanna remind people , uh  
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  please do send me , you know , 
D:  uh 
H:  Agenda ? 
D:  thoughts for an agenda , yeah that  that would be 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Good . 
D:  that 'd be good . 
D:  Eh 
D:  So that , uh , people 's ideas don't get  <inbreath> yeah , well 
H:  Thursday crept up on me this week . 
D:  it does creep up , doesn't it ? 
D:  OK . 
B:  And , I wanted to say , I think this is really interesting 
B:   analysis .  I meant to say that before I started off on the  Switchboard stuff . It 's neat . 
H:  It 's cool stuff , definitely . 
F:  Thank you . Thank you . 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  I was gonna say " can you do that for the other meetings , can you do it for them ? " And , no actually , you can't . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> Does it take  
F:  <laugh> Thank you . 
A:  Actually  actually I  I thought that 's what you were giving us was another meeting and I was like , " Oh , OK ! " 
H:  <laugh> 
H:  " Ooo , cool ! " 
F:  Yeah . Aw , thanks . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  How long does it  take , just briefly , like 
F:   No . 
F:  I have the script now , so , I mean , it can work off the , uh 
B:   t to  
B:   OK . 
H:  It 's  
B:   to label the , OK . 
F:   other thing , <inbreath> 
H:  As soon as we get labels , yep . 
A:  But it has to be hand - labeled first ? 
F:  but  
F:  Uh , well , yeah . Because , uh  well , I mean 
F:   once his  his algorithm is up and running 
H:  If it works well enough . 
F:  then we can do it that way . 
H:  Right now it 's not . 
F:   But  I  I just worked off of my 
B:  OK . 
D:  OK , go ahead 
B:  It 's really neat . 
F:   Thanks . 
F:   Appreciate that . 
H:  Not quite to the point where it works . 
F:  I think  what I  what this has , uh , caused me  so this discussion 
F:  caused me to wanna subdivide these further . I 'm gonna take a look at the , uh  backchannels , how much we have 
F:  anal I hope to have that for next time . 
H:  Yeah , my  my algorithm worked great actually on these , 
A:  That 'd be interesting . 
H:   but when you wear it like that or with the 
H:  uh , lapel 
H:   or if you have it very far from your face , that 's when it starts  failing . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Well , I can wear it , 
A:  Oh . 
B:  I mean if you   
H:  It doesn't matter . 
B:  OK . 
H:  I mean , we want it to work , right ? 
H:   I  I don't want  to change the way we do the meeting . 
A:  It 's too late now .  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  I feel like this troublemaker . <laugh>  
A:  <laugh> 
H:   It 's uh  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
H:   so , it was just a comment on the software , not a comment on 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  prescriptions on how you wear microphones . 
B:  OK . 
A:  <laugh> 
H:   Get the bolts , " whh whh "  
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
D:  OK , that 's  let 's  let 's  let 's do digits . 
F:  Let 's do it . 
H:  <inbreath> 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
H:  <inbreath> OK , thank you . 
F:  Do you want us to put a mark on the bottom of these when they 've actually been read , or 
F:  do you just 
F:   i 
F:   the only one that wasn't read is  
F:   is known , so we don't do it . 
F:  OK .
