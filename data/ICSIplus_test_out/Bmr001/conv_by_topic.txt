B:  OK , so we 're live . 
A:  OK . 
B:  Are we live or are we Memorex ? 
A:  We 're 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  OK , so that 's 
A:  somewhere in between . OK , so we have some sheets for uh  some 
C:  Wait . 
A:  standard doohickies to  
B:  Right . So . 
C:  You 're going to sit there ? 
B:  Is that alright ? 
C:  Yeah , OK , maybe I 'll put this thing here then . 
B:  OK .  
A:  OK , so this is February second , eh , two thousand , this is eh 
A:  meeting number one  with Adam and Dan and Morgan , about five o ' clock 
A:  uh in the afternoon . 
A:  A range of microphones . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  What 's this one here ? This  this one is  has a couple of cheezy electrettes and  
C:  Yeah , that 's   that 's the dummy  dummy PDA . 
A:  That 's connected too , or  ?  
B:  Yep . 
C:  Yeah , it is . 
A:  That 's connected . 
B:  Yeah , both channels . 
A:  It 's got two  to both channels . 
C:  Oh , hang on . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , it is at the moment . 
A:  OK . 
C:  Yep . 
A:  OK . 
A:  This is  
B:  Although the gain  is pretty low . 
B:  So for the um  read numbers task , 
C:  Hang on , let 's  let 's  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  I have extracted these  
C:  OK let 's just  let 's just name the microphones . 
B:  OK . 
C:  So I 'm speaking on the  ear mounted  uh wired headset thing . 
C:  OK . 
B:  Right and I 'm now talking on microphone number two , 
B:  uh , the wireless microphone number two . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Um , I have no idea which one I 'm  I 'm on . Oh one ! Oh , I 'm number one . 
B:  I 'm  
C:  You 're on one . 
C:  Absolutely . 
A:  OK , <laugh> which is a  a l a lapel , in fact it 's sticking through my  lapel . 
C:  Yes . 
C:  OK so this is  this is the PZM nearest the eh 
C:  eh the machine room end of the table . 
B:  Actually , i 
C:  Then  there 's  I know , but yeah .  It 's number three , it says , but  we 'll be able to figure it out . This is at the middle of the table 
C:  This further down the table . 
C:  And this  this one is right at the end of the table , OK ? 
C:  And then we 've got the uh  
C:  This is the left side of the dummy PDA and 
C:  this would be the right side . 
A:  I think listening to this is gonna be like watching somebody 's home movies . @ @ 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yes , it 'll be pretty horrible . 
A:  Yeah , OK . 
C:  Very exciting . 
B:  So , what I have on these forms here is for the read numbers  read digits tasks and it 's extracted directly from Aurora  and uh  
B:  So what I was thinking is we could start just by filling it out and then reading  reading the numbers on the form . 
A:  OK , what do we do with the stuff on top ? 
B:  Fill it out . 
A:  But I  
A:  Do we say it after we  
C:  No . Just write it down .  
B:  No , you don't need to . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  What are we  why are we writing it down ? 
B:  So that  when we  transcribe the data we can figure out who said it and their gender and the date and the time and what mike they were on and all that sort of thing . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  OK 
A:  That 's good . So I don't need to fill that out right now . So maybe we should just say it . 
B:  W 
B:  Why don't you want to fill it out right now ? Just so that  
C:  OK . 
A:  So then we 're not spending the time writing it out . So that we 're spending the time talking . 
C:  Well , how about  you give me one of those and we can fill it out and Morgan can read and then we can do it like that . 
A:  I 'm just uh concerned about a bunch of dead time while we all sit here and fill out the things . 
B:  OK . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  Right ? 
A:  <clears throat> 
B:  And so you have to be sure to pause  between each line , since we 're going to be segmenting it and then  doing it that way . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Right . 
A:  OK , so this is Morgan . I 'm going to read some numbers now . 
C:  one five one eight  
B:  So I definitely wasn't pausing enough between them . <laugh> 
C:  This is  these are things we will find out . 
B:  That 'll be an issue . 
B:  Yep . 
A:  Yeah .  I don't know if I said mine was transcript zero , but it was . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm - hmm ! 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh , good . 
C:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  That 's a little bit . 
C:  Can I 


A:  one  
A:  two  
A:  three zero eight two  
A:  five two one zero nine  
A:  six three  
A:  seven five  
A:  eight six zero one one six two  
A:  nine  
A:  O O two O six   
A:  Whoops  that 's a mistake , disfluency , scratch , start over .  
A:  O O two one six four one  
A:  zero zero seven zero four  
A:  That 's my group . 
B:  OK . So , Adam Janin next ,  uh transcript number two on a wireless headset number two .  
B:  two seven O  
B:  three six seven  
B:  four  
B:  five  
B:  seven one nine zero  
B:  eight five  
B:  nine eight zero seven four three seven  
B:  O  
B:  zero nine nine five  
B:  one  
C:  OK . This is Dan on the uh wired headset , transcript number one .  
C:  two one four eight  
C:  three eight eight  
C:  four three O six five seven one  
C:  five five two seven  
C:  six  
C:  seven  
C:  eight  
C:  O three O  
C:  zero two  


A:  So . 
A:  Because there may be other considerations  that will go into the design . I mean , uh 
A:  our getting some experience with this may help to determine  some of things that are  I don't know  might change this design , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
A:  So . 
A:  So uh  so where are we  uh now ? I mean so we 've just  
A:  uh We 're doing this recording so we show  we can  we 're capable of doing recording 
C:  Right . 
A:  So a little bit of futzing , there 's the issue about a cabinet , we might want to change some pre - amps . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  So we can do some more recordings but there 's  there 's a little  little bit of ramp up  on that over the next month ,  say . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  Right and also I would like to work out some of the  software issues a little more  completely . So , 
B:  um , you know , we 're gonna want to resample and con and bring them over to another machine 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Um . 
A:  we talked out about what we 're  
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 


A:  So , so where are we in this ? Let 's see , so we now  we now have a few mikes that work . How long did it take you to set this up ? 
C:  have something to write on the back of ? 
C:  Thanks . 
C:  Oh ! It didn't  doesn't take  Well , I mean as you see we haven't really set it up that well , but it doesn't  it doesn't take long to set up . I mean , 
C:  We just came up here  one night after recording so it took like twenty minutes something like that . 
C:  I mean it 's  
B:  Right and that  that included a fair amount of fiddling around , 
C:  Yeah ,  I mean the equipment  
B:  since it 's  it 's more or less the first time we 've tried to do it . 
C:  Right . 
C:  The equip Me and Adam went through it yesterday , just looked at everything . But it 's all kind of here and set up , so it 's just a question of turning it all on . 


C:  And , um  
B:  I mean , ev eventually we 'll want to like 
C:  running the program . 
B:  tape that over and run them up through the center so that wires aren't  aren't  people aren't tripping over the wires and so on . 
C:  Right . 
A:  Are we gonna  I mean , is it gonna be over there , or is it gonna be in there ? 
C:  Um , it 's  it 's gonna b it 's  for reasons  because of the microphones runs we want that chunk there . There 's more equipment in there . 
C:  But there 's   the idea is that there are  these microphones on the table , there are some cables coming down  sort of under a nice  mat , 
C:  and then that 's   they  a bunch of them get sort of converged with digital there . 
B:  Well , I think our intention at this point is when we 're not using it to record a meeting we 'll coil them all up and put them under  so that people will not be tripping over them and so on . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  So . 
C:  But ,  well we should get to a  a nice kind of working state of our set up  as quickly as possible . 
A:  Yeah , and there 's also the minor matter , it 'd be kind of nice to able to  bring people in and say " yes , this is where we do such - and - such " , 
A:  and then be able to see uh , 
B:  Right . Not have it  
A:  you know , 
C:  Yeah . 
A:   some kind of  I mean it 's 
A:  less important than doing what we 're doing right now but  
C:  Yeah . 


C:  And the idea is that this gets replaced by a cabinet with doors , so that   so that it 's not  open to fiddling . 
A:  So that 's what 's gonna happen . 
B:  Right . 
C:  That 's 
B:  Do we have like a  cabinet on order or do we just need to do that ? 
C:  We need to do that . It 's on a list of things to do .  I keep on hoping that  they 're gonna get done but they don't . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  I  
B:  Well , I  <laugh> I can help them get done um one question is budget . Do we have any money at all that we can go out and spend on things like cabinets or a hard drive or things like that . 
C:  Yeah ! 
A:  Oh  I mean , I don't know . Did we s did we spend our  the budget already that we had ? 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh , how much  are we talking about here ? 
C:  Um . 
C:  I don't know . A cabinet is probably going to cost  a hundred dollars , two hundred dollars something like that . 
A:  Yeah , I mean , you know , we  we can spend under a thousand dollars or something without  without worrying about it . 
C:  I mean . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  I mean , I think  um  I 'm more worried about things being kept in a funky state long enough that  that uh stuff gets broken or  or 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  you know . 


C:  I mean  there 's one big issue with the equipment still , 
C:  which is um 
C:  ultimately we 're gonna  well the idea is to have 
C:  any number of these wired headsets , but 
C:  there 's this amplification problem . 
C:  I built this thing , it 's  that 's  it 's very noisy . We 're actually recording  I 'm  I 'm going through it at the moment ,  but it 's so noisy that I am not using for this . 
C:  it 's  it 's designed to be used for the  for the desktop meeting as well . 
C:  But I 'm using  running that through my uh  damp machine as a pre - amp as an alternative . 
A:  Well , we should be able to just go buy some preamps ,  I would think . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  It 's just  it eh 
C:  You see how clumsy this is right ? I have to use these batteries to bias them . 
C:  And I 'm only get two channels and there 're a bunch of   
C:  There are like three connectors in the circuit . 
C:  The thing is , like , 
C:  it 's  
C:  it 's not s it 's not that the thing doesn't exist  commercially , but there isn't one unit which does the whole thing in one  in one  swoop . 
C:  So it seemed like it was a good idea to make one . 
C:   um 
C:  And I 'm still not sure . I mean , I think  I probably know how to fix this . I can probably 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  build it better so it doesn't have such noise , but 
C:  it 's kind of a buy . 
B:  Well , ultimately we 're gonna need to build one anyway . 
A:  Are we ? 
B:  Sure . Because we we 're gonna have to put it in a PDA . 
C:  Well , we could just  
A:  Well . 
B:  Right ? If we have microphones in a PDA it 's gonna need 
B:  bias and  a pre - amp . 
A:  I guess I 'd sort of figured that  that Jim would do that at some point . Right ? 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well n 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Jim is busy at the moment . That 's the problem . I was kind of hoping that Jim was going to build this box . 
C:  But um  but he hasn't had time . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Well , I think  I think he is quite interested in doing it . But . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Well 
A:  If it 's too noisy and if there 's something we can buy , again for , you know , moderate amount of price , even if it takes a couple boxes or something , maybe we should just do it . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  And then  and then later we can  uh replace it with  


C:  OK . 


A:  There was uh a statement made 
A:  uh 
A:  which I don't think is right , by the way , but   
A:  there was a statement made at the uh DARPA Communicator meeting I was at recently 
A:  that um 
A:   <swallows> 
A:  microphone  multiple microphones  at a distance of less than  three feet or something like that were totally useless , completely irrelevant . 
C:  Oh ! 
B:  You  you mean for noise cancelling , or  ?  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  for nois noise cancelling . 
A:  Um , 
A:  my counter argument is  is an  uh uh um , a white rat . 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  uh , which  has th it 's two microphones exceedingly close together and it works pretty well .  
C:  Oh . <laugh> 
A:  Um but  
C:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  This happened . 
B:  Do they mean  omnidirectional , is that their point ? I mean all the noise cancelling mikes , they 're  you know , they 're a few m millimeters away from each other pointing in different directions . 
C:  I think   uh , I mean , uh my guess is that means it 's just that if it 's  if it 's near field ,  the mathematics of beam   beam steering is different . 
B:  But . 
B:  Oh , I see . 
C:  If the f if the wavefronts are not approximately planar  then you can't just do delay and sum and expect it to work . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  It 's  Oh , OK , so they 're not talking about  how far apart the mikes are , they 're talking about how far they are from the speaker . 
C:  I guess . Yeah . 
A:  Right . But I think that if  my point is I guess if you  if you have a um  
A:  a uh s a volume in between  the two  the two uh uh sensors 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  and you do something cleverer , 
A:  there clearly are ways  to get more out of it . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  Right , right , right . I mean the  um 
C:  The  the weird thing is that actually  delay in some beam - forming is not  is not the clever thing to do .  The  
C:  the  the underwater guys do this stuff which is  different . 
C:  And it actually means that you should get the microphones as close together as possible . 
C:  Rather than trying to get them far apart so you can get  separation , you sort of   you want them very close . And  
C:  And  the math is too difficult for me to understand but it 's  but it 's there . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , there are various points in meeting where people were making uh uh very strong statements as a matter of fact , like one shouldn't even question it and  
A:  this was one of them that  was kind of  funny . 
A:  Um but I  I  I  what I take it to mean is doing  doing the dumb thing 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  uh with two microphones would be very difficult to get too much out of it but 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  I think it will be interesting to do other things that aren't dumb . 
A:  So I  I still think it 's potentially   interesting to do that . Although we we 'll have to be uh a aware of this if we 're writing proposals about it , 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  wherever , that there may well be reviewers who will say , " well everyone knows that  you can't get anything out of it if it 's  <laugh> if it 's close " . 
C:  Yeah . 


B:  Do they believe you can get speaker location out of it ? Cuz that 's  that 's one way we could sneak it in . 
A:  Uh , that is an interesting point . 
A:  Yeah . Certainly you can 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well we could  
A:  get some  
C:  I mean . By the time   We 'll have  we 'll have data so we can actually  you know , demonstrate that . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Well . 
A:  Hopefully . 
B:  Oh , you mean for location ? 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . Depends on who 's working on it .  
A:  Well , we 're getting some  
A:  we we 're getting some right now . 
B:  Yeah , right . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> but someone has to write some software to  to actually do it . Someone might . 
C:  Right . Right . But I mean . 
A:  Well someone someone might be interested in  in it . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 


B:  Oh that 's uh  I was just thinking one thing we may wanna do is put the fake PDA right in front of someone  
B:  instead of in the middle of the table like we have it now . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  on the thought that  my vision of it is you know each of us will have our little PDA in front of us  and so the acoustics  uh you might want to try to match the acoustics . 
A:  Maybe . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  But on the other hand ,  
A:  suppose that uh , you 're the only one uh who is advanced enough in this thinking to actually bring such a PDA to  to a meeting 
B:  No , and I don't need to meet with those people . <laugh> 
A:  and  and  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  and therefore you bring it in ,  and you probably want it to be as near to people as possible so you might in fact shove it to the middle of the table . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Well .  
C:  Yep , yep .  For those those we can make several  several more of these  
C:  and then we can have actual  recording with you know three  P D As . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , I think we should . 
A:  I mean , I think at least with two .  Right ? 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
A:  Because uh one of the th one of the fantasies that was at least fun to talk about was that uh 
A:  uh OK maybe you th  
A:  you 're   
A:  the range of things you can do with multiple microphones is limited if they 're a few inches apart , 
A:  but what if you have two of these things ? 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  And you know we have this  this idea of the handshake  back and forth and say " I 'm here , I 'm here " <laugh> " We 're now an array . " 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
C:  Right , right . 
C:  Yeah .  And that  that seems very uh  easy to believe scenario , I mean , given the number of palm pilots we 've got on the table right now , so . 
B:  That 's right . 
B:  Three , right ?  So I guess this a pretty dense group but it it 's getting a lot higher . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , but  But that  it 's 
C:  We 're not , even , you know   It 's  we 're just  It 's not like we  
C:  We  we may be technical , but we 're not particularly PDA people . 
C:  So it 's  That 's just how it is . 
B:  Well , I 'm trying to be . So . 
C:  Well , I know . Well , that 's true . I mean . 
B:  Except I s got a PDA way before  Well I was doing hand I was doing wearable computers at Boeing , so I guess I sort of count .  But . 


A:  uh there 's  I guess a little more wiring to do or something to have  to have more  if we had more people participating in the meeting we 'd wouldn't quite be ready for that . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Uh . 
C:  Well we 've got  we 've got  Right now we could have two more people on wireless ,  with a trip to Leo 's Audio we could get a third extra person on wireless ,  and uh  right now we could have three more   three more people wearing mikes like this , and that would just work . I mean I 'm not sure how   how good the quality is on this mike but I think it 's going to be OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  So we could actually have  eight people with  with headset mikes  with , I mean , basically no extra effort . 
B:  Well . 
B:  Five with wireless .  So we could have eight . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Nine . 
B:  Nine . Excuse me , nine . Five with wireless and four without , 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  and four with wired . 
B:  Um , we don't have  headsets though . 
C:  Yeah . We have the um  the ones we 've been using , the ones we got for the PC . 
B:  Oh , OK so we just have to c  wander around and collect them up . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . I think we have three of those . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  So , and the h 
B:  Uh , there 's one in my office . So . 
C:  Right , right .  They don't all work , but the nice ones , the um Plan - Plantronic ones work . 
A:  OK . 
B:  So , we 'll just have to see if that works . 


B:  and uh  um  organize the  how we 're gonna store it all . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah we were talking about that a little bit over coffee today , that  that um 
A:  uh if you downsample it sounded like it came  it sounded like it was something like a gig gigabyte an hour if you didn't downsample and once you downsampled then it was something like four hundred megabytes an hour , 
C:  Per channel , or  ?  
A:  if you used all  if you used all  no , if you used all the channels .  Something like that ? 
C:  We figured out that it was t twelve gig 
B:  It was more than that . 
C:  twelve gigabytes an hour ?  For  for all the channels ?  Was that with or without the  
A:  I thought it was one gigabyte . 
A:  It couldn't be twelve . 
C:  Cuz no , we 've only  no , I mean we 've only got four gigabytes and that 
B:  We said , four gigabytes  would give us twenty minutes  before we did anything else . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . And then we  then we cut it in half . 
B:  And then we cut in half ,  by  
A:  How 'd you cut it ? 
C:  But  
C:  By s  saving sixteen bits on instead of thirty  instead of thirty - two . 
A:  OK , so that 's  so that 's two gigabytes . 
A:  And then  
C:  Well no I mean it 's 
B:  That 's forty minutes <laugh> 
C:  uh four gigabytes for forty minutes . 
A:  Right . But that 's at forty four kilohertz with sixteen channels . 
B:  So , six gigabytes . 
C:  Forty - eight kilohertz ,  yeah . 
C:  So we can actually triple that . 
A:  So you can  right , so you can 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  So , hang on  so that would  OK 
B:  I came out at the gig an hour ,  at one point . That  that 's one computation I did for sixteen channels , sixteen bit . 
C:  Well I think it 's  
C:  I think it 's two gig an hour . 
B:  Is it two gig an hour ? I 'm off by an order of magni That 's alright . Order of two .  Factor of two . 
C:  Cuz like , we don't   Maybe we don't  We don't need to save all channels , right ? So , on average . 
C:  We could  we don't  we  we wouldn't use all the channels , necessarily . 
A:  Oh , we 'll do the higher math later , maybe but it 's  so it 's  so maybe like a gig or two a  an hour , um but  um  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  OK , that is a bit more than I thought . 
B:  How much here would we have to reformat the drive in there 
B:  to get some of the more space  cuz it  I mean it 's a nine gig drive and 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  there 's four gig on sc on scratch and there 's  about three gig unused , it looked like , on the home directory . 
C:  I 'm sure .  Yeah . 
B:  I just don't know enough about LINUX . How hard is it to  repartition ? 
C:  It 's a pain . 
B:  It 's a pain . 
C:  I mean , you know , because  cuz we 've got data on " user " , right ? And then we 'd have to 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  back it all up and  copy it back on again . 
A:  Yeah so this 'll take some thought cuz we have  we  
A:  um 
A:  If we are in fact gonna have forty or fifty hours at some point and we  we wanna ha have part of our work be 
A:  on feature extraction , it means that we need to have waveforms available  somehow . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Hmm . 
B:  Right . So I 've  I 've already created a " U  U , doctor speech , data , MR " directory , 
B:   or had Jane do it and uh 
B:   um  
B:  but there 's not a lot of free space around . 
B:   So it  it  it has currently about four gig 
C:  No . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  on the drive that I think she 's going to put it on um . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  And so we need  we definitely need to go  buy  uh  you know forty gig  fifty gig of drive  drive space . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  We don't need all  we don't necessarily need it all on - line . I mean it will be different subsets .  So you won't  you won't , you know , do all  sixteen channels in a single  
B:  That 's true . I hadn't even thought about that , 
B:  although it 'd be kind of interesting . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  What would you do ? I mean  
C:  You typically train  I mean you 'd have fi you 'd have fifty hours we 'd only use  one of the PZM channels , something like this , and so that would you wouldn't have to use all sixteen channels  at once . 
C:  But it 's kind of  painful for  
C:  because basically , 
C:  if we put them on C Ds then each CD will have  all the channels for one  recording , 
C:  and then when you want to build the P - files , you just want to get one of those files off each of  the sessions and  
B:  Yeah , it 's pretty horrible . 
A:  So what would we do for training ? So if we 're  if we 're training distant mi we 'd just use one of them ? 
C:  Yeah . Well , maybe two of them , but I mean we wouldn't use  we 'd only use the distant mikes , right ? 
A:  OK . 
B:  Yeah so it might be four . 
B:  Right ? But it wouldn't be sixteen . 
A:  Well , although we wanted to get alignments from the close mike  stuff . 
B:  But that 's a separate training . 
A:  Right .  But you don't want to be constantly take  putting that on disk and off disk and on disk . 
B:  No wait . More disk is better . Absolutely . I mean  my  my preference would be to get  get ourselves a hundred gig of disk . <laugh> And just not bother . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  The thing is it 's really not very expensive right now . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  So it 's more of an issue of  of structuring it with uh the uh Sys Admin folks so we don't panic them and 
B:  And back up . 
A:  figuring out where it goes . 
C:  Right if  if we  
A:  Well , we don't  it doesn't need to be backed up . 
C:  if we burn it all on CD - ROM , 
C:  then , 
B:  Right , then it doesn't need to be backed up . 
C:  um , in fact , we could 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Well , anyway for this  this recording we 're fine cuz we 're only  we 're only  how many mikes are we recording right now ? 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Well , right now we don't have any choice . It r still records all sixteen channels . It 's just most of them are all zeroes . 
B:  So that  that 's on our list too . 
A:  OK . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , well that we can 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  do something about . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  It 's mostly a question of user interface . How do we  how do we specify which ones are on ? 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh , yeah ! 
C:  Oh yeah ! 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , that 's right .  We 've got lots of bits of noise . 
C:  These theories things are pretty amazing . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  And 
C:  And there 's help  help they seem  they seem good though they seem to be 
A:  It 's some sort of oversampling thing I imagine , right ? 
A:  Didn't we already get that ? Cuz you  
C:  Oh , God knows . Yeah , yeah . 
A:  you can't have  uh component tolerances that are  uh  sixteen million  one in sixteen million parts , so . 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 


C:  you know  we could throw away the Broadcast News stuff and put it on there or something like that . 
B:  Yeah , we were talking about that . I 'm not sure if anyone 's  still using it . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I think the only one using it has been Javier , 
C:  Somebody used it recently . 
A:  but at this point I think it 's  he 's only been using it for features that he calculated quite a while ago , 
A:  so if nobody else is doing  feature calculation  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  I 'll send mail to speech local . 
B:   I 'll send mail to speech local and see if anyone 's still using it . 
A:  Pardon ? 
A:  How much space is that using up ? Do you have any idea ? 
C:  It 's uh twenty C Ds , so that 's twelve gigabytes . 
B:  So that would last us for a while . 
A:  Yeah , couple hours ! 


B:  Yeah , so we don't store any of our audio formats compressed in any way do we ? 
B:  So these large sections when you guys aren't talking  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Probably , we could  we could probably just run Shorten on them or something and it will get a big win . 
C:  I think that 's a good  
B:  Run what on those ? 
C:  Shorten . 
C:  Tony Robinson 's  uh lossless compression thing . 
B:  OK . 
A:  What 's it do ? 
C:  Um , 
C:  it   
C:  it does  AR  modeling 
C:   and so it looks at a section , 
C:   it runs an AR model to sort of r w to whiten it 
C:   and then quantizes  the residual  with a nice  with the three bits it can get away with . Something like that . 
C:  So I think it  On  on each block it 'll   it 'll compress you know if there 's load on in any range it 'll use ratio bits . I think it does that . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  @ @ 
B:  Yeah , so , P Z Ms . 
C:  Yeah , well . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , it 's something that  that we definitely need to look at with this . 


B:  Maybe we shouldn't 've  subsampled it down to sixteen bits  for our first try . 
C:  Well , it 's OK , it 's only the first try . I  what I 'm thinking is um  obviously we can do the  we can  we can choose any sixteen bits from the twenty four , so we can just have different gain things that we use  you know per channel . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah , so we might wanna see if maybe the low sixteen bits on the P Z Ms are better than the middle  sixteen bits . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I think   probably the bottom four bits are not any good , 
B:  Regardless , yeah . 
C:  Right ? Although you know it claims they are . But probably 
C:  the  
B:  W I was just noticing on the  on the  there 's a view meter , software view meter and the PZM gain is real low .  So . 
A:  Yeah , so I think initially we should take up more space until we 've analyzed this and get a better sense of it because 
A:   uh we don I mean we 're not talking about forty or fifty hours at this point we 're talking about  a half hour of  of speech and so 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yep . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:   uh we should look at this carefully  but  
A:  Yeah , I was  interested when I saw the twenty - four on there . Wow , I mean that 's probably eight bits of noise . Yeah . So . 


B:  Right the other  other thing  another issue is just getting a sound card up here . 
B:  You know , I assumed that we could just put a sound blaster in if we want sound output . 
C:  That  that card  that machine 's got sound  They 've got a sound blaster built into it . 
B:  Oh , it 's just not working . 
C:  I just  I just disabled it cuz I wanted to find out 
C:   how well the  sound infrastructure would deal with both at once 
B:  OK . 
C:   but I think yeah , that 's , uh  
C:   probably it will be fine . 
B:  Yeah , that way we don't  we can't listen to it  on this machine . 
A:  I 'm s 
C:  There 's no , 
A:  Oh ! 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  For a couple of reasons . 
C:  Well , but the @ @   
C:  There are two ways we could listen to it . There 's a sound  there 's actually sound output built into this thing .  But the driver  I haven't  the driver may not support it yet .  And then there 's also the sound or the sound card built in . But I don't know how to  I don't know how the  operating system would like having two sound cards . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  But we can FTP stuff over , right ? So  it 's connected . 
B:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  And we 've looked at it so we know it 's working . I mean , you can see the little squiggles , and it looks like speech  so <laugh>  You just can't listen . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 


A:  One suggestion I have is that um 
A:  I think this   maybe we should just read some more  you made more of these , right ? I think we should read some more 
B:  Right . 
B:  OK . <laugh> 
A:  because  because this is very f we  
A:   we need to  to work the  the  the uh  the talkers more because we 're not gonna have that many meetings 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  and this is a pretty tiny amount of data . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  So maybe we should do another  number list and  
B:  Well right I  I just did ten per page I could easily do twenty per page . 
B:   It 's just a question of uh  of how much uh annoyance I wanted to put uh people going to meetings through . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well this is us . We 'll have a fair amount of annoyance yeah I think <laugh> uh . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  So , can we do  we do another set ? Are we  are we  are we  sort of  
B:  Sure . 
C:  Sure . 


C:  Well no , OK , the question I still have about what we 're going to do is 
A:  OK . 
A:  Right . 
C:  what is  what  eh  OK , so we can get the equipment set up so that 
C:  basically we 're in a situation where we can   with , you know , ten minutes of preparation , we can bring  nine people in here and do a multi channel recording . 
C:  Um . 
C:  What are  wh When are we  Are we going to do that ? Who are they going to be ? What meetings are we going to record ? 
B:  Us , to begin with . 
C:  So which  which meetings  What meetings do we have ? 
B:  I think that 's the intention . 
C:  I mean like " us " being the Meeting Recorder people or " us " being anything that speech  local does . 
B:  Well , I think   
B:  I think , um , certainly us , Meeting Recorder .  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Um , us other groups . It just depends on how many meetings we 're  we 're having . Um . 
B:  Jerry also said it would be  he would be willing to have his group , some of the AI meetings do it as well . 
C:  And we should have like  we should have Decoder meetings and stuff . 
B:  And uh 
B:  Exactly exactly . I think there are enough  incidental meetings for us to  to do this . And if  we can get it set up so it is convenient enough , 
B:  um , then you can just do spontaneous meetings as well . 
C:  Yeah , I mean that 's the thing . It 's OK to g 
C:  Right . 
B:  Which I 'm interested in . I mean , that 's one of the things , the whole reason I want a PDA as opposed to a wired room 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
B:  is for spontaneous meetings . 
C:  Well , we 've got to make it really really easy to start it going then in that case . Cuz that  that 's the real  goal . 
B:  Right . 
B:  That 's right . 
B:  That 's why I put ten on here instead of thirty or forty or fifty . 
C:  Right . But I mean if we  if we want  Jerry 's group to  use it then we probably @ @ won't ask them to read any numbers , right ? Cuz . 
B:  Right . Well , I  I bet they would be willing to do it the first few times , just for the novelty . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah .  
A:  I think they would . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  We could  we could have the reading group in here . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , I mean it 's a different style . But I think that 's alright . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  I mean . 
C:  Yeah , it 's great . 
B:  Um ,  <laugh> we were joking about having lunch up here but eating with the microphones   <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 


A:  And also he 's  he 's  he 's got  at least one woman . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh , that 's a good point ! <laugh> 
C:  That 's great . I know . 
A:  And we 're  we have a little problem of  no women , 
B:  Boy , that 's abs I had never  I hadn't even thought about that . 
C:  I know , it 's a disaster . 
A:  Yeah , well , when L when Liz uh Shriberg starts coming , then there 's another woman although she  
B:  Oh , man ! 
C:  It 's alright she doesn't mind as long as we don't video her , right ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Ah , that 's right . That was it . So . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Maybe we should have the reading group here and force Jane to come . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . No , well , actually we could have Jane uh  Jane 's interested and curious about this stuff so she could attend one of  probably not the decoder meeting but some of the other stuff she  would be interested enough and have her read  


B:  Um ,  I had another question briefly about transcription . So are we going get an external service or are we gonna do it ? I mean who 's gonna  generate the transcripts ? 
C:  OK . 
A:  Um 
A:  I think that one of the neat things about having this little pilot thing from today 
A:  is we should try it a couple different ways , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  so we should  try to do it internally , maybe ask  ask Jane if we could get her to do it or  or  or have her  supervise a linguistics student or somebody 
C:  Mm - hmm 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:   and uh see how long it takes , and you know , multiply out the cost , and then send  
A:  send the same thing out , or maybe split it in halves or something  something like that 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  to a  to an outside service 
A:  and uh see what that costs and how much hassle that is . 
B:  Right . 
A:  And then we can 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  probably . 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  Yet . 
B:  So that  I mean , that 's one chunk of work and just segmenting for this is gonna be another chunk of work .  
B:  Um . 
C:  Yeah . And  Yeah . As much work as you want . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah 
A:  But uh I don't know . This meeting , so , say it 's maybe going to be a half hour or something , and  
C:  Yeah . 
A:   and uh we 've heard estimates ranging between ten and twenty  times uh real time to do this kind of transcription 
A:  um  so you know in  in principle then it 'll take somebody a day for somebody to deal with this . 
C:  Mm - hmm . Wow . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  And uh we 'll see  which one of those seems closest to right and if they  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:   ramped up , if towards the end it was faster you know , get some sort of sense from them 
A:  uh from whoever does it 
A:  and um then uh 
A:  like I say , check it out with an external service and see  if it 's faster , cheaper , better , worse , whatever . Then we 'll go from there . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK so we 're degenerating , right . Are  are  are we done with uh MR business , or  ?  
C:  Yep . 
B:  Sure . 
A:   I mean what what 's  maybe we should  what are our action items ? So there 's  there 's the continuing process of  cleaning up the stuff and making it easier to do that . 


B:  Yeah , the  the problem of course is that it 's  you know , in  in this meeting it 's three four five six seven eight , it 's nine transcripts ,  potentially . 
A:  assess it . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Well , 
C:  Except that you wouldn't transcribe them all individually , right ? You would send  I mean , 
A:  No . 
C:   uh a transcriber is used  I mean , I don't know , assume  presumably a transcriber  transcribes a single meeting , right ? And so they  they just have to  indicate that the  speaker changes . 
A:  No . 
A:  Right . This was  this was the point of having near zero skew . Right ? 
C:  Right ? 
A:  So you just pick one , 
B:  Oh , you 're right , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  with the best sounding one , and give it to somebody and they transcribe it . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  So  the only thing we 'll have to be careful with is that they 're   well , what are they listening to ? 
C:  So  so they  they 're gonna  they 're gonna have to make speaker assignments  or something like this . 
B:  They 're going to have to make speaker assignments , and wh and which recording are they gonna listen to ? 
C:  For one of  one of @ @ . 
C:  Or we could mix  we could mix the  the headset mikes , you know , just to make a single 
C:  high q high quality  
A:  Right . 
C:  and we could do  
B:  Oh , that would be interesting . 
C:  and we could do all kinds of weird things like having you know squelch so that  you only , you know  you only  you 
C:  cut it out when there 's no energy . So you don't @ @ noise . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah , you could do fancy things , but it seems like that 's enough . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I mean there 's  it 's  
B:  OK . 
C:  If we  if we do something which is have a little bit of human input to get the words 
C:  then we can  leverage that a lot 
C:  by some clever cross thing to figure out which channel they really belong to and stuff like this , 


B:  Yeah , one of the things I was thinking with transcript is that if we take the near field 
B:  and  we do an initial  recognition pass , is it easier for a transcriber to correct a transcript , 
B:  if the  near field mike does a reasonably good job ? 
C:  Hmm . 
B:  I bet it isn't , 
C:  Yeah .  
B:  unless it 's really close to right . 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  I have  just because it 's such an un 
C:  The transcribing is sort of something I can imagine doing , 
B:  Right . 
C:  whereas having this distraction 
C:  of having sort of something that looks like it might be right but has got some  
B:  Some errors , yeah . 
C:  very wrong bits in 
C:  is sort of a less  less easy thing to do . 
A:  I don't know . I do I don't know the answer to that . 
C:  I 'm sure the professional transcribers obviously don't have any use for  
A:  I don't know . 
C:  Yeah 
A:  Well , I mean there 's this Cyber Transcriber service , right ? 
C:  Yeah , that 's true , that 's true . 
A:  And at least supposedly the way they work is by feeding them 
C:  Yeah , by fixing up  transcripts . 
A:  what is the output of the recognizer . 
A:  So maybe it depends on what the software tools are like . 
C:  Yeah , but  Yeah . 
A:  If it 's  you know , if they can easily flip through stuff and get to the right thing , or do you point , or I don't know . 
A:  There 's supposed to be some out  out  out - of - work shepherders or something in <laugh> Scotland but  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Ah , the internet . 
C:  They should all be in India right now . That 's where the good , but the cheap English speakers are . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Not in Scotland . 
A:  Inexpensive . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  I 'm sorry , yeah . 
B:  Not in Scotland .  
C:  Well they don't speak  such clear English  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  They  they sheep  they s they  they speak cheap English , right ? 
C:  <laugh> 


A:   There 's taking  the results of this meeting  and putting it in some kind of decent form , probably getting  some kind of single channel  merged sum data or something so that you can give a simple  sound file of some sort to a transcriber 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  to deal with it rather than this massive thing . That 's a little bit of  stuff to do . Right ? 
B:  Right . 
B:  And then  do some segmenting and recognition  initial recognition 
B:  would be interesting to do . 
A:  Yeah , although it  it  it  it may be separating out these numbers  from the rest . Yeah . 
B:  That 's what I mean . 
A:  And then 
B:  Yeah just doing a digits on it  uh , connected digits . 
A:  Yeah  and uh 
A:  Right . 


A:  So , with this next  
B:  You wanna read ? 
A:  Sure . OK .

A:  How many more you got ? 
B:  Oh I on I did ten but I can  I have a script to generate them automatically . <laugh> 
A:  Well , let 's do some more while we got them here . 
B:  OK .  
C:  Wow . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  What fun  it is . 
A:  Well , you know , it 's not , but 
C:  It 's interesting that um it m it 's not clear whether it 's better to have them written as  as words or  or  figures . 
C:  But , of course , to get zero and " O "s distinguished we  you have to do it . 
B:  That 's why , yep . 
C:  But  it 's kind of weird to read . 
A:  OK , this is uh Morgan again with the wireless lapel , transcript six .

C:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  I 'd say we 're done . 
B:  OK . 
C:  Oh , I wonder  I wonder if we ran out of disk space yet . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  So , is it  it 's going to disk , or is this  
A:  And how  how much disk do we have ?
