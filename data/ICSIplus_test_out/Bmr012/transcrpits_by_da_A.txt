A:  Um Gotta go . 
A:  By the way , there was a bug . 
A:  Yeah , i it wasn't using the proper 
A:  basically it wasn't adapting anything . 
A:  Hmm ? 
A:  Oh , because when it estimates the transformer pro produces like a single matrix or something . 
A:  Basically there were no counts 
A:  Hello , hello . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  I think  
A:  Um may I make one suggestion ? 
A:  Instead of age put date of  uh year of birth 
A:  because age will change , but The year of birth changes , you know , stays the same , usually . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well the thing is , if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that  
A:  Well  well I don't know . 
A:  Anyway . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Well it was interesting , 
A:  suddenly  the  the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent 
A:  but i looking at  the first sentences looked much better than that 
A:  and then suddenly it turned very bad 
A:  and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the  
A:  it was actually recognized 
A:  so 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  So  so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever , up to that time to 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Oh , and  
A:  I  I have  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  There are a fair number of errors that are , you know where  got the plural S wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong . 
A:  Mmm , so if  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Oh it 's the  
A:  Well it 's  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well that 's  those are the only we ones there are , 
A:  I mean 
A:  Right . 
A:  Oh yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I should  I should say that  the language model is not just Switchboard 
A:  it 's also  
A:  I mean there 's uh actually more data is from Broadcast News 
A:  but with a little less weight 
A:  uh because 
A:  mm - hmm , 
A:  right . 
A:  Um By the way just  for fun we also ran , 
A:  I mean our complete system starts by doing ge a gender detection 
A:  so just for the heck of it I ran that 
A:  um and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders right . 
A:  Yeah so 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yes . 
A:  I mean clearly there are um with just a small amount of uh actual meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better 
A:  because the  
A:  Not that much the vocabulary actually 
A:  I think  um well we have to see 
A:  but  it 's uh  
A:  We  we talked about setting up the SRI recognizer here . 
A:  That 's  you know if  if there are more machines um uh here 
A:  plus people can  could run their own uh you know variants of  of  of the recognition  runs 
A:  um 
A:  certainly doable . 
A:  Um . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  U um 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  U uh actually I had a question about the downsampling , 
A:  um I don't know who , I mean how this was done 
A:  but is  is there  are there any um <mouth> issues with downsampling 
A:  because I know that the recognizer um that we use h can do it sort of on the fly 
A:  um 
A:  so we wouldn't have to have it eh you know do it uh explicitly beforehand . 
A:  And is there any um i 
A:  are there other d sev uh is there more than one way to do the downsampling where one might be better than another ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Right . 
A:  OK . 
A:  So  so the  th 
A:  So  so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms , 
A:  I mean segment them but not downsample them . 
A:  And  and feed them to  feed them to the SRI recognizer and see if  if the SRI front - end does something . 
A:  Well  
A:  Right and  and it doesn't  is no more work <laugh> for um you know for us . 
A:  Well but they 're only twice as big 
A:  so 
A:  I mean it 's  it 's just a 
A:  Yeah I mean it would be uh you know it would probably take uh about um you know 
A:  minus the transfer time it would  it would take uh you know ten minutes to try and  and  and 
A:  And  and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might investigate why 
A:  and , you know , what  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  You know a at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition um performance . 
A:  So in other words 
A:  right , 
A:  so 
A:  Mel cepstrum . 
A:  That 's what I would assume but you never know , 
A:  you know . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Actually , no . 
A:  Don't stop . 
A:  Don't stop at that part because we 're actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters , 
A:  so shouldn't use  you should s you know , get 

A:  Right . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  They 're less animated . 
A:  Like uh like you know Jerry Springer thing , 
A:  you know r 
A:  Yeah . 

A:  Do you have to hand it around 
A:  and if you have two pieces of 

A:  Pretty soon . 
A:  Um Gotta go .
