F:  Yeah , I don't know exactly what affected it 
F:  but I 'll  I 'll talk to you about it , 
F:  I 'll show you the point . 
F:  That 's what happened . 
F:  There was  
F:  yeah , I mean  
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Non - zero ? 
F:  Um there are like more  cuz there 's a lot of zeros I tacked on just because of the way the script ran , 
F:  I mean but there were there was a point . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Uh . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  There are lots of w <clears throat> there are lots of ways to do the downsampling um different filters to put on , 
F:  like anti - aliasing stuff . 
F:  No , I 'm using uh SN SND uh are resample . 
F:  RSMP . 
F:  Yeah , I don't really . 
F:  I just  yeah I found it . 
F:  Yeah , that 's  
F:  I mean that 's just one line  that 's one line of code to comment at 
F:  so 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Although those eighty meg files take a while to copy into my directories 
F:  so , 
F:  but 
F:  no , 
F:  I mean it 's not  i it wouldn't be a problem if you 're interested in it  
F:  it would

F:  Yeah , it 's  it 's really not a problem . 
F:  Keep going . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , I mean I 'll  I have to do is eh e the reference file would stay the same , 
F:  it 's just the individual segments would be approximately twice as long 
F:  and I could just replace them with the bigger ones in the directory , 
F:  that 's not a problem . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Is eight kilohertz  is  is eighty kilohertz generally accepted as like standard for voice ? 
F:  Yeah that 's what I was gonna say , 
F:  I mean like  
F:  so 
F:  Oh , I see , 
F:  so . 
F:  OK .

F:  Yeah . 
F:  We were just talking about something like this yesterday 
F:  or 
F:  yeah yesterday with Liz . 
F:  About doing some of the <clears throat> echo cancellation stuff or possibly the spectroanalysis over the overlaps , 
F:  so . 
F:  Cool .
