E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  The @ @  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Hi . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  No . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Yeah . 

E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  How  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . Yeah . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  This is the  the first derivate of log of frame energy uh without any kind of normalization . 
E:  These the These are the  the first experiments uh with comment uh 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Here I  I 
E:  in  No I  I  I haven't the result 
E:  but it 's the  it 's the  the  the following . 
E:  Huh ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Catal - uh  Combining the different possibilities of uh the parameters . 
E:  I  I  I  I mean the  the  the scatter plot  combining eh different  n two combination . 
E:  combination of two ,  of energy and derivate  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I agree , yeah . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
E:  But  
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  But  It  it 's curious but uh I f I found it in the  in the mixed file , in one channel <inbreath> that eh in several  oh e eh several times eh you have an speaker talking alone with a high level of energy 
E:  eh in the middle eh a zone of overlapping with mmm less energy 
E:  and eh come with another speaker with high energy 
E:  and the overlapping zone has eh less energy . 
E:  Because there reach very many 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  just locally , yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , this is the  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  To study individual ? 
E:  To study individual ? 
E:  The  the  the  But  Consider  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I don't consi Now I don't consider that possibility . 
E:  This is a s a general studio of the overlapping we 're studying the  i 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Consider different class of overlap ? 
E:  If there 's time . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  This is the thing I  I comment with you before , that uh we have a great variation of th situation of overlapping . 
E:  And the behavior for energy is , uh log energy , <inbreath> is not uh the same all the time . 
E:  And  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  But  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  I  I  I think this is a good idea . 
E:  Not consider the log energy . 
E:  The  ? 
E:  I  I 'm preparing the  the program but I don't  I don't begin because eh <laugh> I saw your email 
E:  and  I agree with you it 's better to  I suppose it 's better to  to consider the  the energy this kind of parameter <inbreath> bef 
E:  I  I go on with the  with the pitch , 
E:  aha !  OK . 
E:  I  I  I  I understood uh that eh  I  I had to finish  by the moment with the <laugh> and  and concentrate my  my energy in that problem . 
E:  OK . 
E:  I go on with the pitch . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I would think it 's interesting , yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  uh uh 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I  I think a a another parameter we c we  we can consider is eh the  duration . 
E:  Another e e m besides eh the  the class of overlap , the duration . 
E:  Because is possible <inbreath> eh some s s um eh some classes eh has eh  a type of a duration , 
E:  eh ,  a duration very short uh when we have  <inbreath> we have overlapping with speech . 
E:  Is possible to have . 
E:  And it 's interesting ,  I think ,  to consider the  the window of normalization , 
E:  normalization window . 
E:  Eh  because eh if we have a type of ,  a kind of eh overlap , eh backchannel overlap , with a short duration , is possible  eh to normali 
E:  i i that if we normalize eh with eh  eh consider only the  the eh window eh by the left eh ri eh  side on the right side overlapping with a  a very  eh oh a small window 
E:  eh the  if the fit of normalization is eh mmm bigger eh in that overlapping zone eh very short 
E:  I  I me I  I understand . 
E:  I mean that you have eh you have a backchannel , eh , eh  you have a overlapping zone very short 
E:  and you consider eh n eh all the channel to normalize this very short eh  
E:  for example " mmm mm - hmm hmm " eh 
E:  And the energy is not eh height 
E:  eh I think if you consider all the channel to normalize and the channel is  mmm bigger  eh eh eh compared with the  with the overlapping eh duration , 
E:  eh the effect is mmm stronger 
E:  eh  that I  I mean the  the e effect of the normalization eh with the mean and the  and the variance eh is different that if you consider  only a  window compared eh with the n the duration of overlapping . 
E:  Not  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I  I don't know . 
E:  Is  s If  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , This is the  This is the  the idea , <inbreath> to consider only the  the small window near  near  near the  the overlapping zone . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I can give you my transcription file , 
E:  no ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yes 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh it 's the same . 
E:  Oh no no . 
E:  Is  is new Is OK . 
E:  Yeah , I  
E:  yeah . 
E:  Me too . 
E:  Oh ! 
E:  But  I am put  I am putting the beginning of the meeting . 
E:  in  on there . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  And the Seat is this number ? 
E:  " use only " 
E:  Oh . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Ah ! 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  What  
E:  uh - huh . 
E:  What i 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  And for simple for  for me ? 
E:  Is mean my native language Spanish  Spanish ? 
E:  eh The original is the center of Spain and the <laugh> beca 
E:  Because is different , the Span - uh  the Spanish language from the  the north of Spain , of the south , of the west and the  
E:  But . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  i at this  <laugh> in that side  in that side of the  the paper . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  A techno 
E:  Is different . Is different . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  And  is  in those  
E:  And if you put  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  If you put eh the state ? 
E:  Uh - huh . Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  And  And  <inbreath> Um  And usually here  people here know what is their kind of mmm lang English language ? 
E:  eh here Is easy for people to know ? 
E:  because you have  
E:  N m Yeah . 
E:  Or Boston ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  style . 

E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Huh . 
E:  South Midwest ? 
E:  Southern Midland . 

E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 

E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Hmm ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Mm - hmm .
