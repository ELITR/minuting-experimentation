H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Does everyone  has everyone met Don ? 
H:  Yeah ? 
H:  OK . 
H:  Dome 
H:  yeah , it sounds like a topic of conversation . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Well , so  
H:  Right , 
H:  so , uh , actually the way Jose is wearing his is  is c  correct . 
H:  The good way . 
H:  So you want to  
H:  Yeah , th that 's good . 
H:  So it 's towards the corner of your mouth so that breath sounds don't get on it . 
H:  And then just sort of about , uh , a thumb or  a thumb and a half away from your  from your mouth . 
H:  And this one isn't very adjustable , 
H:  so this about as good as I can get 
H:  cuz it 's a fixed boom . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Well the onl the only problem with that is right now , um , some of the Jimlets aren't working . 
H:  The little  the boxes under the table . 
H:  And so , w Uh , I 've only been able to find three jacks that are working . 
H:  So  
H:  I  I 'm not sure I 'm follow . 
H:  Say that again ? 
H:  OK , just two . 
H:  OK . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Right . OK . 
H:  Sounds like uniformity wins . 
H:  Well  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yep . 
H:  Couple times . 
H:  What can I say . 
H:  Oh , really ? 
H:  Yeah , I 'm not surprised . 
H:  I mean , " Baaah ! " 
H:  Yeah , it 's an advantage when you don't breath . 
H:  Yeah , I think that the point of doing the close talking mike is to get a good quality signal . We 're not doing research on close talking mikes . 
H:  So we might as well get it as uniform as we can . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  So I think just do a field trip at some point . 
H:  Yep . 
H:  Yep . 
H:  So , as  as I said , we 'll do a field trip and see if we can get all of the same mike that 's more comfortable than  than these things , which I think are horrible . 
H:  So . 
H:  And , you know , we 're researchers , 
H:  so we all have big heads . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Oh , I should 've  
H:  I was just thinking I should have invited him to this meeting . 
H:  I forgot to do it . 
H:  So . 
H:  Sorry . 
H:  HCC . 
H:  Oh , he 's doing array mikes . 
H:  Yeah , that would be neat . 
H:  Well Dan  Dan had worked on that . Dan Ellis , 
H:  yeah . 
H:  So that  that 's the cross - correlation stuff , was  was doing b beam - forming . 
H:  No , 
H:  he did start on it . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Oh , that 's another cl cue , 
H:  that 's true . 
H:  Or who talks the loudest . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Oh , so just morning . 
H:  Is he involved in  
H:  Ach !  I 'm blanking on the name of the project . 
H:  NIST has  has done a big meeting room  instrumented meeting room with video and microphone arrays , and very elaborate software . 
H:  Is  is he the one working on that ? 
H:  OK . 
H:  OK . 
H:  I had read some papers that looked like they had already done some work . 
H:  Hmm . 
H:  Oh , cuz what  what I had read was , uh , they had a uh very large amount of software infrastructure for coordinating all this , 
H:  both in terms of recording and also live room where you 're interacting  the participants are interacting with the computer , and with the video , and lots of other stuff . 
H:  So . 
H:  OK . Well  
H:  Alright . 
H:  Xerox . 
H:  And then they have little ones too 
H:  but I mean  but they don't have our block of wood , 
H:  right ? 
H:  It 's  it 's just a lot of infrastructure that for our particular purpose we felt we didn't need to set up . 
H:  That 's right , I mean if someone  if someone came in and said we really want to do it , 
H:  I mean , we don't care . 
H:  That would be fine , 
H:  Buy more disk space . 
H:  I usually do a mix . 
H:  Well their software infrastructure had a very elaborate design for plugging in filters , and mixers , and all sorts of processing . 
H:  So that they can do stuff in real time and not save out each channel individually . 
H:  So it was , uh  
H:  You mean to  to actually get a microphone array and do that ? 
H:  And video and  
H:  Well , but I think we need a researcher here who 's interested in it . To push it along . 
H:  And we actually only have fifteen . 
H:  One of them 's  
H:  Details . 
H:  But fifteen , not sixteen . 
H:  And y it 'd certainly gets skew . 
H:  Just  
H:  Or a hundred thirty - two . 
H:  Yes , absolutely . But it 's exactly the same problem , 
H:  that you have an infrastructure problem , 
H:  you have a problem with people not wanting to be video taped , 
H:  and you have the problem that no one who 's currently involved in the project is really hot to do it . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  I know . 
H:  Yep . 
H:  Oh ! Probably not . 
H:  Has Don  have you s did you si 
H:  I thought you did actually . 
H:  Didn't you read a digit string ? 
H:  Yeah , and you  and you signed a form . 
H:  I 'm pretty sure . 
H:  Well I 'll  I 'll get another one before the end of the meeting . 
H:  Thank you . 
H:  Well I can't , 
H:  I 'm wired in . 
H:  or 
H:  Yep . 
H:  It 's pretty good . 
H:  Hmm . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Is  is  
H:  Is ATLAS the  his annotated transcription graph stuff ? 
H:  I don't remember the acronym . 
H:  The  the one  the  what I think you 're referring to , they  they have this concept of an an annotated transcription graph representation . 
H:  And that 's basically what I based the format that I did  
H:  I based it on their work almost directly , in combination with the TEI stuff . 
H:  And so it 's very , very similar . 
H:  And so it 's  it 's a data representation and a set of tools for manipulating transcription graphs of various types . 
H:  Yep . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Nu - it 's mostly  it 's for their speech recognition products , 
H:  that they 've hired these people to do . 
H:  Well they  they do send it out 
H:  but my understanding is that that 's all this company does is transcriptions for IBM for their speech product . 
H:  So most of it 's ViaVoice , people reading their training material for that . 
H:  Yep , 
H:  exactly . 
H:  Yep . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Well , but that 's OK , because , you know , you 'll do all them and then combine them . 
H:  No , no . We 're talking about close talking , not the  not the desktop . 
H:  I sure hope so . 
H:  It 'd be really foolish to do otherwise . 
H:  One side . 
H:  But I mean we had this  we 've had this discussion many times . 
H:  And the answer is we don't actually know the answer because we haven't tried both ways . 
H:  So . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Well I think that  that might change if you wanted really fine time markings . 
H:  So . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Oh , I 'd be curious to  to look at that . 
H:  They also all have h heavy accents . 
H:  The networks group meetings are all  
H:  Well we can talk about more details later . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  So , um , Liz , with  with the SRI recognizer ,  can it make use of some time marks ? 
H:  I  I guess I don't know what that means . 
H:  Adjusting . Oh . 
H:  On  Just on the marks . 
H:  Right ? 
H:  Oh , I see , 
H:  it 's for the length . 
H:  I see . 
H:  I understand . 
H:  It 's already chunked . 
H:  Uh , it 's all pretty good sized for the recognizer also . 
H:  Right . 
H:  That 's what she 's saying , is that you can't . 
H:  Got uh six sixty minutes of  
H:  Yeah , but  
H:  We 'll have to talk to Brian . 
H:  February sixteenth I think . 
H:  Oh . 
H:  We had spoken with them about it . 

H:  Which one . 
H:  Yeah , but  but just saying what the  
H:  Yep , just features . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Hmm . 
H:  Right . 
H:  You mean non - ICSI ? 
H:  Yeah , I guess you  you can try 
H:  but  
H:  The problem is so much of their stuff is confidential . 
H:  It would be very hard for them . 
H:  Well , tha I think that 's her point . 
H:  And I think , uh , if we could get  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  You might give them a free lunch . 
H:  But , um , 
H:  it would be nice if we got someone other than me who knew how to set it up and could do the recording 
H:  so u I didn't have to do it each time . 
H:  OK , next week  you 're going to do it all . 
H:  It 's not that hard . 
H:  So . 
H:  Well , I don't know if they meet regularly or not 
H:  but they are no longer recording . 
H:  Um , ugh , what was his name ? 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  When  with him gone , it sorta trickled off . 
H:  They  and they stopped  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yep . 
H:  Well he was sort of my contact , 
H:  so I just need to find out who 's running it now . 
H:  So . 
H:  Who 's willing to get recorded and distributed ? 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Of beeps , 
H:  yeah . 
H:  No that 's  
H:  Legal . 
H:  Well  
H:  Well if he meant and non - British I think we have zero . 
H:  British is English ? 
H:  I bet he meant native speaking American . 
H:  So , why would he care ? 
H:  I wonder if we have any . 
H:  Maybe . 
H:  Maybe . 
H:  And maybe there are a few of  with us where it was  
H:  you know , Dan wasn't there 
H:  and before Jose started coming , 
H:  and  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  RASTA . PLP . 
H:  RASTA . PLP . 
H:  Well , like computer science . 
H:  That  
H:  That 's  
H:  Got a ticket . 
H:  Well I had asked some  some of the students at the business school . 
H:  I could  
H:  The Business school . 
H:  Uh , the business school might be good . 
H:  I actually spoke with some students up there 
H:  and they  they  they expressed willingness back when they thought they would be doing more stuff with speech . 
H:  But when they lost interest in speech they also  stopped answering my email about other stuff , 
H:  so . 
H:  We should probably bleep that out . 
H:  Th - that 's not what we want . 
H:  That 's right . 
H:  " Please throw everything in that direction . " 
H:  Padded cell . 
H:  There was a dorm room at Tech that , uh , someone had coated the walls and the ceiling , and , uh , the floor with mattresses . 
H:  The entire room . 
H:  Uh , Liz wanted to talk about methods of improving accuracy by doing pre - processing . 
H:  Yep . 
H:  I am not sure how much that 's an issue with the close talking mikes , 
H:  but who knows ? 
H:  Right . 
H:  e I bet with the lapel mike there 's plenty , uh , room acoustic 
H:  but I I think the rest is cross - talk . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  So I  I think it 's just , 
H:  yeah , what you said , cross - talk . 
H:  Mm - hmm .
