C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Um , yeah . 
C:  What  what I 'm doing right now is I 'm trying to include some information about which channel , uh , there 's some speech in . 
C:  But that 's not working at the moment . 
C:  I 'm just trying to do this by comparing energies , uh  normalizing energies and comparing energies of the different channels . 
C:  And 
C:  so to  to give the transcribers some information in which channel there 's  there 's speech in addition to  to the thing we  we did 
C:  now which is just , uh , speech - nonspeech detection on the mixed file . 
C:  So I 'm  I 'm relying on  on the segmentation of the mixed file 
C:  but I 'm  I 'm trying to subdivide the speech portions into different portions if there is some activity in  in different channels . 
C:  But  
C:  Yeah .
