A:  I was thinking maybe we should just cough into the microphone and see if they can't  th see if they can handle it . 
A:  Yeah , I think I got my mike on . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Let 's see . 
A:  Mmm  Doesn't , uh  It should be the other way . 
A:  Yeah , now it 's on . 
A:  We are all switched on , yeah . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Yeah , where are those constructors defined ? 
A:  Grep for it ? 
A:  That function automatically generates an initialized XML structure ? 
A:  It 's mystery functions . 
A:  Well , it just automatically initializes things that are common , right ? 
A:  So it 's just a shorthand . 
A:  A " not a number " is a value . Awesome . 
A:  So then , whatever takes this M - three - L is what actually changes the state , 
A:  not the  
A:  Yeah , OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  With sugge yeah , suggested improvements 
A:  and  
A:  Mmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Then the scope of this is beyond  Approach and Vis - or Vista . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  So what would  
A:  OK . 
A:  Uh , yeah . 
A:  but I 'm just  
A:  But the  
A:  Yeah , OK . 
A:  So I just  
A:  this XML stuff here just has to do with Source - Path - Goal type stuff , 
A:  in terms of traveling through Heidelberg . 
A:  Or travel , specifically . 
A:  So , but this O Is the domain greater than that ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Could you give me an example of a reference problem ? 
A:  so  so l I can make it more concrete ? 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Or the re the restaurant where they wear lederhosen ? 
A:  Or is that  
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Trying to  
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  You can put the microphone in your pocket . 
A:  I was envying you and your pocket 
A:  cause I don't have one . 
A:  exactly 
A:  OK 
A:  Asymptotically . 
A:  U 
A:  yeah , yeah . 
A:  So , really , i What a  A Noisy - OR seems to kind of  " neural - net - acize " these Bayes - nets ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , my point was more that we just  eh  
A:  With the neural net , right , eh , things come in , you have a function that combines them 
A:  and  
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah , hash on object name to , you know , uh , the probabilities or whatever . 
A:  We could just steal the classes in JavaBayes and then interface to them with our own code . 
A:  Well , it depends on  
A:  Well , I was j 
A:  OK . Yeah . 
A:  Well , no , but that just means there 's a protocol , 
A:  right ? 
A:  That you could  
A:  Well , no , but  I mean  What I uh the  
A:  So you could have four different Bayes - nets that you 're running , 
A:  and then run your own  write your own function that would take the output of those four , 
A:  and make your own " G function " , is what I was saying . 
A:  Well , then you 'd have to break all of your Bayes - nets into smaller Bayes - nets , 
A:  with all the  
A:  Yeah , but I 'm just  
A:  I was thinking maybe we should just cough into the microphone and see if they can't  th see if they can handle it .
