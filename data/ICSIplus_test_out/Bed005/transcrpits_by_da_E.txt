E:  Sure . 
E:  What did you end up having to do ? 
E:  I mean , wha Was there anything  interesting about it at all ? 
E:  or are we gonna see that ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Interesting parser property . 
E:  I see . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Today 
E:  OK . 
E:  And the  t and the time , right ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  True . 
E:  S 
E:  The former end g " 
E:  Oh , I see . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . Key words , e basically . 
E:  So it really is key word matching , basically . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Tonight ? 
E:  This  this evening ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Huh . 
E:  S 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  It 's a match . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Right  Yeah . 
E:  Uniquely . 
E:  Oh . it 's just that  that the goals are g very different to cases  
E:  So we had this problem last year when we first thought about this domain , actually , 
E:  was that <breath> most of the things we talked about are our story understanding . 
E:  Uh , we 're gonna have a short discourse 
E:  and <breath> the person talking is trying to , I don't know , give you a statement and tell you something . 
E:  And here , <breath> it 's th 
E:  Yea - eh  y Yeah , I guess so . 
E:  And then here , y you are j uh , the person is getting information 
E:  and they or may not be following some larger plan , <breath> you know , that we have to recognize or , you know , infer . 
E:  And th th the  their discourse patterns probably <mike noise> don't follo follow quite as many <breath> logical connec 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  M 
E:  Right . Cuz for a while we were thinking , " well , how can we change the , <breath> um , data to sort of illicit tha <laugh> illicit , um , actions that are more like what we are used to ? " 
E:  But obviously we would rather , you know , try to figure out what 's  what 's , you know  
E:  Yep . 
E:  Mmm  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  It was a quick one , huh ? 
E:  They have clips ! 
E:  Huh . 
E:  New terminology ? 
E:  I haven't heard that before . 
E:  I  
E:  yeah . 
E:  I  I think so , yeah . 
E:  Yeah , @ @ . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  So , you don't need da data enough to cover  uh , nearly as much stuff . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Sure .
