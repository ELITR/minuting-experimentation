D:  Man ! 
D:  And we already got the crash out of the way . 
D:  It did crash , so I feel much better , earlier . 
D:  OK , so um . 
D:  I did collect an agenda . 
D:  So I 'm gonna go first . 
D:  Mwa - ha - ha ! 
D:  It shouldn't take too long . 
D:  Um , so we 're pretty much out of digits . 
D:  We 've gone once through the set . 
D:  Um , so the only thing I have to do 
D:  Yeah , that 's right . 
D:  so I  I just have to go through them 
D:  and uh pick out the ones that have problems , 
D:  and either correct them or have them re - read . 
D:  So we probably have like four or five more forms to be read , to be once through the set . 
D:  I 've also extracted out about an hour 's worth . 
D:  We have about two hours worth . 
D:  I extracted out about an hour 's worth 
D:  which are the f digits with  for which whose speaker have speaker forms , 
D:  have filled out speaker forms . 
D:  Not everyone 's filled out a speaker form . 
D:  So I extracted one for speakers who have speaker forms 
D:  and for meetings in which the " key " file and the transcript files are parsable . 
D:  Some of the early key files , it looks like , were done by hand , 
D:  and so they 're not automatically parsable 
D:  and I have to go back and fix those . 
D:  So what that means is we have about an hour of transcribed digits that we can play with . 
D:  Um , 
D:  Liz  
D:  Yep , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  Yes , absolutely . 
D:  So it 's just a question of a little hand - editing of some files 
D:  and then waiting for more people to turn in their speaker forms . 
D:  I have this web - based speaker form , 
D:  and I sent mail to everyone who hadn't filled out a speaker form , 
D:  and they 're slowly s trickling in . 
D:  It 's for labeling the extracted audio files . 
D:  By speaker ID and microphone type . 
D:  No , I spoke with Jane about that 
D:  and we sort of decided that it 's probably not an issue that  
D:  We edit out any of the errors anyway . Right ? 
D:  So the there are no errors in the digits , 
D:  you 'll always read the string correctly . 
D:  So I can't imagine why anyone would care . 
D:  So the other topic with digits is uh , 
D:  Liz would like to elicit different prosodics , 
D:  and so we tried last week with them written out in English . 
D:  And it just didn't work at all 
D:  because no one grouped them together . 
D:  So it just sounded like many many more lines instead of anything else . 
D:  So in conversations with Liz and uh Jane we decided that if you wrote them out as numbers instead of words it would elicit more phone number , social security number - like readings . 
D:  The problem with that is it becomes numbers instead of digits . 
D:  When I look at this , that first line is " sixty one , sixty two , eighteen , eighty six , ten . " 
D:  Um , and so the question is does anyone care ? 
D:  Um , I 've already spoken with Liz and she feels that , correct me if I 'm wrong , that for her , connected numbers is fine , 
D:  as opposed to connected digits . 
D:  Um , I think two hours is probably fine for a test set , 
D:  but it may be a little short if we actually wanna do training and adaptation and all that other stuff . 
D:  Yeah , the  the  
D:  Six dash one , you mean ? 
D:  Right . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  So we could just , uh , put in the instructions " read them as digits " . 
D:  How about " O " versus " zero " ? 
D:  Just let them read it how they read it . 
D:  OK so  so I can just add to the instructions to read it as digits 
D:  not as connected numbers . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Oh yeah , absolutely , 
D:  cognitively it 's much easier . 
D:  OK . And is the spacing alright or do you think there should be more space between digits and groups ? 
D:  Or is that alright ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  And I think there are about ten different gouping patterns 
D:  isn't that right , Liz ? 
D:  That we did . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
D:  I think that uh trying to duplicate , spending too much effort trying to duplicate the existing TI - digits probably isn't too worthwhile 
D:  because the recording situation is so different . 
D:  It 's gonna be very hard to be comparable . 
D:  Yeah I mean read versus not . 
D:  Well , and not just that , 
D:  I mean the uh the corpus itself . 
D:  I mean , we 're collecting it in a read digit in a particular list , 
D:  and I 'm sure that they 're doing more specific stuff . 
D:  I mean if I remember correctly it was like postman reading zipcodes and things like that . 
D:  I thought so . 
D:  Was it read ? 
D:  Oh , I may well be . 
D:  I haven't ever listened to TI - digits . 
D:  So I don't really know how it compares . 
D:  But  but regardless it 's gonna  it 's hard to compare cross - corpus . 
D:  So . 
D:  And which group appears is picked randomly , and what the numbers are are picked randomly . 
D:  So unlike the previous one , which I d simply replicated TI - digits , this is generated randomly . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah all we have for some people is digits . 
D:  Oh , you 're not . 
D:  Oh I see . 
D:  Oh yeah that 's true , absolutely . 
D:  That would be interesting to see whether that helps . 
D:  Do you think that would help adapting on  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I have a real problem with that . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Same  same acoustics , 
D:  same microphone , 
D:  same channel . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Good . 
D:  Yeah , we talked about that a couple times . 
D:  The  the problem I see with trying to do overlapping digits is the cognitive load . 
D:  No it 's  it 's not stupid , 
D:  it 's just  I mean , try to do it . 
D:  I mean , here , let 's try it . 
D:  You read the last line , I 'll read the first line . 
D:  So  so you read the last line , I 'll read the first line . 
D:  Oh I guess if you plug you 're ears you could do it , 
D:  but then you don't get the  the same effects . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh I see . 
D:  I guess we could try . 
D:  We could try doing some . 
D:  Well  Well OK . Well let 's try it . 
D:  You do the last line , I 'll do the first line . 
D:  O .  That 's not bad . 
D:  The poor transcribers 
D:  they 're gonna hate us . 
D:  A round . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  I think maybe if we wanted to do that we would do it as a separate session , 
D:  something like that 
D:  rather than doing it during a real meeting 
D:  and you know , do two people at a time 
D:  then three people at a time and things like that . 
D:  So . 
D:  See  see what Dan thinks . 
D:  Yeah , right . 
D:  I thought this was gonna be fast . 
D:  Oh well . 
D:  Not after I " eight " though . 
D:  Uh . 
D:  Nein ! 
D:  You have to be German , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  Oh ! 
D:  I think for something like that we 'd be better off doing like uh TIMIT . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  OK , are we done with digits ? 
D:  Um , 
D:  We have ASR results from Liz , 
D:  transcript status from Jane , 
D:  and disk space and storage formats from Don . 
D:  Does  do we have any prefer preference on which way we wanna  we wanna go ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Um , why don't you , if you have a hard copy , why don't you email it to the list . 
D:  Oh it 's in the paper . 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK then , it 's already been mailed . 
D:  Horrible ? 
D:  And someone said " oh " in the front  in the middle . 
D:  I noticed that Chuck was wearing the lapel a lot . 
D:  Probably how you wear it  wore it I would guess . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Right . 
D:  And he said , " Lots lots lots lots . " 
D:  Well that 's with the hand stuff . 
D:  But how would you do that automatically ? 
D:  I mean that that 's the sort of thing that you would do . 
D:  So . 
D:  Um , 
D:  I also wanted to say I have done all this chopping up of digits , 
D:  so I have some naming conventions that we should try to agree on . 
D:  So let 's do that off - line , 
D:  we don't need to do it during the meeting . 
D:  And  and I have scripts that will extract it out from " key " files 
D:  and  and do all the naming automatically , 
D:  so you don't have to do it by hand . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah , names  names in the  names to I Ds , 
D:  so you 
D:  and it does all sorts of matches 
D:  because the way people filled out names is different on every single file 
D:  so it does a very fuzzy sort of match . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  So th I now have a script that you can just say basically look up Morgan , 
D:  and it will give you his ID . 
D:  So . 
D:  Um , 
D:  alright . 
D:  Do we  
D:  Don , you had disk space and storage formats . 
D:  Is that something we need to talk about at the meeting , 
D:  or should you just talk with Chuck at some other time ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Entropy coding . 
D:  So . 
D:  And I assume half of it is scratch and half of it is  ? 
D:  Probably , yeah . 
D:  That doesn't matter . 
D:  You can access it from anywhere in ICSI . N  
D:  N  
D:  Slash N slash machine name , slash X A in all likelihood . 
D:  Um , so the  the only question is how much of it  
D:  The distinction between scratch and non - scratch is whether it 's backed up or not . 
D:  So what you wanna do is use the scratch for stuff that you can regenerate . 
D:  So , 
D:  the stuff that isn't backed up is not a big deal 
D:  because disks don't crash very frequently , 
D:  as long as you can regenerate it . 
D:  Then put it all on scratch 
D:  because we 're  ICSI is  is bottlenecked by backup . 
D:  So we wanna put  
D:  It just depends on your tools . 
D:  I mean , because it 's not backed up and it 's just on scratch , if your sc tools can't take shortened format , I would leave them expanded , 
D:  so you don't have to unshorten them every single time you wanna do anything . 
D:  Yeah , as I said , since that 's  it 's regeneratable , what I would do is take  downsample it , 
D:  and compress it however you 're e the SRI recognizer wants to take it in . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  And that 's the whole point about the naming conventions 
D:  is that you could run all the English speaking , 
D:  all the native speakers , 
D:  and all the non - native speakers , 
D:  and all the men , and all the women . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  " That 's just not right , man . " 
D:  The  the point  
D:  So  so s For example , what if you wanted to run  run all the native speakers . 
D:  Right , so if  if you did it that way you would have to generate a program that looks in the database somewhere , 
D:  extracts out the language , 
D:  finds the time - marks for that particular one , 
D:  do it that way . 
D:  The way they 're doing it , you have that already extracted 
D:  and it 's embedded in the file name . 
D:  And so , you know , you just say  
D:  y so you just say you know " asterisk E asterisk dot wave " , and you get what you want . 
D:  Rather than doing seeks through the file . 
D:  This is all just temporary access , 
D:  so I don't  I think  it 's all just  
D:  It 's fine . 
D:  You know . 
D:  Fine to do it however is convenient . 
D:  Yeah and they don't . 
D:  Two gig ? 
D:  Yes you can . 
D:  I th 
D:  w The transcribers didn't have any problem with that 
D:  did they Jane ? 
D:  They loaded  they loaded the long long files into X Waves . 
D:  Are you talking about Transcriber or X Waves ? 
D:  Because  because i we used X Waves to do the digits . 
D:  And they were loading the full mixed files then , 
D:  and it didn't seem to be any problem . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Seemed really fast . 
D:  Well regardless , it 's  
D:  and , it 's no problem , right ? 
D:  Because it 's not backed up . 
D:  So we just  
D:  If we don't have a spare disk sitting around we go out and we buy ourselves an eighty gigabyte drive 
D:  and make it all scratch space . 
D:  You know , it 's not a big deal . 
D:  So remind me afterward 
D:  and I 'll  and we 'll look at your disk and see where to put stuff . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Each partition . 
D:  And you wanna use , either XA or scratch . 
D:  Well X question mark , 
D:  anything starting with X is scratch . 
D:  Two digits , right , 
D:  XA , XB , XC . 
D:  OK ? 
D:  Jane ? 
D:  So on the fifth page , seven down  
D:  And then you gloss them ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And so  so your list here , are these ones that actually occurred in the meetings ? 
D:  Whew ! 
D:  We are acronym - loaded . 
D:  Except right there . 
D:  Well , 
D:  but they have the gloss . 
D:  You have the gloss form 
D:  so you always replace it . 
D:  If that 's how  what you wanna do . 
D:  Um  
D:  Can  ca 
D:  So a are we done with acronyms ? 
D:  Cuz I had a question on what  what this meant . 
D:  Oh I 'm sorry . 
D:  A comment , basically . 
D:  They 're impulsive . 
D:  Well the " QUAL " can be  The " QUAL " is applying to the left . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  " While laughing " . 
D:  Oh good . 
D:  So it 's a small list . 
D:  That  that 's known as " found data " . 
D:  Yeah . It 's much easier . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Ah ! 

D:  Yes , that 's right . 
D:  We 're gonna have a big problem when we talk about that . 
D:  In Monty Python you say " argh " a lot . 
D:  So . 
D:  Well , or if you 're a C programmer . 
D:  You say arg - C and arg - V all the time . 
D:  It does . 
D:  Ah ! 
D:  Maybe he died while dictating . 
D:  Eh ? 
D:  You mean just the single letter " a "  as in the particle ? 
D:  Article . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  I 'm just  these poor transcribers , they 're gonna hate this meeting . 
D:  Them Canadians . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Oh I see . 
D:  I didn't get that , 
D:  OK . 
D:  Yeah , it 's good , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  And just listen to them ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Performance art , 
D:  just extract them all . 
D:  Oh I see . 
D:  o 
D:  How about question mark ? 
D:  Oh . 
D:  So they  so it 's " PLP ? " 
D:  Yeah , P - make is  
D:  That 's a good one . 
D:  That 's correct . 
D:  I know ! 
D:  I  I was saying that I think a lot of them are the Networks meeting . 
D:  I see a few . 
D:  Although I see  I see plenty of uh 
D:  Yeah , that 's pretty close . 
D:  Count . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah , I wonder what it is . 
D:  Oh I 'm sure we 've said XML more than five times . 
D:  Yes , it 's very bad . 
D:  Yes . 
D:  Yeah  that 's right . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  And that 's an underestimate 
D:  cuz they 're 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah , we 'll have to look at it you know . 
D:  So I 'll just  I was just looking at the bottom of page three there , 
D:  is that " to be " or " not to be " . 
D:  OK anyways , sorry . 
D:  " Try to stay on topic , Adam . " 
D:  OK so , um , on some of these QUALs , 
D:  are they really QUALs , 
D:  or are they glosses ? 
D:  So like there 's a " QUAL TCL " . 
D:  Uh 
D:  Oh I see , I see . 
D:  So it 's not gloss . 
D:  OK , I see . 
D:  It wasn't said " TCL " . 
D:  Of course . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  We 'll probably add it to the language model . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  What did I say ? 
D:  Well both . 
D:  We can go on lan lan add it to both dictionary and language model . 
D:  Well " tickle " was pronounced " tickle " . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  It 's pronounced the same  it 's pronounced the same as the verb . 
D:  So I think it 's the language model that makes it different . 
D:  Oh I see . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
D:  And  and you 'll ha you 'll have to do it sychronously . 
D:  Right , so y so , whoever 's creating the new models , will have to also go through the transcripts and change them synchronously . 
D:  You can correct it . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  These are so funny to read . 
D:  You add it to the dictionary . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  It 's this , " rrre - rrre - rrre " . 
D:  It was me . 
D:  A lot of these are me 
D:  the  the " beep is said with a high pit high pitch and lengthening . " 
D:  That was the  I was imitating uh , beeping out  
D:  What I meant was " beep " . 
D:  I guess so . 
D:  Anyway . 
D:  So they 're vocalization , 
D:  glosses . 
D:  Um , 
D:  So on  
D:  On the glosses for numbers , 
D:  it seems like there are lots of different ways it 's being done . 
D:  There 's a  
D:  " Ooo - ooo . " 
D:  " NUMS " , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  So what 's to the left of these ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  OK , that 's what I was asking . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Point FIVE , yeah . 
D:  Good . 
D:  OK now , the other example is , in the glosses right there , 
D:  " gloss one one one dash one three zero " . 
D:  What  what 's to the left of that ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  Good . 
D:  Label it . 
D:  Right 
D:  Master copies of superset . 
D:  Good . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Well , the numbers ? 
D:  We might wanna  just a separate tag that says it 's read . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  OK ? 
D:  Are we done ? 
D:  Oh , I guess we 're not done . 
D:  Well  
D:  We did that for one meeting , right , 
D:  so you have that data don't you ? 
D:  All ten hours ? 
D:  Great . 
D:  Well it 's just we 're  missing tea . 
D:  So . 
D:  Oop ! 
D:  Man !
