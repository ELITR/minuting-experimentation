C:  OK . 
C:  Dueling digits . 
C:  Round . 
C:  Nein ! 
C:  You scream it . 
C:  It only sounds w good when you scream it , though . 
C:  So . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Yeah , where you were sitting probably affected it . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Alright . 
C:  You 've compiled the list of , uh , speaker names ? 
C:  Not names , 
C:  but I Ds . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Cool . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  That was my fault . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Then disregard it then . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Um , I had some general questions just about the compression algorithms of shortening waveforms 
C:  and I don't know exactly who to ask . 
C:  I thought that maybe you would be the  the person to talk to . 
C:  So , is it a lossless compression  when you compress , 
C:  so  
C:  It just uses entropy coding ? 
C:  OK . 
C:  So , I mean , I guess my question would be is 
C:  I just got this new eighteen gig drive installed . 
C:  Um , yeah , 
C:  which is  
C:  I 'm not exactly sure how they partitioned it . 
C:  But um , 
C:  yeah , I don't know what 's typical here , 
C:  but um , 
C:  it 's local though , 
C:  so  
C:  But  
C:  OK . 
C:  Alright . 
C:  How do you do that ? 
C:  Eighteen . 
C:  Oh I see . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Alright , I did know that . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Right . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  I mean all of this stuff can be regenerated , 
C:  it 's just a question  
C:  OK . 
C:  Yeah , I guess  
C:  Right . 
C:  OK . 
C:  So , I mean , I guess th the other question was then , should we shorten them , downsample them , or keep them in their original form ? 
C:  Um  
C:  Right . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Do you think that 'd be OK ? 
C:  To downsample them ? 
C:  OK . 
C:  Yeah , I guess the only argument against downsampling is to preserve just the original files in case we want to experiment with different filtering techniques . 
C:  Right . 
C:  r 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah those are gonna be kept . 
C:  Right . 
C:  OK . Alright . 
C:  I mean , I could just u do a DU on it right ? 
C:  And just see which  how much is on each  
C:  So . 
C:  OK . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I replace the " cuz " with " because " if it 's glossed . 
C:  And  
C:  Right . 
C:  It 's like the z Zapruder Film . 
C:  Jane , can I ask you a question ? 
C:  What 's that very last one correspond to ? 
C:  I don't even know how to pronounce that . 
C:  Uh , is that like someone 's like burning or some such thing ? 
C:  Like their hair 's on fire ? 
C:  Uh , it looks like that . 
C:  Right . 
C:  But that 's not really like  
C:  No one really says " argh , " you know , 
C:  it 's not  
C:  Well , 
C:  there 's another  there 's another word error . 
C:  Cha - ching . 
C:  Oh yeah ? 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  That 's true . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  All the " EH " 's I 've seen have been like that . 
C:  They 've been like " eh " 
C:  like that have bee has been transcribed to " EH " . 
C:  And sometimes it 's stronger , 
C:  like " eeh "  which is like closer to " EH " . 
C:  But . 
C:  I know . 
C:  We should go off - line . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , we don't have that many acronyms comparatively in this meeting . 
C:  It 's not so bad . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  That 's not bad . 
C:  There 's a lot of " OK 's " . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Is this after  like did you do some uh replacements for all the different form of " OK " to this ? 
C:  OK . 
C:  Although , what 's  there 's one with a slash after it . 
C:  That 's kind of disturbing . 
C:  Anyway . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  That 's alright . 
C:  I 'm just pointing that out . 
C:  There 's  
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Sh - shouldn't it be " QUAL TICKLE " or something ? 
C:  Like  it 's not  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh I see . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  It 's not something you wanna replace  with 
C:  but  
C:  It 's just disturbing . 
C:  That 's great . 
C:  Um  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  You need a lot of  
C:  You need a lot of qualification Adam . 
C:  Subtext . 
C:  Yeah , that was in the first meeting . 
C:  Right . 
C:  There 's a " numbers " tag  
C:  I 'm sorry I 'm  I didn't follow that last thing . 
C:  Right . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  So , uh , have those  e e the vis the ten hours that have been transcribed already , have those been channelized ? 
C:  And I know  I 've seen @ @  I 've seen they 've been channelized , 
C:  but 
C:  have they uh  have they been  has the time  have the time markings been adjusted , uh , p on a per channel  
C:  So , 
C:  I guess , I mean , I don't know if we should talk about this now , or not , 
C:  but I 
C:  Yeah , I know . 
C:  No , but I mean my question is like should I wait until all of those are processed , and channelized , 
C:  like the time markings are adjusted before I do all the processing , 
C:  and we start like branching off into the  into the  our layer of uh transcripts . 
C:  Right . 
C:  OK . 
C:  No I know  I know that adjusting those things are gonna  is gonna make it better . 
C:  I mean I 'm sure about that , 
C:  but do you have like a time frame when you can expect like all of it to be done , 
C:  or when you expect them to finish it , or  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , I don't doubt it . 
C:  Um , so . 
C:  Yeah . I 'm doing it myself . 
C:  I mean i if the time markings aren't different across channels , 
C:  like the channelized version really doesn't have any more information . 
C:  So , I was just  I mean , originally I had done before like the channelized versions were coming out . 
C:  Um , 
C:  and so it 's a question of like what  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Right . 
C:  OK . 
C:  I know . 
C:  Right . 
C:  No . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I mean as long as it can all be done automatically , I mean , then that 's not a concern . 
C:  You know , if I just have to run three scripts to extract it all and let it run on my computer for an hour and a half , or however long it takes to parse and create all the reference file , that 's not a problem . 
C:  Um , 
C:  so yeah . 
C:  As long as we 're at that point . 
C:  And I know exactly like what the steps will work  what 's going on , in the editing process , 
C:  so . 
C:  OK .
