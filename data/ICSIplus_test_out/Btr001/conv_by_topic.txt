F:  let 's see , so , 
F:  um , as you know , the meeting today is to , um , 
F:  @ @  benefit from your involvement in the data , all the things that  that you 've been exposed to in these many months . 
F:  And um , I just  I just put down some ideas  you 've seen some of this in the email that I sent out earlier . 
A:  <sniff> 
B:  <sniff> 
F:  And , um , 
C:  Mmm . 
F:  none of these  these are not obligatory toca topics but they 're just things that I thought might be useful to discuss , just as a way of organizing the discussion . 
F:  But if there are other topics you 'd like to discuss that 'd be great too . 
F:  Alright , so um , 
F:  it struck me that , um , 
F:  you know , we could start out with some sort of general thing about , 
F:  um , <outbreath> things that you found easier or more difficult with respect to transcribing or checking or using the interface or , 
F:  uh , dealing with the time bins or any aspect of that type . 
F:  And then , maybe talk about specifics  specifics of the data 
F:  and then maybe talk about , um , aspects of the conventions 
F:  and then the technical 
F:  set - up regarding the , um , auditory image and the interface . 
F:  OK , so , 
topic_description:	topics for meeting


F:  maybe we could just , um , start with 
F:  issues of the  @ @  the tar ti up there at the top of  
F:  What  what did you find easiest or more s most difficult about transcribing the data ? 
D:  <mouth> OK . 
F:  Yeah .  
E:  <mike noise> 
C:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	transcribing issues


D:  One thing that I remember being really difficult at the beginning and it got easier as we went along was , um , acronyms and technical terms . 
D:  Um , because there are so many and  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  it 's a field that 
D:  I 'm not really l very  
D:  I don't know , I don't know very much about this kind of stuff  computers and 
D:  speech recognition . I 've never taken 
D:  classes on it or anything , so . I found that really hard . 
D:  And 
D:  I remember transcribing and having a bunch of  You know , every five words there 'd be something I 'd put in parentheses cuz I didn't know what it was . 
D:  So . 
F:  Parentheses , meaning uncertainty . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , but it 's definitely gotten easier because 
C:  Uh - huh . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  the same things keep getting repeated , once you learn what it is , and you can say , " OK 
D:  I know what they meant by that " or " I know how to spell that now " or something like that . 
F:  <mouth> Is  
D:  And the Cast of Characters that you put up on the Web was helpful 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  also . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  OK , good . 
F:  It 's sorta like a foreign language , isn't it ? It 's basically  you have these 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  <laugh> specialized terms for things that I didn't know n needed specialized terms . <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> @ @  
D:  Especially when describing like the set - up in this room , also , and the different types of mikes . 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  I don't know . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And it 's hard to tell when people are talking relatively quickly . They just 
D:  glide over some of the letters . They don't fully pronounce them . So you can't really tell even if you listen to it ten times 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  @ @  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . I usually put most of the acronyms in parentheses cuz I think it 's 
D:  what it is . 
E:  sort of safe , cuz people can  
D:  Uh - huh . 
E:  people can say their acronyms really fast and 
E:  I figure that even if I think I know exactly what letters they said , 
E:  it 's probably best to put them in parentheses cuz I probably don't . 
F:  That 's not a bad strategy . I mean , i it 's  it 's true that I  I always check the parentheses at the last stage and those are pretty easy to clear , in terms of when they 're in context . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Right . 
B:  Hmm . 
F:  Not a bad strategy . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
D:  <mike noise> 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  Some of them just occurred over and over the  again , so like  PDA . 
F:  <sniff> 
F:  Yes . 
C:  Like that 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  got  got easy . There  there was a  a bunch of them that , uh  
F:  I suspect in context . 
C:  They just kept getting repeated often and often you know , over and over , so . Just got better , but . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  And also when you have the  the juxtaposition of PDA and PZM  
F:  <laugh> 
F:  then , you know , you  @ @  in context you can tell which one it 's  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  is probably likely to be the one that you had .

D:  Even though I still don't know what they are . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  I mean , I assume they 're microphones of some sort , but that 's all . <sniff> 
F:  Well these here are the P Z Ms , that right there . 
D:  Oh .  
E:  Oh . 
A:  Is anybody wearing one of those awful quote Crown microphones that people used to be  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Uh you 've heard , the " crown of pain " .  <laugh> 
C:  No . 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <sniff> 
F:  No . He was telling us , uh , before the meeting that , um , 
F:  that they 're not in circulation right now , that they 're  they were unpopular . 
F:  I liked them , and Adam liked them . I thought the quality was good . 
A:  Huh . 
A:  Oh . Oh , OK . 
E:  Hmm . 
A:  Just curious . <laugh> 
F:  What  
F:  yeah , what did he say ? He said some more things about that , but I was n I was working on something else . Uh - huh . 
D:  About the microphone ? 
D:  I can't remember . I mean he 's e 
D:  <mike noise> he  he said that they were designed for 
D:  a specific sized head ? 
F:  Ah , yeah . Yeah , that 's right . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Right ? 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  And so if  if your head happened to be that size , then you were fine and if it w was bigger , then it was like 
F:  That 's right . 
A:  Oh . 
D:  torture , <laugh> 
A:  Oh . 
C:  Right . 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , it 's  
D:  o or  I don't know . 
D:  I don't know . 
F:  I liked them . And there 's the  actually , there 's the picture of the  of the Crown adjustment on the 
D:  <sniff> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  wall right there . 
E:  Hmm . 
F:  So it sort of hooks over your ears from the back . 
C:  <mouth> Right . 
D:  Oh , yeah . 
A:  Oh , OK . 
F:  Yeah , good c 
D:  Oh , it doesn't look so bad , but , I guess it depends really . 
F:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	microphones


D:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , but it definitely got much better when that change happened . 
C:  Oh yeah , it was so ea it  it became much easier . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Um , you know . 
E:  <mouth> <inbreath>  
topic_description:	transcribing issues


F:  OK , so now what about accents ? 
F:  Do you have , uh  Did you find any p 
C:  <mike noise> 
A:  They 're tough sometimes . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  <mouth> 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh OK . 
D:  I think so , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Sometimes  And actually  
F:  Sometimes <mike noise> when people lack a certain level of fluency you can ask them themselves , " What did you say there ? " and they can't tell you . 
D:  And they won't know . 
F:  S I think it 's  it 's sort of a general variability when it 's not  when you 're learning a language and you haven't gotten to a certain level . 
E:  Mmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
E:  @ @ 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  <mike noise> 
E:  <breath> 
F:  <inbreath> But she was also very low volume .  
A:  ch 
F:  And , um  and didn't say a lot . I mean , I  I  I c I totally agree . This was a  a difficult person to  to understand . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Well , the last one I did she actually said a lot , and it was kinda  it was very hard to transcribe . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  But . 
E:  You kno it was  i j I just think that , um , her fluency in English wasn't  
D:  <sniff> 
C:  <mike noise> 
E:  wa um , 
E:  wasn't very  
C:  <mike noise> 
E:  very high up there , so it was really 
A:  <breath> 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  difficult . But , I mean , I did 
E:  find that knowing Spanish helped me a lot . I could tell that a lot of things that the other transcriber had put in parentheses , I was like , " I can see how you  
F:  I can imagine that , yeah . 
C:  Hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  You were able to figure out .  
E:  how you couldn't understand that " , but I c 
A:  <mike noise> 
E:  I kn I think I know what she 's doing .  I mean , I think I know the mistake she 's making . And  
F:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  That 's really good . Yeah , cuz that 's definitely something that I wouldn't have be able to do .  
F:  Yeah , yeah .  
E:  <mouth> Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , I couldn't do it in Spanish . I 've  I found myself doing that somewhat in  in German . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  German .  
E:  In German , yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
topic_description:	accents


A:  Sometimes the German accents can get a little bit daunting . I mean , 
A:  um , 
A:  I forget who it was that I was transcribing but , it was tough to figure out what e e he was saying , 
A:  uh , at any given point in time and I would 
A:  I would just listen to it over and over and over again , going " Oh my God ! My head 's gonna explode ! " <laugh> like , 
F:  <mouth> <breath-laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  not really understanding a 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  you know ? 
A:  And so 
A:  I was getting a little frustrated because 
A:  I would put a lot of things into parentheses and then go back over it and go back over it again and still  
A:  you know , I  I like to try to clear as much up as I possibly can and 
A:  I  I just felt like 
A:  you know , with the German accents , just for me personally , those were probably the toughest 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  to get around . 
A:  Um , they weren't impossible but just  like they too the m they took the most time too . 
A:  I mean I would take maybe twice as long on a  a g given channel w with a speaker who has a German accent than somebody who 's 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Hm - hmm . 
A:  you know , a native English speaker ,  
A:  or even Asian  like , uh , speaks an En - Asian language . I found that easier . 
A:  Uh , you know . 
A:  Uh , somebody who speaks like Chinese or something , @ @ .

F:  What 's  you 've  studied some languages , which  which ones do you  are you studying ? It 's more of a Romance direction , or  ? 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <mouth> 
A:  Um , yeah  well , I studied  I mean , <laugh> I studied Old English for a while .  Um , 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  and then I 've worked with Larry Hyman on like some of the Bantu languages . 
A:  Um , and you know , I 'm also working with Ian Maddieson and he 's been doing work on 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  <clears throat> 
A:  the , uh , 
A:  like also some African languages . So I 've <mike noise> like learned a little bit . 
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  Mm - hmm , so it 's not really  you 're not really exposed to German very much . 
A:  No , I mean I sing in German . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  Ah !  Interesting . Interesting . 
A:  But   I mean , I can  I can pronounce it but I don't know any . <laugh> 
F:  Huh . 
F:  OK . 
F:  <inbreath>  
D:  That 's interesting . 
C:  Hmm - hmm . 
A:  I can do  I can pronounce a lot of languages and not actually speak them because of singing .

E:  Huh .

D:  For me I found the Spanish speakers to be the hardest . 
D:  And the German speakers I found a little bit easier , and I thought maybe that was because I had  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  I took German for a semester and I 've had exposure to German , 
A:  Oh . 
E:  <mike noise> 
D:  um , because I had a lot of friends who were really into Germany and German language and  
D:  But  
D:  And I found that I could  
D:  if they were pronouncing something in a certain way I could say , " Oh well that 's just the German way of pronouncing this " and then I figured out what they were saying . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  um , but with the Spanish speakers it was  
D:  I 've never taken Spanish , and even though I 've taken French , 
D:  and I speak French fairly well , um , I found the Spanish to be much 
D:  harder and  
D:  maybe also because 
D:  the level of fluency for the Spanish speakers was a little bit less than the level of fluency of the German speakers that are here ? I think 
A:  Oh .  
E:  If you 're talking about who I think you 're talking about  are you talking about um  
D:  There was a couple of different Spanish speakers . 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  Can we give names ? <laugh> We  w we probably shouldn't , right ? 
E:  O can  yeah . <laugh> 
F:   
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Is that  
F:  I it 's a good question . Um , 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <clears throat> 
F:  And I can't really answer that . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> OK , well there 's one in particular 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <mike noise> 
E:  who I find the hardest to transcribe of all , and it 's  d she 's Spanish . 
F:  Oh . <laugh> 
E:  So . 
C:  Oh yeah , OK . 
E:  And , um , and I 've 
E:  taken lots  I 'm fluent in Spanish , and so , um , when I  
F:  <clears throat> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <mike noise> 
E:  when I correct it , I 
E:  can t 
E:  I can tay  
E:  tell that the person who , um , transcribed it before me probably 
E:  didn't speak Spanish , cuz I can catch a lot of things like  
E:  like " No , that 's not what she said " , I can tell she 's  pronouncing  
E:  pronouncing it the way that if you read it from a  you know , a Spanish speaker 's 
E:  mind that you would , you know , pronounce it the way that you would pronounce it in Spanish . But the same time , 
E:  uh I can't get most of it , cuz I  <laugh> 
D:  Huh , that 's really interesting . 
F:  Oh , that 's fascinating . 
A:  Huh . 
E:  I find it one of  one of the hardest ones to transcribe . 
F:  Well , what you can see is that it 's  it 's her lack of  of English fluency that 's being  
topic_description:	Spanish accent more difficult


F:  Yeah , that 's  that 's really interesting . I do find that the German tends to be easier for me than s than the others because of my c exposure and interest in German . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <mike noise> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  But , um , 
E:  Right . 
A:  Maybe I haven't transcribed this Spanish woman , I don't know if I have . 
F:  I suspect you haven't because this was , uh , earlier on that we had a lot of  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  actually she  she was in the middle phase I would say . We had another Spanish speaker who was earlier who was also difficult . 
E:  Hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah , he was hard . 
C:  <mouth> Yeah . 
F:  But that 's really interesting . 
C:  He got easier though , because he started  like he would say certain words over and over , and  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And you got to know his pronunciation of them . I remember , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . So when he said " sign - yah " , 
F:  Yes . Yes yes yes . 
C:  and it sounds like " sign " , he was saying " signal " . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  Ex - 
D:  Yeah , I remember that . And  and m eh the way he said " mixed " was really strange , too . " Miss - ed " or somethi yeah . 
E:  <mouth> Oh , wow . 
B:  Ah !  <laugh> 
C:  And so I would transcribe it as " signal " . 
F:  exactly . 
A:  Huh . 
F:  " Miss - ed " .  
C:  " Meexe " , " meese " , " mees - uh " , or something . Right . 
E:  " Miss - " 
F:  Uh - huh . 
E:  <laugh> Huh . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Which was  you know , you could predict it , I mean , if you knew  
D:  He  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  That 's kinda cool . 
F:  look looked back at it , they  
D:  Especially because also in the beginning meetings , I mean , he 'd say something and no one in the meeting would understand , 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <mouth>  <inbreath> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  and then everyone would say , " What was that again ? " and then they 'd pronounce it in English and so I could 
C:  Oh , eh   
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  figure out what it was <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  that way . 
F:  Yeah , interesting . 
D:  <clears throat> Yeah . 
D:  <sniff> 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  OK . 
C:  Yeah , I mean he was never like  it was never up to like a native speaker , but like that  it got a little easier . 
F:  <clears throat> 
C:  Um  I remember in the beginning you had  and you were just sorta like  you were beating your head against the wall , but I  it go but it got better , it got better . 
D:  Like his English fluency got better ? 
D:  Oh , I went crazy . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  I  I would 
D:  skip doing that 
D:  portion for as long as I could because 
C:  Yeah , I know . Yeah .  I remember . 
D:  i 
D:  I just couldn't deal with it , and  
C:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , I had the same experience .

F:  I also wonder if  if it 's partly that Span - Spanish has 
F:  different pronunciations in different regions ? I mean , do you think that , um , 
F:  that , uh , 
F:  maybe  I mean , being  
F:  <laugh> I mean , not that I would know that . <laugh> But I just wondered if , um  
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Mmm . 
F:  <mouth> you know , she was from 
F:  probably continental Spain versus @ @  y you know other Spanish  
F:  I wonder if that would have a  
E:  <mouth>  <inbreath> 
F:  a contributing factor . 
E:  I don't know . 
A:  Oh , like the region ? 
D:  I have no idea about Spain , but I know that in France for example 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  Parisian French is much easier for me to understand cuz I learned it versus 
D:  France in like Marseilles or in the south or in like the provin like 
C:  <mouth>  <inbreath> 
A:  Sure . 
A:  Right . 
D:  <mouth> the  villages in the south , it 's really hard to understand . 
A:  Menton .  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <inbreath> 
C:  Or in Quebec , right ? In Canada it 'd be  it 's different . A lot of the pronunciations are different , yeah . 
F:  That 's right . 
D:  Yeah .  
A:  Right . 
D:  Much different . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  And in my case with  with , uh , German w I  a certain region that I do well in and then <laugh> get farther away from that region and I notice it 's more and more difficult . Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  There 's another language that 's spoken in Spain too , that 's um , what am I thinking of ? 
C:  Castillian ? 
A:  Castillian . Yeah , and uh , 
D:  And  
A:  um  
D:  isn't it Catalan ? 
A:  Catalan . 
D:  Yeah .

A:  <mouth> So maybe  I mean , depending on where she is , like maybe

C:  Right . A big im I tha I think the transcriptions improved immensely , 
C:  like exponentially , um , after it was able to sort of isolate a single person onto a single channel . 
D:  Yeah , absolutely . 
F:  Oh , excellent . Oh , good to know . 
C:  Um  
C:  Oh , there 's no question . Um  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh , yeah . 
F:  S 
F:  so that was  You 're talking about early on , the change fro into Channeltrans ? Mm - hmm . 
C:  <mouth> <inbreath>  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  You guys didn't have 
E:  o one channel per person before ? 
C:  No . 
D:  No , it was one like  one ribbon for everybody and you had to kind of  you could switch signals , like you could listen to a different one , but you couldn't really  
C:  No . 
A:  Oh , wow . 
B:  Euh .  
C:  <mouth> <inbreath>  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Well could you ? Did  we didn't do that very much . 
A:  You couldn't visually isolate it ? 
E:  What ? 
D:  You couldn't visually do it , no . 
A:  Huh . 
B:  Euh .  
C:  No . 
D:  And f Yeah .  
C:  And you had to mark interruptions by a slash , right ? 
F:  Mm - hmm , that 's right . 
D:  And it was very hard to be precise about it , and it was very hard to tell  
C:  Um  
F:  Overlaps . 
topic_description:	improved when isolate one person one channel


D:  I had so much trouble at the very beginning trying to figure out who was who .  
E:  Mmm .  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm .  
topic_description:	figuring out who was who


D:  Cuz there 's m so many men and so few women . The women were easy to f figure out who was who , 
D:  and then the men  all their voices sounded the same except I think there was one British English speaker 
D:  and that was easy but 
E:  Wow , that 's difficult . 
D:  Eh .   Yeah . 
C:  You know what ? There might be a gender thing there , though , too , cuz I think  
B:  Yeah .  
C:  I think as women it might be easier to differentiate  Well , there were fewer women , too , but I  I wonder if a man transcribing all the guys  would have had  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Like if you  had transcribed it you would have had an easier time differentiating them ?  
D:  An easier time ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  I don't know why that would be true , but 
F:  That 's interesting . 
A:  That 's possible . 
D:  That 's possible . <laugh> 
C:  you wonder if there 'd be like a gender difference there ?  I don't know , I 'm thinking about it as like a psychologist I suppose . 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  I don't know . 
F:  It 's possible . Hmm . 
C:  Anyway .  
A:  Well , it 's  
C:  <mike noise> 
A:  oh , yeah , yeah , that 's possible . 
F:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  I was just gonna say something . I was gonna say that , 
A:  I mean , it 's easier for people to mimic like the timbre of 
A:  somebody 's voice if it 's the same  if , 
D:  <mike noise> 
A:  uh , that person 's voice is the same  
A:  if that person is the same sex as you . So maybe , 
D:  <mike noise> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <mike noise> 
A:  like , implicitly people pay attention more closely to 
A:  uh , speakers of the same sex . 
C:  Hmm . 
A:  I don't know . I don't know if that 's actually true but I 'm just 
F:  Hmm . 
A:  throwing that out there . 
D:  It 's interesting . 
C:  Huh . 
D:  I don't know . 
F:  Huh . 
D:  <mouth> 
A:  Kind of an interesting research project . <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , it seems like it 's  it 's related to this 
F:  production idea . 
F:  How you  
F:  you internalize what you 're externalizing in a way , <laugh> but . 
topic_description:	gender differences


F:  In the prev You 've also gone through  They 've  been here since the beginning .  You 've also gone through the  use the int in in introduction of the pre - segmentation , and that kind of thing . 
C:  <mouth>  <inbreath> 
D:  Oh , yeah . 
A:  <mike noise> 
C:  Right . 
F:  So initially they had to actually mark all the time bins themselves as well . 
B:  Wow . <laugh> 
A:  Oh . 
C:  <mouth> Right . 
E:  Oh , wow . 
D:  That took a l 
C:  Which wasn't as hard . I mean , it took time . It took time . 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  E No .  It just took time . Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  Um , I find that I have to adjust the time bins a lot anyway . Um  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Me too , yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Me too . 
E:  Yeah , I always adjust the time bins . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Um , not for the end of the utterance but for the beginning . Sometimes the beginning  
D:  Yeah . 
F:  <mouth> I see . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Really ? 
C:  the person started to say something , it 's a very slight difference ,  and then the time bin starts . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah , that happens a lot . 
E:  Yeah right . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  Right . 
C:  Um , so you have to just move it back a little bit . 
C:  And besi and I think you  mentioned at some point that you wanted a little pad 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  of time anyway . 
F:  It doesn't hurt to have a pad . It 's  it 's nicer to have a pad than not , d but s don't have to be really  Yeah , don't  doesn't have to be  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Then to have it be cut off . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  Don't have it just start , yeah . 
E:  I always wonder about the , um , time bins . I mean , I usually ended adjusting them a little bit  I mean , 
D:  I thought  
C:  Um , so . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  definitely when something 's cut off at the beginning or the end but also sometimes there 's just like 
E:  huge pads of , you know , 
E:  air before and  or after , um , that I don't really feel 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  is necessary for that segment , and I usually , um , you know , 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  Shrink in them or whatever , yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  shrink it a bit and make it a little bit  
F:  Nice . 
B:  Seems like I always have to cut off pads at the end . 
F:  Nice . 
B:  I don't have so much problem at the beginning , but . 
D:  Of breath or of uh  nothing ? 
B:  No , of n just nothing . Yeah . 
E:  Just nothing , yeah . 
D:  Hmm , yeah . 
C:  Yeah , there 's nothing going on . 
F:  <mouth> <inbreath> I

topic_description:	adjusting time bins


A:  At the beginning it seems to happen when , um , voicing occurs later  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  l you know , like  
D:  With fricatives a lot . 
A:  Yeah , with fricatives and with like , uh  I mean , like i it doesn't happen with , uh , like " buh "  
B:  Mmm . 
A:  so much because you 've got the pre - voicing before the consonant actually begins . 
D:  Although I found one in  actually I was just working right before this meeting ,  one where someone said , " great " and 
D:  the  
D:  the G  it was pronounced as a K so it was unvoiced and then part of the R was cut off in the beginning . 
A:  Oh . 
D:  And then 
D:  you  It sounded like " great " if you just listened to that time bin it still sounded like " great " . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
D:  But if you listened to right before it you could hear a little the  the K or whatever and a little bit of the R . <sniff> So  
E:  <mouth> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  I don't know . Usually it 's not  usually that doesn't happen but this time it did . 
A:  That 's kind of interesting . 
topic_description:	late voicing


C:  So for the non - linguists , what 's a fricative ? 
F:  Ah . <laugh> 
A:  Oh . <laugh> 
E:  <mouth> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh , it 's like " fff " , " sss " .   
D:  Or " sss " .   
D:  Or  
E:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh , OK . 
E:  Or " thh " .   
A:  " Shh " .   
E:  <mouth> It 's a sound that  
A:  It 's like the noisy , uh , um , like airflow ones where you 've got like a  a stoppage in your mouth like , uh , like your tongue  
D:  But it 's not completely blocking the airflow . 
C:  Oh , I see . 
E:  Yeah , and you can sort of  you can sort of keep it going a little bit . 
A:  Right . 
C:  Oh , I see . 
C:  Oh , OK . 
B:  Unlike like a " tuh " or a " kuh " that just stops . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Got it . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Sorry . <laugh> 
C:  I guess I 'm the only non - linguist . <laugh> 
F:  Have you  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Well , I 'm  I 'm sort of a hybrid , so I  I  you know , I  I appreciate having them do this , yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Oh , right , yeah , oh you  Yeah . 
topic_description:	fricatives


F:  So , um , in  did you  have you run into places  I 've run into a couple where actually the word was totally different when you adjusted the time bin . Have you had that happen ? 
D:  Mmm , yeah . 
E:  Oh , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  That 's fascinating . 
E:  Yeah . I like that . <laugh> I think that 's fun .  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Oh , it 's really a kick . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  And it sometimes changes the entire utterance , too . 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh it does . Completely . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I  I don't remember the words exactly . It 's a shame . There was one that was a whole sentence was broken up in the middle , 
A:  <swallows> 
D:  and there was a little 
D:  like 
D:  millisecond of break in the middle . 
D:  And 
D:  if you connected it all together , it completely changed what was right before it and what was right after <mike spike> it . It was written as something else , and then 
E:  <mike noise> 
E:  <mike noise> 
D:  it became a 
D:  word together from what was before and after and then with this little tiny 
D:  millisecond pause .  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  So I guess  I don't know . I mean , I guess when we talk 
D:  in between 
D:  different 
D:  segments of the word maybe ,  there 's pauses somehow ,  I guess  or the  you can  
C:  Hmm . 
A:  We stop voicing sometimes . 
D:  Yeah , or something like that . 
D:  It 's probably like inaudible 
D:  for us but  
D:  And maybe the pause was just so short that 
D:  it made up a 
D:  pause . I don't  is  it  That doesn't make any sense , but . <laugh> 
F:  There are some times when there have been words that they just pause right in the middle of . You 're  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <mike noise> 
F:  i it 's h 
D:  On purpose , though . 
D:  Or not . 
F:  Well , <outbreath> 
F:  it ge u I 'm sure sometimes on purpose , but sometimes it 'd just be s saying something and especially people who have really lo elongation in their style , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  and they say , " That 's really fascinating " <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  It 's not a great example , but you know ? 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Sh -  
F:  And  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Uh there 's  it 's  
F:  it 's funny how , um , 
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  i it 's funny to me that th something like that , you just change one little boundary and suddenly the whole meaning changes and I 've run across that also . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , that is true . 
E:  Hmm . Would you want , um , 
E:  uh , 
E:  a transcription of something like that , of a big pause in between  in the middle of a word ? Or just leave it as , " fascinating " ? 
F:  What I 've done  I 've  It 's very rare . I mean , when I 've run across it . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And , you know , maybe there are times that I haven't detected it and I 'm not @ @  
F:  you know , fin I haven't looked at everything . I 've looked at  I 've probably 
F:  looked at per uh s at least eighty percent of the data , 
F:  you know , all the way through e every meeting  <laugh> for about eighty percent of the stuff that I 've cleared so far . 
D:  <mouth> 
E:  Oh !  
F:  And , um , 
F:  i it s You guys are getting so good that it 's like I 'm  
F:  I  I  i I can get through them faster , and I 'm getting to the point where I maybe don't have to go through them all the way , you know , so it 's like  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  it 's just we 've gotten to a level , it 's just really great ,  of , um , 
E:  Mmm . 
F:  of  of 
F:  <laugh> 
F:  pre precision that 
F:  um , it takes a lot of a load off of me . And , um  
F:  and so I 'm not gonna be checking them all I don't think in the @ @  for throughout the whole rest of the project . 
F:  But , um  
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  Certainly have spot checking .  
A:  <mike noise> 
F:  But , um , hhh ,  those that I have found that way ,  to me , I think f f the most sensible way to handle it from my perspective was to treat it as a pronunciation situation . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So just do a  you know , a mark , then " fascinating " , and then put " PRN " and uh " interrupted by a pause " or , you know , some kind of other gloss like that , you know . 
A:  Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . 
A:  PRN . 
D:  How it was really pronounced ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <mouth> Mm - hmm . <mouth> 
E:  Right . 
C:  Mmm , oh right . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
F:  You know , " P R dot dot fascinating " , whatever it is . 
topic_description:	pauses in words


D:  I always get confused with the 
C:  <sniff> 
D:  pronunciation 
D:  convention . 
F:  Sorry , what was this ? 
D:  I get confused with pronunciation , like when there 's a strange pronunciation that I wanna mark .  
F:  OK . 
F:  <mouth> 
D:  Because I think w 
D:  m may di in the beginning did we do 
D:  the strange pronunciation and then write PRN and what it really was meant to be ? And now we 're doing the normal word and then inside the brackets 
D:  what it sounded like ? 
C:  Right . 
D:  We did a switch , right ? 
D:  Or not . I don't know if it 's just me that 's confused or if it was swi 
F:  Well , I 've  
C:  Mm - hmm , I  it  it never occurred to me , but now that you 're mentioning it , n yeah , yeah , possibly . 
F:  There was an adjustment , and I  and I 've switched them all  all the way at this point so that 
D:  <mouth> OK . 
D:  OK . So the convention as it stands now is 
D:  write the word as it is normally conventionally spelled in English with the little 
E:  <mike noise> 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yep . 
D:  <mouth> 
D:  apostrophe , or whatever you call it , 
F:  Mm - hmm , that 's right . 
D:  and then 
D:  " PRN " , 
F:  And then in the brackets , what it  Uh - huh . So i you know , " OK " is a very 
D:  how it 's pronounced . 
E:  <mike noise> 
F:  e easy example . A person says , " Mm - kay " then , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Oh . 
F:  it 's " OK " with a ha a little hatch and then , 
F:  " PRN " and then " m mm - kay " , or whatever it is in quotes . 
C:  Oh , right . 
D:  OK . 
A:  Oh . Right . 
C:  I think Nelson 's the only one who , uh  Oh , Morgan . 
C:  You guys call him Morgan . 
F:  Yeah , yeah . 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  He 's the only one who ever did that , I think . " Mm - kay . " 
D:  He does it a lot . <laugh> 
E:  " Mm - kay "  I  
C:  He does it a  yeah . 
B:  <mouth> 
A:  OK . 
E:  Yeah , and some people just say , " Kay . " 
C:  Um  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  " Kay " , yeah , that 's true . 
F:  Yeah , that 's right . 
E:  S 
A:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	pronunciation conventions


F:  And of course , you know  I mean , there 's also this other reduction that 
F:  w that we 've done in terms of like not capturing every time a person says " and " versus " nnn "  versus , you know , " nd " , <laugh> whatever  all the different ways of reducing " and " . 
C:  <mouth>  <inbreath> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  That 's true . 
F:  Because you can assume that 
D:  <mouth> 
F:  the speech recognition , 
F:  um , 
F:  uh , pronunciation models will handle a certain amount of reductions of these types , and the same thing for , 
F:  um , well " the " . " The "  versus " the "  that there are those known variants , and  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
D:  <mouth> Or " a "  versus " a " .  
F:  Exactly . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And that they should be able to handle themselves , and  and that we assume also that 
E:  <mouth> 
F:  for discourse purposes , those distinctions are not really the focus right now , and 
D:  <mouth> 
F:  those distinctions could be added later if needed but it 's unlikely that they would be . And it 's so time - consuming . So we 've made these  these simplifying assumptions with that , and so then you begin to think , " Well what about " OK " ? I mean , maybe 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  " mm - kay " is an appropriate variant for " OK " and it wouldn't be necessary to mark those either , so it 's  
F:  <mike noise> it 's definitely  there 's a , uh , 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
F:  choice of how far you go with that , and whether " kay " is  is enough of a variant  
F:  you know , it 's  th this is a case where , 
F:  um , I appreciate it when people mark those kinds of things but I  I sort of figure that 
F:  i @ @  
F:  that  that 's 
F:  not as far aw away from " OK " as " mm - kay " is , so it 's not quite so

A:  dif definitively like what context they 're gonna be used in . 
F:  Mm - hmm .

F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Or " the cat " because it 's next word starts with a  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  There 's a study done on when people say " uh " and when people say " um " .

topic_description:	contextual variation


D:  You know , what 's  On that 
D:  sort of similar topic , I just thought of something that 's been hard for me sometimes , is 
D:  you can have a pronunciation of  of the word " a "  
F:  Yeah . 
D:  as " a " .  
D:  And then you can have " uh " like 
D:  a pause or whatever as " uh " , and sometimes it 's hard to tell 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <mouth> 
D:  what the person meant . Are  did they mean " uh " like they 're pausing or did they mean " a " like " a

D:  Yeah .

F:  um , and I don't know if this is a good time frame ,  
C:  <mouth>  <inbreath> 
F:  uh , maybe it 'd be good to have it an hour later or  I don't know  I mean , could do anything 
D:  <mouth> 
F:  about  
A:  This is fine . 
D:  This time is fine for me . 
E:  Yeah , this is a good time for me . 
F:  Good time for you ? 
C:  It should be . 
F:  OK . 
A:  <mouth>  
C:  Um , I know I have something in the morning , which I don't normally have . 
C:  I don't remember off the top of my head when it ends .  
C:  Um , I 'll let you know if it 's  it 'll be a problem but it should be OK . 
F:  OK . 
C:  Two - thirty should be late enough . So . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Excellent , cuz we could probably move it one hour later , I mean  I think , u unless  
A:  In m 
A:  I was just gonna say maybe fifteen minutes later would help me a little bit just cuz I have a class up at Dwinelle b just before this . That 's why I was a little late today because  
F:  Oh , I see .  
F:  Wow .  You did really well .  Yeah . 
A:  Thanks . <laugh> Well , I took the bus for part of the way .  
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <mouth> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Oh , did you ? OK , OK . 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  But um , that might help me just a little bit because then it  
D:  <mouth> 
A:  I  you know , I 'm gonna  gonna be hobbling a little slowly . 
E:  <mike noise> 
D:  Then you don't have to rush . 
F:  Would anybody be constrained by having it be a full half hour later ? 
E:  <mike noise> 
D:  Hnh - nn .  
C:  No . 
E:  No . 
F:  OK . 
F:  And th the final question i <outbreath> 
A:  No . 
C:  Except we 'll miss treat time . 
E:  <laugh> <mock gasp> Oh ! 
A:  <sudden inbreath>  
A:  Tea ! 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  Oh , that 's right ! Oh !  I thought she said " mistreat time " . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Oh no . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Maybe we could have like a  
D:  Mistreat ? Oh ! <laugh> 
C:  like a half hour , then take a little break , <laugh> then come back and finish the meet 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah , well that 's  that 's some good motivation to not start a half hour later . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <mouth> 
D:  You know what we could do ? 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , you know , that 's  that 's  that 's an interesting  
D:  We could just ask the  
D:  someone like the front desk person or Lila to like set aside a little bit for us . 
A:  Tha - that 's so funny .  
E:  <noise> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Little bit of treats . 
F:  Hey , they would . 
A:  Oh that 's true . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah , they would . That 's  that 's not a bad solution . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  It 's not gonna be birthday cake , so . 
D:  Yeah , so we 'll survive . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> Yeah , that 's right , it 's already done .  
A:  This is very important .  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> It 's good to s good to have these things all scheduled . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  OK , so um  Oh , 
F:  uh , eh then I was gonna ask you , what about an hour later ? I mean , if we h had those things an hour later like , would people  OK ? 
A:  This is fine with me . 
D:  That 's fine too . 
C:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	next meeting


F:  OK , good . Alright , so , I 'll  I 'll so settle on that . OK now , I wanted to say , you 've been through a couple of different , uh , @ @ improvements in the methods , the pre - segmentation . 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  Yeah . That 's fine . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  There was another impro another improvement in that  
F:  Well , s let 's ask if it was an improvement from your standpoint . 
F:  Uh , the Tigerfish , um , approach . So , 
F:  uh , s moving from having the first transcription done by an external service , and then you 
F:  correcting that versus doing the initial transcription yourselves . 
F:  Ho - ho how  Have you  And so I think you  Yeah , I think you  
E:  <mike noise> 
A:  Oh . <laugh> 
F:  Did you  
E:  I don't think I have ever 
F:  has there already been t 
E:  done one from an external  
A:  I have . 
E:  I th I feel like they 've all been done probably by 
E:  another transcriber here .  
A:  You talking about the IBM ones ? 
F:  Yeah , IBM or if  if it was dash TF , that 's the Tigerfish . 
C:  Right . 
E:  T 
A:  Right , yeah , oh , yeah yeah . 
E:  Oh , m yeah , then I guess I have . Maybe the o one I 'm working on now . 
F:  <mouth> 
A:  I could tell you something that I thought  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So d 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Id - Is  
D:  Hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
E:  Hmm . 
F:  Yeah .  
F:  Have you noticed that Tiger - I 've noticed that Tigerfish uses " cough " a lot where it isn't really a cough .  You notice that ? Yeah . 
D:  <coughs twice> 
D:  <mike noise> 
C:  <mouth> It should be " clear throat " , or something . 
D:  <mike noise> 
E:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Oh , yeah . 
D:  <mouth> Oh yeah , mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
C:  Yeah , I  I just fix that . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <mouth> Yeah . 
E:  I 'd fix that too . 
F:  Yeah . Do you find  you 've  i This has caused me to wonder . So , in Tigerfish ones , 
F:  do you find that where they 've  where they have like " dot dot 's " cuz it 's segments they didn't hear ,  
F:  that  that you add  
F:  u you probably do add things in those places where 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  it 's  
F:  where nothing is transcribed really , because they didn't even hear it . 
D:  You mean in between the segments that they did transcribe ? 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  <mouth> Oh . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That 's where you f tend to find  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Interesting . 
F:  Oh , interesting . <laugh> 
E:  Yeah , you find little lost  lost words in the middle . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Huh . 
F:  Huh . 
topic_description:	first transcript external versus do yourself


E:  They have different  definitely a different style , right ? 
E:  Do they end all  them all in dots , like dot dot ? 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  There 's a lot of that . Yeah . 
C:  <mouth> Yes . 
D:  Yeah , mm - hmm . 
B:  They used to . 
E:  And they  and they capitalize like every single first   
A:  I really th 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <clears throat> 
D:  And they put paren um , not parentheses . What 's it called ?  
D:  Punctuation after brackets . 
F:  Yeah , that 's right too . 
A:  Yep . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
E:  Oh , OK , yeah , then I 'm doing that right now . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Oh , right , " Laugh , period " . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  <mouth> Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . <laugh> Which makes no sense to me . Like " that 's not a syntactic part of that sentence " . <laugh> 
C:  Something like that , right ? 
A:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
F:  <mouth> 
D:  No it doesn't to me either but . 
F:  Yeah . 
A:  If  
D:  No . <laugh> 
F:  Exactly . Exactly , I 'm glad you  Yeah , exactly .

topic_description:	different style


A:  if I could be completely frank , I really didn't like the IBM ones . 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh , good to know . 
A:  Yeah . I found them to be just  
D:  I didn't either . 
F:  Oh , that 's helpful . 
A:  I just  I  I ended up basically redoing them . 
F:  OK . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  Um , like from start to finish , so when I was checking them like it would take me basically as long as it would have taken me to just to transcribe it by myself . 
C:  I don't know if I did one .  
F:  Wow . Wow ! 
C:  Hmm . 
E:  Hmm . 
D:  I think it was a little bit faster than just transcribing it , but I definitely saw a lot of  
F:  Wow , OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  <clears throat> 
A:  I 'm really picky . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  there was a lot of errors that are not in the Tigerfish ones . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah , Tigerfish are better . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And they just have better intuitions , or I don't know what but , about what 's said . 
E:  OK - 
E:  Which are  What are the two differences ? I 'm not sure . 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  I 'm not sure if you had an IBM one . So this was earlier  on . 
E:  So do I have a Tigerfish one right now ? 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  If it says " TF " . 
A:  If it says " TF " . 
F:  You probably do . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . The ones that say " IBM " are like  They actually say " IBM " . 
E:  So I don't think I 've ever  
E:  The IBM ones were the ones that came in huge , huge paragraphs , huh ? 
A:  Yes ! Yeah , and you have to parse them all down . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
D:  <mouth> Yeah , and we had to split them up . 
E:  See , I never got one of those . 
E:  Right , OK , yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah , I didn't g ever get one of those . No . I 'm glad I didn't . <laugh> 
F:  So you didn't get one ? Oh , interesting . 
A:  OK . 
B:  I didn't get one either . 
C:  I think those show up in Tigerfish too , cuz I think I 've had a couple of Tigerfish where I 've had to break them up . 
D:  Where they have li 
E:  Ye - 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , but they 're not like  
E:  They 're not  
E:  Yeah , I can remember , u I used to see  
D:  they 're not huge huge , though . 
C:  A couple were . Yeah . And I had to sorta break them down . 
D:  Really ? 
D:  Oh . <mouth> 
D:  Oh . 
E:  Do they get them , um  
D:  I don't know . 
topic_description:	Tigerfish versus IBM


E:  They don't have like an interface , right ? They just  
F:  No . 
F:  In neither case . And I 'm  and I 'm thinking  I 'm thinking  you 're causing me to think back over what the differences were in the  what they got and IBM didn't  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  <mouth>  <inbreath> 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  They just have  They just have it segmented . You can tell because 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  sometimes they have it so wrong and it 's like , " Well , if you had just listened to what was before " . <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> But they don't have that option . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah .

F:  There 's also some i iffiness about 
A:  Als - 
E:  <mouth> 
F:  how d if  We 're not sure really how Tigerfish does it , you know , the methodology . How do they do this . Because sometimes you 'll have the s the same word , and I 've seen this ,  like , within  
E:  Mmm . 
F:  well , within a single turn , 
F:  l it 'll be spelled in three different ways . 
F:  And it 's like , you know , is this the same person who 's kind of forgetful ,  or is it that they have several people doing it together ?  You know , maybe it 's parallel . Maybe they 're all doing it in parallel and one falls behind and the other one   
A:  Huh . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Right . 
E:  Right . 
B:  <sniff> 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh , that 's interesting .

D:  <coughs twice> 
F:  And that 's why . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Exactly right . 
A:  OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
D:  God , it must take them a really long time to do these . 
E:  Hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  Um . 
F:  They 're very fast . Is l 
D:  That 's amazing . It sounds so hard . 
F:  Yeah . Yeah . 
F:  It  it turns out that they 're really much faster than the other approaches we 've used , and 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  we don't know exactly how they do it and I think that that 's by intention , that  @ @  not just me who thinks that  it 's that 
E:  <mike noise> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  proprietarily , it 's a very competitive business and they probably don't wanna , 
D:  <mike noise> 
D:  <coughs three times>

E:  Huh . 
A:  Right . 
F:  uh , 
D:  Leak their secrets ?

topic_description:	Tigerfish methodology


D:  And they don't  One person doesn't listen to all the channels of one meeting , right ? 
F:  <mouth> 
D:  So they can't get clues from the other channels ?  
F:  Well , you know , the  The way they 're listening to it is 
D:  Or can they ? I don't know . Mm - hmm . 
F:  they  
F:  they get a  they get  It 's linearized . So 
F:  if you picture what we have on the screen , 
F:  um , you know , there 's this block and it goes over   
F:  I 'm doing it from my perspective . <laugh> You have this block and it goes over to here and stops and this person starts to talk and he goes over to here and then you have an overlap over here .  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And so what they would get is this block from the first guy , this block from the second guy , and then the top of the overlap and then the second guy in the overlap . 
B:  <mike noise> 
A:  <mike noise> 
D:  <mouth> 
D:  Oh . 
E:  Oh , wow . 
C:  Hmm . 
F:  And then it would move on . So it 's sort of like this  you know , you go this way as much as you can , then you cycle through there and then you go up to this next level and  
B:  Hmm . 
E:  So they hear all the channels at once like you guys were saying you first did ? 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh , OK . 
F:  Um , let 's see , they hear them  Oh ! 
F:  uh , they hear them separately in two chunks , but then sometimes 
F:  they get confused about who the foreground speaker is , because they 're not being told who the foreground speaker is . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
F:  You know , and especially you can see if you have like four speakers , it be reason you can maybe find a way of doing that . But with nine speakers   
A:  Eee !  Yeah .  
F:  So what they get is they get a beep 
F:  that tells them when there 's something that they think  that the 
F:  f pre - segmenter thought there should be s transcribed in there . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
F:  And  so they 'll get  
D:  <mouth> 
F:  And it 's numbered so that we end up with the same number of  of transcribed slots . <laugh> 
D:  As there are slots in the pre - segmentation .  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Exactly . Cuz the first time when we didn't have them numbered , 
F:  we ended up with a  couple extra  segments that were transcribed , and it was hard to patch the whole thing back together because when it comes back to our end , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Hmm . 
F:  um , it 's just this long string of things that they 've 
F:  uh , partitioned according to the 
F:  tape that they were given . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Cuz they don't  they actually don't have digital interface either so it 's  it 's audiotape . 
B:  Oh wow . 
D:  Oh , wow . 
C:  Huh . 
A:  Oh . 
E:  Hmm , wow . 
F:  And they type it on and then  then it comes back to us and Adam and Thilo have a program wa they put it back together into our interface format and then we can use it . But , 
C:  Makes it really hard . 
E:  Wow . 
D:  <mike noise> 
D:  <coughs twice> 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  um , <mike noise> 
D:  <mike noise> <sniff> 
F:  um , <laugh> there are f cases where you 'll get a segment and it 's someone else 's utterance and that 's because 
D:  <mike noise> 
F:  that was overlapping with someone else and this is the weaker speaker of the two , and you 'll have like two totally parallel 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  r renditions of the same thing . 
F:  Because 
C:  Right . 
F:  i it 's just  i n  So what they get is like  i t is they get something like " beep one " . 
F:  And then  then they get " beep two " , " beep three " . Chuck Wooters does the numbers . 
F:  And , um , it cycles through . 
C:  Wow . 
C:  Oh , so they don't  Do they know the names of the speakers ? 
F:  No . 
C:  Oh , OK . 
F:  And they don't know which channel is s l supposed to be together . 
C:  Cuz  y OK . 
A:  <mouth> Huh .  
C:  Cuz sometimes there 'd just be interesting things where 
C:  there 'd be a misunderstanding about like  
C:  like 
C:  Morgan would be speaking but it 'd be on your  channel ,  and it 'd be like , " This is clearly not a woman speaking . " 
F:  Yes , exactly . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> Yeah , that 's quite right .  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  It 's like , " How could they do that ? " It 's like  Well now it 's  it m seems more reasonable that they 'd make a mistake like that if they had no idea . 
topic_description:	channels and different speakers


D:  Well , I  I definitely prefer not doing the transcript I mean , I liked transcribing  because I felt like I was much closer to the data  
F:  Yeah .  
D:  and I had a lot more ideas ,  like you were saying , hypotheses of what 's going on and  <sniff> 
F:  Huh .

topic_description:	liked/disliked transcribing


D:  You don't tend to notice as much I don't think at checking as you do transcribing , because it 's already there so you don't have to pay as much attention . 
E:  a little bit more . 
A:  That 's true . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , OK . 
E:  Yeah , and when you 're  
B:  Mmm . 
E:  when you 're , um , just checking you 're  You 're usually just looking for certain things that you know are gonna come up , and 
E:  I usually assume that , um , the words are mostly right , although I g you know , I go through and I look and make sure all the words are right , but usually it 's like , punctuation and capitalization and 
C:  <clears throat> 
E:  other things that I 'm  end up changing . And time bins , yeah .

D:  Yeah .

A:  I 'm like ultra - careful .  I  That 's just how I am . But , like I

A:  and I only  
B:  Hmm . 
A:  You know , b So , 
A:  like , I  I change time bins a lot , and I

F:  Yeah , it 's true . It 's true , it 's just a big mess .  
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Or if they 're breathing loudly . 
E:  So . 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , that 's right . 
F:  Well , i it 's a judgment call . And you can also say  well , you know , if the backchannels were so limit so low on volume that 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  they weren't o visually obvious , then you can say , " Well , it 's reasonable not to worry about them . " 
topic_description:	checking for backchannels


E:  Yeah . The  I mean  but also if they have it all 
E:  pre - segmented and they can only hear the segments , they often miss what 's in between because they didn't even have the option of listening to what 's in between . 
D:  You mean the 
A:  Right . 
D:  transcribers ? Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm , so . And you know , the  the segmenter usually misses little things like " mm - hmm " and " yeah " and  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  <sniff> 
F:  Yeah , that 's tr right , That 's quite right . 
D:  <mouth> 
F:  Yeah , that 's right . 
D:  And even bigger things . 
E:  @ @ yeah , sometimes the segmenter will  
D:  I mean you 've  said things that weren't caught on the pre - segmenter , like 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  whispers , kind of . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Just like , 
F:  OK .  
D:  " Oh , that 's interesting " , or something like that . 
A:  Well , like little sighs , or like inbreaths , like as though you 're gonna start speaking , which I feel is important 
D:  Yeah , you 're about to s speak . 
C:  Uh   
F:  Yes , I agree . 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  <sniff> 
A:  because it means that somebody 's about to interject something but then they decide for whatever reason that they 're not going to . 
D:  But then they don't .  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  And oftentimes I find that the segmenter will miss those kind of things , those kind of vo vocal cues . 
D:  And sometimes even laughs . 
F:  <mouth>  <inbreath> 
A:  Yeah , breath - laughs especially . 
C:  <mouth> Oh , yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh - huh . Uh - huh . 
B:  Oh yeah . <laugh> 
E:  Hmm . 
topic_description:	things missed between pre-segments


E:  <mouth> I usually take out  um , I usually don't put in any of the breaths unless they 're laughs . 
E:  I usually don't transcribe the  the inbreaths or things like that . 
D:  I don't either . M but , I mean I don't take them out if they 're already there . 
F:  <inbreath>  
E:  You know ? 
D:  I don't

D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah , or when it 's a laugh . I mean , often in the Tigerfish there 'd  it would si say " breath " , 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  but it  it w it actually seemed more like a laugh . 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  It 's really a laugh . 
E:  It 's a laugh , yeah . 
D:  But it 's a laugh . 
A:  It 's actually a breath - laugh . 
D:  Yeah . And you can  
C:  Um , cuz everyone 's laughing . @ @ Someone has just said something funny and everyone 's like , " Ah - ha - ha - ha - ha " .  Yeah . 
E:  Uh - huh .

D:  <mouth> 
F:  Yes . @ @  um , <clears throat> it 's mainly a matter of  
C:  The - 
C:  sort of  
F:  two things . First is the storage . It 'd be so huge that , uh , you 'd wanna be sure that it was of interest to someone , that it would be worthwhile doing . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And that 's the other thing , that we don't have 
F:  someone currently doing the video thing . It would really be interesting . 
C:  <mouth>  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah . Cuz I know it was mentioned . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , I mean , there are other things we could expand on and  with  i in terms of the methodology . It 's nice to have a core set of data though and they 've d actually done some  
D:  <mike noise> 
F:  they 've had some good results in terms of the digits which 
F:  they do in terms of having a r a nice

A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
F:  So , um  
D:  That 's good . 
F:  <mouth> 
topic_description:	transcribing issues


D:  It 's  it depends on the person , I mean , some people don't tend to do  
D:  aren't that involved in the meeting , or something , and they don't tend to say as much ,  
C:  Mmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  um , m backchannels or whatever . And some people  I mean  
D:  I remember <laugh> transcribing one person , all they did was clear their throat and breathe . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh>

D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh>

A:  There 's one guy in particular who does that .

E:  <laugh>

F:  Yeah .

F:  It just occurred to me , this is a  a different kind of question , but 
F:  I w <mike noise> 
F:  from having listened to all these people , 
F:  I mean , and it is kind of ab abnormal to be listening to them as if you 're  they 're talking into your ear , really .  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  You know , it 's this really unusual acoustic circumstances . 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  Right .  
E:  Uh - huh . 
F:  Um , <mouth> 
F:  I sort of end up feeling like I know these people better than I really do . And it 's like you go out to tea and there they are and , " Oh , you were so funny in that meeting " and it  it has this sort of 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  unusual dynamic because , you know , I  I 'm privy to information which really by all rights I shouldn't be , except of course they  they agreed , they signed , they were there , they agreed .

E:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm .

A:  <mike noise> 
F:  access to all this information and all your inferences about , you know , whether they 're funny or not funny or whatever , but it  
E:  <laugh> 
D:  I remember from the very beginning , I

F:  It 's  it 's very interesting , the ambience that you can get through these  these little things . 
A:  Yeah .  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  It 's  really makes it a lot nicer to transcribe because 
A:  Yeah .  
D:  there can be a lot of heated discussions about these very technical issues and people will have their opinions and , you know  
F:  <clears throat> Mm - hmm .

topic_description:	hypotheses about data


D:  One thing that I  I 'm  you probably don't remember this  that I was really interested in is the use of " so " and the use of " or " . 
D:  Because the way people use it in these meetings , I found , was  I don't know if it was  
C:  <mike noise> 
D:  it  if it 's different than other people .  I don't know if it 's a computer speech thing .  
D:  I mean , computer people speech thing , but um , 
E:  Hmm . 
D:  people tend to end utterances quite often with " so " or " or " and trailing off . 
A:  Oh , yes . 
E:  M Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  A couple people in particular do that , yeah . 
D:  Yeah , mm - hmm . And I found that really interesting , and I was curious to  to figure out when that happened , if it happened in certain occasions and whatever , and I never really got around to it , but . 
F:  Mm - hmm , that 's right . 
F:  Do you people  I mean , does everyone agree with that intu I mean , I f I s share her intuition that 's it 's  it is sort of unusual to have " so " used as a final , 
C:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Oh , yeah . 
F:  uh , 
F:  part of a person 's turn . I mean , it 's  
D:  It didn't sound stran I mean , it doesn't sound like bizarre enough that I don't understand . 
E:  Hmm . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  But I don't think it 's something that happens in just everyday speech really . 
A:  I don't  no , I don't agree necessarily . I do it . 
E:  I don't  
D:  Really ? 
F:  I was wondering . 
D:  Really ? 
A:  Yeah , I trail off with " so " . 
D:  Huh . 
D:  And " or " tends to be used with questions more than  
C:  <mouth>  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
D:  So . 
E:  That 's true . 
D:  But . 
D:  I thought that was really interesting . 
A:  Or y I 've heard you say " so " , in that sort of sense like uh , um , 
A:  " So in other words blah - blah - blah - blah . " 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Like a sort of an inad uh , eh  
F:  Of course b but that 's not really an example of this , because they don't just say " so " . 
A:  Right , but  
E:  u Nnn . 
A:  That 's true . 
F:  Is that right ? I mean , s I just wanna be sure . 
E:  Ending with " so " . 
A:  Or I  maybe I 'm misunderstanding what you were sa 
E:  When you end with " so " . 
D:  When you end the utterance . 
A:  When  Oh , just  just ending with " so " . OK . 
E:  When you say something  
F:  Yeah . 
E:  Right , and you say " so " . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , " I c I could get all those extra signatures , but I don't know , so . " 
E:  It  
E:  Yeah . 
A:  <mouth> Yeah , to me it 's like a vocal shrug .

topic_description:	"so" or "or" as final


A:  Um , I don't necessarily do it as often as the one speaker I 'm thinking of ,  um , 
A:  but , I do do that because  
A:  I think partly because I want to make sure that people know that my  
A:  my thought  my utterance is finished ,  
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
A:  but that it 's not necessarily final .  
D:  Like that you 're flexible ?

A:  Right . Or you can build on it or j d 
E:  Right . 
D:  Mm - hmm .

A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  It 's kinda like a shrug . 
topic_description:	vocal shrug


D:  Yeah , but it tends to happen  I mean , " so " tends to happen when the person brings up a new idea that kind of goes against what the other people is saying . Or at least that 's what I found . 
A:  It 's like a m it 's like a  
E:  You know ? 
A:  so .  
E:  <mouth> 
A:  What do you mean ? 
D:  Like if someone in a meeting is talking about a certain thing and someone kind of interrupts or doesn't necessarily interrupt and says something  either a new topic or a different take on the same topic 
B:  Oh . 
A:  Oh oh oh , yeah , OK .  
B:  Hmm . 
B:  <mouth> Uh like  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  will tend to use  will trail off with " so " . 
B:  " So , you can see you might be wrong , but I don't want to actually say that . " Mm - hmm . <laugh> 
F:  Yes , that 's possible , yeah . 
D:  Yeah , kind of , yeah , yeah . 
C:  Huh . 
F:  Yeah , interesting . 
D:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	new idea that goes against the other person's


E:  I think people end in " but " a lot too . And I feel that that means that they want somebody else to take it up ?  Or somebody just sort of like  
B:  <mouth> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Oh , yeah . 
E:  you know , take it from here ? So , you know , " Blah - blah - blah - blah - blah , but . " 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  " But I 'm not really sure so you can  you could finish my thought . " 
F:  Once again a sh is it a shrug ? Would you say  it 's another shrug ? Or  
E:  Yeah , so s 
A:  <clears throat> 
E:  Um , 
D:  It 's a different kind of shrug though . 
E:  I feel like it  I feel like it sort of , um , asks for somebody else to , uh , put input in now .  
F:  OK . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah .  
A:  I could see that . 
D:  I think it shows less of confident  like less confidence in what they just said in a way . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  OK . 
C:  Or giving permission ? 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  Same with " I don't know " . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  You can also end an utterance with , 
D:  <sniff> 
A:  uh , " blah - blah - blah but I don't know " . 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Like that . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Like , I feel like maybe that 's similar to " but " . 
D:  Yeah . More similar than to " so " I think . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah , that 's interesting . 
A:  To " so " , yeah . I think so too . 
F:  Huh . 
F:  Huh , interesting .

F:  What about , um , the way people treat 
F:  w when they give a joke , I mean , and  and they 're like  
F:  they laugh and then after the laugh they say , " uh " . 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  I mean , if you  so it 's like , " ha - ha - ha  uh " . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh>

F:  Do you  Have you run across this ? 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
E:  @ @  
B:  Mmm . 
F:  And it 's like , to me  I  I think I 've heard comedians do that . There 's some there 's something there about  
C:  <clears throat> 
E:  <mouth> 
F:  @ @  
F:  you know , you  you make a joke and then you have an " uh " in there somehow , 
F:  which I don't really understand the function of . Do you  
A:  Maybe it 's like saying like , 
A:  " This is funny but maybe it shouldn't be funny "  or " This is funny but maybe it 's funny for some sort of perverse reason " .  
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Or maybe it 's just a link to get back to the conversation or something ?  Like to connect it with what is going on 
F:  <mouth> 
C:  Hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  Well , eh how  OK , so the one I 'm thinking of is like if 
D:  elsewhere ?  
A:  like " ha - ha " <mouth> uh , you say  you would say like , um , 
A:  <mouth> uh like  OK , so he 's laughing " ha - ha " and then he 'd go " i uh " . <laugh> 
D:  Oh , like kind of  
A:  And  
D:  kind of laughing with it in a way ? Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Kinda , yeah , kinda like " Uh . " You know . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  And to me that 's more of like the <laugh> " Maybe this shouldn't be funny but it is . Maybe this is funny because it 's kind of disgusting or perverse in some way . " 
D:  Mmm . 
C:  Huh . Yeah . 
F:  It 's possible , now what I 'm thinking  I didn't have the extra  the extra 
F:  e um , what do you say , nuances in the " uh " , which you just  which you just did . However , the context fits . I mean , that 's an interesting take on it . I think  
A:  Wi  
A:  Oh , OK . 
D:  Mmm . 
F:  It 's possible . 
F:  It 's possible . 
A:  So you meant just sort of like a  just a normal " uh " ? 
F:  It 's just a normal " uh " . Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  But it 's stuck in  maybe it 's a little louder than usual . It 's not any of the extra , 
F:  um , 
F:  you know , glottal thing . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  Meaning , " Let 's keep going " ? 
D:  Maybe it means that . 
F:  Well , 
F:  but it just seems like it 's more prominent than  You know it really is like a 
D:  Uh . 
F:  placeholder of some sort , like  
F:  which I think is self - reflexive in  in the  sort of brings focus back onto the jokemaker , 
A:  That 's  yeah . 
D:  Maybe if  maybe it 's when people don't laugh enough or something . 
F:  but  
A:  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , that 's possible . OK . 
D:  I don't know . 
A:  Yeah , like , " Let 's come back to the original subject and I will take it from there " . 
F:  Oh . It could be . 
F:  Yes , po that 's possible . 
A:  Maybe . 
F:  It 's possible .  
A:  Cuz I 've heard , um , Morgan do that . 
F:  Exactly who I was thinking of actually . <laugh> Uh - huh .  Yeah . Exactly . Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , he does that a lot . 
A:  For obvious reasons , probably , if that 's the way he uses it . 
F:  That 's true , that would  The  And he does continue after that . But it 's just  you know , to say " uh "  you kn to say " uh " while you 're laughing 
E:  Right . 
F:  i it 's just to me it 's an interesting category . 
E:  I think it may almost have to do with like , 
E:  " OK , I told a joke , now everyone 's laughing , and now it 's common courtesy I 'll sort - of 
C:  <mike noise> 
E:  tell everyone to stop laughing , you know , so you don't offend me about 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  how good my joke was . " You know , it 's almost like , " OK ,

F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  uh , OK , my joke 's over , you know , you can stop laughing now " . 
D:  <coughs three times> 
D:  Right . 
F:  That 's possible . 
B:  Mmm . 
D:  Giving them permission to  
E:  Yeah . You know , because it 's like  
D:  <laugh> I don't know about permission . 
C:  Hmm ! 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  How do you  you know , how much do you laugh after someone 's joke to 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
E:  tell them how much you enjoyed it or  
A:  Be polite , or whatever .  
E:  Yeah . 
D:  <sniff> 
E:  Or how long do you wait after the joke 
D:  <mouth> To keep going with the meeting .  Yeah .

B:  <laugh>

A:  can somebody explain to me why you do digits ? I still don't really know . 
C:  No , no , let 's not . <laugh> 
F:  No , you don't ? 
F:  OK , the idea is that you have  
F:  then , um , you have ground truth , you know exactly what they 're supposed to have said , and then of course sometimes we go through and actually , um , people do double check that they read them correctly and all ,  
B:  Mmm . 
E:  Mmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  so that we 're sure , as you 've done . 
C:  I remember I did that a little bit , and , yeah , you must have too . 
D:  Yeah , I did that once too . 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , yeah . 
F:  And you  did also ? 
F:  <inbreath> 
B:  We  we are meant to be transcribing if they 're just left in the  the curly brackets ? 
C:  Kinda early on . 
F:  <clears throat> 
F:  No , because it 's  it 's  
F:  it should be able to be taken care of efficiently with this interface . 
F:  I mean , if the T Tigerfish people do it , then , 
C:  Yeah , they do write the numbers in . Yeah . 
F:  you know , leave it , that 's fine . Yeah . 
D:  The  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I 've been just leaving it . 
B:  And sometimes they don't . 
A:  Oh , I 've been writing the numbers just cuz I wasn't sure what to do . 
F:  Sometimes they don't . 
F:  Well , if you do that 's  that 's alright as well . 
E:  Oh , really ? 
A:  You don't have to ? 
F:  You don't have to . 
A:  Oh , OK .

F:  Because , uh , we 're  we have the assumption that we 'll take care of it this  in this other 
F:  way , but 
D:  <sniff> 
F:  In any case , the idea is that you have ground truth , you know exactly what the person should have said and you check to be sure , and usually there aren't many errors  eh w when they were checked . 
B:  Oh . 
F:  Um , and then , you have this multiplicity of voices , 
F:  uh , reading these things , and you can do really good speech recognition that way . 
F:  So they have some papers out that they 've done this . It 's really  
F:  it 's been very fruitful in terms of the analyses . It 's nice to have , 
E:  Huh . 
B:  Hmm . 
F:  you know , a standard  Uh , you know , it 's like ,

topic_description:	why do it


A:  Where 's the little things that 's supposed to say " transcript L dash blah - blah - blah " ? 
F:  <laugh> Yes , you run across that . 
C:  Oh , it 's at the top . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Let 's see , I guess it would be  it 's up there . 
E:  It 's right here , yeah . I looked for that too . 
B:  Oh , I see . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  Up there at the top . 
A:  Ah . Oh . OK . 
F:  <clears throat> 
D:  OK . 
C:  So , I have a question . 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  Cuz now I 'm looking at this 
C:  and I realize I don't know the answer ,  is , um , 
C:  sometimes when people are reading 
C:  " zero " ,  they say " O " , and sometimes they say " zero " , but  And I thought 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yes . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  that there must be an indication here . 
F:  Used to be . 
D:  That 's what I thought too . 
F:  Used to be . 
C:  Oh , that  " read O or read zero " . 
E:  Hmm . 
A:  Oh .  
F:  This  they changed them . Initially it was words all spelled out , so " ONE "  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh . 
B:  Mmm .  
C:  Oh , my ! 
F:  Yes . 
E:  Oh , wow . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <sniff> 
F:  And that was like a Stroop test in some ways . It took a lot of conc When I was doing those I had to really concentrate . It was like s " One , s seven "  you know , it was like  You really had to  " let 's see , the words and the numbers " and  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <mouth> 
C:  Yeah , you 're not used to seeing the numbers like that . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  and then you 'd have an " OH " periodically and , um , they were initially spelled out that way , one or the other . 
E:  Hmm . 
A:  Huh . 
C:  I see , so that 's why . 
F:  But we converted them to this format , and then the idea  I mean , you could conceivably put an " OH " or a " zero " for the " O 's " and still have this benefit , but I think that the idea is that people can choose what they think is most natural for them to say in those  those locations , and  you know , maybe there 'd be  
E:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  So it 's optional . You can say one or the other ? 
B:  Hmm . 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  Yes , mm - hmm . 
C:  OK . 
B:  Mmm . 
F:  So , um  
B:  <mouth> Oh , can I ask also ? Um , it says  it looks like the groupings are important , but some of the transcripts I 've seen they don't have any commas or breaks , it 's just a string of numbers . So we should be adding the breaks if  
F:  Sure . 
A:  <clears throat> 
F:  <mouth>  <inbreath> 
F:  Yes . Well , see  er  also , this has been a  a change in the procedure that  used to be that they were like uh one long string  
B:  Oh , OK . 
F:  different sized strings . But to have them broken up like this , it 's  it 's m been about 
A:  <mike noise> 
F:  uh maybe half a year that  that this  
F:  or maybe  maybe seven months , I don't know , 
F:  maybe longer , <laugh> that they 've gotten actually broken up within the line . 
D:  <mouth>  <inbreath> 
E:  <mouth> 
B:  Mmm . 
F:  So the idea is @ @  to pause when you see that . 
topic_description:	conventions


D:  But in the transcriptions  I mean , we don't have to deal with that because when 
F:  No . 
D:  the other interface deals with it then they break it up or whatever . 
F:  That 's right , break it up more finely . 
D:  Yeah .

B:  Though the one I 'm working on now is like that . 
F:  Well  
F:  I would say don't worry about that , because , um , 
B:  OK . 
F:  <mouth> this is w again  you know , it  it 'd be nice to get the words right , 
F:  but , um , 
F:  the  
F:  uh , the interface that these guys used , uh , allows you to set the time boundaries really accurately , so it 's not so important . It 's more important to focus on the words , because there we don't know the ground truth .

D:  <clears throat> Mm - hmm .
