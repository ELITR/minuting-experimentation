E:  Alright . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I usually put most of the acronyms in parentheses 
E:  cuz I think it 's sort of safe , 
E:  cuz people can  people can say their acronyms really fast 
E:  and I figure that even if I think I know exactly what letters they said , it 's probably best to put them in parentheses 
E:  cuz I probably don't . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Huh . 
E:  If you 're talking about who I think you 're talking about  
E:  are you talking about 
E:  um  
E:  O can  
E:  yeah . 
E:  Is that  
E:  OK , 
E:  well there 's one in particular who I find the hardest to transcribe of all , 
E:  and it 's  d she 's Spanish . 
E:  So . 
E:  And , um , 
E:  and I 've taken lots  
E:  I 'm fluent in Spanish , 
E:  and so , 
E:  um , when I  when I correct it , I can t I can tay  tell that the person who , um , transcribed it before me probably didn't speak Spanish , 
E:  cuz I can catch a lot of things 
E:  like  like " No , that 's not what she said " , 
E:  I can tell she 's  pronouncing  pronouncing it the way that if you read it from a  you know , a Spanish speaker 's mind that you would , you know , pronounce it the way that you would pronounce it in Spanish . 
E:  But the same time , uh I can't get most of it , 
E:  cuz I  
E:  I find it one of  one of the hardest ones to transcribe . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Oh , wow . 
E:  " Miss - " 
E:  Huh . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  I don't know . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Well , the last one I did she actually said a lot , 
E:  and it was kinda  it was very hard to transcribe . 
E:  You kno 
E:  it was  i j I just think that , um , her fluency in English wasn't  wa um , wasn't very  very high up there , 
E:  so it was really difficult . 
E:  But , I mean , I did find that knowing Spanish helped me a lot . 
E:  I could tell that a lot of things that the other transcriber had put in parentheses , I was like , " I can see how you  how you couldn't understand that " , 
E:  but I c I kn I think I know what she 's doing . 
E:  I mean , I think I know the mistake she 's making . 
E:  And  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  In German , 
E:  yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  You guys didn't have o one channel per person before ? 
E:  What ? 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Wow , that 's difficult . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Oh , wow . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  I always adjust the time bins . 
E:  Yeah right . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I always wonder about the , um , time bins . 
E:  I mean , I usually ended adjusting them a little bit  
E:  I mean , 
E:  definitely when something 's cut off at the beginning or the end 
E:  but also sometimes there 's just like huge pads of , you know , air before and  or after , um , that I don't really feel is necessary for that segment , 
E:  and I usually , um , you know , shrink it a bit 
E:  and make it a little bit  
E:  Just nothing , 
E:  yeah . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Or " thh " . 
E:  It 's a sound that  
E:  Yeah , 
E:  and you can sort of  you can sort of keep it going a little bit . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Oh , yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I like that . 
E:  I think that 's fun . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Hmm . Would you want , um , uh , a transcription of something like that , 
E:  of a big pause in between  in the middle of a word ? 
E:  Or just leave it as , " fascinating " ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Oh ! 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Right . 
E:  " Mm - kay "  
E:  I  
E:  Yeah , 
E:  and some people just say , " Kay . " 
E:  S 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Oh , really ? 
E:  I was trying to figure that out myself a couple times , 
E:  and I couldn't get anything . 
E:  I kept looking at all the " uh 's " and " um 's " and I was like , " Oh , this would be hard to do . " 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Really ? 
E:  I don't usually get con 
E:  Right . 
E:  Huh . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah , this is a good time for me . 
E:  No . 
E:  Oh ! 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  well that 's  that 's some good motivation to not start a half hour later . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . That 's fine . 
E:  I don't think I have ever done one from an external  
E:  I th I feel like they 've all been done probably by another transcriber here . 
E:  T 
E:  Oh , m yeah , then I guess I have . 
E:  Maybe the o one I 'm working on now . 
E:  They have different  definitely a different style , right ? 
E:  Do they end all  them all in dots , 
E:  like dot dot ? 
E:  And they  and they capitalize like every single first  
E:  Oh , OK , 
E:  yeah , then I 'm doing that right now . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Which makes no sense to me . 
E:  Like " that 's not a syntactic part of that sentence " . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK 
E:  Which are  What are the two differences ? 
E:  I 'm not sure . 
E:  So do I have a Tigerfish one right now ? 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  OK . 
E:  So I don't think I 've ever  
E:  The IBM ones were the ones that came in huge , huge paragraphs , huh ? 
E:  See , I never got one of those . 
E:  Right , 
E:  OK , 
E:  yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . Yeah , I didn't g ever get one of those . 
E:  No . I 'm glad I didn't . 
E:  Ye 
E:  They 're not  
E:  Yeah , I can remember , u I used to see  
E:  Do they get them , um  
E:  Id - Is  
E:  They don't have like an interface , right ? 
E:  They just  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  They just have  They just have it segmented . 
E:  You can tell because sometimes they have it so wrong 
E:  and it 's like , " Well , if you had just listened to what was before " . 
E:  Yeah , but they don't have that . 
E:  Yeah , I figured that they didn't . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh , wow . 
E:  So they hear all the channels at once like you guys were saying you first did ? 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Hmm , wow . 
E:  Wow . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Huh . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  I kinda miss it . 
E:  I liked  
E:  Yeah , 
E:  I liked transcribing . 
E:  I  You know , I feel  <mouth> I feel like it was , um , more personal . 
E:  I was  
E:  You know , the  n This is sort of just , you know , correcting other  
E:  I feel like I 'm just sort of like correcting a test or something now , 
E:  you know , 
E:  that somebody 's already done , 
E:  and  
E:  But , I mean , it 's still  It 's still cool . 
E:  But , um , 
E:  yeah , I did  I did like actually doing the transcribing a little bit more . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  and when you 're  when you 're , um , just checking you 're  You 're usually just looking for certain things that you know are gonna come up , 
E:  and I usually assume that , um , the words are mostly right , 
E:  although I g you know , I go through and I look and make sure all the words are right , 
E:  but usually it 's like , punctuation and capitalization and other things that I 'm  end up changing . 
E:  And time bins , 
E:  yeah . 
E:  Really ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Well , sometimes when you crank up the visual all it gives you is the background speakers . 
E:  So . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  The  I mean  
E:  but also if they have it all pre - segmented and they can only hear the segments , they often miss what 's in between 
E:  because they didn't even have the option of listening to what 's in between . 
E:  Mm - hmm , 
E:  so . And you know , the  the segmenter usually misses little things like " mm - hmm " and " yeah " 
E:  and  
E:  yeah , 
E:  sometimes the segmenter will  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  I usually take out  
E:  um , I usually don't put in any of the breaths unless they 're laughs . 
E:  I usually don't transcribe the  the inbreaths or things like that . 
E:  You know ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  It 's a laugh , yeah . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . Yeah . 
E:  I 'd fix that too . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Oh . Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah , you find little lost  lost words in the middle . 
E:  Huh . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  I haven't seen most of them . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh , yeah . 
E:  Oh ? 
E:  Oh , wow . 
E:  That would be interesting . 
E:  Wow . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Oh , wow . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  M Mm - hmm . 
E:  Oh , yeah . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  I don't  
E:  Right . 
E:  Right . 
E:  I think it 's sort of a like  you guys can take from here , 
E:  you know , 
E:  somebody  somebody build on my thought . 
E:  It 's  are you  people also do it with " but " . 
E:  You know ? 
E:  That 's true . 
E:  u Nnn . 
E:  Ending with " so " . 
E:  When you end with " so " . 
E:  When you say something  
E:  Right , 
E:  and you say " so " . 
E:  It  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  It 's  
E:  I think people end in " but " a lot too . 
E:  And I feel that that means that they want somebody else to take it up ? 
E:  Or somebody just sort of like  you know , take it from here ? 
E:  So , you know , " Blah - blah - blah - blah - blah , 
E:  but . " 
E:  Yeah , so s 
E:  Um , 
E:  I feel like it  I feel like it sort of , um , asks for somebody else to , uh , put input in now . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Right . 
E:  I think it may almost have to do with like , " OK , 
E:  I told a joke , 
E:  now everyone 's laughing , 
E:  and now it 's common courtesy I 'll sort - of tell everyone to stop laughing , 
E:  you know , 
E:  so you don't offend me about how good my joke was . " 
E:  You know , 
E:  it 's almost like , " OK , 
E:  uh , 
E:  OK , 
E:  my joke 's over , 
E:  you know , you can stop laughing now " . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  You know , 
E:  because it 's like  How do you  you know , how much do you laugh after someone 's joke 
E:  to tell them how much you enjoyed it 
E:  or  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Or how long do you wait after the joke 
E:  to  
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Definitely . 
E:  Sometimes they make me laugh so hard , 
E:  because they 'll just be talking  about something technical 
E:  and I 'll be so bored 
E:  and then suddenly they 'll say something that they only just sort of chuckle at 
E:  and then I laugh at for the next like twenty minutes 
E:  because I think it 's so funny . 
E:  Like one time  everybody was doing the , um , digits , 
E:  and they were all doing it at the same time , 
E:  and they started off kind of shaky , 
E:  they were like , " Oh , do we wanna do this at the same time , 
E:  you know , that 's  @ @   you know , wh let 's not all start laughing " 
E:  and then they all did it at the same time 
E:  and one person ended up at the very end doing the digits 
E:  and everybody had finished 
E:  and he had like two more lines to go , 
E:  and when he ended somebody turned to him and went , " You lose ! " 
E:  And I just kept laughing and laughing and laughing . 
E:  Oh . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Oh , really ? 
E:  Huh . 
E:  It 's right here , 
E:  yeah . I looked for that too . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Oh , wow . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Sure . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Pause after each line ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Alright . 
E:  Eight three one , seven six , three nine , 
E:  And I only started laughing when I had one batch of numbers left , and I couldn't get it . 
E:  Um . 
E:  I it just c 
E:  It is . 
E:  I finished my last one , it was really hard though . 
E:  Yeah . I mean , I got all the way down and then the very last one came and I was like , " I haven't laughed . " <laugh> And then I was @ @ . And then I just couldn't help it . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Sounds good , yeah . 
E:  Alright .
