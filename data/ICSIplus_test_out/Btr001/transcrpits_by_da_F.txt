F:  Signing off . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Um , w would you mind telling me again , please ? 
F:  Oh , he 's gonna write it . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Now , if the batteries were to go out during the meeting , there 's really  
F:  what do we do ? 
F:  Do we have batteries back there ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  And you 'll be in your office during this ? 
F:  Oh , thank you very much . 
F:  Thanks a lot . 
F:  Appreciate it . 
F:  Could you close the door for me please ? 
F:  OK , thanks . 
F:  So , 
F:  thanks very much for coming . 
F:  OK . 
F:  So um  
F:  let 's see , 
F:  so , um , as you know , the meeting today is to , um , @ @  benefit from your involvement in the data , 
F:  all the things that  that you 've been exposed to in these many months . 
F:  And um , I just  I just put down some ideas  
F:  you 've seen some of this in the email that I sent out earlier . 
F:  And , um , 
F:  none of these  these are not obligatory toca topics 
F:  but they 're just things that I thought might be useful to discuss , 
F:  just as a way of organizing the discussion . 
F:  But if there are other topics you 'd like to discuss that 'd be great too . 
F:  Alright , 
F:  so um , 
F:  it struck me that , um , you know , we could start out with some sort of general thing about , um , <outbreath> things that you found easier or more difficult with respect to transcribing or checking or using the interface or , uh , dealing with the time bins or any aspect of that type . 
F:  And then , maybe talk about specifics  specifics of the data 
F:  and then maybe talk about , um , aspects of the conventions 
F:  and then the technical set - up regarding the , um , auditory image and the interface . 
F:  OK , 
F:  so , 
F:  maybe we could just , um , start with issues of the  @ @  the tar ti up there at the top of  
F:  What  what did you find easiest or more s most difficult about transcribing the data ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Parentheses , meaning uncertainty . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Is  
F:  OK , 
F:  good . 
F:  It 's sorta like a foreign language , isn't it ? 
F:  It 's basically  you have these <laugh> specialized terms for things that I didn't know n needed specialized terms . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  That 's not a bad strategy . 
F:  I mean , i it 's  it 's true that I  I always check the parentheses at the last stage 
F:  and those are pretty easy to clear , in terms of when they 're in context . 
F:  Not a bad strategy . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I suspect in context . 
F:  And also when you have the  the juxtaposition of PDA and PZM  <laugh> then , you know , you  @ @  in context you can tell which one it 's  is probably likely to be the one that you had . 
F:  Well these here are the P Z 
F:  that right there . 
F:  Uh you 've heard , the " crown of pain " . 
F:  No . He was telling us , uh , before the meeting that , um , that they 're not in circulation right now , 
F:  that they 're  they were unpopular . 
F:  I liked them , 
F:  and Adam liked them . 
F:  I thought the quality was good . 
F:  What  
F:  yeah , what did he say ? 
F:  He said some more things about that , 
F:  but I was n I was working on something else . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  Ah , yeah . 
F:  Yeah , that 's right . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  it 's  
F:  I liked them . 
F:  And there 's the  actually , there 's the picture of the  of the Crown adjustment on the wall right there . 
F:  So it sort of hooks over your ears from the back . 
F:  Yeah , good c 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  OK , 
F:  so now what about accents ? 
F:  Do you have , uh  Did you find any p 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  What 's  
F:  you 've  studied some languages , 
F:  which  which ones do you  are you studying ? 
F:  It 's more of a Romance direction , 
F:  or  ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm , 
F:  so it 's not really  you 're not really exposed to German very much . 
F:  Ah !  Interesting . 
F:  Interesting . 
F:  Huh . 
F:  OK . 
F:  I it 's a good question . 
F:  Um , 
F:  And I can't really answer that . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  Oh , that 's fascinating . 
F:  Well , what you can see is that it 's  it 's her lack of  of English fluency that 's being  
F:  Yeah , that 's  that 's really interesting . 
F:  I do find that the German tends to be easier for me than s than the others 
F:  because of my c exposure and interest in German . 
F:  But , um , 
F:  I suspect you haven't 
F:  because this was , uh , earlier on that we had a lot of  
F:  actually she  she was in the middle phase I would say . 
F:  We had another Spanish speaker who was earlier who was also difficult . 
F:  But that 's really interesting . 
F:  Yes . Yes yes yes . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  Ex 
F:  exactly . 
F:  " Miss - ed " . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  Which was  you know , you could predict it , 
F:  I mean , if you knew  look looked back at it , 
F:  they  
F:  Yeah , 
F:  interesting . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Yeah , I had the same experience . 
F:  Sometimes  
F:  And actually  
F:  Sometimes <mike noise> when people lack a certain level of fluency you can ask them themselves , " What did you say there ? " 
F:  and they can't tell you . 
F:  S I think it 's  it 's sort of a general variability when it 's not  when you 're learning a language and you haven't gotten to a certain level . 
F:  I also wonder if  if it 's partly that Span - Spanish has different pronunciations in different regions ? 
F:  I mean , do you think that , um , that , uh , maybe  
F:  I mean , being  
F:  I mean , not that I would know that . 
F:  But I just wondered if , 
F:  um  
F:  you know , she was from probably continental Spain versus @ @  y you know other Spanish  
F:  I wonder if that would have a  a contributing factor . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  And in my case with  with , uh , German w I  a certain region that I do well in 
F:  and then <laugh> get farther away from that region 
F:  and I notice it 's more and more difficult . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  But she was also very low volume . 
F:  And , um  and didn't say a lot . 
F:  I mean , I  I  I c I totally agree . 
F:  This was a  a difficult person to  to understand . 
F:  But . 
F:  I can imagine that , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
F:  Yeah , yeah . 
F:  Yeah , I couldn't do it in Spanish . 
F:  I 've  I found myself doing that somewhat in  in German . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  Or they 're laughing when they 're talking 
F:  or they 're  
F:  Oh . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  we had lapels for d l brief 
F:  And then sometimes people would wear these around their necks , 
F:  which would mean really basically u uh , a problem that you 're saying of getting input from others , 
F:  and also , um , it varying when they change their hea w head position . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  but  
F:  Oh , excellent . 
F:  Oh , good to know . 
F:  S 
F:  so that was  You 're talking about early on , the change fro into Channeltrans ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm , 
F:  that 's right . 
F:  Overlaps . 
F:  That 's interesting . 
F:  It 's possible . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Huh . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  it seems like it 's  it 's related to this production idea . 
F:  How you  you internalize what you 're externalizing in a way , 
F:  but . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  In the prev 
F:  You 've also gone through  
F:  They 've  been here since the beginning . 
F:  You 've also gone through the  use the int in in introduction of the pre - segmentation , and that kind of thing . 
F:  So initially they had to actually mark all the time bins themselves as well . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I see . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  It doesn't hurt to have a pad . 
F:  It 's  it 's nicer to have a pad than not , 
F:  d but s don't have to be really  Yeah , don't  doesn't have to be  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Nice . 
F:  Nice . 
F:  I  
F:  Ah . 
F:  Have you  
F:  Well , I 'm  I 'm sort of a hybrid , 
F:  so I  I  you know , I  I appreciate having them do this , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  So , um , in  did you  have you run into places  
F:  I 've run into a couple where actually the word was totally different when you adjusted the time bin . 
F:  Have you had that happen ? 
F:  That 's fascinating . 
F:  Oh , it 's really a kick . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  There are some times when there have been words that they just pause right in the middle of . 
F:  You 're  
F:  i it 's h 
F:  Well , 
F:  it ge u I 'm sure sometimes on purpose , 
F:  but sometimes it 'd just be s saying something and especially people who have really lo elongation in their style , 
F:  and they say , " That 's really fascinating " 
F:  It 's not a great example , 
F:  but you know ? 
F:  And  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Uh there 's  
F:  it 's  it 's funny how , um , 
F:  i it 's funny to me that th something like that , you just change one little boundary and suddenly the whole meaning changes 
F:  and I 've run across that also . 
F:  What I 've done  I 've  
F:  It 's very rare . I mean , when I 've run across it . 
F:  And , you know , maybe there are times that I haven't detected it 
F:  and I 'm not @ @  you know , fin I haven't looked at everything . 
F:  I 've looked at  I 've probably looked at per uh s at least eighty percent of the data , 
F:  you know , all the way through e every meeting  <laugh> for about eighty percent of the stuff that I 've cleared so far . 
F:  And , um , 
F:  i it s You guys are getting so good that it 's like I 'm  I  I  i I can get through them faster , and I 'm getting to the point where I maybe don't have to go through them all the way , 
F:  you know , 
F:  so it 's like  it 's just we 've gotten to a level , it 's just really great ,  of , um , of  of <laugh> pre precision that um , it takes a lot of a load off of me . 
F:  And , um  
F:  and so I 'm not gonna be checking them all I don't think in the @ @  for throughout the whole rest of the project . 
F:  But , um  
F:  Certainly have spot checking . 
F:  But , um , hhh ,  those that I have found that way ,  to me , I think f f the most sensible way to handle it from my perspective was to treat it as a pronunciation situation . 
F:  So just do a  you know , a mark , then " fascinating " , and then put " PRN " and uh " interrupted by a pause " or , you know , some kind of other gloss like that , you know . 
F:  You know , " P R dot dot fascinating " , whatever it is . 
F:  Sorry , what was this ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  Well , I 've  
F:  There was an adjustment , 
F:  and I  and I 've switched them all  all the way at this point so that 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  Mm - hmm , that 's right . 
F:  And then in the brackets , what it  
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  So i you know , " OK " is a very e easy example . 
F:  A person says , " Mm - kay " 
F:  then , 
F:  it 's " OK " with a ha a little hatch 
F:  and then , " PRN " and then " m mm - kay " , or whatever it is in quotes . 
F:  Yeah , yeah . 
F:  Yeah , that 's right . 
F:  And of course , you know  I mean , there 's also this other reduction that w that we 've done in terms of like not capturing every time a person says " and " versus " nnn "  versus , you know , " nd " , <laugh> whatever  
F:  all the different ways of reducing " and " . 
F:  Because you can assume that the speech recognition , um , uh , pronunciation models will handle a certain amount of reductions of these types , 
F:  and the same thing for , um , well " the " . " The "  versus " the " 
F:  that there are those known variants , and  
F:  Exactly . 
F:  And that they should be able to handle themselves , 
F:  and  and that we assume also that for discourse purposes , those distinctions are not really the focus right now , 
F:  and those distinctions could be added later if needed 
F:  but it 's unlikely that they would be . 
F:  And it 's so time - consuming . 
F:  So we 've made these  these simplifying assumptions with that , 
F:  and so then you begin to think , " Well what about " OK " ? 
F:  I mean , maybe " mm - kay " is an appropriate variant for " OK " 
F:  and it wouldn't be necessary to mark those either , 
F:  so it 's  <mike noise> it 's definitely  there 's a , uh , choice of how far you go with that , and whether " kay " is  is enough of a variant  
F:  you know , it 's  th this is a case where , um , I appreciate it when people mark those kinds of things 
F:  but I  I sort of figure that i @ @  that  that 's not as far aw away from " OK " as " mm - kay " is , 
F:  so it 's not quite so  
F:  but I don't change it back if it 's there , 
F:  you know . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm , 
F:  interesting . 
F:  Oh , that 's interesting . 
F:  Huh . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Once in a while . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  Yeah , I  
F:  I agree . 
F:  And  and when I  when I 'm totally in doubt , if there 's a case where it really could be either , and I could flip a coin , <mouth> I 'll choose the one that would make syntactically the most sense , 
F:  give them the benefit of the doubt that they 're being fluent about it . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  It must be really rare though , 
F:  I haven't run across that often . 
F:  Ha - ha h Is it rare ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . Well , le let 's see now , 
F:  there 's another  another methodo 
F:  what I go I wanna ask you at some point , it just occurred to me ,  I 'd like to ask you the following question , maybe you can have this in the back of your minds , something like , um , you know , what sorts of hypothesis  your hypothesis about the  you know , ti trying to find the distributional explanations for some of these things . 
F:  What kind of , uh , hypotheses have  has this caused you  
F:  uh , I mean , don't wanna have you give away a paper topic that you wanna explore , 
F:  but , 
F:  you know , if there 's interesting th uh , hypotheses that the  that y have been suggested to you by looking at the data . 
F:  That kinda thing , maybe , uh , at some point . 
F:  So , 
F:  and al Oh ! And I also wanna say , that , um , I 'd like to meet again also next week , 
F:  um , and I don't know if this is a good time frame , 
F:  uh , maybe it 'd be good to have it an hour later 
F:  or  I don't know  I mean , could do anything 
F:  about  
F:  Good time for you ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Excellent , 
F:  cuz we could probably move it one hour later , 
F:  I mean  I think , u unless  
F:  Oh , I see . 
F:  Wow . 
F:  You did really well . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh , did you ? 
F:  OK , OK . 
F:  Would anybody be constrained by having it be a full half hour later ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  And th the final question i 
F:  Oh , that 's right ! 
F:  Oh !  I thought she said " mistreat time " . 
F:  Yeah , you know , that 's  that 's  that 's an interesting  
F:  Hey , they would . 
F:  Yeah , they would . 
F:  That 's  that 's not a bad solution . 
F:  Yeah , that 's right , 
F:  it 's already done . 
F:  It 's good to s good to have these things all scheduled . 
F:  OK , 
F:  so um  
F:  Oh , 
F:  uh , eh then I was gonna ask you , what about an hour later ? 
F:  I mean , if we h had those things an hour later 
F:  like , would people  
F:  OK ? 
F:  OK , good . 
F:  Alright , so , I 'll  I 'll so settle on that . 
F:  OK now , I wanted to say , you 've been through a couple of different , uh , @ @ improvements in the methods , the pre - segmentation . 
F:  There was another impro another improvement in that  
F:  Well , s let 's ask if it was an improvement from your standpoint . 
F:  Uh , the Tigerfish , um , approach . 
F:  So , 
F:  uh , s moving from having the first transcription done by an external service , and then you correcting that versus doing the initial transcription yourselves . 
F:  Ho - ho how  Have you  
F:  And so I think you  Yeah , I think you  Did you  
F:  has there already been t 
F:  Yeah , IBM or if  if it was dash TF , 
F:  that 's the Tigerfish . 
F:  So d 
F:  There 's a lot of that . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  that 's right too . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Exactly . 
F:  Exactly , 
F:  I 'm glad you  
F:  Yeah , exactly . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh , good to know . 
F:  Oh , that 's helpful . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Wow . 
F:  Wow ! 
F:  Wow , 
F:  OK . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I 'm not sure if you had an IBM one . 
F:  So this was earlier  on . 
F:  You probably do . 
F:  So you didn't get one ? 
F:  Oh , interesting . 
F:  No . 
F:  In neither case . 
F:  And I 'm  and I 'm thinking  I 'm thinking  you 're causing me to think back over what the differences were in the  what they got 
F:  and IBM didn't  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  There 's also some i iffiness about how d if  
F:  We 're not sure really how Tigerfish does it , 
F:  you know , the methodology . 
F:  How do they do this . 
F:  Because sometimes you 'll have the s the same word , 
F:  and I 've seen this ,  like , within  
F:  well , within a single turn , l it 'll be spelled in three different ways . 
F:  And it 's like , you know , is this the same person who 's kind of forgetful , 
F:  or is it that they have several people doing it together ? 
F:  You know , maybe it 's parallel . 
F:  Maybe they 're all doing it in parallel 
F:  and one falls behind and the other one  
F:  But , who knows ? 
F:  Well , you know , the  The way they 're listening to it is they  they get a  they get  
F:  It 's linearized . 
F:  So if you picture what we have on the screen , 
F:  um , you know , there 's this block and it goes over  
F:  I 'm doing it from my perspective . 
F:  You have this block 
F:  and it goes over to here and stops 
F:  and this person starts to talk 
F:  and he goes over to here 
F:  and then you have an overlap over here . 
F:  And so what they would get is this block from the first guy , 
F:  this block from the second guy , 
F:  and then the top of the overlap 
F:  and then the second guy in the overlap . 
F:  And then it would move on . 
F:  So it 's sort of like this  you know , you go this way as much as you can , 
F:  then you cycle through there 
F:  and then you go up to this next level 
F:  and  
F:  Um , 
F:  let 's see , 
F:  they hear them  
F:  Oh ! 
F:  uh , they hear them separately in two chunks , 
F:  but then sometimes they get confused about who the foreground speaker is , because they 're not being told who the foreground speaker is . 
F:  You know , 
F:  and especially you can see if you have like four speakers , it be reason you can maybe find a way of doing that . 
F:  But with nine speakers  
F:  So what they get is they get a beep that tells them when there 's something that they think  that the f pre - segmenter thought there should be s transcribed in there . 
F:  And  so they 'll get  
F:  And it 's numbered so that we end up with the same number of  of transcribed slots . 
F:  Exactly . 
F:  Cuz the first time when we didn't have them numbered , we ended up with a  couple extra  segments that were transcribed , 
F:  and it was hard to patch the whole thing back together 
F:  because when it comes back to our end , um , it 's just this long string of things that they 've uh , partitioned according to the tape that they were given . 
F:  Cuz they don't  they actually don't have digital interface either 
F:  so it 's  it 's audiotape . 
F:  And they type it on 
F:  and then  then it comes back to us 
F:  and Adam and Thilo have a program wa they put it back together into our interface format 
F:  and then we can use it . 
F:  But , 
F:  um , 
F:  um , <laugh> there are f cases where you 'll get a segment and it 's someone else 's utterance 
F:  and that 's because that was overlapping with someone else and this is the weaker speaker of the two , 
F:  and you 'll have like two totally parallel r renditions of the same thing . 
F:  Because i it 's just  i n 
F:  So what they get is like  i t is they get something like " beep one " . 
F:  And then  then they get " beep two " , " beep three " . 
F:  Chuck Wooters does the numbers . 
F:  And , um , it cycles through . 
F:  No . 
F:  And they don't know which channel is s l supposed to be together . 
F:  Yes , 
F:  exactly . 
F:  Yeah , that 's quite right . 
F:  And that 's why . 
F:  Exactly right . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  They 're very fast . 
F:  Is l 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  It  it turns out that they 're really much faster than the other approaches we 've used , 
F:  and we don't know exactly how they do it 
F:  and I think that that 's by intention , that  @ @  not just me who thinks that  it 's that proprietarily , it 's a very competitive business 
F:  and they probably don't wanna , uh , say too much about it . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  But they 're very fast . 
F:  It 's uh  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Huh . 
F:  Excellent . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  You miss  
F:  Oh ! I see . 
F:  Oh , interesting . 
F:  Oh , how interesting . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  OK . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And this is when you crank up the visual . 
F:  I mean , you 've still got the maximum  
F:  Yeah . OK . 
F:  Yeah , it 's true . 
F:  It 's true , 
F:  it 's just a big mess . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , that 's right . 
F:  Well , i it 's a judgment call . 
F:  And you can also say  well , you know , if the backchannels were so limit so low on volume that they weren't o visually obvious , then you can say , " Well , it 's reasonable not to worry about them . " 
F:  Yeah , that 's tr right , That 's quite right . 
F:  Yeah , that 's right . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Yes , 
F:  I agree . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  c Yeah . It 's  it 's good to  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  It  Well , it 's communicative . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Have you noticed that Tiger 
F:  I 've noticed that Tigerfish uses " cough " a lot where it isn't really a cough . 
F:  You notice that ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Do you find  
F:  you 've  
F:  i This has caused me to wonder . 
F:  So , in Tigerfish ones , do you find that where they 've  where they have like " dot dot 's " cuz it 's segments they didn't hear ,  that  that you add  u 
F:  you probably do add things in those places where it 's  where nothing is transcribed really , because they didn't even hear it . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Interesting . 
F:  Oh , interesting . 
F:  Huh . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  It just occurred to me , 
F:  this is a  a different kind of question , 
F:  but I w 
F:  from having listened to all these people , 
F:  I mean , and it is kind of ab abnormal to be listening to them as if you 're  they 're talking into your ear , really . 
F:  You know , it 's this really unusual acoustic circumstances . 
F:  Um , 
F:  I sort of end up feeling like I know these people better than I really do . 
F:  And it 's like you go out to tea and there they are 
F:  and , " Oh , you were so funny in that meeting " 
F:  and it  it has this sort of unusual dynamic 
F:  because , you know , I  I 'm privy to information which really by all rights I shouldn't be , 
F:  except of course they  they agreed , 
F:  they signed , 
F:  they were there , 
F:  they agreed . 
F:  But  but it  but it 's sort of an unusual relationship to say , 
F:  you know , i i you know , 
F:  if you 're in the meeting yourself , then you  of course you 'd have access to all this information and all your inferences about , you know , whether they 're funny or not funny or whatever , 
F:  but it  
F:  Oh , that 'd be interesting . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  He 's  he 's on campus , 
F:  I found this out . 
F:  Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Nice guy . 
F:  Nice guy . 
F:  Oh , but he is . 
F:  I went on  I actually went on a hike with him two weeks  three weeks ago . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah yeah . Yeah . 
F:  Nice guy . 
F:  Oh , she 's here . 
F:  Yeah , I 'm sure you 've seen her , 
F:  uh but  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah yeah , that 's no problem . 
F:  I also find that some of the  
F:  you know , if someone sits there and  and 
F:  it  th there 's this o one who doesn't say much , 
F:  but she just is always pleasant . 
F:  You know , 
F:  and it 's kind of a smiling voice and she laughs 
F:  and  
F:  What a difference . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I mean it 's like  
F:  Actually it 's  
F:  um , she 's  she 's just so pleasant . 
F:  And  and , you know , adds a lot just by virtue of that . 
F:  You know , can  People will talk on all these technical things 
F:  but she 'll  she 'll say something technical and then laugh , 
F:  and  
F:  It 's  it 's very interesting , the ambience that you can get through these  these little things . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I agree with you . 
F:  I agree , 
F:  it 's  it 's really interesting , Also , 
F:  i it 's a persona , 
F:  you get this  
F:  there 's definitely a sense of persona . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  Yeah , it 's difficult . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  um , <clears throat> it 's mainly a matter of  two things . 
F:  First is the storage . It 'd be so huge that , uh , you 'd wanna be sure that it was of interest to someone , 
F:  that it would be worthwhile doing . 
F:  And that 's the other thing , that we don't have 
F:  someone currently doing the video thing . 
F:  It would really be interesting . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  That was Liz 's idea . 
F:  Oh , well , it 's a question of feedback , and being able to give feedback . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Exactly . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  And , you know  I mean , th that was the meeting where , <mouth> um , @ @  you know the m the  th y y <outbreath> Partitions wouldn't work . 
F:  Another possibility is pa partitions wouldn't work 
F:  because then it would cut off the P Z Ms from having the indirect  
F:  so it 's like you have these unusual configuration problems that  that you wouldn't normally have . 
F:  Yeah , blindfolds . 
F:  You know , and someone else said , " Well , maybe you could just turn the light out . " 
F:  But then , someone else said no , 
F:  cuz there are these m special lights that have to stay on all the time 
F:  for the fire code or whatever it is . 
F:  But then  
F:  That 's right . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  I mean , there are other things we could expand on and  with  i in terms of the methodology . 
F:  It 's nice to have a core set of data though 
F:  and they 've d actually done some  they 've had some good results in terms of the digits 
F:  which they do in terms of having a r a nice broad set of speakers doing the same thing , meeting after meeting after meeting . 
F:  So , um  
F:  I 'm wondering , 
F:  um , 
F:  so we still technically  
F:  uh  you know  I mean , what should we do in terms of tea ? 
F:  Technically  
F:  if we could hang on for fifteen more minutes and have tea ? 
F:  And then continue with this  this next  next week ? 
F:  That 'd be great . 
F:  OK , 
F:  so , um , 
F:  let 's see . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm , 
F:  that 's right . 
F:  Do you people  
F:  I mean , does everyone agree with that intu 
F:  I mean , I f I s share her intuition that 's it 's  it is sort of unusual to have " so " used as a final , uh , part of a person 's turn . 
F:  I mean , it 's  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I was wondering . 
F:  Yes , that 's possible , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  interesting . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Of course 
F:  b but that 's not really an example of this , 
F:  because they don't just say " so " . 
F:  Is that right ? 
F:  I mean , s I just wanna be sure . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  " I c I could get all those extra signatures , 
F:  but I don't know , 
F:  so . " 
F:  That 's a very nice characterization . 
F:  Interesting . 
F:  Once again a sh 
F:  is it a shrug ? 
F:  Would you say  it 's another shrug ? 
F:  Or  
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Yeah , that 's interesting . 
F:  Huh . 
F:  Huh , 
F:  interesting . 
F:  What about , um , the way people treat w when they give a joke , 
F:  I mean , and  and they 're like  they laugh 
F:  and then after the laugh they say , " uh " . 
F:  I mean , 
F:  if you  
F:  so it 's like , " ha - ha - ha 
F:  uh " . 
F:  I mean  
F:  Do you  Have you run across this ? 
F:  And it 's like , to me  I  I think I 've heard comedians do that . 
F:  There 's some there 's something there about  
F:  you know , you  you make a joke 
F:  and then you have an " uh " in there somehow , 
F:  which I don't really understand the function of . 
F:  Do you  
F:  It 's possible , 
F:  now what I 'm thinking  
F:  I didn't have the extra  the extra e um , what do you say , nuances in the " uh " , which you just  which you just did . 
F:  However , the context fits . 
F:  I mean , that 's an interesting take on it . I think  
F:  It 's possible . 
F:  It 's possible . 
F:  It 's just a normal " uh " . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  But it 's stuck in  
F:  maybe it 's a little louder than usual . 
F:  It 's not any of the extra , um , you know , glottal thing . 
F:  Well , 
F:  but it just seems like it 's more prominent than  
F:  You know it really is like a placeholder of some sort , 
F:  like  
F:  which I think is self - reflexive in  in the  sort of brings focus back onto the jokemaker , 
F:  but  
F:  Yeah , that 's possible . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Oh . It could be . 
F:  Yes , po that 's possible . 
F:  It 's possible . 
F:  Exactly who I was thinking of actually . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  Yeah . Exactly . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  That 's true , 
F:  that would  The  
F:  And he does continue after that . 
F:  But it 's just  you know , to say " uh "  you kn to say " uh " while you 're laughing i it 's just to me it 's an interesting category . 
F:  That 's possible . 
F:  Very interesting . 
F:  Interesting . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  that 's  that 's  
F:  Huh , OK . 
F:  Oh n 
F:  Yes . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  He 's very funny . 
F:  He 's very funny . 
F:  I  I started laughing with something he said the other day , 
F:  it was  it was the beginning of a meeting 
F:  and it hadn't gotten far into it 
F:  and  
F:  and he 's  he 's doing this  one of these mock fights with Nancy , 
F:  which he does . 
F:  Have you run across these mock fights ? 
F:  And he s he says , <mouth> um , something like , 
F:  uh , 
F:  I  i and he 's m e they  they have this nice @ @  mutual condescending joking thing going on , 
F:  and he says , " Well , I could explain this to you . 
F:  I have a better laugh than you do . 
F:  The transcribers told me so . " 
F:  And it went on a little longer 
F:  but it 's li it 's like this really  
F:  Yeah , 
F:  and then at one point she  you know , at another meeting , she  she was not sure which channel she was on , 
F:  and he said , " Well , I think you 're on channel so - and - so " 
F:  and then she said , " Well , no , 
F:  sh shouldn't it be channel so - and - so ? " 
F:  and he says " Well , no , 
F:  it should be channel so - and - so " . 
F:  And then it turned out it was channel so - and - so 
F:  which he said , 
F:  and  and she said  he s he said , " I bested you again Nancy " . 
F:  And she said , " Yes , 
F:  that 's my recollection of all of our meetings together " . 
F:  They have this really nice  
F:  You know , it 's really  
F:  Those sorts of things , i it 's true , 
F:  you know , it 's like , it really does liven things up to have the , uh , <mouth> the nice interrelationships . 
F:  I think  
F:  I  I found that 's a nice aspect of a lot of these meetings , 
F:  the  eh the , uh , eh little periods of humor like that . 
F:  Alright , 
F:  well , so do we  would  would  we could do digits if we so desired . 
F:  If w if we wanted to do that . 
F:  Let 's do simultaneous digits . 
F:  No , you don't ? 
F:  OK , the idea is that you have  then , um , you have ground truth , 
F:  you know exactly what they 're supposed to have said , 
F:  and then of course sometimes we go through and actually , um , people do double check that they read them correctly and all , 
F:  so that we 're sure , 
F:  as you 've done . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  And you  did also ? 
F:  No , 
F:  because it 's  it 's  it should be able to be taken care of efficiently with this interface . 
F:  I mean , if the T Tigerfish people do it , then , you know , leave it , 
F:  that 's fine . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Sometimes they don't . 
F:  Well , if you do that 's  that 's alright as well . 
F:  You don't have to . 
F:  Because , uh , we 're  we have the assumption that we 'll take care of it this  in this other way , 
F:  but In any case , the idea is that you have ground truth , 
F:  you know exactly what the person should have said 
F:  and you check to be sure , 
F:  and usually there aren't many errors  eh w when they were checked . 
F:  Um , and then , you have this multiplicity of voices , uh , reading these things , 
F:  and you can do really good speech recognition that way . 
F:  So they have some papers out that they 've done this . 
F:  It 's really  it 's been very fruitful in terms of the analyses . 
F:  It 's nice to have , you know , a standard  
F:  Uh , you know , it 's like , uh , psychological approach also that <laugh> you like to have some standard stimulus here 
F:  and then you can  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I  I agree , 
F:  I think it 's a nice  it 's a nice design feature . 
F:  Yes , you run across that . 
F:  Let 's see , 
F:  I guess it would be  
F:  it 's up there . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  Up there at the top . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  Used to be . 
F:  Used to be . 
F:  This  they changed them . 
F:  Initially it was words all spelled out , 
F:  so " ONE "  
F:  Yes . 
F:  And that was like a Stroop test in some ways . 
F:  It took a lot of conc 
F:  When I was doing those I had to really concentrate . 
F:  It was like s " One , s seven "  
F:  you know , it was like  You really had to  " let 's see , the words and the numbers " 
F:  and  
F:  and then you 'd have an " OH " periodically 
F:  and , um , they were initially spelled out that way , 
F:  one or the other . 
F:  But we converted them to this format , 
F:  and then the idea  
F:  I mean , you could conceivably put an " OH " or a " zero " for the " O 's " and still have this benefit , 
F:  but I think that the idea is that people can choose what they think is most natural for them to say in those  those locations , 
F:  and  you know , maybe there 'd be  
F:  Yes , 
F:  mm - hmm . 
F:  So , um  
F:  Sure . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  Well , see  er  also , this has been a  a change in the procedure that  used to be that they were like uh one long string  
F:  different sized strings . 
F:  But to have them broken up like this , it 's  it 's m been about uh maybe half a year that  that this  or maybe  maybe seven months , I don't know , maybe longer , <laugh> that they 've gotten actually broken up within the line . 
F:  So the idea is @ @  to pause when you see that . 
F:  No . 
F:  That 's right , 
F:  break it up more finely . 
F:  Well  
F:  I would say don't worry about that , 
F:  because , um , <mouth> this is w 
F:  again  you know , it  it 'd be nice to get the words right , 
F:  but , um , 
F:  the  uh , the interface that these guys used , uh , allows you to set the time boundaries really accurately , 
F:  so it 's not so important . 
F:  It 's more important to focus on the words , 
F:  because there we don't know the ground truth . 
F:  So . 
F:  OK , so  
F:  Well , I don't know , 
F:  how do you feel ? 
F:  I mean , 
F:  what we could do is we could do it together one week 
F:  and then separate the next 
F:  or something like that 
F:  to give the variety . 
F:  We  
F:  why don't we do them together this time 
F:  just because  in the interest of time , to get you out in time . 
F:  OK , 
F:  so , um , 
F:  we just start out , we  and you s you say , " transcript L " whatever it is , 
F:  and then launch into the numbers 
F:  and then pause between the gr the gaps 
F:  and then  
F:  I guess you 're supposed to treat  
F:  Yeah , 
F:  you s well , you 're supposed to treat each line as kind of like a little sentence . 
F:  What do they say , 
F:  " Each line into smaller groups . 
F:  Please read each string as if you were giving it to someone over the telephone using the groupings indicated . 
F:  Yes , 
F:  there you go . 
F:  OK . 
F:  So , here we go . 
F:  Ready , 
F:  set , 
F:  go . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  It 's  it 's funny how distracting it is , you know ? It 's like there 's no content . 
F:  Did y did you finish your last batch ? OK . 
F:  You 're right in the middle of it , yeah . I 'm on the edge . 
F:  OK , well , I wanna thank you very much , and um , look f and so we 'll meet next week at the same time , u unless  I mean , I g I need to check on the schedule but I think , um , 
F:  The same  same time or within an hour ra of it . 
F:  Good . 
F:  Great . Thanks very much . 
F:  Signing off .
