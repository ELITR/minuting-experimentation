C:  Signing off . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Some of them just occurred over and over the  again , 
C:  so like  PDA . Like that got  got easy . 
C:  There  there was a  a bunch of them that , uh  
C:  They just kept getting repeated often and often 
C:  you know , over and over , 
C:  so . 
C:  Just got better , 
C:  but . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  No . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Hmm - hmm . 

C:  Yeah . 
C:  Can we give names ? 
C:  We  w we probably shouldn't , right ? 
C:  Oh yeah , 
C:  OK . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  He got easier though , 
C:  because he started  like he would say certain words over and over , 
C:  and  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  So when he said " sign - yah " , and it sounds like " sign " , he was saying " signal " . 
C:  And so I would transcribe it as " signal " . 
C:  " Meexe " , " meese " , " mees - uh " , or something . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Oh , eh  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , I mean he was never like  
C:  it was never up to like a native speaker , 
C:  but like that  it got a little easier . 
C:  Um  
C:  I remember in the beginning you had  and you were just sorta like  you were beating your head against the wall , 
C:  but I  it go but it got better , it got better . 
C:  Yeah , I know . Yeah .  I remember . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Or in Quebec , 
C:  right ? 
C:  In Canada it 'd be  
C:  it 's different . 
C:  A lot of the pronunciations are different , 
C:  yeah . 
C:  Castillian ? 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  A big im 
C:  I tha I think the transcriptions improved immensely , 
C:  like exponentially , 
C:  um , after it was able to sort of isolate a single person onto a single channel . 
C:  Um  
C:  Oh , there 's no question . 
C:  Um  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  No . 
C:  No . 
C:  No . 
C:  And you had to mark interruptions by a slash , 
C:  right ? 
C:  Um  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  You know what ? 
C:  There might be a gender thing there , though , too , 
C:  cuz I think  I think as women it might be easier to differentiate  
C:  Well , there were fewer women , too , 
C:  but I  I wonder if a man transcribing all the guys  would have had  
C:  Like if you  had transcribed it you would have had an easier time differentiating them ? 
C:  I don't know why that would be true , 
C:  but 
C:  you wonder if there 'd be like a gender difference there ? 
C:  I don't know , 
C:  I 'm thinking about it as like a psychologist I suppose . 
C:  Anyway . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Huh . 
C:  Oh yeah , 
C:  it was so ea it  it became much easier . 
C:  Um , 
C:  you know . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Which wasn't as hard . 
C:  I mean , it took time . 
C:  It took time . 
C:  Um , I find that I have to adjust the time bins a lot anyway . 
C:  Um  
C:  Um , not for the end of the utterance but for the beginning . 
C:  Sometimes the beginning  the person started to say something , 
C:  it 's a very slight difference , 
C:  and then the time bin starts . 
C:  Um , so you have to just move it back a little bit . 
C:  And besi and I think you  mentioned at some point that you wanted a little pad of time anyway . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Don't have it just start , 
C:  yeah . 
C:  Um , so . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah , there 's nothing going on . 
C:  So for the non - linguists , what 's a fricative ? 
C:  Oh , OK . 
C:  Oh , I see . 
C:  Oh , I see . 
C:  Oh , OK . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Got it . 
C:  I guess I 'm the only non - linguist . 
C:  Oh , right , 
C:  yeah , oh you  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mmm , oh right . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Mm - hmm , 
C:  I  it  it never occurred to me , but now that you 're mentioning it , n yeah , yeah , possibly . 
C:  Oh , right . 
C:  I think Nelson 's the only one who , uh  
C:  Oh , Morgan . 
C:  You guys call him Morgan . 
C:  He 's the only one who ever did that , I think . 
C:  " Mm - kay . " 
C:  He does it a  
C:  yeah . 
C:  Um  
C:  " Kay " , 
C:  yeah , that 's true . 
C:  That 's true . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah , that came up a couple of times , 
C:  yeah . 
C:  Mmm - mm . 
C:  It 's rare . 
C:  Huh . 
C:  Hnh . 
C:  It should be . 
C:  Um , I know I have something in the morning , which I don't normally have . 
C:  I don't remember off the top of my head when it ends . 
C:  Um , I 'll let you know if it 's  it 'll be a problem 
C:  but it should be OK . 
C:  Two - thirty should be late enough . 
C:  So . 
C:  No . 
C:  Except we 'll miss treat time . 
C:  Maybe we could have like a  like a half hour , then take a little break , 
C:  then come back and finish the meet 
C:  Little bit of treats . 
C:  It 's not gonna be birthday cake , 
C:  so . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yes . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Oh , right , 
C:  " Laugh , period " . 
C:  Something like that , right ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well , they 're not linguists , 
C:  so . 
C:  I don't know if I did one . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  I think those show up in Tigerfish too , 
C:  cuz I think I 've had a couple of Tigerfish where I 've had to break them up . 
C:  A couple were . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  And I had to sorta break them down . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Huh . 
C:  Makes it really hard . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Wow . 
C:  Oh , so they don't  
C:  Do they know the names of the speakers ? 
C:  Oh , OK . 
C:  Cuz  
C:  y OK . 
C:  Cuz sometimes there 'd just be interesting things where there 'd be a misunderstanding about like  
C:  like 
C:  Morgan would be speaking but it 'd be on your  channel , 
C:  and it 'd be like , " This is clearly not a woman speaking . " 
C:  It 's like , " How could they do that ? " 
C:  It 's like  Well now it 's  it m seems more reasonable that they 'd make a mistake like that if they had no idea . 
C:  Um . 
C:  Yeah , I liked transcribing . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Uh  
C:  Oh , yeah . 
C:  If it sounds like a yawn . 
C:  I 've transcribed yawns , 
C:  um  
C:  You can hear , there 's like . 
C:  You know , 
C:  it , like   something like that . 
C:  Uh  
C:  Yeah , 
C:  or when it 's a laugh . 
C:  I mean , often in the Tigerfish there 'd  it would si say " breath " , 
C:  but it  it w it actually seemed more like a laugh . 
C:  Um , 
C:  cuz everyone 's laughing . 
C:  Someone has just said something funny 
C:  and everyone 's like , " Ah - ha - ha - ha - ha " . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right , 
C:  it 's  it 's not a very committed laugh , 
C:  but it 's still a laugh . 
C:  It 's like  
C:  yeah , " I guess I 'll laugh cuz everyone else is laughing , " 
C:  I  You know , who knows , but  
C:  but yeah . 
C:  It should be " clear throat " , or something . 
C:  Yeah , I  I just fix that . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  I think I know who you 're talking about , 
C:  but  
C:  Uh  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Oh , cool . 
C:  I just wanted to know what Liz looked like . 
C:  I 've never gotten to see her . 
C:  She 's got a nice voice . 
C:  I know she 's here , 
C:  I know she 's a big part of the Institute , right ? 
C:  So . 
C:  Um  
C:  I must have , 
C:  I just don't know who  you know , what she looks like . 
C:  Um  
C:  Yeah , I think she 's got a nice voice . 
C:  But anyway . 
C:  It 's OK if we say nice things about these people , 
C:  right ? 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah , all you hear is the squeaky pen , 
C:  and you 're like , " Oh , no , 
C:  something  something 's going on that I don't know . " 
C:  Yeah , you guys talked about doing a videotape . 
C:  The 
C:  sort of  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Cuz I know it was mentioned . 
C:  Also having a meeting where you all wore blindfolds . 
C:  Li - it was Liz 's idea , 
C:  wasn't it ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  There you go . 
C:  I would just be so worried that someone would cheat . 
C:  You know , 
C:  it 's sort of like a prisoners ' di prisoners ' dilemnas game , where <laugh> you know , everyone 's wearing their blindfold but someone could just cheat and look , see what 's  <laugh> see what 's going on . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  You know , someone just leaves , 
C:  you know , 
C:  gets coffee , 
C:  comes back , 
C:  and no one knows . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah , sure . 
C:  Oh , yeah . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Huh . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Or giving permission ? 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Huh . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Hmm ! 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh , right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  What does he say ? 
C:  Why ? 
C:  Oh , no . 
C:  Woo - hoo ! 
C:  Let 's do simultaneous digits . 
C:  No , let 's  let 's not . 
C:  No , no , let 's not . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I remember I did that a little bit , 
C:  and , yeah , you must have too . 
C:  Kinda early on . 
C:  Yeah , they do write the numbers in . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh , yeah . 
C:  No , I totally agree . 
C:  Oh , it 's at the top . 
C:  So , I have a question . 
C:  Cuz now I 'm looking at this and I realize I don't know the answer , 
C:  is , 
C:  um , 
C:  sometimes when people are reading " zero " ,  they say " O " , 
C:  and sometimes they say " zero " , 
C:  but  
C:  And I thought that there must be an indication here . 
C:  Oh , 
C:  that  " read O or read zero " . 
C:  Oh , my ! 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , you 're not used to seeing the numbers like that . 
C:  I see , 
C:  so that 's why . 
C:  So it 's optional . 
C:  You can say one or the other ? 
C:  OK . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah , I don't care . 
C:  Whatever . 
C:  Sure . 
C:  Sure . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Aw ! 
C:  I 'm just happy I didn't make any mistakes . 
C:  Oh yeah ? That 's why I  that 's why I sat back here , I was like , " I didn't want  I  I don't wanna look at you people . " <laugh> To read it . 
C:  Oh , no . 
C:  Oh , that 's the killer . 
C:  Alright then . 
C:  Sounds good . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Signing off .
