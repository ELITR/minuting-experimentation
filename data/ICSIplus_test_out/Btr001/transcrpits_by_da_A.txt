A:  I love you , man . 
A:  What 's  so what do we do with this ? 
A:  Anything ? 
A:  Oh , OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Is anybody wearing one of those awful quote Crown microphones that people used to be  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Huh . 
A:  Oh . Oh , OK . 
A:  Just curious . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Oh , OK . 
A:  They 're tough sometimes . 
A:  Sometimes the German accents can get a little bit daunting . 
A:  I mean , 
A:  um , 
A:  I forget who it was that I was transcribing 
A:  but , it was tough to figure out what e e he was saying , uh , at any given point in time 
A:  and I would I would just listen to it over and over and over again , going " Oh my God ! My head 's gonna explode ! " 
A:  like , not really understanding a 
A:  you know ? 
A:  And so 
A:  I was getting a little frustrated 
A:  because I would put a lot of things into parentheses 
A:  and then go back over it 
A:  and go back over it again 
A:  and still  
A:  you know , 
A:  I  I like to try to clear as much up as I possibly can 
A:  and I  I just felt like you know , with the German accents , just for me personally , those were probably the toughest to get around . 
A:  Um , they weren't impossible 
A:  but just  like they too the m they took the most time too . 
A:  I mean I would take maybe twice as long on a  a g given channel w with a speaker who has a German accent than somebody who 's you know , a native English speaker , 
A:  or even Asian  
A:  like , uh , speaks an En - Asian language . 
A:  I found that easier . 
A:  Uh , 
A:  you know . 
A:  Uh , somebody who speaks like Chinese or something , @ @ . 
A:  Um , yeah  
A:  well , I studied  I mean , <laugh> I studied Old English for a while . 
A:  Um , 
A:  and then I 've worked with Larry Hyman on like some of the Bantu languages . 
A:  Um , 
A:  and you know , I 'm also working with Ian Maddieson 
A:  and he 's been doing work on the , uh , like also some African languages . 
A:  So I 've <mike noise> like learned a little bit . 
A:  No , 
A:  I mean I sing in German . 
A:  But  
A:  I mean , I can  I can pronounce it 
A:  but I don't know any . 
A:  I can do  I can pronounce a lot of languages and not actually speak them 
A:  because of singing . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Huh . 
A:  Oh OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Maybe I haven't transcribed this Spanish woman , 
A:  I don't know if I have . 
A:  Huh . 
A:  That 's kinda cool . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Oh , like the region ? 
A:  Sure . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Menton . 
A:  Right . 
A:  There 's another language that 's spoken in Spain too , that 's um , 
A:  what am I thinking of ? 
A:  Castillian . 
A:  Yeah , 
A:  and uh , 
A:  um  
A:  Catalan . 
A:  So maybe  I mean , depending on where she is , like maybe 
A:  ch 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  German . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  He - yeah . 
A:  If  when people talk over one another like constantly ,  like there 's this whole barrage of voices coming from everywhere , 
A:  it 's like " Oh my God ! 
A:  What 's going on right now ? " 
A:  It 's kind of  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh , wow . 
A:  You couldn't visually isolate it ? 
A:  Huh . 
A:  That 's possible . 
A:  Well , it 's  
A:  oh , yeah , 
A:  yeah , that 's possible . 
A:  I was just gonna say something . 
A:  I was gonna say that , 
A:  I mean , it 's easier for people to mimic like the timbre of somebody 's voice if it 's the same  if , uh , that person 's voice is the same  
A:  if that person is the same sex as you . So maybe , like , implicitly people pay attention more closely to uh , speakers of the same sex . 
A:  I don't know . 
A:  I don't know if that 's actually true 
A:  but I 'm just throwing that out there . 
A:  Kind of an interesting research project . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Me too . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  At the beginning it seems to happen when , um , voicing occurs later  
A:  l you know , like  
A:  Yeah , with fricatives and with like , uh  
A:  I mean , like i it doesn't happen with , uh , like " buh "  so much 
A:  because you 've got the pre - voicing before the consonant actually begins . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  That 's kind of interesting . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Uh , it 's like " fff " , " sss " . 
A:  " Shh " . 
A:  It 's like the noisy , uh , um , like airflow ones where you 've got like a  a stoppage in your mouth 
A:  like , uh , like your tongue  
A:  Right . 
A:  Sorry . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  And it sometimes changes the entire utterance , too . 
A:  We stop voicing sometimes . 
A:  Sh 
A:  Mm - hmm , 
A:  mm - hmm . 
A:  PRN . 
A:  Oh . Right . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  I think with like some of them  like you know with uh the difference between " the "  and " the " ,  you can  you can distinguished very , uh , u dif definitively like what context they 're gonna be used in . 
A:  Like um , <mouth> like you would say " the  apple " 
A:  because it 's " the " plus then the next word starts with a vowel . 
A:  Or " the cat " because it 's next word starts with a  
A:  Yeah , I 'm sure it 's  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  But something like  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mmm , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I 've run into that . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Sometimes I 'll put in like a bracket like uh , you know , the orthographic A slash UH like if I 'm really confused . 
A:  Yeah , 
A:  kinda go " Well there 's two , 
A:  so here . " 
A:  A few times . 
A:  Right . 
A:  This is fine . 
A:  In m 
A:  I was just gonna say maybe fifteen minutes later would help me a little bit 
A:  just cuz I have a class up at Dwinelle b just before this . 
A:  That 's why I was a little late today 
A:  because  
A:  Thanks . 
A:  Well , I took the bus for part of the way . 
A:  But um , that might help me just a little bit 
A:  because then it  I  you know , I 'm gonna  gonna be hobbling a little slowly . 
A:  No . 
A:  Tea ! 
A:  Oh no . 
A:  Tha - that 's so funny . 
A:  Oh that 's true . 
A:  This is very important . 
A:  This is fine with me . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  I have . 
A:  You talking about the IBM ones ? 
A:  Right , 
A:  yeah , 
A:  oh , yeah yeah . 
A:  I could tell you something that I thought  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I really th 
A:  Yep . 
A:  Right . 
A:  If  
A:  if  
A:  if I could be completely frank , I really didn't like the IBM ones . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I found them to be just  
A:  I just  I  I ended up basically redoing them . 
A:  Um , like from start to finish , 
A:  so when I was checking them like it would take me basically as long as it would have taken me to just to transcribe it by myself . 
A:  I 'm really picky . 
A:  Yeah , Tigerfish are better . 
A:  If it says " TF " . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  The ones that say " IBM " are like  They actually say " IBM " . 
A:  Yes ! 
A:  Yeah , and you have to parse them all down . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Als 
A:  Huh . 
A:  Oh , that 's interesting . 
A:  Eee !  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Huh . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  That 's true . 
A:  I guess I 'm such a perfectionist that I sort of combine the two when I 'm checking , 
A:  like I act as though I 'm transcribing it . 
A:  And so  
A:  Yeah , I really do . 
A:  Like I 'm  I tend to take a little <laugh> longer maybe than other people  doing checking 
A:  but like I  I 'm like ultra - careful . 
A:  I  That 's just how I am . 
A:  But , like I  
A:  I think I really , like , think of it in terms of re - transcribing it almost 
A:  and I only  You know , b 
A:  So , 
A:  like , I  I change time bins a lot , 
A:  and I like will change what people write  like for whatever words they write a lot , 
A:  like  
A:  So , I guess I don't see too much of a difference 
A:  but that 's just because it 's me . 
A:  Like I think I like checking more for that reason 
A:  because then it 's sort of  it 's like it 's a  it 's a little helpful . 
A:  It 's like kind of , you know , somebody 's helping me a little bit , 
A:  but I 'm actually doing the work anyway , 
A:  is kind of how I see it . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , like little sighs , 
A:  or like inbreaths , 
A:  like as though you 're gonna start speaking , 
A:  which I feel is important 
A:  because it means that somebody 's about to interject something 
A:  but then they decide for whatever reason that they 're not going to . 
A:  And oftentimes I find that the segmenter will miss those kind of things , 
A:  those kind of vo vocal cues . 
A:  Yeah , breath - laughs especially . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  It 's actually a breath - laugh . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  It 's  No , like , 
A:  yeah , it 's like . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yo - yo yo . 
A:  There 's one guy in particular who does that . 
A:  It 's really cute actually . 
A:  Reacting . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yep . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Y you know who I kept wanting to meet ? Was Bhaskara . 
A:  Is he really ? 
A:  He has such a nice voice . 
A:  I really like his voice , 
A:  so I kept wanting to meet him . 
A:  And then John told me that he 's not around anymore . 
A:  Or something , 
A:  so . 
A:  Neat . 
A:  Just curious . 
A:  I haven't either . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yes . 
A:  I th I think I know who you 're talking about . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  I know . 
A:  I started like kind of making mental friends . 
A:  I 'm just like ,  " I really like that person . 
A:  You know what , 
A:  I 'm gonna be his or her friend . " 
A:  And then  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Some of that computer stuff , I just  
A:  Oh , my God . 
A:  I 'll just sit there like going , " Oh fff ! " 
A:  It 's going right over my head . 
A:  Yeah , 
A:  I just  I start zoning out sometimes . 
A:  Like , I don't mean to , 
A:  but I 'm just kind of going , " I don't know what any of these acronyms are 
A:  and no idea what you 're talking about . " 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  And they 're writing stuff on boards and stuff that we can't see , 
A:  and so we don't know what they 're referring to , 
A:  and so . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah , they 're referring to this or that and the other thing 
A:  and you 're just going , " No , 
A:  I don't understand . " 
A:  Really ? 
A:  Oh I see . 
A:  So you have to do it vocally as opposed to visually ? 
A:  Like you can't use gesture ? 
A:  Ah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Cute . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Are you raising your hand ? 
A:  Totally . 
A:  Right . Right , right . 
A:  Gets bored . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh , yes . 
A:  A couple people in particular do that , 
A:  yeah . 
A:  I don't  
A:  no , I don't agree necessarily . 
A:  I do it . 
A:  Yeah , 
A:  I trail off with " so " . 
A:  Um , 
A:  I don't necessarily do it as often as the one speaker I 'm thinking of , 
A:  um , 
A:  but , I do do that because  
A:  I think partly because I want to make sure that people know that my  my thought  my utterance is finished , 
A:  but that it 's not necessarily final . 
A:  Like , you can  
A:  Right . 
A:  Or you can build on it 
A:  or j d expound on it . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  It 's kinda like a shrug . 
A:  It 's like a m it 's like a  
A:  so . 
A:  What do you mean ? 
A:  Oh oh oh , yeah , OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Or y 
A:  I 've heard you say " so " , in that sort of sense 
A:  like uh , um , " So in other words blah - blah - blah - blah . " 
A:  Like a sort of an inad 
A:  uh , eh  
A:  Right , 
A:  but  
A:  That 's true . 
A:  Or I  maybe I 'm misunderstanding what you were sa 
A:  When  
A:  Oh , just  just ending with " so " . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah , to me it 's like a vocal shrug . 
A:  S sort of . 
A:  That 's cool . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I could see that . 
A:  Same with " I don't know " . 
A:  You can also end an utterance with , uh , " blah - blah - blah 
A:  but I don't know " . 
A:  Like that . 
A:  Like , I feel like maybe that 's similar to " but " . 
A:  To " so " , 
A:  yeah . 
A:  I think so too . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Maybe it 's like saying like , " This is funny 
A:  but maybe it shouldn't be funny " 
A:  or " This is funny 
A:  but maybe it 's funny for some sort of perverse reason " . 
A:  Well , 
A:  eh how  OK , so the one I 'm thinking of is like if like " ha - ha " 
A:  uh , you say  you would say like , um , 
A:  uh like  
A:  OK , 
A:  so he 's laughing 
A:  " ha - ha " 
A:  and then he 'd go " i uh " . 
A:  And  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Kinda , 
A:  yeah , 
A:  kinda like " Uh . " 
A:  You know . 
A:  And to me that 's more of like the <laugh> " Maybe this shouldn't be funny 
A:  but it is . 
A:  Maybe this is funny because it 's kind of disgusting or perverse in some way . " 
A:  Wi  
A:  Oh , OK . 
A:  So you meant just sort of like a  just a normal " uh " ? 
A:  Meaning , " Let 's keep going " ? 
A:  That 's  
A:  yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , like , " Let 's come back to the original subject 
A:  and I will take it from there " . 
A:  Maybe . 
A:  Cuz I 've heard , um , Morgan do that . 
A:  Yeah , 
A:  he does that a lot . 
A:  For obvious reasons , probably , 
A:  if that 's the way he uses it . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  Be polite , or whatever . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Go  
A:  Johno keeps making comments about the transcribers . 
A:  It 's the funniest thing . 
A:  He  he 'll like 
A:  say  he 'll say like mean things about the transcribers . 
A:  He 'll be like  
A:  Like  Well sometimes he 'll do that , 
A:  yeah . 
A:  But sometimes he doesn't . 
A:  And sometimes he 'll just be like uh , you know , um , " Here , Transcribers , 
A:  try transcribing this ! " 
A:  Like , " Thanks ! " 
A:  Right . 
A:  Li 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Ah , the digits task . 
A:  We  
A:  can somebody explain to me why you do digits ? 
A:  I still don't really know . 
A:  Oh , I 've been writing the numbers just cuz I wasn't sure what to do . 
A:  You don't have to ? 
A:  Oh , OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Where 's the little things that 's supposed to say " transcript L dash blah - blah - blah " ? 
A:  Ah . Oh . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Huh . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Sure . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Joel . <laugh> I almost started laughing cuz you were cracking up . 
A:  He  You almost made me mess up . 
A:  Ye - he almost made me mess up . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Bye . 
A:  I love you , man .
