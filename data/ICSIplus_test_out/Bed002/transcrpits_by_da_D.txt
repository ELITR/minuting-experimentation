D:  That 's right , OK . 
D:  OK .  OK . Afterwards is fine . 
D:  Really small ? 
D:  OK . I see . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Thank you . 
D:  OK . It 's on . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  People no might not be able to infer that either , right ? 
D:  Like the fact  Like , I could imagine if someone came up to me and asked , " Where 's the city hall ? " , I might say , g ar " Are you trying to get there ? " 
D:  Because how I describe um , t its location  uh , p probably depend on whether I think I should give them , you know , directions now , or say , you know , whatever , " It 's half a mile away " or something like that . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Yeah . Exactly . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
D:  So that context was like , um , their presumed purpose context , 
D:  i like business or travel , 
D:  as well as the utterance context , like , " I 'm now standing at this place at this time " . 
D:  Um , I missed the beginning , 
D:  but , um 
D:  I guess  
D:  could you back to the slide , 
D:  the previous one ? 
D:  So , is it that it 's , um  
D:  These are all factors that uh , a These are the ones that you said that we are going to ignore now ? 
D:  or that we want to <mouth> take into account ? 
D:  You were saying n 
D:  Take the  the linguistic factors too . 
D:  Oh , how to extract these features . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Got it . 
D:  OK . 
D:  And  and it 's clear from the data , um , like , sorta the correct answer in each case . 
D:  But l 
D:  OK . 
D:  That 's  that 's the thing I 'm curious ab 
D:  Like do we know from the data wh which  
D:  OK . 
D:  So  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Sure . 
D:  u u I mean , the only way you could get that is if you were to give th the x subjects a task . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  Where you have  where your , uh , current goal is to  

D:  So that 's what you want ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  So you will know . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  The  No , that 's fine . 
D:  I guess , it 's just knowing the intention from the experimental subject . 

D:  And I think the other concern that has come up before , too , is if it 's  
D:  um  
D:  I don't know if this was collected  what situation this data was collected in . 
D:  Was it  is it the one that you showed in your talk ? 
D:  Like people  
D:  But 
D:  OK . 
D:  So was this , like , someone actually mobile , like  s using a device ? 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  OK . OK . 
D:  But , is it  
D:  I guess I don't know  The situation of  of collecting th the data 
D:  of , like  Here you could imagine them being  walking around the city . as like one situation . 
D:  And then you have all sorts of other c situational context factors that would influence w how to interpret , like you said , the scope and things like that . 
D:  If they 're doing it in a  
D:  you know , " I 'm sitting here with a map and asking questions " , 
D:  I  I would imagine that the data would be really different . 
D:  Um , so it 's just  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  a At the third ? 
D:  Right then ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  So , in the display you can  Oh , you said that you cou you might have a display that shows , like , the  
D:  a w your perspective ? sort of ? 
D:  And so , as you  
D:  Oh , two - D . 
D:  OK . 
D:  So as you move through it that 's - they just track it on the  for themselves 
D:  there . 
D:  OK . 
D:  So 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Uh , I was just trying to figure out how  how ambitious the system is . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  So your tasks don't require you to  
D:  I mean , uh  yo you 're told  So when your task is , I don't know , " Go buy stamps " or something like that ? 
D:  So , do you have to respond ? 
D:  or does your  
D:  Uh , what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system ? 
D:  Like , w 
D:  what you 're doing now ? 
D:  or  
D:  There 's no  
D:  OK , so it 's just like , " Let 's figure out what they would say under the circumstances " . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah , I  I don't know how much direction is given to the subject about what their interaction  
D:  I mean , th they 're unfamiliar w with interacting with the system . 
D:  All they know is it 's this great system that could do s stuff . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  So  
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Oh , Fey Parrill . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  She started taking the class last year 
D:  and then didn't  um , you know , didn't continue . 
D:  I g She 's a g 
D:  Is she an undergradua 
D:  She is a graduate , OK . 
D:  Yeah , I m I know her very , very briefly . 
D:  I know she was inter you know , interested in aspect and stuff like that . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  OK . 
D:  I guess the reason I was asking about the sort of the de the details of this kind of thing is that , um , it 's one thing to collect data for , I don't know , speech recognition or various other tasks that have pretty c clear correct answers , 
D:  but with intention <inbreath> um , obviously , as you point out , there 's a lot of di other factors 
D:  and  I 'm not really sure , um , how  how  e the question of how to make it a t appropriate toy version of that  Um , it 's ju it 's just hard . 
D:  So , I mean , obviously it 's a  
D:  It is , if they have these tasks that they 're supposed to  
D:  to  to give  
D:  Yeah , 
D:  uh  
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  w What are the t three intentions ? 
D:  Is it to go there , to see it , and  
D:  Yeah , it 's @ @ . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  OK , so now I understand the referent of Tango mode . 
D:  I didn't get that before . 
D:  Yeah , like , how close are you gonna be ? 
D:  Like , <laugh> Tango 's really close . 
D:  There 's the m tool kit that um , Kevin Murphy has developed , 
D:  which might be useful too . 
D:  And it 's available Matlab code . 
D:  Oh , really ? 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right , yeah . 
D:  I was wondering . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Sure ! 
D:  Um . 
D:  So , you two , who 'll be working on this , li are  are you gl will you be doing  Well , I mean are you supposed to just do it by thinking about the situation ? 
D:  Can you use the sample data ? 
D:  Is it like  
D:  Yeah , I mean , ho is there more than  
D:  Is there a lot s of sample data that is beyond what you  what you have there ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  That 's right , OK .
