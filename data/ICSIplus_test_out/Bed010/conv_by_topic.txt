B:  @ @ 
D:  How many batteries do you go through ? 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  Thank you . 
C:  Alright . <outbreath> <mike noise> Good . 
A:  Sure . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK so , 
C:  let 's get started . Nancy said she 's coming and that means she will be . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Um . 


C:  Alright . 
C:  So it might be worth , Keith , you looking at this , 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  um 
D:  Well Tilman s 
C:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
B:  I  I still don't  I still don't really understand e like  I mean we sort of say , um  
B:  You know , I  I still don't exactly understand sort of the information flow uh in  in this thing , or what the modules are and so on . So , you know , like just that such - and - such module uh 
B:  um 
B:  decides that it wants to 
B:  achieve the goal of greeting the user , and then magically it sort of s 
C:  Yeah  
B:  I mean , how does it know which syntactic structure to pull out , and all that ? 
C:  I thi 
C:  Yeah . So . I think it 's not worth going over in the group , but sort of when you get 
B:  R uh Sure . 
C:  free and you have the time 
B:  Yeah , soon . 
C:  uh either Robert or Johno or I can walk you through it . 
B:  OK . 
C:  And you can ask all the questions about how this all fits together . 
B:  That 's fine . 
C:  It 's eee  messy but once you understand it you understand it . It 's  it 's  There 's nothing really complicated about it . 
B:  OK . 
E:  No . 
B:  And I remember one thing that  that came up in the talk last Wednesday . 
B:  Um , 
B:  was 
B:  this , I  I think he talked about the idea of like , um  He was talking about these lexicalized 
D:  OK , you know how to do it ?  
B:  uh , uh , tree adjoining grammars where you sort of  for each word you , um  For each lexical item , 
A:  <mike noise> 
B:  the lexical entry says what all the uh trees are that it can appear in . And 
B:  of course , 
B:  that 's not v 
B:  That 's the opposite of constructional . That 's , you know , that 's  that 's HPSG or whatever . You know ? 
C:  Right . 
C:  Actually , roughly starting uh let 's say , nex next meeting , cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report . 
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
C:  But uh starting next meeting I think we want to 
C:  flip into this mode where  
C:  Uh . I mean there are a lot of issues , what 's the ontology look like , you know what do the constructions look like , what 's the execution engine look like , mmm lots of things . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  But , more focused on 
F:  <sniff> 
C:  uh an idealized version than 
C:  just getting the demo out . 
C:  <taps tongue to roof of mouth four times, evenly spaced>  
C:  Now before we do that , 
C:  let 's get back in  Oh ! But , 
C:  it 's still , I think , useful for you to understand the demo version 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  enough , so that you can  can see what  what it is that  that uh it might 
C:  eventually get retro - fitted into or something . 
B:  OK , right . 
C:  And Johno 's already done that , 
D:  Wa - uh  
C:  uh , looked at the dem uh the  looked at the SmartKom stuff . 
F:  <sniff> 
D:  To some de uh what  what part of th the SmartKom stuff ? 
C:  Well , the parser , and that stuff . 
D:  Oh yeah  yeah . 
A:   
B:   
C:   
D:   
E:   
F:   
G:   
C:  uh we  so we now know 
C:  I think , what the landscape is like . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  And so we just push on and  and 
C:  uh , do 
C:  what we need to do . 


C:  My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures 
B:  <door closes> 
C:  uh to start . 
C:  So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh , uh , actually from uh DFKI 
C:  uh , part of the German SmartKom project , who were here for the week 
C:  and , I think got a lot done . 
E:  Yeah , I think so too . 
E:  Um . 
E:  The  we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll 
E:  go all the way through and then say something like " Roman numeral one , 
E:  am Smarticus . " 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  It actually says , " Roemisch einz , am Smarticus , " which means it 's just using a German sythesis module for 
B:  OK . 
E:  English sentences . So uh , 
B:  OK . 
C:  It doesn't know " I " . 
E:  <scratchy mike noise> 
B:  OK . <laugh> 
E:  <inbreath> Um , 
G:  <outbreath> 
E:  the uh 
B:  Oh , " Am Spartacus . " Verstehe . OK . <laugh> 
D:  " I am Sm - I am Smarticus " is what it 's saying . I gue <laugh> 
E:  <scratchy mike noise> 
A:  Right . 
E:  The uh sythesis is just a question of um , 
G:  <outbreath> 
G:  <outbreath> 
E:  hopefully it 's just a question of 
E:  exchanging a couple of files , once we have them . 
E:  And , um , it 's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech 
E:  approach . So I 'm  I 'm  I 'm going backwards now , so 
E:  " synthesis " is where you sort of make this  uh , make these sounds , 
E:  and " concept to speech " is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said , 
E:  and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce things better , 
E:  presumably . Then , just with text to speech . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And , uh , Johno learned how to write 
E:  XML tags . 
E:  Uh , and did 
E:  write the tree adjoining grammar for some  some sentences . No , right ? Yeah , for a couple  
B:  Alright . 
E:  And because we 're sticking to that structure , the synthesis module doesn't need to be changed . So all that 
E:  f fancy stuff , and 
E:  the Texas speech version of it , which is actually the simpler version , is gonna be done in October which is much too late for us . So . 
E:  This way we  we worked around that . 
E:  The , uh  the system , um  I can show you the system . I actually want , at least , maybe , you should be able to start it on your own . 
E:  If you wanna play around with it , in th in the future . 
E:  Right now it 's brittle and you need to ch 
E:  start it up and then make ts twenty changes on  on  on  
E:  on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  And send in a  a  a couple of side queries on some dummy center set - up program so that it actually 
E:  works because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  running with this s Siemens virtual touch screen , which we don't have here . 
E:  And so we 're doing it via mouse , but the whole system was designed to work with this thing and it was  It was a lot of 
E:  engineering stuff . 
E:  No science in there whatsoever , but it 's working now , and um , 
E:  that 's the good news . So everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation . 
D:  Why  I had  I did need to chan generate different trees than the German ones , mainly because you know like 
D:  uh , the gerund in  in German is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb , 
E:  You have to switch it on .  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  so I 'd uh have to add " am walking , " or I 'd have to add a little stem for the " am " , 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
D:  when I build the  built the tree . 
B:  Yeah , I noticed that um , 
B:  that some of the examples they had , had 
B:  you know , non - English word orders and so on , you know . And then all that good stuff . So . Like . 
D:  Yeah . 


D:  Yeah . So . Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , 
D:  to a  er in XML 
D:  and there 's a conversion system for different 
D:  uh , to go from XML to something else . And th so , the knowledge base 
D:  for the system , 
D:  that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , 
D:  in a LISP - like  the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form . And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is 
D:  something based on Prolog . 
D:  So , you have a  basically , a goal and it , you know , says " OK , well I 'm gonna try to do the 
D:  Greet - the - person goal , so it just starts  uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold . Basically , it just means " build the tree . " 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And then it passes the tree onto , uh , 
B:  OK . 
D:  the ge the generation module . 
E:  But I think that the point is that out of the 
E:  twelve possible utterances that the German system can do , 
G:  <sniff> 
E:  we 've already written the  
E:  the syntax trees for 
E:  three or four . 
D:  We - yeah . So , the syntax trees are very simple . It 's like most of the sentences in one tree , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  and instead of , you know , breaking down to , like , small units and building back up , they basically took the sentences , and basically cut them in half , or you know , into thirds or something like that , and 
D:  made trees out of those . 
D:  And so uh , uh Tilman wrote a little tool that you could take 
G:  <mike noise> <sniff> 
D:  LISP notation and generate an XML , uh , 
D:  tree . 
D:  Uh , 
D:  S what do ca structure 
D:  from the  from the LISP . 
D:  And so basically you just say , you know , 
D:  " noun goes to " , you know , 
D:  Er , nah , I don't re I 've never been good at those . So there 's like the VP goes to N and those things 
B:  OK . 
B:  N , V yeah , OK . 
D:  in LISP , and it will generate for you . 


C:  Right . Now , we 're  we 're not 
C:  committed for our research 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  to  do any of those things . So uh we are committed for our funding . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
C:  OK ? to  uh  
B:  Make our stuff fit to that .  
C:  Yeah , to  n no , to just get the dem get the demos they need . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <scratchy mike noise> 
B:  Uh - huh . 
C:  OK ? So between us all we have t to get th the demos they need . If it turns out we can also 
B:  <background slam> 
B:  <cough> 
C:  give them lots more than that by , you know , tapping into other things we do , that 's great . 
D:  You should probably move the microphone closer to your face .  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  But i it turns out not to be in an any of the contracts 
D:  There 's like a little  The twisty thing , you can move it with .  
B:  OK . 
C:  and , s deliberately . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  So , the reason I 'd like you to understand 
B:  <coughing> 
C:  uh what 's going on 
C:  in this demo system is not because it 's important to the research . It 's just 
C:  for closure . So that if we come up with a question of 
C:  " could we fit this deeper stuff in there ? " or something . You know what the hell 
B:  Right . 
C:  we we 're talking about fitting in . So it 's just , uh in the sam same actually with the rest of us 
B:  OK . 
C:  we just need to really understand 
C:  what 's there . Is there anything we can make use of ? 
C:  Uh , is there anything we can give back , beyond th the sort of minimum requirements ? 
C:  But none of that has a short time fuse . 
B:  OK . 
C:  So th the demo the demo requirements for this Fall are sort of 
C:  taken care of as of later this week or something . And then  So , it 's probably fifteen months or something until 
F:  <outbreath> 
C:  there 's another serious demo requirement . That doesn't mean we don't think about it for fifteen months , but it means we can not think about it for six months . 
B:  Oh OK . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Right , yeah . 
G:  <sniff> 
C:  So . The plan for this summer 
E:  Right . 
C:  uh , really is to 
C:  step back from the applied project , 
C:  keep the d keep the context open , but actually go after the basic issues . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Oh OK . 
C:  And , so 
C:  The idea is there 's this 
C:  uh , other subgroup that 's worrying about formalizing 
C:  the nota getting a notation . But 
C:  sort of in parallel with that , 
C:  uh , the hope is tha in particularly you will work on 
C:  constructions in English Ge - and German for this domain , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  but y not worry about parsing them or fitting them into SmartKom or 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  any of the other  anything lik any other constraints 
B:  OK . 
C:  for the time being . 
B:  Got it . 
C:  It 's hard enough to 
C:  get it semantically and syntactically right and then  and get the constructions in their form and stuff . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  And , I don I don't want you f 
C:  feeling 
C:  that you have to somehow meet all these other constraints . 
B:  Right , OK . 
C:  Um . And similarly with the parsing , 
C:  uh 
C:  we 're gonna worry about parsing 
C:  uh , the general case 
C:  you know , construction parser for general constructions . 
C:  And , if we need a cut - down version for something , or whatever , we 'll worry about that later . 
B:  OK . 
C:  So I 'd like to , for the summer turn into science mode . 
F:  <sniff> 
B:  OK . <inbreath>  
C:  And I assume that 's also , uh , your plan as well . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Right . 
B:  So I mean , the  the point is that like the meetings um so far that I 've been at have been  sort of been geared towards this demo , 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . But  but we we 're swit 
B:  and then that 's going to go away pretty soon . 
C:  Right . 
B:  OK . And then we 'll sort of shift gears a 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  It 's  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Fairly substantially , huh ? 


E:  It 's got . What I  what I think is  is a good idea that I can  can show to anyone who 's interested , we can even make a  sort of an internal demo , and I  I show you 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  what I do , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  I speak into it and you hear it talk , 
B:  OK . 
E:  and I can sort of walk f through the information . So , this is like in half hour or forty - five minutes . Just fun . 
G:  <sniff> 
F:  <sniff> 
B:  OK . 
E:  And so you  when somebody on the streets com comes up to you and asks you what is SmartKom so you can , sort of , give a sensible answer . 
C:  <outbreath> 
B:  Right . 
B:  OK . 
C:  So , c sh we could set that up as actually an institute wide thing ? 
C:  Just give a talk in the big room , and  and so peo people know what 's going on ? when you 're ready ? 
F:  <sniff> 
E:  Absolutely . 
C:  Yeah I mean , that 's the kind of thing  That 's the level at which 
C:  you know we can just li invite everybody and say " this is a project that we 've been working on and here 's a demo version of it " and stuff like that . 
F:  <outbreath> 
F:  <sniff> 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . <inbreath> 
E:  Well d we  we do wanna have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of 
E:  pipe in extra XML messages from left and right before you 're   
B:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Indeed . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . Makes sense . 
F:  <sniff> 
C:  But any so that  e e It 's clear , then , I think . 
F:  <outbreath> 


C:  OK . Anyway . So , the trip  the report on these  the last we we sort of interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week . 
B:  Yeah . It 's alright . 
G:  <mike noise> 
E:  Um . <outbreath> 
C:  Maybe you 're done , then .  
E:  Well it was 
F:  <sniff> 
E:  just amazing to  to see uh 
E:  how  how instable the whole thing is , and if you just take the  
E:  And I g I got the feeling that 
G:  <sniff> 
E:  we are  the only ones right now who have a running system . I don't know what the guys in Kaiserslautern have running because 
E:  e the version  that is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work . 
E:  And you need to do a lot of 
E:  stuff to make it work . And so it 's  
E:  And even Tilman and Ralf sort of said " yeah 
E:  there never was a really working version that uh 
E:  did it without th all the shortcuts that they built in for the uh October @ @ version " . So we 're actually maybe ahead of the System Gruppe by now , 
F:  <sniff> 
E:  the system  the integration group . 
E:  And it was , uh  It was fun to some extent , but the uh 
E:  the outcome that is sort of of scientific interest is that I think both Ralf and Tilman  
E:  um , I know that they enjoyed it here , 
E:  and they r they  they liked , uh , a lot of the stuff they saw here , 
E:  what  what we have been thinking about , 
E:  and they 're more than willing to  to 
E:  um , cooperate , by all means . 
E:  And um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal " group - ware " 
E:  server at EML , make that open to all of us and them , 
E:  so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and  and generating and constructions w 
E:  we  we sort of uh put it in there and they put what they do in there 
E:  and maybe we can even 
F:  <cough> 
E:  um , 
E:  get some overlap , get some synergy out of that . 
E:  And um , 
E:  the , uh  If I find someone at  in EML that is interested in that , um I  
F:  <inbreath> 
E:  I may even think that we could look  take constructions and  and generate from them because the tree adjoining grammars that  that Tilman is using is 
E:  as you said nothing but a mathematical formalism . And you can just do anything with it , whether it 's syntactic trees , 
F:  <sniff> 
G:  <sniff> 
F:  <sniff> 
E:  H P S G - like stuff , or whether it 's construction . 
E:  So if you ever get to the generation side of constructing things and 
E:  there might be something of interest there , but in the moment we 're of course definitely 
E:  focused on the understanding , 
E:  um , pipeline . 
C:  Anyth - any other 
C:  <tongue taps>  
C:  uh repo visit reports sort of stories ? 


C:  And one of the things we need to do 
C:  is the um , 
C:  and this I think is relatively 
C:  tight  
C:  tightly constrained , is to finish up this belief - net stuff . So . 
C:  Uh . And I was going to switch to start talking about that unless there 're m other more general questions . 
C:  OK so here 's where we are on the belief - net stuff as far as I understand it . Um . 
C:  Going back I guess two weeks ago 
A:  <mike noise> 
C:  uh Robert had 
C:  laid out this belief - net , missing only the connections . Right ? 
F:  <sniff> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  That is   So , he 'd put all th all the dots down , and we 
C:  went through this , and , I think , more or less convinced ourselves that 
C:  at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there . 
C:  Yeah  we may run across one or two more . But of course the connections weren't . 
C:  So , uh Bhaskara and I went off and looked at some technical questions about 
C:  were certain operations sort of legitimate belief - net computations and was there some known problem with them 
C:  or had someone already uh , solved you know how to do this and stuff . 
C:  And so Bhaskara tracked that down . The answer seems to be 
F:  <sniff> 
C:  uh , " no , no one has done it , but yes it 's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that 's what you set out to do " . 
C:  And , so the current state of things is that , again , starting now , um 
C:  we 'd like to actually get a running belief - net 
C:  for this particular subdomain 
C:  done in the next few weeks . 
C:  So Bhaskara is switching projects as of the first of June , and 
C:  uh , he 's gonna leave us an inheritance , which is a uh  hopefully a belief - net that 
D:  <outbreath> 
C:  does these things . 
C:  And there 're two aspects to it , one of which is , you know , technical , getting the coding right , and making it run , and 
C:  uh stuff like that . And the other is the actual 
C:  semantics . 
C:  OK ? What all  you know , what are the considerations and how and what are the ways in which they relate . 
C:  So he doe h he doesn't need help from this group 
C:  on the 
C:  technical aspects or if he does uh we 'll do that separately . But in terms of 
F:  <sniff> 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  what are the decisions and stuff like that , that 's something that we 
C:  all have to work out . 
C:  Is  is that right ? 
C:  I mean that 's  that 's both you guys ' understanding of where we are ? OK . 
E:  Absolutely . 
G:  So , I guess , um  Is there like a latest version of the 
G:  belief - net  of the proposed belief - net ? 
G:  Like  
E:  We had um decided  
G:  like  
F:  <inbreath> 
E:  Um . 
E:  Well , no , we didn't decide . We wanted to look into maybe 
E:  getting it , the visualization , a bit clearer , but I think 
E:  if we do it , um , 
E:  sort of a paper version of all the nodes and then 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  the connections between them , 
G:  Yeah , that should be fine . 
E:  that should suffice . 
D:  Yeah , I  
C:  Yeah I mean , that 's a separate problem . We do in the long run wanna do better visualization and all that stuff . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  That 's separable , yeah . 
E:  What I 'm  what my job is , I will , um , 
E:  give you the input 
E:  in terms of  of 
E:  the internal structure . Maybe node by node , or something like this ? Or should I collect it all and  
G:  <mike noise> 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Doesn't matter . 
G:  Um , just any like  like sort of rough representation of the entire belief - net is probably best . 
E:  OK . 
E:  And um 
E:  you 're gonna be around ? 
E:  t again , always Tuesdays and Thursdays afternoon - ish ? 
E:  As usual ? 
G:  Yeah  
E:  Or will that change ? 
G:  I mean , yeah , I can  like I c Um . This week I guess um , kind of  I have a lot of projects and stuff but after that I will generally be more free . So yes , I might  
G:  I can be around . And g I mean , generally if you email me also I can be around on other days . 
E:  Yeah . OK . 
C:  Yeah and this is not a crisis that  I mean , you do , e everybody who 's a student should , 
C:  you know do their work , get their c courses all in good shape and  and  and  and then we 'll dig  d dig down on this . 
B:  <laugh> <mike noise> 
F:  <outbreath> 
E:  Yeah , that 's  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  No , that 's good . That means I have I h I can spend this week doing it . So . 
G:  OK . 
B:  OK , yeah , I mean . 
E:  OK . 


D:  I did look into that , uh in terms of , you know , exploding the nodes out and down ag 
C:  Yep . 
C:  Right . 
D:  JavaBayes does not support that . 
D:  I can 
D:  imagine a way of hacking at the code to do that . 
D:  It 'd probably take two weeks or so to actually go through and do it , 
G:  <mike noise> 
C:  Not  not at this point . 
D:  and I went through all the other packages on Murph - Kevin Murphy 's page , and I couldn't 
C:  Right . 
D:  find the necessary mix of free and uh 
G:  <laugh> 
D:  with the GUI and , with this thing that we want . 
C:  Well , we can p If it 's  If we can pay  Yeah . If you know it 's paying a thousand dollars or something we can do that . 
C:  OK ? So  so don't view free as  as a absolute constraint . 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK , so then I 'll go back and look at the ones on the list that  
C:  OK . And you can ask Kevin . 
G:  Yeah . 
E:  But  
G:  Yeah , the one that uh people seem to use is uh Hugin or whatever ? How exp I don't think it 's  Is it free ? Because I 've seen it advertised in places so I  it seems to  
D:  Mmm . 
E:  But  
C:  Hugin , yeah that 's free . 
C:  Uh , it may be free to academics . Like I  I don't know . 
F:  <sniff> 
C:  I have a co  I have a copy  that I l I downloaded . So , at one point it was free . 
G:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <mike noise> 
G:  OK . 
G:  OK . 
C:  Uh but yo I noticed people do use Hugin so um , 
D:  How do you spell that ? 
F:  Why  
C:  HUGIN . 
C:  And Bhaskara can give you a pointer . So then , in any case , um  But paying a lit You know , if i if 
C:  it 's uh  Probably for university , it 's  it 's gonna be real cheap anyway . 
C:  But um , you know , if it 's fifty thousand dollars we aren't gonna do it . I 'm mean , we have no need for that . 
E:  I  I also s would suggest not to d spend two weeks in  in  in changing the  the JavaBayes code . I  I will send you a pointer to a Java applet 
C:  No , he 's not gonna do that . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  OK . 
F:  <sniff> 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  <sniff> 
E:  that does that , it 's sort of a fish - eye . You  you have a node , and you 
E:  click on it , and it shows you all the connections , and then if you click on something else that moves away , that goes into the middle . 
D:  Mmm . 
F:  <sniff> 
F:  <sniff> 
E:  And maybe there is an easy way of interfacing those two . 
E:  If that doesn't work , 
E:  it 's not a problem we  we need to solve right now . 


B:  How do you go about this process of deciding what these connections are ? I know that there 's an issue of how to weight the different 
F:  <cough> 
B:  things too , and stuff . Right ? I mean do you just sort of guess and see if it sort of  
C:  Right . 
C:  Well there  there  there 
E:  It 's  
C:  There 're two different things you do . One is you design and the other is you learn . 
F:  <sniff> 
C:  OK ? 
C:  So uh what we 're gonna do initially is  is do design , 
C:  and , i if you will , guess . 
F:  <outbreath> 
B:  OK . 
C:  OK . Uh that is you know use your best knowledge of  of the domain to 
B:  Right . 
C:  uh , hypothesize what the dependencies are and stuff . 
F:  <sniff> 
B:  OK . 
C:  If it 's done right , 
C:  and if you have data 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  then , there are techniques for learning the numbers given the structure 
C:  and there are even techniques for learning the structure , although 
C:  that takes a lot more data , and it 's not as @ @ and so forth and so on . So uh 
C:  but for the limited amount of stuff 
C:  we have for this particular exercise 
C:  I think we 'll just design it . 
B:  Alright . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Fo - 
E:  Hopefully as time passes we 'll get more and more data from Heidelberg and 
B:  OK . 
E:  from people actually using it and stuff . 
E:  So but this is the  <whistle>   long run . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  But to solve our problems ag uh a mediocre design will do I think in the beginning . 
B:  Yeah , that 's right . 


B:  Yeah , oh , and by the way , speaking of data , um , are there 
B:  I could swore  uh , I could swear I saw it sitting on someone 's desk at some point , but is there a  um a transcript of any of the , sort of , initial 
B:  interactions of people with the  with the system ? 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Cuz you know , I 'm still sort of itching to  to look at what  
B:  look at the stuff , and see what people are saying . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah make yourself a note . So and  and , of course Keith would like the German as well as the English , so whatever you guys can get . 
E:  <inbreath> The German . 
E:  Oh yeah , of course , German . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , the y your native language , right ?  You remember that one . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <inbreath> OK . 
E:  That 's important , yeah . 
C:  So he 'll get you some data . 
B:  Yeah , u 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah , I mean I  I sort of um 
B:  found the uh , 
G:  <mike noise> 
B:  uh the audio 
B:  of some of those , and um , 
E:  Hmm . 
B:  it kind of sounded like I didn't want to trudge through that , you know . It was just  
G:  <mike noise> 
B:  Strange , but . 
C:  Yep . 
E:  We probably will not get those to describe because they were trial runs . 
B:  Oh yeah , OK . 
E:  Um , but uh that 's th 
E:  but we have data in English and German already . So .  Transcribed . I will send you that . 


C:  OK , so 
C:  while we 're still at this sort of top level , anything else that 
C:  we oughta talk about today ? 
E:  Ho - how was your 
E:  thingy . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:   
C:   
F:   
A:   
D:   
B:   
G:   
B:  Oh , um , 


B:  I just wanted to , uh , s like mention as an issue , um , you know last meeting I wasn't 
B:  here because I went to a linguistics colloquium on the fictive motion stuff , and that was pretty interesting and you know , I mean , seems to me that that will fairly obviously be of relevance to uh  
C:  Oh right . 
A:  <mike noise> 
A:  I 'd love to see it if you  if you have a copy kind of . Uh . 
C:  Yeah . I see this is  this is getting into Ami 's thing . 
B:  Yeah . 
G:  <mike noise> 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  He 's  he 's very interested in that . 
A:  Here 
E:  OK . 
C:  So . Uh . Yeah . Well , why don't you just put it on the web page ? There 's this EDU  Right ? 
B:  Me too . 
E:  Yeah it 's  or  or just  Yeah . It 's also all on my  my home page at EML . It 's called " An Anatomy of a Spatial Description " . But I 'll send that link . 
C:  Or a link to it . 
C:  Just 
A:  OK , great . 
C:  Anyway yeah , so we 'll  we 'll look at this . 
C:  And . So , all of these issues now  are now starting to come up . So , now  we 're now done with demos . We 're starting to do science , right ? And so these issues about 
B:  <laugh> <mike noise> 
C:  uh , reference , and  spatial  reference , discourse reference , uh - uh - uh - uh  all this sort of stuff , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  uh , deixis which is part of what you were talking about , um  So , all of this stuff is 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  coming up essentially starting now . 


B:  to what we 're doing here because you know people are likely to give descriptions like 
B:  you know , " What 's that thing uh right where you start to go up the hill , " or something like that , you know , meaning a few feet up the hill or whatever from some 
B:  reference point and all that stuff so I mean , I 'm sure in terms of 
B:  you know , people trying to state locations or , you know , all that kind of stuff , this is gonna be very relevant . So , 
B:  um , now that was  
B:  the talk was about English versus Japanese , um , which obviously the Japanese doesn't 
B:  affect us directly , except that , um , 
B:  some of the construction  he 'd  what he talked about was that you know in English we say things like th you know , " your bike is parked across the street " 
B:  and we use these prepositional phrases , you know , " well , 
B:  if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike " , but um in  
B:  in Japanese the  the more conventionalized tendency is to use a  sort of a description of 
B:  " where one has crossed to the river , there is a tree " . 
B:  Um , and you know , you can actually say things like , um , 
B:  " there 's a tree where one has crossed the river , but no one has ever crossed the river " , or something like that . 
B:  So the idea is that this really is you know that 's supposed show that 's it 's really fictive and so on . But um  
B:  But the point is that that kind of construction is also used in English , you know , like " right where you start to go up the hill " , or " just when you get off the train " , or something like that to  
C:  Mmm . 
B:  uh , to indicate where something is . So we 'll have to think about  
C:  So  
C:  how much is that used in German ? 
E:  Um . 
E:  The uh  Well  
E:  I wa I was on a uh  on a  on a different sidetrack . I mean , 
C:  Oh , OK . 
E:  the  the Deep Map project which um is undergoing some renovation at  at the moment , 
G:  <mike noise> 
E:  but this is a  a three language project : German , English , Japanese . 
B:  OK . 
E:  And um , 
E:  we have a uh , uh  
E:  I have taken care that we have the  the Japanese generation and stuff . And so 
E:  I looked into uh spatial description . So we can generate spatial descriptions , how to get from A to B . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And  and information on objects , in German , English , and Japanese . And there is a huge uh project on spatial descriptions uh  differences in spatial descriptions . 
E:  Well , if yo if you 're interested in that , 
E:  so how  how , I mean it does sort of go d all the way down to the conceptual level to some extent . So . 
A:  <click> 
B:  OK . 
E:  Um . 
C:  So , where is this huge project ? 
E:  It 's KLEIST . It 's the uh Bielefeld 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  generation of uh 
A:  <click> 
E:  spatial descriptions and whatever . 
E:  @ @ 
C:  Well , that may be another thing that Keith wants to look at . 
B:  OK .  
E:  But um , I  I think we should leave Japanese constructions maybe outside of the scope for  for now , but um 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  definitely it 's interesting to look at  at 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  cross 
E:  the bordered there . 
A:  Are  are you going to p pay any attention to 
A:  the relative position  
A:  of  of the direction relative  relative to the speaker ? 
A:  For example , there are some differences between Hebrew and English . 
A:  We can say 
A:  um 
A:  " park in front of the car " 
A:  as you come beh you drive behind the car . 
F:  <sniff> 
A:  In Hebrew it means 
A:  " park behind the car " , because to follow the car is defined as it faces you . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Intrinsic , yeah . 
A:  While in English , front of the car is the absolute front of the car . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Right , so the canonical direction of motion determines where the front is . OK . 
A:  So . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  So , i i i is German 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  uh 
A:  closer to  to E uh , uh , uh , uh  to E I mean uh 
A:  I don't think it  it 's related to syntax , though , so it may be entirely different . 
E:  Um , as a matter of fact  
G:  <sniff> 
C:  No , it 's not . 
B:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  Um . 
B:  I think  
E:  Did you ever get to look at the  the rou paper that I sent you on the  on that problem in English and German ? 
G:  <mike noise> 
E:  Carroll , ninety - three .  
E:  Um . 
E:  I  There is a  a study 
E:  on the differences between English and German on exactly that 
E:  problem . 
A:  Hmm . 
E:  So it 's  they actually say " the monkey in front of the car , where 's the monkey ? " 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And , um , they found statistically very significant differences in English and German , 
E:  so I  I  I  It might be , since there are only a finite number of ways of doing it , that  
E:  that German might be more like Hebrew in that respect . 
E:  The solution they proposed was that it was due to syntactic factors . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  That  but it wasn't  was  
E:  That syntactic facto factors do  do play a role there , wh whether you 're more likely , 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
E:  you know , 
E:  to develop uh , choices that lead you towards using uh intrinsic versus extrinsic reference frames . 
C:  Hmm . 
B:  I mean , it seems to me that you can get both in  in English depending o You know , like , " in front of the car " could you know  Like , 
B:  here 's the car sideways to me in between me and the car or something 's in front of the car , or whatever . I could see that , but  
C:  Absolutely . 
B:  But anyway , so you know , I mean , this was  this was a  a very good talk on those kinds of issues and so on . So uh . 


E:  I can also give you uh , a pointer to a paper of mine which is the  the ultimate taxonomy of reference frames . So . <laugh> I 'm the only person in the world who actually knows how it works . 
B:  Alright ! Cool ! <laugh> 
C:  Oh . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Oh . 
E:  Not really . 
C:  Great . No , I 've not seen that . 
E:  It 's called a  
A:  What do you mean . Um . 
A:  " reference frames " ? 
A:  uh 
E:  It 's  it 's spatial reference frames . You actually have only  
A:  uh 
E:  Um . 
E:  If you wanna have a  
E:  This is usually um  
E:  I should  there should be an " L " , though . 
E:  Well actually you have  only have two choices . You can either do a two - point 
E:  or a three - point 
E:  which is you 
E:  You 're familiar with th with the " origo " ? 
G:  <mike noise> 
E:  where that 's the center  " Origo " is the center of the f frame of reference . And then you have the 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  reference object and the object to be localized . 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  OK ? In some cases the origo 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  is 
E:  the same 
E:  as the reference object . 
F:  This was like  
C:  So that would be " origin " in English , right ? 
B:  The origin . Yeah . 
A:  Right 
E:  " Origo " is a Terminus technikus . in that sense , 
F:  <clears throat> 
E:  that 's even used in the English literature . " Origo . " 
B:  Oh , OK . I never heard it . OK . 
C:  Alright . 
A:  OK . 
E:  And um , 
E:  so , 
E:  this video tape is in front of me . I 'm the origo and I 'm also the reference object . Those are two - point . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And three - point relations is if something has an intrinsic front side like this chair then your f 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  shoe is behind the chair . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And , 
E:  reference object and  Um . 
E:  No , from  from my point of view your shoe is 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Right . 
E:  left of the chair . 
B:  You  you can actually say things like , um , 
B:  " it 's behind the tree from me " or something like that , I think , in  in  in certain circumstances in English , right ? As sort of " from where I 'm standing it would appear that "  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So , 
F:  Looks a little bit like Reichenbach for time . 
C:  Yeah , it sounds like it , doesn't it , yeah . 
F:  It 's a lot like it . Um . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  And then  and then here you  On this scale , you have it either be ego 
G:  <mike noise> 
E:  or allocentric . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And that 's   that 's basically 
E:  it . So . Egocentric two - point , egocentric three - point , or you can have allocentric . 
E:  So , " as seen from the church , the town hall is right of that 
B:  Oh , OK . 
E:  um , fire station " . 
E:  aa - huh  
E:  It 's hardly ever used but it 's w 


C:  Maybe just put a link on . Yeah . By the way , there  something that I didn't know until about 
E:  Yep . Yep . 
C:  a week ago or so , 
C:  is apparently , 
C:  there are 
C:  separate brain areas 
C:  for 
C:  things within reach , and things that are out of reach . 
C:  So there 's  there 's uh all this linguistic stuff about 
B:  Huh . 
C:  you know , near and far , or yon and  and so forth . So this is all  This is  There 's this linguistic facts . But apparently , 
B:  Mm - hmm . <outbreath> 
C:  the  Uh . Here 's the way the findings go . 
C:  That , 
C:  you know they do MRI , and  and if you 're uh  got something within reach then there 's one of your areas lights up , and if something 's out of reach 
C:  uh a different one . 
C:  But here 's the  the amazing result , 
C:  um , 
C:  they say . 
C:  You get someone with a  with a deficit 
C:  so that they have a perfectly normal ability at distance things . So 
C:  the s typical task is subdivision . So there 's a  a line on the wall over there , and you give them a laser pointer , and you say , 
C:  " Where 's the midpoint ? " And they do fine . 
C:  If you give them the line , and they have to touch it , they can't . 
C:  There 's just that part of the brain isn't functioning , so they can't do that . 
C:  Here 's the real experiment . 
C:  The same thing on the wall , you give them a laser , " where is it ? " , 
C:  they do it . Give them a stick , long stick , and say " do it " , they can't do it . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  So there 's a remapping of distant space into nearby space . 
A:  <mike noise> 
A:  Right . 
A:  So they doubled  the  the end  the end of this  
F:  Because it 's within reach now ? 
C:  It 's not within reach and you use the Within - Reach 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
F:  Oh . Wow . <laugh> 
C:  uh , mechanism . So I 'll d I 'll dig you up this reference . 
B:  Circuits . <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  Right . 
B:  That 's cool . <outbreath> 
C:  And so this doe This is , uh  First of all , it explains something that I 've always wondered about 
C:  and I 'll do this  this test on you guys as well . So . 
C:  Uh . 
C:  How - 
C:  I have had an experience , not often , but a certain number of times , when , for example , I 'm working with a tool , a screwdriver or something , for a long time , 
G:  <cough> 
C:  I start feeling the tip 
C:  directly . 
C:  Not indirectly , but you actually can feel 
B:  Yeah  yeah . 
C:  the tip . And people who are uh accomplished violinists and stuff like that , claim they also have this kind of thing where you 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  get a direct sensation 
C:  of , physical sensation , of 
C:  the end affector . 
B:  What 's going on at the end of the tool , yeah .  
A:  The ext the  the  The extension , right . 
C:  Huh ? 
B:  What 's going on at the end of the tool , or whatever . 
C:  Yeah , within  Huh ? 
A:  The extension of  of your hand , right . 
C:  Yeah , right . Have you hav y h had this ? 
A:  The  
A:  I  I think so . I mean i i it 's not exactly 
A:  the th same thing , but  but s it  it  it 's getting close to that . 
F:  W what does it feel like ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Oh i it feels like your  as if your 
C:  uh neurons had extended themselves out to this tool , and you 're feeling forces on it and so forth and  and you deal directly with it . 
F:  <door slams> 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  I once  
A:  I  I was playing you know with those um 
A:  uh devices that allow you to manipulate objects when it 's dangerous to get close ? 
C:  Right , yeah  yeah  yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Oh , OK . 
A:  So you can insert your hand something 
A:  and there 's a correspondence between  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  So I played with it . After a while , 
A:  you don't feel the difference anymore . 
F:  <outbreath> 
C:  Yeah , right . 
A:  I  I mean it 's kind of  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Very  kind of  you stop back 
A:  and suddenly it goes away 
B:  Yeah . <outbreath> 
A:  and you have to kind of work again 
C:  Right , right . 
A:  to recapture it , but yeah . 
C:  Yeah , so anyway , so  So this was the first actual experimental evidence I 'd seen that was consistent with this anecdotal stuff . 
B:  That 's cool . 
C:  And of course it makes a lovely def uh story about why 
C:  languages 
C:  uh , make this distinction . Of course there are behavioral differences too . Things you can reach are really quite different than things you can't . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  But there seems to be an actu really deep embodied 
C:  neural difference . And i this is , um  So . In addition to the 
C:  e 
E:  This is more proximal - distal . 
C:  Yeah uh exactly . So in addition to e ego and allocentric 
C:  uh which appear all over the place , you also apparently have this proximal - distal 
C:  thing which is very deeply uh embedded . 
C:  S 
E:  Well , Dan Montello sort of , he  he does the uh uh  th the cognitive map 
E:  world , down in Santa Barbara . 
F:  <sniff> 
E:  And he  he always talks about these  
E:  He  he already  well  i probably most likely without knowing this  this evidence uh is talking about these small scale spaces that you can manipulate versus large scale environmental spaces . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well there 's  there 's uh been a lot of behavioral things o on this , but that was the first neur neuro - physiological thing I saw . 


C:  So we gotta do all this . So there 's that . And then there 's also a set of system things that come up . 
C:  So " OK , we 're not using their system . That means we need 
C:  our system . " Right ? It  it follows . And so , 
B:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . <inbreath> 
C:  uh , in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right , and the formalism and stuff , we 're actually gonna build something 
C:  and uh , Johno is point person on the parser , analyzer , whatever that is , and we 're gonna start on that in parallel with the 
C:  um , the grammar stuff . But 
B:  Alright . 
C:  to do that 
C:  we 're gonna need to make some decisions like 
C:  ontology , 
C:  so , um  And so this is another thing where we 're gonna , you know , have to get involved and make s relatively early I think , make some decisions on 
F:  <clears throat> 
C:  uh , " is there an ontology API 
C:  that  that "  There 's a sort of standard way of getting things from ontologies and we 
C:  build the parser and stuff around that , or is there a particular ontology that we 're gonna standardize on , and if so  For example , is there something 
F:  <clears throat> 
F:  <sniff> 
C:  that we can use there . 
C:  i Does uh either the uh SmartKom project or one of the projects at EML 
C:  have something that we can just 
C:  p pull out , for that . 
C:  Uh , so there are gonna be some  some  some things like that , which are 
G:  <sniff> 
C:  not science but system . 
C:  But we aren't gonna ignore those cuz we 're  we 're not only going  The plan is not only to 
C:  lay out this thing , but to actually uh 
C:  build 
C:  some of it . 
C:  And how much we build , and  and so forth . 
B:  I  
G:   
E:   
F:   
B:   
C:   
A:   
D:   


C:  Uh . Part of it , if it works right , 
C:  is wh It looks like we 're now in a position 
C:  that 
C:  the 
C:  construction analyzer that we want for this 
C:  applied project 
C:  can be the same as the construction analyzer that Nancy needs for the child language modeling . 
C:  So . It 's always been out of phase but it now seems that 
C:  um , there 's a good shot at that . So we 've talked about it , and 
G:  <sniff> 
C:  the hope 
C:  is that we can make these things the same thing , 
G:  <sniff> 
B:  OK . 
C:  and of course it 's only w In both cases it 's only one piece of a bigger system . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  But it would be nice if that piece 
C:  were exactly the same piece . It was just this 
B:  Right . 
C:  uh 
C:  construction analyzer . 
A:  <mike noise> 
C:  And so we think  we think we 
C:  have a shot at  at that . 
B:  OK . 
D:   
A:   
B:   
C:   
G:   
E:   
F:   


C:  So . The for So . To  to come full circle on that , this formalization task , 
F:  <clears throat> 
G:  <outbreath> 
C:  OK ? is trying to 
C:  get the formalism into  into a shape where it can actually 
F:  <outbreath> 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  uh d 
B:  Be of use to someone who 's trying to do this , right ?  
C:  Well , yeah , where it actually is  is  covers the whole range of things . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <outbreath> 
C:  And the  the  the  the thing that got Mark into the worst trouble is he 
C:  had a very ambitious thing he was trying to do , and 
G:  <sniff> 
C:  he insisted on trying to do it with a limited set of mechanisms . It turned out , inherently not to cover the space . 
B:  OK . 
C:  And it just  it was just terribly frustrating for him , and he seemed fully committed to both 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  sides of this 
G:  <outbreath> 
B:  I see . 
G:  <sniff> 
C:  i i irreconcilable thing . 
B:  Right . <laugh> 
C:  And . 
C:  Uh . Johno is much more pragmatic . 
B:  OK . 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  Uh . 
B:  <laugh> Good to know . <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
C:  Huh ? 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Is  This is true , is it not ? 
D:  Yes . 
F:  <cough> 
C:  OK . So there 's you know sort of , yeah , deep , really deep , emotional commitment to a certain theory being 
G:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh , OK . 
C:  uh , complete . 
F:  You don't have a hidden purist streak ? 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh no . 
F:  OK . Just checking . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> We - well it hasn't it  it certainly hasn't been observed , in any case . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  No sir . 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  Alright . 
C:  Um . 
C:  Now , you do , but that 's OK . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Uh . So . For  for  
B:  Cuz I don't have to implement anything . <laugh> 
C:  Exactly right . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  I have a problem , then . <laugh> 
C:  Exactly . 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  <sniff> 
F:  It 's  So . Whether I do depends on whether I 'm talking to him or him probably . Which meeting I 'm in . 
A:  Hmm . 
B:  Yeah , right . <laugh> 
C:  Right . Why  a actually , uh , the thing is , you  you do but , th the thing you have to im implement is so small that  
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  It 's OK to be purist within that context . Yes , good . <laugh> 
C:  Uh . 
C:  Within that , yeah , and uh , it 's  a and still , I think , you know , get something done . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Cool ! 
F:  <inbreath> 
C:  But to try to do something upscale and purist 
F:  Yay . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Particularly if  if 
C:  um 
C:  what you 're purist about doesn't actually work , <laugh> is real hard . 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 


C:  OK . And then the other thing is 
A:  @ @ It 's possible yeah . 
C:  while we 're doing this 
C:  uh 
C:  Robert 's gonna pick a piece of this space , 
G:  <sniff> 
B:  OK . 
C:  OK , 
C:  uh , 
C:  for 
C:  his absentee thesis . I think you all know that  that you can just , in Germany  almost just send in your thesis . 
G:  <sniff> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  Just a drive up . Ca - chuk !  There you go .  
C:  Yeah right . OK .  
G:  <laugh> 
A:  Um 
E:  The - th 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  There  there 's a drive - in thesis uh sh <laugh> joint over in Saarbruecken . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Exactly . Drive through , yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  It costs a lot . The  the amount  You put in your credit card and  <laugh> as well . But , uh ,  But anyway , so , uh , 
F:  <clears throat> <sniff> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  that 's 
G:  <sniff> 
C:  um , also 
C:  gotta be worked out , hopefully over the next few weeks , so that  that it becomes clear 
C:  uh , what piece 
C:  uh , Robert wants to jump into . 
C:  And , while we 're at this level , uh , 
C:  there 's at least one new 
C:  doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project , either 
C:  next week or the first of August , depending on 
C:  the blandishments of Microsoft . So , de 
B:  OK .  
F:  <outbreath> 
C:  Uh . And her name is Eva . 
B:  OK . 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  It really is . Nobody believed th th that  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , I thought it had to be a joke , 
G:  <laugh> 
F:  of your part , you know like   " Johno made it up , I 'm sure . "  
G:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  Is this person someone who 's in first - year this year , or  
C:  No , first year coming . So , she 's  she 's now out here she 's moved , and she 'll be a student as of 
G:  OK . 
C:  then . And probably she 'll pick up from you on the belief - net stuff , so sh she 'll be chasing you down and stuff like that . 
G:  OK . 
E:  Document . 
C:  Uh . 
G:  <laugh> 
G:  Right . 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  Uh , against all traditions .  
G:  <laugh> 
C:  And actually I talked today to a 
G:  <sniff> 
C:  uh undergraduate who wants to do an honors thesis on this . 
C:  Uh  
F:  Someone from the class ? 
C:  No , interestingly enough . 
F:  We always get these people who are not in the class , who  It 's interesting . 
C:  Some of th some of them , yeah . 
C:  So anyway , uh , but uh she 's another one of these ones with a three point nine average and so forth and so on . 
G:  <sniff> 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <sniff> 
C:  Uh , so , 
C:  um , I 've give I 've given her some things to read . 
C:  So we 'll see how this goes . Oh there 's yet another one of the incoming 
C:  first   incoming first - year graduate students who 's expressed interest , so we 'll see how that goes . 


G:  <sniff> 
C:  Um , 
C:  anyway , 
C:  so , 
F:  <clears throat> 
C:  I think as far as 
C:  this group goes , 
C:  um , 
F:  <outbreath> 
C:  it 's certainly worth continuing 
C:  for the next few weeks 
G:  <sniff> 
C:  to get closure 
C:  on the uh 
C:  belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts . 
G:  <sniff> 
C:  We 'll see 
C:  whether 
C:  it 's gonna make sense to have this be separate from the other 
C:  bigger effort with the formalization stuff or not , I 'm not sure . It partly depends on w 
C:  what your thesis turns out to be and 
C:  how that goes . 
C:  S so , we 'll see . And then , Ami , you can decide , you know , how much time you wanna put into it and uh , 
F:  <door slams> 
A:  <background noise> 
A:  OK . 
C:  it it 's beginning to take shap shape , so 
C:  uh 
A:  Right 
C:  and , I think you will find 
G:  <sniff> 
C:  that 
C:  if you want to 
C:  look technically 
C:  at some of the  your traditional questions in this light , 
C:  uh Keith , who 's buil building constructions , will be 
C:  quite happy to 
C:  uh 
C:  see what , you know , you envision as the issues and the problems and 
C:  um , how they might uh 
C:  get reflected in constructions . 
B:  Sure . 
C:  I suspect that 's right . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  So we 'll set that up . 
A:  Cool . 
C:  OK . So , 
C:  uh , unless we wanna start 
C:  digging into the  
C:  uh 
C:  the belief - net and the decisions now , which would be fine , it 's probably  
E:  I  I tho It 's probably better if I come 
E:  next week with the 
E:  um 
E:  version O point nine 
C:  OK . So , how about if you two guys between now and next week 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  of the structure . 
G:  <laugh> 
C:  come up with something that 
C:  is partially proposal , and partially questions , saying " here 's what we think we understand , here are the things we think we don't understand " . 
C:  And that we as a group will try to  to finish it . What I 'd like to do is shoot f for finishing all this next Monday . 
G:  Sure . 
C:  OK ? Uh , " these are the decisions "  I don't think we 're gonna get lots more information . It 's a design problem . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Yeah . 
C:  You know . We  
C:  Yeah .  
C:  And let 's come up with a first cut at what this should look like . 
C:  And then finish it up . Does that so make sense ? 


A:  I  I may have to go to Switzerland for  in June or beginning of July for 
G:  <sniff> 
A:  between two weeks and four weeks , but uh , 
A:  after that or before that . 
C:  OK , fine . 
C:  And , um , 
C:  if it 's useful we can probably arrange for you to drop by and visit either at Heidelberg or 
C:  at the German AI center , 
C:  while you 're in  in the neighborhood . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah be uh actu actually 
A:  I 'm invited to do some consulting with a bank in Geneva which has 
C:  Yeah . Yep . 
A:  an affiliation with a research institute in Geneva , which I forgot the name of . 
C:  E o do y Well , we we 're connected to 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  uh  There 's a  there 's a  a very significant connection between  We 'll  we 'll go through this , 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  ICSI and EPFL , which is the , uh  
G:  <mike noise> 
C:  It 's the  
C:  Fr - Ge - Germany 's got two big 
C:  technical institutes . There 's one in  in 
C:  Zurich , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  E T H , and then there 's one , the French speaking one , 
C:  in Lausanne , 
C:  OK ? which is uh E P F L . 
B:  Oh , so in Switzerland . 
C:  So find out who they are associated with in Geneva . Probably we 're connected to them . 
A:  Great . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Great . I 'll let you know . 
F:  <inbreath> 
A:  S I 'll send you email . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Yeah , and so anyway we c uh  
C:  We can m undoubtedly get Ami uh to give a talk at uh EML or something like that . While he 's in  in uh  
G:  <sniff> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Hmm . Uh . I  I think the one you  you gave here a couple of weeks ago would be of interest there , too . 
C:  A lot of interest . Actually , either place , DFKI or uh  
A:  Sure , yeah . 
C:  Yeah , so , and  and if there is a book , that you 'll be building up 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
C:  some audience for it . And you 'll get feedback from these guys . Cuz they 've actually  
A:  Great , yeah . 
C:  these DFKI guys have done as much as anyone 
C:  over the last decade in trying to build them . 
G:  <sniff> 


B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
E:  And um , the  the sem semester will be over 
E:  next week but then you have projects 
E:  for one more week to come ? 
G:  No , I  I think I 'll be done  everything by this uh  by the end of this week . 
E:  Same with you ? No . 
D:  Nnn . This  Well , I 've  I have projects , but then the  my prof professor of one of my classes also wa has a final 
G:  <sniff> 
D:  that he 's giving us . And he 's giving us five days to do it which means 
D:  it going to be hard . <laugh> 
F:  <sniff> 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . Oh . is it a take - home final ? Who 's doing this ? 
G:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . Aikin , Alex , yeah . 
C:  Yeah , figured . That would have been i my guess . 
G:  Hmm . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Right . 
C:  Um , 
C:  But anyway , yeah . 
B:  Pretty soon . <laugh> 
E:  OK .  
C:  OK , so I guess that 's 
D:  So , the seventeenth will definitely be the last day , like it or not for me . <laugh> 
G:  <sniff> 
C:  <outbreath> 
C:  Right . right . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  So let 's do this , and then we we well there 's gonna be some separate co these guys are talking , 
F:  <sniff> <outbreath> 
G:  <outbreath> <sniff> 
C:  uh we have a group on the formalization , uh Nancy and Johno and I are gonna talk about parsers . So there 're various kinds of 
G:  <sniff> 
B:  OK . 
C:  uh  
C:  Of course , 
C:  nothing gets done even in a meeting of seven people , right ? So , um , 
B:  Right .  
E:  Mmm . 
C:  two or three people is the size in which 
C:  actual work gets done . 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  So we 'll do that . 
C:  Great . Oh , the other thing we wanna do is catch up with 
G:  <sniff> 
C:  uh , Ellen and see what she 's doing because the um image schemas 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  are going to be 
C:  um , an important pa We  we want those , right ? And we want them formalized and stuff like that . 
B:  Quite relevant , yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , oh yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  So let me  let me make a note to do that . 
B:  OK . Yeah , I 'm actually probably going to be in contact with her uh pretty soon anyway because of various of us students were going to have a reading group about 
D:  OK .  
B:  precisely that sort of thing over the summer , so . <inbreath> 
C:  Oh right ! Right right right ! That 's great ! Yeah , I  I  Shweta mentioned that , 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  OK . 
C:  although she said it 's a secret . 
D:  Hi @ @ <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Right , no faculty ! <laugh> 
C:  Th - the faculty aren't  faculty aren't supposed to know . 
D:  Wednesday 's much better for me , yeah .  
C:  But um , 
G:  <mike noise> 
C:  I 'm sufficiently clueless that I count as a  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , right . <laugh> It 's as if we didn't tell anyone at all , right . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Bhaskara .  
D:  <laugh>
