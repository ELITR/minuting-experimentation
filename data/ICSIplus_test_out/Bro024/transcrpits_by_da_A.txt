A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , 
A:  OK . 
A:  Um , so for the past , <breath> uh , week an or two , I 've been just writing my , uh , formal thesis proposal . 
A:  Um , so I 'm taking <breath> this qualifier exam that 's coming up in two weeks . 
A:  And I  I finish writing a proposal and submit it to the committee . 
A:  Um . 
A:  And uh , should I  should I explain , uh , more about what  what I 'm proposing to do , and s and stuff ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Um , 
A:  so briefly , <breath> I 'm proposing to do a n a new p approach to speech recognition using um , a combination of , uh , multi - band ideas and ideas , um , <breath> <mouth noise>  about the uh , acoustic phonec phonetic approach to speech recognition . 
A:  Um , so I will be using <breath> these graphical models that  um , that implement the multi - band approach <breath> to recognize a set of intermediate categories that might involve , uh , things like phonetic features <breath> or other  other f feature things that are more closely related to the acoustic signal itself . 
A:  Um , and the hope in all of this is that by going multi - band and by going into these , <breath> um intermediate classifications , <breath> that we can get a system that 's more robust to  to unseen noises , and situations like that . 
A:  Um , 
A:  and so , 
A:  some of the research issues involved in this are , <breath> um , <mouth noise>  one , what kind of intermediate categories do we need to classify ? 
A:  Um , another one is <breath> um , what  what other types of structures in these multi - band graphical models should we consider in order to um , combine evidence from <breath> the sub - bands ? 
A:  And , uh , the third one is how do we  how do we merge all the , uh , information from the individual uh , multi - band classifiers to come up with word  word recognition or  or phone recognition things . 
A:  Um , 
A:  so basically that 's  that 's what I 've been doing . 
A:  And , 
A:  I got two weeks to brush up on d um , presentation stuff 
A:  and , um , 
A:  But . 
A:  Oh , that too . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yes . 
A:  Yes . 
A:  I , um  I 'm  I 'm gonna do some . 
A:  Would you be interested ? 
A:  To help out ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Thanks . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  That 's it . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Is this  is this VAD a MLP ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  How  how big is it ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Seven . 
A:  So I  I 'm eight , 
A:  you 're seven . 
A:  Yeah .
