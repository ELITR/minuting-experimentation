F:  Hey Dave ? 
F:  Could you go ahead and turn on , uh , Stephane 's  
F:  OK . 
F:  Uh , yeah , 
F:  a Linux box . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  It 's got , uh , like sixteen channels going into it . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  so far , it 's been pretty good . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Why don't you go ahead , Dave ? 
F:  That 's on digits ? 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  You can also  
F:  you can also reflect the data . 
F:  So you take , uh  
F:  you know , 
F:  I 'm not sure how many frames you need . 
F:  But you take that many from the front and flip it around to  a as the negative value . 
F:  So you can always  
F:  Do you wanna go , Barry ? 
F:  Yeah briefly . 
F:  So you 've got two weeks , huh ? 
F:  Are you gonna do any dry runs for your thing , 
F:  or are you just gonna  
F:  Sure . 
F:  Sure . 
F:  Is that it ? 
F:  Hhh . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Uh . Hhh . 
F:  Let 's see . 
F:  So we 've got forty minutes left , 
F:  and it seems like there 's a lot of material . 
F:  An - any suggestions about where we  where we should go next ? 
F:  Uh . 
F:  Do you wanna go , Sunil ? 
F:  Maybe we 'll just start with you . 
F:  So n s So since the high mismatch performance is much worse to begin with , it 's easier to get a better relative improvement . 
F:  Well , but that involves mucking with the back - end , 
F:  which is not allowed . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Thanks Adam . 
F:  So is , uh  Is that about it ? 
F:  Or  ? 
F:  This is for the LDA ? 
F:  Oh . 
F:  What  where was the , um  the smallest latency of all the systems last time ? 
F:  What  what was it ? 
F:  Thirteen ? 
F:  Thirty . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I was just curious about where we are compared to , you know , the shortest that people have done . 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK , 
F:  we 've got twenty minutes 
F:  so we should <breath> probably try to move along . 
F:  Uh , did you wanna go next , Stephane ? 
F:  I can share with Barry . 
F:  So is  that it ? 
F:  So we need to combine these two . 
F:  Carmen ? 
F:  Do you , uh  
F:  So , um , 
F:  what 's  Do you think we , uh , should do the digits or skip it ? 
F:  Or what are  what do you think ? 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  got them . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Would you pass those down ? 
F:  OK , 
F:  um , 
F:  so I guess I 'll go ahead . 
F:  Um , 
F:  OK , 
F:  if you could just leave , um , your mike on top of your , uh , digit form 
F:  I can fill in any information that 's missing . 
F:  That 's uh  
F:  I didn't get a chance to fill them out ahead of time . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  we 're gonna have to fix that . 
F:  Uh , let 's see , 
F:  it starts with one here , and then goes around and ends with nine here . 
F:  So he 's eight , 
F:  you 're seven ,
