A:  Hmm . 
A:  I 'm 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yes . 
A:  Was he supposed to harass me ? 
A:  Well , he just told me that you came looking for me . 
A:  figure this out . 
A:  I know , 
A:  I didn't understand that either ! 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  It hurts . 
A:  It does ! 
A:  I 'm sorry I didn't mean to  
A:  I 'm sorry . 
A:  I 'm sorry , oh these are all the same . 
A:  OK ! th this is not very  on target . 
A:  Shoot . 
A:  Alright , you guys can continue talking about whatever you were talking about before . 
A:  Oh ! Which Johno mentioned to me . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  What 's the part that 's not pretend ? 
A:  The writing ? 
A:  Tha - <laugh> Which conference is it for ? 
A:  Oh . Wow . Interesting . 
A:  Whinney .  MacWhinney. Uh - huh . 
A:  So , interesting , both , like , child language people . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah , maybe I wanna go . 
A:  Um , why are they speaking at it if it  
A:  is  is it normally like  like , dialogue systems , or , you know , other NLP - ish things ? 
A:  Oh , it 's cognitive . 
A:  OK . 
A:  And 
A:  uh , both learning and like , comprehension , production , that kinda stuff . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  I don't know about it . 
A:  Yeah that 's pretty soon . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  I mean , th that 's the kinda thing that maybe like , um , the general uh con sort of like NTL - ish like , whatever , the previous simulation based pers  maybe you 're talking about the same kind of thing . A general paper about the approach here would probably be appropriate . 
A:  And good to do at some point anyway . 
A:  Um . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Having it is still a good thing . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . It 's fun . 
A:  When is it and where ? 
A:  Ah , it 's in Germany . 
A:  Ah , OK . I s I see . 
A:  Tomasello 's already in Germany anyway , 
A:  so makes sense . OK . 
A:  Um . OK . 
A:  So , is the  What  Are you just talking about you know , the details of how to do it , or whether to do it , or what it would be ? 
A:  Or what to write about ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  How many pages ? 
A:  Four pages ? 
A:  OK , so it 's a little thing . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  OK . Four pages is , like , really not very much space . 
A:  It 's  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  And it 's also difficult to  even if you had a lot of substance , it 's hard to demonstrate that in four pages , basically . 
A:  Um . 
A:  I mean it 's still  it 's still  
A:  Uh - huh , uh - huh . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Not including figures and such ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Well , 
A:  ASCII ? 
A:  OK , look at the web page ? 
A:  Wha - w 
A:  More cues for us to find it are like , neural cons 
A:  Oh , you have a link . OK . OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Oh . Cool . Keith . 
A:  Cool , " cool Keith " . 
A:  Excellent . 
A:  That 's a very cool T - shirt . 
A:  New York ? 
A:  Excellent . 
A:  Sorry . Yes ? 
A:  Oh , lucky you . 
A:  The idea that you and I already know about ? 
A:  That you already told me ? 
A:  Not that  
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  That 's what  That 's what he says . 
A:  I kn That 's great ! 
A:  Does that mean  Does that mean you 'll get  you 'll fly us there ? 
A:  Hhh ! 
A:  OK , cool . 
A:  Uh - a a 
A:  I know  I know about that part . 
A:  I know about the  the almond trees and stuff . 
A:  Not joking . 
A:  Name a vegetable , 
A:  OK . <laugh> Oh , um , kiwi ? 
A:  Coconut . 
A:  Pineapple . 
A:  See ? 
A:  Mango ? 
A:  OK . OK . Too easy ? 
A:  Really ? 
A:  Oh . OK , but I was trying to find something that he didn't grow on his farm . 
A:  Sorry . 
A:  Anyway . 
A:  Cantaloupe . 
A:  But then in the end we 're not doing like those things right yet , right ? 
A:  Would that be clear in the paper or not ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  It would be like , this is the idea . 
A:  Oh , I didn't get that , 
A:  did I ? 
A:  Oops . 
A:  Did I ? 
A:  Oops .  Sorry . 
A:  I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . Sorry . 
A:  OK , go on . 
A:  So parsing done right <laugh> is like chicken done right . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Parsing done right , interpretation done right , example . 
A:  And how much to get into the cognitive neural part ? 
A:  Well , you don't have t 
A:  I mean the conference may be cognitive neural , 
A:  doesn't mean that every paper has to be both . 
A:  Like , NLP cognitive neural . 
A:  So i so this paper wouldn't particularly deal with that side 
A:  although it could reference the NTL - ish sort of , like , um , approach . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  The fact that the methods here are all compatible with or designed to be compatible with whatever , neurological  neuro neuro - biol su stuff . 
A:  Yeah , I guess four pages you could  
A:  I mean you could definitely  it 's definitely possible to do it . 
A:  It 's just  It 'd just be small . 
A:  Like introducing the formalism might be not really possible in detail , 
A:  but you can use an example of it . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  So it be like using the formalism rather than you know , introducing it per se . 
A:  So . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  And people will sort of figure out or ask about the bits that are implicit . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  That 's th that 's definitely a good idea . 
A:  No . Sorry . 
A:  Yes ! 
A:  What 'd you say ? 
A:  I do remember you talking to me . 
A:  Um , 
A:  a few more bits . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Oh , yeah . OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  So that was  was that the question ? 
A:  Was that what  
A:  Oh my god , that 's amazing ! 
A:  No way . 
A:  Someone 's gonna start making Phil Collins jokes . 
A:  Sorry . 
A:  You guys are too young . 
A:  Yeah , come on . 
A:  I know , that was horrible . 
A:  Sussudio . 
A:  I 'm sorry , I haven't . 
A:  Not on purpose . 
A:  No , he 's not . 
A:  Really ? 
A:  Oops .  I didn't really listen to it , 
A:  I was too young . 
A:  Anyway . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Stop excluding me . 
A:  I can't believe that that 's never been thought of before . 
A:  Cool Keith . 

A:  Wait , wait , what 's the middle thing ? 
A:  But wh I mean  
A:  But what is it ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Is that supposed to be the international sign for interface ? 
A:  Mmm . OK . 
A:  OK . Just t 
A:  Cool . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Cool . 
A:  That 's so great . 
A:  User ? 
A:  What about the utterance ? 
A:  Oh , discourse . 
A:  So that 's not like context , OK . 
A:  Interesting , 
A:  uh - huh . 
A:  User . 
A:  User . 
A:  Grateful for us ? 
A:  Did you just say grateful for us ? 
A:  OK , sorry . 
A:  Anyway . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 

A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  So it 's not just a particular word 's  
A:  OK , so the  you 're looking for a few keys that you know are cues to  sorry , a few specific cues to some intention . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Just  
A:  OK . Just " where is X " ? 
A:  Or any variants of that . 
A:  s 
A:  That it has a location or something like that ?  
A:  or th the ontology will tell us where actually it is located ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  So you 're talking about , for instance , the construction obviously involves this entity or refers  refers to this entity , 
A:  and from the construction also you know that it is a location  
A:  is  or a thing  thing that can be located . 
A:  Right ? Ontology says this thing has a location slot . 
A:  Sh - and that 's the thing that is being  that is the content of the question that 's being queried by one interpretation of " where is X " . 
A:  And another one is , um , path from current  user current location to  that location . 
A:  So . 
A:  So is the question  
A:  I mean it 's just that I 'm not sure what the  
A:  Is the question , for this particular construction how we specify that that 's the information it provides ? 
A:  Or  or asked for ? 
A:  b Both sides , right ? 
A:  Observed when you heard the speaker say " where is X " , or when  when that 's been parsed ? 
A:  So these little circles you have by the D ? 
A:  Is that  ? 
A:  OK . OK . 
A:  Is - uh , 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So un 
A:  So I agree with that . 
A:  I have a different kinda question , 
A:  might be related , 
A:  which is , OK so implicitly everything in EDU , we 're always inferring the speaker intent , right ? 
A:  Like , what they want 
A:  either , the information that they want , or  
A:  It 's always information that they want probably , of some kind . 
A:  Right ? 
A:  Or I  I don't know , 
A:  or what 's something that they  
A:  I  I  I don't  
A:  OK . 
A:  So , um , 
A:  let 's see . 
A:  So I don't know if the  I mean i if th just there 's more s here that 's not shown that you  it 's already like part of the system whatever , 
A:  but , " where is X " , like , the fact that it is , you know , a speech - act , whatever , 
A:  it is a question . 
A:  It 's a question that , um , queries on some particular thing X , 
A:  and X is that location . 
A:  There 's , like , a lot of structure in representing that . 
A:  So that seems different from just having the node " location - X " 
A:  and that goes into EDU , right ? 
A:  So tha is that what you 're t talking about ? 
A:  wh what kinds of structure we want . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  OK . So in some ways  
A:  um , so in some ways in the other sort of parallel set of mo more linguistic meetings we 've been talking about possible semantics of some construction . 
A:  Right ? 
A:  Where it was 
A:  the simulation that 's , according to it  you know , that  that corresponds to it , and as well the  as discourse , 
A:  whatever , conte infor in discourse information , 
A:  such as the mood , 
A:  and , you know , other stuff . 
A:  So , are we looking for a sort of abbreviation of that , that 's tailored to this problem ? 
A:  Cuz that  that has , you know , basically , you know , s it 's in progress still 
A:  it 's in development still , 
A:  but it definitely has various feature slots , attributes , um , bindings between things  
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  For the subset of  
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . That exactly " where is X " , 
A:  not the  the choices of " where is X " or " how do I get to X " . 
A:  Just " where is X " . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Wait , so do , or do not take other kinds of constructions into account ? 
A:  OK . Where possible . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Um , it seems like for instance , " where is X " , the fact that it might mean um , " tell me how to get to X " , 
A:  like  
A:  Do y So , would you wanna say that those two are both , like  
A:  Those are the two interpretations , right ? 
A:  the  the ones that are location or path . 
A:  So , you could say that the s construction is a question asking about this location , 
A:  and then you can additionally infer , if they 're asking about the location , it 's because they wanna go to that place , 
A:  in which case , the  you 're jumping a step  step and saying , " oh , I know where it is 
A:  but I also know how to get  they wanna seem  they seem to wanna get there so I 'm gonna tell them " . 
A:  So there 's like structure 
A:  i do you kn sort of uh , that  
A:  So it 's like you infer the speaker intent , 
A:  and then infer a plan , a larger plan from that , for which you have the additional information , 
A:  you 're just being extra helpful . 
A:  Um . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  And just by an additional link  
A:  Oh . 
A:  Right , 
A:  like , 
A:  with context and enough user information , 
A:  yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Fifty ? 
A:  You 've had fifty so far , 
A:  or  ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Hmm .
