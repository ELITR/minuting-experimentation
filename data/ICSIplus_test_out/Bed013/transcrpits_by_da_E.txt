E:  Right . 
E:  As usual . 
E:  Something 's not right here . 
E:  What a great time to be coming back to the 
E:  You 'll see maybe  see the fireworks from your plane coming in . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  You 'll get even better service than usual . 
E:  Oh great . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Except this smacks a little bit more of a schizophrenic computer than AI . 
E:  That 's good . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Right , right . 
E:  Yeah . No problem . 
E:  Mmm , I don't know . 
E:  e I 'm sort of  have the impression that getting it to say the right thing in the right circumstances is much more difficult than getting it to understand something given the circumstances and so on , 
E:  you know , I mean just cuz it 's sort of harder to learn to speak correctly in a foreign language , rather than learning to understand it . Right ? 
E:  I mean 
E:  just the fact that we 'll get  The point is that getting it to understand one construction doesn't mean that it will n always know exactly when it 's correct to use that construction . Right ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Nnn , yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Well you 're not gonna  are you gonna get a variety of intentions out of that then ? 
E:  I mean , you 're just talking about like given this user , what 's the th what is it  what is that user most likely to want to do ? 
E:  And , have it talk about  
E:  OK . 
E:  Oh . 
E:  I don't know if that 's right or not . 
E:  Th - that 's big . 
E:  That 's just  That 's uh  It 's a billion , right ? 
E:  Right . 
E:  Argh . 
E:  Oh , OK . 
E:  Yeah . Yeah , that 's big . 
E:  Sure . 
E:  Alright . 
E:  OK . So , is it t comes to twenty billion or something ? 
E:  That 's pretty big , though . 
E:  I remember there being some other one floating around . 
E:  But anyway , uh . 
E:  Yeah , it 's g Anyway , the point is that given all of these different factors , it 's uh e it 's  it 's still going to be impossible to run through all of the possible situations or whatever . 
E:  But I mean , this 'll get us a bit closer at least , right ? 
E:  I mean . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Long ! 
E:  Tah - dah ! 
E:  Here in the group ? 
E:  Jerry Feldman . 
E:  Yeah , i that would the g the bald guy . 
E:  I 'm not going back . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Non - conducive . 
E:  That 's approaching . 
E:  He 's coming back when ? 
E:  Uh next  
E:  OK . 
E:  Alright . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Well , um , I don't have much experience with uh , conference papers for compu in the computer science realm , 
E:  and so when I looked at what you had , which was apparently a complete submission , I just sort of said 
E:  what  just  
E:  I  I didn't really know what to do with it , 
E:  like , this is the sort of the basic outline of the system or whatever , 
E:  or  
E:  or 
E:  " here 's an idea " , right ? 
E:  That 's what that paper was , 
E:  " here 's  here 's one possible thing you could do " , 
E:  short , 
E:  eight pages , 
E:  and I just don't know what you have in mind for expanding . 
E:  Like I 'd  I  what I didn't do is go to the web site of the conference 
E:  and look at what they 're looking for or whatever . 
E:  Right . Oh , yeah . 
E:  Setting that aside . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Backwards . 
E:  There 's a s diagram somewhere which tells you how to put that  
E:  But that 's what you get for coming late to the meeting . 
E:  Um , 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  About how <laugh> all of these things  
E:  The submitting to a major international conference .   Yeah . 

E:  Mmm . <outbreath> Mmm . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Why , we 've got over a week ! 
E:  Hmm ! 
E:  Just  
E:  What would one possibly put in such a paper ? 
E:  Are in the process of  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh . 
E:  Oh my gosh . Oh , I thought you were  I thought we were talking about something 
E:  which was much more like ten or something . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  That would be hard . 
E:  Four thousand lines . 
E:  I mean . Isn't a isn't it about fifty s fifty five , sixty lines to a page ? 
E:  He  he decided <laugh> I 'm chilling in the five - one - O . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Thank you . 
E:  I got this from the two one two . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  The thing with the goats and the helicopters ? 
E:  No . 
E:  Oh . 
E:  Oh , shoot . 
E:  We 'll see . 
E:  Huh . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So , but we have to decide what , like , sort of the general idea of  

E:  Um , 
E:  I mean , we 're gonna have an example case 
E:  um , right ? 
E:  I m the  the point is to  like this " where is " case , or something . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Well , l looking at  
E:  yeah , looking at that paper that  that you had , I mean you know , like , you didn't really explain in detail what was going on in the XML cases or whatever 
E:  you just sorta said well , you know , here 's the general idea , 
E:  some stuff gets put in there . 
E:  You know , hopefully you can  you can say something like constituents tells you what the construction is made out of , you know , without going into this intense detail . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Give them the one paragraph whirlwind tour of w w what this is for , 
E:  and  Yeah . 
E:  I think so . 
E:  Oh I saw the diagram in the office , 
E:  Way ! 
E:  Oh , god , I hope not . 
E:  You know like " Sussudio " , 
E:  that horrible , horrible song that should never have been created . 
E:  in here 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  It sounds too rocking for that . 
E:  Anyway . So , what 's going on here ? 
E:  So what are  what  
E:  Was wollte der Kuenstler uns damit sagen ? 
E:  Those are little bugs . 
E:  That 's a c 
E:  That 's  
E:  Cuz things fit onto that , see ? 
E:  In a vaguely obscene fashion . 
E:  So wait , 
E:  what a what are these letters again , 
E:  Situr -  Situation , User , Discourse and 
E:  Ontology . 
E:  It 's  
E:  Discourse is all things linguistic , yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Uh , so , wait  so um , since this  since this sort of technical stuff is going over my head , 
E:  the  the point is that you uh  that when someone 's talking about a castle , you know that it 's the sort of thing that people are likely to wanna go into ? 
E:  Or , is it the fact that if there 's an admission fee , then one of the things we know about admission fees is that you pay them in order to go in ? 
E:  And then the idea of entering is active in the discourse or something ? And then 
E:  blah - blah - blah ? 
E:  I mean . 
E:  Oh , OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  So  
E:  No , go ahead . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Mm - hmm . OK . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . But you 're still doing look up so that when the person  So the point is that when the person says , " where is it ? " then you sort of say , let 's go back and look at other things and then decide , 
E:  rather than the other possibility which is that  all through discourse as they talk about different things  
E:  You know like w 
E:  prior to the " where is it " question they say , you know , " how much does it cost to get in , you know , to  to see a movie around here " , 
E:  um , <mouth> " where is the closest theater "  
E:  The  the  the point is that by mentioning admission fees , that just sort of stays active now . 
E:  You know . That becomes part of like , their sort of current ongoing active conceptual structure . 
E:  And then , um , over in your Bayes - net or whatever , when  when the person says " where is it " , you 've already got , you know since they were talking about admission , and that evokes the idea of entering , um , then when they go and ask " where is it " , then you 're Enter node is already active 
E:  because that 's what the person is thinking about . 
E:  I mean that 's the sort of cognitive linguistic - y way , 
E:  and probably not practical . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mmm , yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  And much harder to r program . 
E:  And much harder to p to program . 
E:  Uh 
E:  Well we were 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  So , um , we 're supposed to  
E:  I mean we 're talking about sort of anything that has the semantics of request for location , right ? 
E:  actually ? 
E:  Or , 
E:  I mean , anyway , the node in the uh  the ultimate , uh , in  in the Bayes - net thing when you 're done , the  the node that we 're talking about um , is one that says " request for location , true " , or something like that , right ? 
E:  Um , and  and exactly how that gets activated , you know , like whether we want the sentence " how do I get there ? " to activate that node or not , you know , that 's  that 's sort of the issue that sort of the linguistic - y side has to deal with , right ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Alright , OK . 
E:  Oy . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  I 'm thinking about it . 
E:  Um  
E:  I kinda like it better without that extra level of indirection too . 
E:  You know with  with this points to this points to that , and so on 
E:  because <inbreath> I don't know , it  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Right , th this  it 's not  it 's not that this is sort of like semantically ambiguous between these two . 
E:  It 's really about this 
E:  but why would you care about this ? 
E:  Well , it 's because you also want to know this , or something like that right ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Here 's hoping . 
E:  Here 's hoping . Right ? 
E:  Now cross your fingers . 
E:  Yeah .  Yeah . 
E:  Um - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  That 's always a good way to begin . Yeah . Yeah . 
E:  All others are useless . 
E:  That 's good . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  True . 
E:  Huh . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Sure . 
E:  Yeah , I 'll have to look more into that data . 
E:  Is that around ? 
E:  Like , cuz that 's pretty much getting posted or something right away when you get it ? 
E:  Or  ? 
E:  I guess it has to be transcribed , huh ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  You know  
E:  I mean you know that I  that I looked at the first  the first one and got enough data to keep me going for , you know , probably most of July . 
E:  So . <inbreath> But , um . 
E:  Yeah , a probably not the right way to do it actually . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Right .
