A:  OK . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Files and directories ? 
A:  And I  and I think a crucial part of that is the idea of  of not wanting to do it until right before the next level zero back - up so that there won't be huge number of  of added , 
A:  uh  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Oh , excellent . 
A:  Oh , good . 
A:  I 'm sorry , you 've been what ? 
A:  Showing them ? 
A:  Sharing them . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  As long as they have one number , and they know that there 's only one beep maximum <laugh> that goes with that number . 
A:  Well , you know , actually , are we having them  
A:  Yeah , but are we having them do digits ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  That 'd be great . 
A:  That 'd be what I 'm having the transcribers here do , cuz it can be extracted later . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  We 're doing well . 
A:  I  I hire  I 've hired two extra people already , expect to hire two more . 
A:  And , um , <breath> I 've prepared , um , uh , a set of five which I 'm  which I 'm calling set two , 
A:  which are now being edited by my head transcriber , <breath> in terms of spelling errors and all that . 
A:  She 's also checking through and mar and  <breath> and monitoring , um , the transcription of another transcriber . 
A:  You know , I mean , she 's going through and doing these kinds of checks . 
A:  And , I 've moved on now to what I 'm calling set three . 
A:  I sort of thought if I do it in sets  groups of five , then I can have , like , sort of a  a parallel processing through  through the  the current . 
A:  And  and you indicated to me that we have a g a goal now , <breath> for the  for the , um , <click> <breath> the , uh , DARPA demo , of twenty hours . 
A:  So , I 'm gonna go up to twenty hours , be sure that everything gets processed , and released , and    and that 's  that 's what my goal is . 
A:  Package of twenty hours right now , <breath> and then once that 's done , move on to the next . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Good . 
A:  I 'm  I 'm hiring people who , <breath> uh , really are  
A:  They would like to do it full - time , several of these people . 
A:  And  and I don't think it 's <breath> possible , really , to do this full - time , but , that  what it shows is motivation to do as many hours as possible . 
A:  And they 're really excellent . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Got a good core group now . 
A:  Again . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  And I  you know , I 've also d uh , discovered  
A:  So with the new transcriber I 'm  
A:  um  
A:  So  
A:  Uh , lemme say that my , 
A:  uh  
A:  So , um  
A:  At present , um , the people have been doing these transcriptions a channel at a time . 
A:  And , that sort of , um , <breath> is useful , 
A:  and t you know , and then once in a while they 'll have to refer to the other channels to clear something up . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Well , <breath> I realize that , um , w i we we 're using the pre - segmented version , 
A:  and , um , the pre - segmented version is extremely useful , 
A:  and wouldn't it be , useful also to have the visual representation of those segments ? 
A:  And so I 've   uh ,  I , uh , uh , I 've  trained the new one  uh , the new the newest one , <breath> to , um , <breath> use the visual from the channel that is gonna be transcribed at any given time . 
A:  And that 's just amazingly helpful . 
A:  Because what happens then , is you scan across the signal and once in a while you 'll find a blip that didn't show up in the pre - segmentation . 
A:  And that 'll be something like  <breath> I it 's ver  it 's interesting . 
A:  Once in a while it 's a backchannel . 
A:  Sometimes it seems to be , um , similar to the ones that are being picked up . 
A:  And they 're rare events , but you can really go through a meeting very quickly . 
A:  You just  you just , you know , yo you s you scroll from screen to screen , looking for blips . 
A:  And , I think that we 're gonna end up with , uh  better coverage of the backchannels , 
A:  but at the same time we 're benefitting tremendously from the pre - segmentation 
A:  because <breath> there are huge places where there is just absolutely no activity at all . 
A:  And , uh , the audio quality is so good  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So I think that that 's gonna , also  eh ,  you know , speed the efficiency of this part of the process . 
A:  Well it  it  well , it 'd be preceded by " I 'm reading transcript so - and - so " ? 
A:  So , I think if they 're processing it at  
A:  Hmm . 
A:  That 's a good idea . 
A:  Well this  
A:  Well this  
A:  Oh . 
A:  I think  
A:  Well it 's  it  well , because  
A:  I ha I have an extra point , which is the naturalness issue . 
A:  Because we have , like , meetings that have a reason . 
A:  That 's one of the reasons that we were talking about this . 
A:  And  and those  and this sounds like it 's more of an experimental setup . 
A:  It 's got a different purpose . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Would it be  ? 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Well they  
A:  You saying NW archive ? 
A:  Yep  <inbreath> And if you did that during the day it would never make it to the nightly back - ups . 
A:  And then there wouldn't be this extra load . 
A:  Well , but you can have it NW archive to  you can have , <inbreath> uh , a non - backed - up disk NW archived , 
A:  and it 'll never show up on the nightly back - ups . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Sixteen to eighteen , I think . 
A:  Roughly . 
A:  OK .
