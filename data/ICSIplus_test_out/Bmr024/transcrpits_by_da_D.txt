D:  OK we 're done . 
D:  Well , so , here 's the thing . 
D:  Um , why don't we s again start off with  with , 
D:  uh , 
D:  Yeah , I 'll get it . 
D:  I 'll get the door . 
D:  Um , I think we want to start off with the agenda . 
D:  And then , given that , uh , Liz and Andreas are gonna be  ten , fifteen minutes late , we can try to figure out what we can do most effectively without them here . 
D:  So  <inbreath> So  so , one thing is , yeah , talk about demo , 
D:  IBM transcription . 
D:  Uh , what else ? 

D:  What 's SmartKom ? 
D:  SmartKom ? 
D:  What  what  what are we collecting here ? 
D:  Yeah , right . 
D:  Uh , right . 
D:  Uh . 
D:  Reorganization status . 
D:  Files and directories . 
D:  Um  
D:  Right . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Well , let 's see . 
D:  I think the a certainly the segmentation and recognition we wanna maybe focus on when An - Andreas is here since that was particularly his thing . 
D:  SmartKom also , Andreas . 
D:  Absinthe , I think also he has sort of been involved in a lot of those things . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Um 
D:  So , I mean , I think they 'll be inter I 'll be interested in all this , 
D:  but  but , uh , probably , if we had to pick something  that we would talk on for ten minutes or so while they 're coming here . Or I guess it would be , you think , reorganization status , 
D:  or  ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Well , maybe uh , since that  that was a pretty short one , maybe we should talk about the IBM transcription status . 
D:  Someone can <inbreath> fill in Liz and Andreas later . 
D:  Uh 
D:  OK . 
D:  Le - let 's talk about it , 
D:  because that 's  that 's something that I  I know Andreas is less interested in than Liz is , 
D:  so , you know . 
D:  It 's good  
D:  Actually , maybe I  One  one relate more related thing in transcription . 
D:  So that 's the IBM stuff . 
D:  We 've got that sorted out . 
D:  Um , how 're we doing on the  on the rest of it ? 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Yeah , uh , 
D:  so twenty hours . 
D:  But I guess the other thing is that , um , that  that 's kinda twenty hours ASAP because the longer before the demo we actually have the twenty hours , the more time it 'll be for people to actually do cool things with it . 
D:  So . OK . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , that 's good . 
D:  Yeah , I mean , I guess the  So the difference if  if , um , if the IBM stuff works out , the difference in the job would be that they p primarily would be checking through things that were already done by someone else ? 
D:  Is that most of what it  ? 
D:  I mean  Correcting . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Uh , yeah . 
D:  So , uh  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So let 's talk about the digits , since they 're not here yet . 
D:  Well , forced alignment would be one thing . 
D:  What about just actually doing recognition ? 
D:  No , they make mistakes . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Um  
D:  Yeah , I 'm  I 'm not quite sure what I 'm talking about . 
D:  I mean  I  
D:  I mean , uh , we 're talking about digits now . 
D:  And  and so , um , there 's a bunch of stuff that hasn't been marked yet . 
D:  Uh . 
D:  And , um , <inbreath> there 's the issue that  that they  we know what  what was said , but do we ? 
D:  Because people make mistakes and stuff . 
D:  I was just asking , just out of curiosity , if  if with , uh  uh , the SRI recognizer getting one percent word error , 
D:  uh , would we  would we do  better  ? 
D:  So , if you do a forced alignment but the force but the  but the transcription you have is wrong because they actually made mistakes , uh , or <inbreath> false starts , it 's  it 's much less c <inbreath> it 's  much less common than one percent ? 
D:  We should be able to . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So that 's just my question . 
D:  I 'm not saying it should be one way or the other , but it 's  If  
D:  Well  
D:  Yeah , it 's  Y you raised a point , kind of , uh , euphemistically  
D:  but , I mean , m maybe it is a serious problem . 
D:  Ho - what will they do when they go  hear " beep  seven  beep  seven three five two "  
D:  I mean , <inbreath> you think they 'll  we 'll get  ? 
D:  Yeah ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Well , I  I  I dunno , 
D:  I  I think that that 's  if they are in fact going to transcribe these things , uh , certainly any process that we 'd have to correct them , or whatever is  needs to be much less elaborate for digits than for other stuff . 
D:  So , why not ? 
D:  Sure . 
D:  That was it ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  Well , we  we  we wanna have them . 
D:  Yeah , I  
D:  I in Berkeley , yeah . 
D:  So , <breath> uh  You  you have to go a little early , 
D:  right ? 
D:  At twenty  
D:  Alright . 
D:  So le let 's make sure we do the ones that  that , uh , saved you . 
D:  So there was some  Uh  <sniff> In  in  Adam 's agenda list , 
D:  he had something from you about segmentation this last recognition ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  Um another one that we had on Adam 's agenda  that definitely involved you was s something about SmartKom ? 
D:  Wait a minute . 
D:  So , I just wanted to understand it , cuz I  I 'm  uh , hadn't quite followed this process . 
D:  Um . So , it 's wizard in the sen usual sense that the person who is asking the questions doesn't know that it 's , uh , a machi not a machine ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  You might wanna try collecting it the other way around sometime , saying that th the computer isn't up yet 
D:  and then  so then you can separate it out whether it 's the beginning or end kind of effects . 
D:  But , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  S 
D:  Um  
D:  So , what is the purpose of this recording ? 
D:  This is to get acoustic and language model training data for SmartKom. OK . 

D:  Well , 
D:  so why not  ? 
D:  We 've never signed anything that said that we couldn't use anything that we did . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  No that 's not a problem . 
D:  I  L look , it seems to me that if we 're doing it anyway and we 're doing it for these  these purposes that we have , <inbreath> and we have these distant mikes , we definitely should re should save it all as long as we 've got disk space , 
D:  and disk is pretty cheap . 
D:  So should we save it ? 
D:  Now th 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So we save it because it 's  it  it 's potentially useful . 
D:  And now , what do we do with it is  is a s separate question . 
D:  I mean , anybody who 's training something up could <inbreath> choose to put it  eh , to u include this or not . 
D:  I  I would not say it was part of the meetings corpus . 
D:  It isn't . 
D:  But it 's some other data we have , 
D:  and if somebody doing experiment wants to train up including that then they can . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  I think it 's  I  I think  I th think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key . 
D:  Nnn , well 
D:  No , it doesn't . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  It has  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I think it is a s 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  It 's scenario - based , it 's  it 's human - computer interface  <inbreath> it 's really pretty different . 
D:  But I I  I have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they 're gonna do , 
D:  but I don't think i it  it doesn't match anything that we 've described about meetings . 
D:  Whereas everything that we talked about them doing at  at UW and so forth really does . 
D:  They 're actually talking  
D:  You can  you can  
D:  Again , as  as I think Andreas was saying , <inbreath> if you wanna use the same tools and the same conventions , there 's no problem with that . 
D:  It 's just that it 's , you know , different directory , it 's called something different , it 's  
D:  you know . 
D:  It is different . 
D:  You can't just fold it in as if it 's  
D:  I mean , digits are different , too . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  Well , I don I wouldn't call reading digits " meetings " . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  I mean , we  we  we were doing  
D:  Well  
D:  I mean , I don't care what directory tree you have it under . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  I mean that 's just a  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  O - You  you can use whatever procedure you want that 's p convenient for you . 
D:  All I 'm saying is that there 's no way that we 're gonna tell people that reading digits is meetings . 
D:  And similarly we 're not gonna tell them that someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meetings . 
D:  Those aren't meetings . 
D:  But if it makes it easier for you to pu fold them in the same procedures and have them under the same directory tree , knock yourself out . 
D:  You know ? 
D:  Alright . 
D:  Ah . 
D:  Good point . 
D:  Good point . 
D:  But I 'm sure no one would have a problem with our folding it in for some acoustic modeling or  or some things . 
D:  Um . 
D:  Do we h do we have , uh , um , American - born folk , uh , reading German  German , uh , pla uh , place names and so forth ? 
D:  Is that  ? 
D:  Yeah , great . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Heidelberg 
D:  Yeah , I be pretty good . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So , I mean , pretty much anytime we need a disk , we can get it at the rate that we 're  
D:  Yeah . You really shouldn't be saying  
D:  Da - we had allowed Dave to listen to these  <laugh> these , <inbreath> uh , recordings . 
D:  Um  <mouth> Yeah , 
D:  I me and there 's been this conversation going on about getting another file server , 
D:  and  and <breath> we can do that . 
D:  We 'll take the opportunity and get another big raft of  <laugh> of disk , I guess . 
D:  Soon . 
D:  Year or two ? 
D:  Wow . 
D:  I mean , yeah , all the L 
D:  LDC - all the LDC distributions are on CD - ROM . 
D:  We have all sorts of CD - ROMs from a long time ago . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh , I see . 
D:  Well  
D:  You know  I would think  
D:  The b I think th the  at least the once tha that you put it on , it would  <laugh> it would  <inbreath> kill that . 
D:  So . 
D:  Wh 
D:  The o the one that we have ? 
D:  The  I mean  
D:  No , we have s we  Don't we have our own ? 
D:  Something wi th that doesn't  that isn't used by the back - up gang ? 
D:  Don't we have something downstairs ? 
D:  Just in  ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , that 's basically what I was gonna say , is that a disk is  is so cheap it 's es essentially , you know , close to free . 
D:  And the only thing that costs is the back - up  issue , <inbreath> eh , to first order . 
D:  And we can take care of that by putting it on non - back  up drives and just backing it up once onto this tape . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Good . 
D:  It 's good . 
D:  He - I  Dave has  has promoted this in the past . 
D:  So I don't think he 's actually against it . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Um , another , thing on the agenda said SRI recognition experiments ? 
D:  What 's that ? 
D:  Uh . 
D:  Who 's that ? 
D:  Yeah , I got confused by the results . 
D:  It sai because  uh , the  meeting before , <inbreath> you said " OK , we got it down to where they 're  they 're within a tenth of a percent " . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  It 's the women are the problem . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  No . 
D:  Aha ! 
D:  OK . 
D:  So  but you see , now , between  between the males and the females , there 's certainly a much bigger difference in the scaling range , than there is , say , just within the males . 
D:  And what you were using before was scaling factors that were just from the  the m the  SRI front - end . 
D:  And that worked  that worked fine . 
D:  Uh , but now you 're looking over a larger range and it may not be so fine . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Huh . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  No  no . 
D:  I  I remember that . 
D:  You 're  This is  lemme ask a q more basic que 
D:  I mean , is this , uh  uh , iterative , Baum - Welch training ? 
D:  Or is it Viterbi training ? 
D:  Or  ? 
D:  Baum - Welch training . 
D:  And how do you determine when to  to stop iterating ? 
D:  Or maybe  or maybe you 're doing one too many . 
D:  I mean it 's  it 's  
D:  Uh .  Well , there can be . 
D:  Sure . 
D:  It d if you  if you remember some years ago Bill Byrne did a thing where he was  he was looking at that , 
D:  and he showed that you could get it . 
D:  So . 
D:  But   but  <inbreath> but , um  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And in each case , ho 
D:  um , I 'm sorry  
D:  in each case how do you determine , you know , the  the usual  fudge factors ? 
D:  The , uh  <inbreath> the , uh , language , uh , scaling , acoustic scaling , 
D:  uh , uh  
D:  OK . 
D:  And the pru the question he was asking at one point about pruning , 
D:  uh  
D:  Remember that one ? 
D:  Well , he was  he 's  it looked like the probabil at one point he was looking at the probabilities he was getting out  at the likelihoods he was getting out of PLP versus mel cepstrum , and they looked pretty different , 
D:  as I recall . 
D:  And so , uh , there 's the question  
D:  But , still it 's a question  
D:  if you have some threshold somewhere in terms of beam search or something , 
D:  or  ? 
D:  But , you 're only talking about a percent or two . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  Here we 're - we 're saying that we there  gee , there 's this b eh , there 's this difference here . 
D:  And  it  
D:  See cuz , i i  there could be lots of things . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  But  but  but  but , um , let 's suppose just for a second that , uh , we 've sort of taken out a lot of the  the major differences , uh , between the two . 
D:  I mean , we 're already sort of using the mel scale and we 're using the same style filter integration , 
D:  and <inbreath> and , well , we 're making sure that low and high  
D:  Before we  i i th with straight PLP , it 's trapezoidal also . 
D:  But then we had a slight difference in the  in the scale . 
D:  Uh , so . 
D:  Coup - Couple tenths of a percent or something . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  So the oth <breath> the other thing that  
D:  So , f 
D:  i 
D:  We 've always viewed it , anyway , as the major difference between the two , is actually in the smoothing , 
D:  that the  that the , um , <inbreath> PLP , and  and the reason PLP has been advantageous in , uh , slightly noisy situations is because , <inbreath> PLP does the smoothing at the end by an auto - regressive model , 
D:  and mel cepstrum does it by just computing the lower cepstral coefficients . 
D:  Um . So , um  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Could be . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Now the other que related question , though , is  is , <mouth> uh , what 's the boot models for these things ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Well , mis for making things better . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  But , this for making things worse . 
D:  This it migh 
D:  Th - the thought is  is  is possible  another possible  partial cause is if the boot models <inbreath> used a comple used a different feature set , that  
D:  Which you got from a different feature set . 
D:  So , those features look at the data differently , actually . 
D:  I mean , you know , they  they will find boundaries a little differently , though  
D:  You know , all th all that sort of thing is actually slightly different . 
D:  I 'd expect it to be a minor effect , 
D:  but  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Yeah , maybe not . 
D:  But  it  it  I st still see it as  I mean , <inbreath> there 's  there 's a history to this , too , 
D:  but I  uh , I don't wanna go into , 
D:  but  but I  I  I th I think it could be the things  that it  the data is being viewed in a certain way , uh , that a beginning is here rather than there and so forth , 
D:  because the actual signal - processing you 're doing is slightly different . 
D:  But , <inbreath> it 's  it 's  that 's probably not it . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  At some point you also might wanna take the same thing and try it on , uh , some Broadcast News data or something else that actually has  has some noisy  <inbreath> noisy components , so we can see if any conclusions we come to holds <mouth> across  different data . 
D:  Uh  
D:  OK . 
D:  So , is there something quick about Absinthe  that you  ? 
D:  Yeah , we 'll just go buy them , I guess . 
D:  Probably just throw away the old ones , 
D:  and  
D:  Thank you  for the box , 
D:  and  <laugh> I 'll just go buy their process . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Is  is Liz coming back , do you know , 
D:  or  ? 
D:  I dunno . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh , you don't . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Alright . 
D:  Alright . 
D:  See you . 
D:  Um . 
D:  Alright . 
D:  So  
D:  Uh , they 're having tea out there . 
D:  So I guess the other thing that we were gonna talk about is  is , uh , demo . 
D:  And , um , so , these are the demos for the  uh , July , uh , meeting  and , um  DARPA mee 
D:  Oh , I think it 's July fifteenth . 
D:  Is that it ? 
D:  Yeah , sixteenth , eighteenth . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So , we talked about getting something together for that , 
D:  but maybe , uh  maybe we 'll just put that off for now , given that  
D:  But I think maybe we should have a  a sub - meeting , 
D:  I think , uh , probably , uh , Adam and  and , uh , Chuck and me should talk about  should get together and talk about that sometime soon . 
D:  Yeah  something like that . 
D:  Um , uh , you know , maybe  maybe we 'll involve Dan Ellis at some  some level as well . 
D:  Um . 
D:  OK . The  the tea is  is going , so , uh , I suggest we do , uh  uh , a unison . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Gets our  
D:  Oh . 
D:  Well , that 'll be interesting . 
D:  So , 
D:  uh  
D:  No . 
D:  OK we 're done .
