E:  OK . 
E:  Hi . 
E:  Oh wow . 
E:  Not yet . 
E:  Yeah right . 
E:  I 've got the headset on after all . 
E:  yes . 
E:  I know Nancy . 
E:  Man ! 
E:  Wizard . 
E:  The list of majors in the department ? 
E:  So you 're just saying like what part of town the things are in or whatever ? 
E:  I 'm not sure I totally understand this 
E:  but  
E:  I 'm not sure I totally understand everything that 's being talked about 
E:  but I  I imagine I 'll c just catch on . 
E:  Uh , this is where they 're supposed to  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  You will be here . 
E:  They 're very dependent 
E:  We 're done . 
E:  Toll . 
E:  So it 's not done basically . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Perhaps if the answers have something to do with the questions for example . 
E:  I want to see " Die Dukes Von Hazard " 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  OK . 
E:  " Chicken Run " . 
E:  OK . What 's the next thing ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Spit right here . 
E:  A laser pointer would be most appropriate here I think . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Rad ! 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  So very specific role names are " viewed thing " , " entered thing "  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Snack action . 
E:  See . 
E:  I 'm sure there 's a commercial event schema in there somewhere . 
E:  Yeah I mean I  I still am not entirely sure that I really fully grasp the syntax of this . 
E:  You know , like what  
E:  Right . 
E:  Or the intended interpretation of this . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Every SPG  every SPG action either is an Enter or a View or an Approach , 
E:  right ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  This is a cate this a category structure here , 
E:  right ? 
E:  Action schema . 
E:  What are some types of action schemas ? 
E:  Well one of the types of action schemas is Source - Path - Goal action . 
E:  And what are some types of that ? 
E:  And an Enter , a View , an Approach . 
E:  Those are all Source - Path - Goal actions . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  There could be a communication event action or something like that 
E:  and you could write it . 
E:  Ri - You 'd like  so you 're saying you could practically turn this structure inside out ? 
E:  or something , 
E:  or  ? 
E:  List all the parent categories . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  This sounds like a paper I 've read around here recently in terms of  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah I mean but there 's a good question here . 
E:  Like , I mean uh do you  When do you need  
E:  Damn this headset ! 
E:  When you this uh , 
E:  eh  
E:  Yeah .  That 's all recorded . 
E:  Um . 
E:  Why do you  
E:  I don't know . Like  
E:  How do I  how do I come at this question ? 
E:  Um . 
E:  I just don't see why you would  
E:  I mean does th 
E:  Who uses this uh  this data structure ? 
E:  You know ? Like , do you say " alright I 'm going to uh   do an SPG action " . 
E:  And then you know somebody ne either the computer or the user says " alright , well , I know I want to do a Source - Path - Goal action so what are my choices among that ? " 
E:  And " oh , OK , so I can do an Enter - View - Approach " . 
E:  It 's not like that , 
E:  right ? 
E:  It 's more like you say " I want to , uh   I want to do an Enter . " 
E:  And then you 're more interested in knowing what the parent categories are of that . 
E:  Right ? 
E:  So that the um  the uh sort of representation that you were just talking about seems more relevant to the kinds of things you would have to do ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Mayb - Well maybe I 'm not understanding where this comes from and where this goes to . 
E:  What are we doing with this ? 
E:  In principle . 
E:  Sigh . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  In my view . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Again  
E:  Well  
E:  I  I would just like to ask um like , if it could happen for next time , 
E:  I mean , just beca cuz I 'm new 
E:  and I don't really just  I just don't know what to make of this 
E:  and what this is for , and stuff like that , you know , 
E:  so if someone could make an example of what would actually be in it , 
E:  like first of all what modules are talking to each other using this , 
E:  right ? 
E:  And  
E:  OK . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Nope . 
E:  Alright . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Sure . 
E:  Sure . 
E:  Oh you meant pastries , then ? 
E:  This is the bakery example . 
E:  Got it . Alright .

E:  Uh  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I could do that . 
E:  Yeah I mean earlier on Friday is better but three  you know I mean  if it were a three or a three thirty time then I would take the three or whatever ,
