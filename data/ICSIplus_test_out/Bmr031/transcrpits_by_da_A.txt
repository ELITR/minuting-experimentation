A:  Oh . 
A:  Hello ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Should we close the door ? 
A:  Well , I tend to  
A:  th there 're a couple meetings where there are a lot of preambles like this , 
A:  in which case the transcription doesn't start until someone actually says " OK . " 
A:  So , we 're starting right now . 
A:  This is the  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  u 
A:  Didn't get the door . 
A:  Is it turned on ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Channel B . 
A:  Channel B . 
A:  Do they know about your pie chart ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  He has a nice pie chart on the , uh , s the current status page , 
A:  which shows the amount of transc amount of data that had been transcribed 
A:  and the amount  out of the entire  
A:  and <inbreath> at this point it 's not quite half . 
A:  Wouldn't  Is that what you 'd say , with the pie chart ? 
A:  And then of that , there 's , uh , a little sliver  
A:  I could try and draw it 
A:  but it 's probably better to describe . 
A:  So  <breath-laugh> Roughly . Almost . 
A:  Not quite . 
A:  And I haven't actually caught up with , uh  
A:  since I got back so recently from my vacation . 
A:  Um , I know that the transcribers finished , um , uh , several meetings while I was gone . 
A:  And I haven't told you 
A:  cuz I haven't  I haven't figured out which ones they are y are yet . 
A:  But when that happens , then that pie will get even closer to the midline . 
A:  It 's not quite  <inbreath> not quite fifty percent 
A:  but  really getting close . 
A:  I think it will be . 
A:  Well , <laugh> not mathematically . 
A:  n 
A:  But it 's a nice  it 's  I recommend his  his  his graphic , 
A:  cuz it 's  it 's a really nice graphic . 
A:  Can't we downsample 
A:  and , uh , transcribe on that basis ? 
A:  Also seems like the corpus could all be standardized on s on this  the , uh  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 

A:  Do you want to write on the l on the board ? 
A:  I could write on the board . 
A:  Last updated in July . 
A:  Oh , I 'm not sure . The one that I saw on the web when I came back . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yes . At present there 's  n none of those are on the pie chart . 
A:  There 're five ? 
A:  Good . 
A:  So the c the cross - hatching there is , um  is 
A:  it 's been through the double - check . 
A:  Right ? 
A:  I mean , it 's  this is the  it 's - it 's been tran 
A:  Everything on the  
A:  So , I mean , it 's  
A:  When I add a couple more from  that , uh  that were done in my absence , I think that th we 'll be down to about there . 
A:  So it 's not quite as close to half as I 'd thought , 
A:  but it 's , you know  
A:  it 's more than a  
A:  And so these right here have been through the double - check . 
A:  These haven't . 
A:  Oh , how nice of you , 
A:  holding  holding the thing so I 'm not  
A:  Yeah , thank you . 
A:  Are they from one of the foreign - language ones ? 
A:  I mean  
A:  OK , good . 
A:  Those will figure less prominently in things anyway . 
A:  Long vacations . 
A:  Oh , thank you . Thank you . 

A:  Yeah . I mean , you know , it 's an extra step . 
A:  Well , for speed . 
A:  To get rid of what ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  No . 
A:  No . 
A:  Oh .
