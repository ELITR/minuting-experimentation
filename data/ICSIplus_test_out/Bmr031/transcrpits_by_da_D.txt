D:  Yeah . 
D:  Four . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  CD . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Sixteen . 
D:  Yeah . It 's shortened . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  It 's really short , yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Just not yet approved for  
D:  Yeah ? OK . 
D:  You  
D:  Didn't you wanna say something about the hardware  set - up ? 
D:  Nothing this week . 
D:  Maybe n end of next week . 
D:  Yeah . Let me check with  Robert again , 
D:  but I  I 'm  pretty sure that there 's nothing this week . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I 'm  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I don't like the backchannels at all , 
D:  as that 's  really a problem with the speech - nonspeech detection . 
D:  So  
D:  Yeah . I 've been doing a bunch of recognition experiments on  meeting data with different , uh , segmentations  with different  different automatic segmentations , 
D:  but  it 's not yet finished . 
D:  It 's  work in progress . 
D:  Yeah . For , uh  for  for the paper I w I want to submit to ASRU to  <inbreath> to , uh , evaluate the quality of the speech - nonspeech detection by  using it for speech recognition . 
D:  It  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So , it hurts compared to the ideal segmentation , when you have the  the manual segmentations , 
D:  where you have exact boundaries for each s utterances . 
D:  Sometimes there are some  some words are cut off 
D:  or  there 's some segments i are s uh , assigned to s to speech which there is nothing in . 
D:  And so there are more insertions 
D:  but <inbreath> most of the time there are more  the  the number of deletions is higher when  when you use the automatic segmentation compared to the ideal one . 
D:  And so I 'm just in  in progress of , yeah , trying to feed the recognizer with un - segmented data 
D:  and to see how much worse that is . 
D:  So that  that I have three things . 
D:  Un - yeah  un - segmented , the automatic , and the  the ideal one . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I haven't really  had time to do that . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Maybe after Wednesday ? 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah .
