E:  Um , so , <inbreath> <mike spike> been looking at that as well . 
E:  Right . So I 've been looking at spectral tilt 
E:  and  different ways of  perhaps generating it . 
E:  And , um , I basically have three ways right now that we 're looking at for , uh  we 're gonna look at for features . 
E:  Uh , one is just looking at , um , the first cepstral coefficient 
E:  and , uh , using that . 
E:  Um , another is looking at the log ener the difference of log energies between , um , the high  like a high - frequency band and a low - frequency band . 
E:  And the third is just , um , taking a slope , um , of the linear fit of the spectrum  and using that . 
E:  So , those are the three  three ways I have right now for generating these spectral tilt numbers . 
E:  And , <inbreath> um , 
E:  hopefully soon we can look at some of the labelled stuff 
E:  and look at , uh , these numbers and see  see which ones w seem to be working well . And things like that . 
E:  Um , I also recently wrote a script , um , <mouth> that , uh , generates the kappa statistic , 
E:  um , which is a  for labeller agreement . 
E:  Um , so , <inbreath> <mike spike> been looking at that as well .
