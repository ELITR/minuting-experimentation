C:  Yep . 
C:  I think that 's recording now . 
C:  Um , do it again . 
C:  That 's uh  That 's in channel one . 
C:  Channel one . 
C:  Let me make sure . 
C:  There are no  There 's only one connection element . 
C:  It 's zero - based . 
C:  Unfortunately the mikes are  you know  
C:  This  this has the disadvantage of needing to put the numbers on the mikes . 
C:  Consistently not equal to the numbers  numbers on the channels . 
C:  Well , you can write it down . 
C:  I mean  Write down whatever you like . 
C:  I don't know . 
C:  You can do whatever  any way you like . 
C:  The weird thing is that um it means that it varies when you move your head around 
C:  but  <inbreath>  I think it 's probably the better solution . 
C:  OK ? 
C:  Do we have the numbers ? the the sheets , that we did from last time ? 
C:  so we can do them again ? 
C:  Great . 
C:  I 'm on uh mike three . 
C:  This is mike three , 
C:  coming in here . 
C:  It 's moving around as I move my head backwards and forwards . 
C:  So that 's just the way it goes . 
C:  That 's life . 
C:  That 's just what it does . 
C:  That 's right . 
C:  OK . 
C:  P Z Ms ? or   or not P Z 
C:  Because this is PZM number three . 
C:  Let 's list them in order . 
C:  PZM number three was the furthest away . 
C:  This is the next one in , which is PZM number four ,  apparently . 
C:  PZ 
C:  What - Can you  can you see other stuff happening ? 
C:  This is PZM number four . 
C:  which is closest to the machine room . 
C:  I mean  I don't know . 
C:  It 's all hopeless . 
C:  This is uh one side of PDA , I guess . 
C:  We could actually give these sides names , 
C:  right ? 
C:  This would be left , 
C:  wouldn't it . 
C:  I know , 
C:  but I 'm just  asking . 
C:  I wasn't asking you . 
C:  This is  this is PDA left . 
C:  You getting something there ? 
C:  And this is PDA right . 
C:  They will vary in future . 
C:  Because it depends which one of these shows more consistency then . 
C:  No . 
C:  Well , we 're w we 're so ahead of the game now , 
C:  cuz we 've got built - in downsampling now . 
C:  We 've got built - in downsampling . 
C:  And so it 's only recording  sixteen kilohertz data , 
C:  and we 've got  
C:  We 're not select We 're not recording the empty channels . 
C:  What about the ones that we didn't record ? 
C:  OK ? 
C:  Fine . 
C:  Then it doesn't matter , 
C:  does it . 
C:  Before that . 
C:  OK . 
C:  So , this is Dan on mike three , 
C:  wireless headset , 
C:  I 'm wearing it around my neck . 
C:  which may be different than wearing it on the head . 
C:  And  
C:  Great . 
C:  It 's kind of weird . 
C:  That was great , what you did . 
C:  Um 
C:  Yeah , cuz I figure no one 's going to be able to figure it out 
C:  from the  from my name . 
C:  So , 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh , right , right , right . 

C:  Well , hang on . 
C:  Well , <laugh> Well , I guess . 
C:  Do you  So , do you  
C:  What are  what are we talking about ? 
C:  That you 're gonna  you 're gonna do transcriptions ? 
C:  You 're going to listen to these things and  
C:  OK . 
C:  D I And do you have a clear  I mean , is that  
C:  Do you sort of  
C:  Are you going to have to make up what you do 
C:  or do you have a very clear idea of what you 're going to do ? 
C:  So I mean , is it  is it  Is this l Is it  like something you 've done before ? 
C:  or  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  And , 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , 
C:  because as people are going to be listening to it afterwards 
C:  and saying " Oh listen to her . 
C:  She couldn't even speak true English sentences ! " 
C:  Oh , you 're meant  You 're meant to speak naturally . 
C:  You 're meant to say " Oh , I didn't realize we were being recorded ! " 
C:  It 's just  It 's just jewelry . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  The problem is  The nice thing about transcribers is they have foot pedals , 
C:  Oh . 
C:  I see . 
C:  I  I  I actually have one . 
C:  Well , Sarah has one 
C:  because she does a lot of transcribing of interviews . 
C:  But The crazy thing is we 'd have to convert the s we 'd have to dump the audio files onto cassette . to use it . 
C:  I mean , given that we 've already got them digitally it would be  
C:  you know , it 's quite tempting to use some kind of uh software thing . 
C:  But  but then there 's the question of the ergonomic interface , that  
C:  OK . 
C:  What do they connect to ? 
C:  Oh , that 's totally cool . 
C:  now how  how do you  how do you decide which keystrokes they generate ? 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  And this is Windows ? 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  So hang on . 
C:  You have  You have these foot pedals but you d you 're not using them . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Wow . 
C:  That 's so cool . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Well , 
C:  the d the  well , the uh The part that 's not wonderful is someone has to write the software . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well ,  
C:  Yeah , absolutely . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  What 's her name ? 
C:  OK . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  So  
C:  Oh , OK . 
C:  So , the p I mean , what I 'm hearing is that the problem of starting off with some recordings and trying to get word transcripts is kind of  I mean , it 's not a  it 's not an unfamiliar problem . 
C:  So that  
C:  So that I mean that basically , there are standard solutions and we should just adopt  adopt them 
C:  and it 's going to cost however much it 's going to cost , 
C:  I mean there 's  We 're  we 're probably not going to have a lot of flexibility in bringing down the cost 
C:  cuz probably the low cost solution 's already been established . 
C:  And so that 's just whatever it is . 
C:  That 's how we 'll do it . 
C:  See what I mean ? 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well , whatever they  people who have had to do this  
C:  I mean the only thing is I wonder if our requirements are different from um  I mean there 's  than  than what 's been done in the past 
C:  than discourse analyzers 
C:  because maybe we have different requirements in terms of time align you know , how much time  aligned detail we need and uh how much detail in terms of people . 
C:  I don I don't know how much ti I don't think we do need any time aligned detail . 
C:  I think we just have basically one text file which runs from beginning to end . 
C:  But . 
C:  Sure . 
C:  But not if it costs more . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right , I mean , the  it 's sort of it 's  a little  In some sense it 's a little bit easier with it  with Switchboard 
C:  because the telephone is so  actually people are less flexible in what they do . 
C:  In this kind of situation where we 've got nonverbal channels then there 's a lot of overlap 
C:  and there 's just that it 's not a very good model . 
C:  Well , every utterance is a single speaker , 
C:  right ? 
C:  It 's just that utterances can overlap . 
C:  I mean , 
C:  I think so . 
C:  I think  I think  I mean , I think when I 'm  when  
C:  Like , So , Eric made a s made a sentence , and that should be like one utterance 
C:  and then I had a couple of backchannels in there 
C:  and they should be just overlapping things that  
C:  I don't think that we should break Eric 's sentences for those . I think  
C:  Well , we 'll have to go in from somewhere 
C:  but we can't necessarily  I mean , we  we may be able to get the transcriber to give them to us if we give them software 
C:  but we may not 
C:  in which case we 'll have to get them some other way , 
C:  like with forced alignment later , 
C:  I mean you know all this can be done . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Phoneme  phoneme  phoneme transcriptions . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  There 's a  there are  there 's a whole bunch of tools . 
C:  There 's a  some web page , where they have a list of like ten of them or something . 
C:  No , no , no . There 's some  I mean , I just  there are  there are a lot of a lot of @ @ these things . 
C:  Oh , EAGLES . 
C:  Yeah , that 's the European one . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  You don't  
C:  Just take the thing with you . 
C:  Well , I don't know what will happen , 
C:  but  you may as well . 
C:  Sure . Sure . Sure . 
C:  My uh My s 
C:  Yeah , so be just  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , 
C:  that 's true . 
C:  You can leave it behind as well if you want . 
C:  I I assume that these are projects where they do the whole thing , 
C:  right ? 
C:  So they probably will have tools to address the actual the  the  the transcriber support 
C:  and then automated alignment of what the transcribers give you , 
C:  which is , you know , exactly the problem we have . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  But then again we don't have to do it . 
C:  and  
C:  Oh sure , we are . 
C:  We 've got individual microphones . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well , 
C:  Yes , 
C:  although that might @ @ presumably we 'll have one  we 'll have several formats that you can interconvert between . 
C:  When we want to do recognition we 'll do STM , 
C:  but if we 're  rather than  rather than designing our own format , we 'll just take whatever comes out of the tools that we can find to use , I think . 
C:  I  I  I 've got no idea what that 'll look like . 
C:  but 
C:  on our speaker phones . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Mmm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Good . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Oh , good . 
C:  It must be  It must be fundable then . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh , yeah . 

C:  Alembic ? 
C:  No . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  I don't think so . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Because the transcriber 's put in intonational tags ? 
C:  Or maybe not . 
C:  Well . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Who 's it from ? 
C:  Right . 
C:  Is it the French one ? 
C:  U Penn . 
C:  I think that I 've heard of this one . 
C:  It was the one that Steve Renals mentioned . 
C:  Sure . 
C:  Can I see ? 
C:  Well  Well , We are going to do time alignment . 
C:  but we 'll probably do it ourselves , 
C:  right ? 
C:  So we 're not  we 're not concerned about getting  getting  about buying and  or bringing in tools . 
C:  We 're not very good 
C:  but we 're proud of ourselves . 
C:  We 're very proud of our time alignment . 
C:  Right . 
C:  I mean , it 's not a bad  
C:  Oh look ! 
C:  It uses Snack ! 
C:  Um . 
C:  It uses Snack . 
C:  That 's a  TCL  audio  thing that I  had some involvement with . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  If I have to use it 
C:  I 'm sure  I 'm sure  It 's a TCL - based thing . 
C:  I 'm sure it 's just  wonderful . 
C:  Yes , T " Transcriber was developed with the scripting language TCL TK and C extensions . 
C:  It relies on the Snack sound extension , which allows support for most common audio formats . " 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  It 's the French one . 
C:  I mean , no , I  I  
C:  But I 've never downloaded it . 
C:  Someone mentioned it to me . 
C:  And that 's probably why they mentioned it to me , 
C:  because they thought I would be excited because it 's TCL - based . 
C:  Oh " Deliverable D - three point one " , 
C:  Oh yeah . 
C:  Transcriber 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  That 's a fine question . 
C:  Wow . 
C:  So this thing , this uh deliverable D - three point one of the MATE project is a review of a lot of different tools . 
C:  They 're actually , they seem to be more 
C:  the tool the main focus of the tools is you 've already got a transcription but you 're trying to tag the different turns transi transcriptions with uh discourse roles 
C:  and things like that . 
C:  But I mean a lot them are tools that will also do transcription as well . 
C:  And I could be wrong . 
C:  Right . 
C:  I  Uh , the stuff I did , I combined pairs of these into stereo pairs , 
C:  listened to them in stereo . 
C:  And I was very impressed by how well you could hear separate speakers , 
C:  but I haven't  I haven't done very extensive tests . 
C:  you get a certain amount of spatial information . 
C:  It 's not  It 's not consistent 
C:  but it 's  Gives you some noise  
C:  Yeah , yeah , 
C:  you 'd get  get wide coverage . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  But I mean  But you would   you would  You know , you 'd get good  You 'd get good pick up at both ends of the table . 
C:  So . 
C:  Well , what is  what is the goal ? 
C:  again ? 
C:  We 're going to end up with some  I mean , ultimately , we 're going to end up with transcriptions of these meetings . 
C:  What , 
C:  and then  Then  Then we 'll be done , 
C:  huh ? 
C:  Um . 
C:  Of course , there are different kinds of recos 
C:  so we 're going to actually train a recognizer based on these uh , far - field mikes 
C:  cuz what we  that 's the problem we 're trying to solve . 
C:  OK . 
C:  We need a lot of  I mean  
C:  Well  and also the near field will allow us to do the time alignment accurately . 
C:  Um . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Close mikes . 
C:  I mean I  
C:  yeah , I feel like  that  What we 're actually going to do with these data is very unclear to me 
C:  Well , because I don't think that 's a  That 's not going to work . 
C:  Right ? 
C:  OK . We 're going to get horrible performance on that . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well , we know the answer to that , but unfortunately , will we get fifty percent p accuracy ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  And are they specifically far field mikes ? 
C:  OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well , I mean , that would be tremendously useful information 
C:  assuming that we actually pursue it , 
C:  but um we 've got a huge problem , 
C:  because if we ge if we want train a recognizer we need tens of hours of labelled data . 
C:  And um it 's just eh  it 's very frightening . 
C:  uh - uh 
C:  Who , Eric ? 
C:  Outrageous ! 
C:  Laying out his folders . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Lea ? 
C:  I see . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . If you think it won't slow you down at all . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , that 's great . 
C:  No , well , presumably there 's a an annotation standard for prefix  characters or something like that . 
C:  That 's what they 're using here . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Yeah , exactly . 
C:  Exactly . 
C:  Exactly . 
C:  Well , so , um 
C:  What is the plan ? 
C:  We 're gonna  
C:  I mean , How many  How many  How many meetings ? 
C:  What about r our recording schedule ? 
C:  How many meetings are we going to record ? 
C:  Um . 
C:  Which ones are we going to transcribe ? 
C:  Um . 
C:  Do we  
C:  OK . 
C:  Absolutely . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Five . 
C:  Well . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  If we can do anything with it , yeah . 
C:  I don't feel like you 're speaking unnaturally quietly . 
C:  I mean   I feel like it 's all quite normal . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Eric 's really got it easy cuz he 's got the lapel mike , which is so unobtrusive . 
C:  They 're much more expensive . 
C:  I  I  Which I don't understand 
C:  but there it is . 
C:  Right , it 's because they make people feel like television stars . 
C:  So you can charge more for it . 
C:  Yeah , that 's it . 
C:  That must be it . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Well , I don't mind . 
C:  Oh , we should read some more numbers , then . 
C:  Are we  are we  are we there ? 
C:  Are we at that point ? 
C:  More space than you can  
C:  We 've got two hours of space now . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  In theory . 
C:  Assuming it 's recording anything . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Yep .
