D:  <sigh> 
B:  OK . So . 
C:  <clap> I think that 's recording now . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  OK , I 'm on  
B:  <outbreath> 
B:  I 'm talking on mike two . 
B:  So , 
B:  Which channel is that ? 
A:  <inbreath, outbreath> 
C:  Um , 
C:  do it again . 
B:  Mike number two , I 'm talking right now on ? 
C:  That 's uh  
B:  Mike number two ? 
C:  That 's in channel one . 
B:  Channel one ? 
B:  Is that channel one or channel zero ?  
C:  Channel one . 
C:  Let me make sure . 
A:  Channel one . 
C:  There are no  
C:  There 's only one connection element . 
B:  which is zero - based or one - based ? 
C:  It 's zero - based . 
B:  OK , So we 're not going to do that . OK . 
C:  Unfortunately the mikes are  you know  
C:  This  this has the disadvantage of needing to put the numbers on the mikes . 
A:  off by one . 
C:  Consistently not equal to the numbers  numbers on the channels . 
A:  Right . 
B:  Wh - that 's why I wanted to write it down , 
B:  but 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <laugh> <inbreath> 
B:  Dan just doesn't want to do that .  
D:  Well 
C:  Well , you can write it down . 
C:  I mean  Write down whatever you like . 
B:  Thank you . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Write down that poem . 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  Let us know when you 're done , though 
D:  cuz we want to start the meeting .  
D:  Now , how do you do the mike ? 
B:  OK , now , that means  if I 'm going to be standing in there looking ,  
D:  I keep getting it in my nose . 
C:  I don't know . 
C:  You can do whatever  any way you like . 
D:  Oh ! <inbreath>  
D:  Oh ! This is good .  
B:  then someone else has to write them down .  
D:  Oh ! I like this . 
B:   because I won 
C:  The weird thing is that 
D:  I like this .  
C:  um it means that it 
B:  OK . 
C:  varies when you move your head around but  
B:  Fine . 
C:  <inbreath>  
C:  I think it 's probably the better solution . 
B:  Let 's not try  to do anything too easy .  
D:  I like this , this is much more comfortable . 
C:  OK ? 
B:  Testing . 
B:  <whistles into mike> 
D:  I could have it more at the midline . 
D:  Boy ! It 's very  adjustable now . 
B:  <whistles into mike> 
A:  So go ahead . 
D:  I 'm on number four . 
C:  Do we have the numbers ? 
C:  the the sheets , that we did from last time ? so we can do them again ? 
A:  Can  
A:  So we can do them again ? Yeah . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  They 're  in the folder right there . 
C:  Great . 
D:  May I pass the folder to Dan ? 
B:  You may . 
D:  OK . 
B:  So , Jane , can you talk into your mike ? You said it 's mike four ? 
D:  I 'm mike  I 'm on mike four . 
D:  and it 's a very nice microphone , 
D:  very modern . 
B:  Well , hmm , 
B:  I 'm glad you like it . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  I like it very much . 
B:  @ @ Uh 
B:  Eric , what mike are you ? 
A:  I 'm on channel one  
B:  Mike one  
A:  Mike one , channel zero , probably . 
B:  Looks like it . S talk again ? 
A:  Channel zero . 
B:  Thank you . 
C:  I 'm on uh 
C:  mike three . 
C:  This is mike three , 
C:  coming in here . 
C:  It 's moving around as I move my head 
C:  backwards and forwards . 
C:  So that 's just the way it goes . That 's life . 
C:  That 's just what it does . 
B:  OK . 
D:  You didn't get the s head restraint with your system ? 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  That 's right . 
A:  Head restraint system ? 
D:  I did modify my 
D:  my mike uh distance from my 
D:  speaking apparatus .  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Um , can you  do taps on the P D As ? 
D:  Slightly . 
A:  OK . 
B:  and the 
C:  OK . 
B:  P Z Ms ?  And you have to actually check what the nu 
C:  P Z Ms ? or   or not P Z Ms ? 
B:  The - 
B:  Start with P Z Ms . 
C:  Because this is PZM number three .  
C:  <tapping> 
B:  Thank you . 
C:  Let 's list them in order . 
A:  OK . 
C:  PZM number three was the furthest away . 
C:  This is the next one in , which is PZM number four ,  
C:  apparently .  
C:  <tapping> 
B:  I can't tell . <tapping>  
C:  PZ - 
C:  What - Can you  can you see other stuff happening ? 
B:  Yep .  
C:  This is PZM number four . 
B:  Thanks . 
D:  That 's a good way . 
A:  OK . 
A:  This is PZM two . 
A:  <tapping> 
B:  F  
B:  Thank you . 
A:  And this is PZM one . 
C:  which is closest to the machine room . 
A:  Which  
D:  Should I draw a map ? 
B:  OK .  
D:  OK . 
C:  I mean  
B:  And PDA ,  left , right ?  
C:  I don't know . 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  It 's all hopeless .  
C:  This is uh one side of PDA , I guess .  
C:  We could actually give these sides names , right ? 
C:  This would be left , wouldn't it .  
B:  I don't see anything .  
C:  I know ,  but I 'm just  asking . 
A:  Huh - uh .  
D:  He 's labelling  he 's labelling right now . 
C:  I wasn't asking you .  
A:  He 's ? 
B:  Ah . 
C:  This is  this is PDA left . 
D:  Now . 
C:  You getting something there ?  
B:  Yep . 
C:  And this is PDA right . 
B:  All OK . 
C:  They will 
B:  Thank you . 
C:  vary in future . 
D:  OK . 
A:  Right . 
C:   Because it depends which one of these 
B:  Did we just record all that ? Should we start it over ? 
C:  shows more consistency then . 
C:  No . 
B:  OK . 
C:  Well , we 're w we 're so ahead of the game now , cuz we 've got 
C:  built - in downsampling now . 
D:  We have what ? What do we have ? 
C:  We 've got built - in downsampling . 
C:  And so it 's only recording  sixteen kilohertz data , and we 've got  
A:  Wait a second . 
C:  We 're not select We 're not recording the empty channels . 
B:  The ones that aren't filled out are the ones you want to hand out . 
C:  What about the ones that we didn't record ? 
A:  No , I was looking for the ones  
B:  I threw the ones out , that we already 
B:  recorded but we didn't record .  
A:  Oh . 
A:  OK . 
C:  OK ? 
A:  Well , then , fine . 
C:  Fine . 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  Then it doesn't matter , does it . 
D:  Well done . 
A:  See if we care . 
D:  Well done . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  OK . 
D:  You 're probably wondering why I 
D:  brought you all here today .  
B:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Right . 
A:  But before w 
A:  before we  
C:  Before that . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Right . 
B:  So the first task is to read some digits . 
A:  Before that . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  So I 'll go ahead and start . 
B:  And  
B:  OK . 
B:  Good . Thanks . 
C:  Great . 
B:  So we 'll probably do another one at the end  of the meeting . 
B:  just to get some more digits . 
C:  OK . 
A:  Right . 
C:  It 's kind of weird . 
B:  And , uh 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  OK . 
A:  <outbreath> 
B:  Thank you . 
D:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
D:  If I were to be dictating a phone number , I would have done that 
D:  more slowly , but 
D:  uh  
D:  which would have been 
D:  easier for the  
D:  of course , 
D:  for the machine . 
D:  But . 
A:  Sure . 
D:  Was that an OK pace ? 
A:  Yeah . It 's fine . 
C:  That was great , what you did . 
C:  Um 
D:  OK . 
D:  Just as long as it 's with  
D:  you know , 
B:  What - what 's your mike number , Jane ? 
D:  uh within the constraints . 
D:  Number four . 
D:  Oh , 
D:  Sorry . 
B:  Dan doesn't remember what sex he is . 
C:  Yeah , cuz I figure no one 's going to be able to figure it out 
C:  from the  from my name . So , 
B:  That 's true , it 's  it 's really difficult . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  and the voice . Just no way . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Well , don't you  I  I wrote a scanner program that scans these forms in . 
C:  Oh , right , right , right .

D:  So , I 'm  I 'm on uh number four 
D:  with the microphone around my neck 
D:  and I will 
D:  read these . 
B:  So you wanna pause  briefly between each one 
B:  so that the person transcribing can tell  where one ends and one begins . 
D:  OK . 
C:  And  
B:  So , a short sentence between each line . 
D:  It really sounds like sentences .

B:  Anyway . So , why did I call you all here ? 
D:  Yes . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Um , what I 'd like to talk about is , um 
D:  Oh , you did . 
B:  the transcription . 
B:  So , as part of this um project , we need to transcribe these meetings . 
B:  um , to do training and test and so on . 
B:  and , uh , so we need 
B:  word transcripts 
B:  and , 
B:  uh , speaker change identification . 
B:  So , speaker ID . 
B:  And , uh 
B:  so I 'd sort of like to know  who 's going to do that ,  
B:  hi Jane , 
B:  and uh  
B:  what tools to use ,  what other resources you might need , 
B:  and also what we  
B:  things like just the data format 
B:  and 
B:  how we 're going to do it . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
D:  Well , 
D:  you know  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Now , we 're at a pilot phase right now , and  what I was told is that 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  beginning , 
D:  you know , 
D:  that the  the pilot data would be something like half hour of uh  or f 
D:  you know  
D:  half hour to forty minutes of running text . 
D:  And so ,  for the pilot thing , 
D:  you know , of course this would be useful . 
A:  Right , this is the pilot data . 
D:  And I w I wou I 'm assu 
C:  Oh , OK . So , the p 
C:  I mean , what I 'm 
C:  hearing is that 
C:  Well , 
C:  whatever they  
C:  people who have had to do this  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  I assume that these are projects where they do the whole thing , right ? 
B:  Right . 
C:  So they probably will have tools to address the actual 
D:  Oops .   
C:  the  the  the transcriber support and then automated alignment of what the transcribers give you , which is , you know , exactly the problem we have . So . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <card key reader beep, and door opening> 
C:  So this thing , this uh deliverable D - three point one of the MATE 
A:  Right . 
C:  project is 
C:  a review of a lot of different tools . 
D:  Yes !  
D:  Yeah , there you go . 
D:  Exactly . 
C:  They 're actually , they seem to be more 
C:  the tool the main focus of the tools is 
C:  you 've already got a transcription but you 're trying to tag the different turns 
C:  transi transcriptions with uh 
C:  discourse roles 
C:  and things like that . 
A:  I see . 
C:  But I mean a lot them are tools that will also do transcription as well . 
C:  And I could be wrong . 
D:  Well , my my impression I  I  
D:  I really thought of these resources in the context of you  
D:  you asking about 
D:  time aligning the  you know , What would you need to indicate 
C:  Right . 
D:  and were there tools for that because 
D:  um 
D:  I suspect that would be 
D:  uh pretty 
D:  time intensive . 
D:  I also wanted to say , in terms of like 
D:  disc 
D:  you know , if there are discussions about intonation contours 
D:  I do have 
D:  a certain amount of background in that and I really would be  
A:  Right . 
D:  I 'd like to be involved in that . 
A:  No , right , I didn't mean to imply that 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  that we  
A:  that  that we shouldn't discuss this now , but I 'm  
A:  I 'm just saying that  
D:  Oh , not right now , but I mean in the future . So at this meeting with Liz 
A:  Right . 
D:  I  you know , I mean  
A:  Right . 
D:  I  I do  
D:  I 'd like to  
D:  I like that stuff . 
A:  Sure , sure . 
B:  So , when is she showing up ? 
A:  Well ,  
A:  I mean , they 're coming in April . 
B:  April . OK . 
A:  Right . 
A:  But , 
A:  um 
A:  You know , we  we may or may not 
A:  talk before then 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  on that . 
A:  Um . 
A:  I  I think we won't 
A:  probably talk until we have more data , I would think . 
A:  Right ? 
B:  Right , since we have 
B:  almost none right now , 
B:  let 's 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  We need to move forward from there . 
B:  But uh , yeah , I guess it 's O K . 
B:  OK , do we have anything else to talk about with transcribes ? 
topic_description:	transcription


A:  So , I 'm just curious how  how  h 
A:  how exactly you got roped into this . 
A:  I mean  
D:  Oh .  
D:  Um , because my name was  
D:  was mentioned when I wasn't around , but I 'm most happy . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  OK . Good . 
B:  Oh really ? Cuz Morgan said he asked you . 
D:  Oh , uh he did . 
D:  and  and I approved . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  but I think that I was 
D:  uh 
D:  proposed before I was asked ? 
D:  And that doesn't matter 
D:  cuz I think there was probably an a 
A:  Oh . 
D:  uh 
A:  Yeah . That would be m 
D:  y an indication that  
A:  That would be my fault . 
D:  that I was interested in advance 
D:  and , in which case , I thank you .  
A:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh 
A:  right . 
B:  And so , one of the first questions is , 
A:  OK . 
B:  " do you need help ? " 
C:  Well , hang on . 
A:  Oh ? 
B:  That 's not the first question . 
C:  Well , <laugh> 
A:  OK . 
C:  Well , I guess . 
C:  Do you  So , do you  
C:  What are  what are we talking about ? That you 're gonna  
C:  you 're gonna do transcriptions ? You 're going to listen to these things and  
D:  I 'm going to provide  
D:  I 'm going to be  
D:  once I 'm given the 
D:  data , I will provide 
D:  w word - level transcripts 
D:  with 
C:  OK . 
D:  uh indication of speakers , 
D:  and 
D:  um 
D:  I guess speaker change in any case , so 
D:  speaker ID , 
D:  and words . 
A:  OK . 
A:  So you 're gonna 
A:  do the actual transcription yourself . 
topic_description:	fe008 to do transcripts


C:  D I And do you have a clear  I mean , is that  
C:  Do you sort of  
C:  Are you going to have to make up what you do or do you have a very 
C:  clear idea of what you 're going to do ? 
C:  So I mean , is it  is it  
D:  Well 
C:  Is this l 
C:  Is it  like something you 've done before ? or  
D:  I 've transcribed a lot . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  But um e 
D:  you know , 
D:  the  
D:  I mean , there are always ways of doing things 
C:  And , 
D:  more efficiently or 
D:  more 
D:  uh  
D:  in a more technical technically sophisticated way ? 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Do you have to speak 
D:  true English sentences when you do this ? 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , because as people are going to be listening to it afterwards and saying 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  " Oh listen to her . She couldn't even speak true English sentences ! " 
D:  " She can't speak ! "  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  " It 's terrible ! " 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  OK , 
D:  So <laugh> 
D:  um 
C:  Oh , you 're meant  You 're meant to speak naturally . You 're meant to say 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  " Oh , I didn't realize we were being recorded ! " 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  Ah <laugh> right . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  " No one told me that . " 
D:  " This microphone , what 's this doing around my neck ? " 
B:  Uh , that 's  <laugh> I  I was saying before we don't really have to worry about people being surprised by it .  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  It 's just  
C:  It 's just jewelry . 
C:  <microphone bumping noises> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  OK , so um 
D:  typically , what I w you know I  in  
D:  uh 
D:  i 
D:  what I 've done before is I have a  
D:  uh 
D:  tape recorder , with a reverse button . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  And you just , 
D:  you know , if it 's word level 
D:  e you know , you do a  
D:  e 
D:  a r 
D:  I just hit the r 
B:  Play .  
D:  re 
D:  the rewind button 
D:  every couple of words and

C:  Yeah . 
D:  Um .

D:  It 's just

C:  The nice thing about transcribers is they have foot pedals ,

D:  But I frankly 
D:  didn't find it any more use to me than 
C:  Oh . 
D:  my  hand - held taperecorder . 
C:  I see . 
D:  However , if we have a transcribing machine 
D:  I would accept it . 
D:  The other thing is , 
D:  you know , 
D:  having  
D:  getting hold of a transcriber . I think that CogSci has one . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  And I could probably borrow one . 
A:  Well , 
C:  I  I  I actually have one . 
A:  one th 
D:  You have one yourself ? 
C:  Well , Sarah has one because she does a lot of 
D:  Oh , I see !  
C:  transcribing of interviews .

A:  The other thing is is that we might be  
C:  The crazy thing is we 'd have to 
A:  Oh . 
C:  convert the s 
C:  we 'd have to dump the audio files onto cassette . 
C:  to use it . 
D:  Oh , I see . 
D:  OK . 
C:  I mean , given that we 've already 
C:  got them digitally 
C:  it would be  
C:  you know , it 's quite tempting to use some kind of uh software thing . 
D:  Oh , OK . 
C:  But  but then there 's the question of the ergonomic interface , that  
D:  I kn 
B:  Oh , 
B:  I actually have some foot pedals for the P C . 
A:  Well , that 's what I was gonna say , is 
A:  that Adam has foot pedals that we could probably try and rig something up to  
C:  OK . 
D:  Oh , that 'd be super . 
C:  What do they connect to ? 
B:  Uh , keyboard . 
B:  and they generate keystrokes . 
C:  Oh , that 's totally cool . 
C:  now how  how do you  
C:  how do you decide which keystrokes they generate ? 
B:  Um 
B:  There 's a little program that downloads into it . 
D:  This is great .  
B:  Um . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  And this is Windows ? 
B:  But the program probably only runs in Windows , although I bet we could 
B:  program it once 
C:  Uh - huh . 
B:  And  
B:  and then put it on another machine and it would work . 
A:  Except for the fact that we would have to unplug it and pow and 
B:  I haven't used them . 
A:  change  it w 
A:  Does it lose the memory 
A:  once you 've unpowered it ? 
B:  I don't know . 
B:  I don't think it does . 
C:  So hang on . You have  
C:  You have these foot pedals but you d you 're not using them . 
B:  I 'm not using them anymore . I used to use them . 
B:  So they 're currently set up 
B:  for Shift , Control , and Alt . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  But I r I don't use them .  They 're not even plugged in . 
C:  Wow . 
C:  That 's so cool . 
C:  OK . 
D:  This sounds wonderful . 
B:  And so tha uh if that would help , uh I 'm certainly willing to donate them . 
C:  Well , 
D:  I 'm  I 'm open to  
C:  the d the  well , the uh 
C:  The part that 's not wonderful is someone has to write the software .  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Right . 
D:  Yeah , that 's true . 
D:  <inbreath> 
B:  And it  it is a PC connection , so it would have to go on a P C somewhere .

D:  I 'm assuming that I would not be 
B:  Yeah , yeah , you are  generating it . 
D:  uh 
D:  you know 
D:  e eh uh 
D:  transcribing all of it . 
D:  <laugh> <inbreath> 
D:  So , 
B:  Well , that  that was part of the question , is that if , 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  for  
C:  Right . 
B:  if we 're doing this regularly  Imagine we 're doing a couple of hours a week of transcripts 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  um , of recording , 
B:  uh , I wouldn't expect you to do it all . 
D:  No . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  No , no . 
B:  So the question is do you know of resources that we could use . 
B:  So are there grad students or undergrads or just 
D:  Yes . 
D:  Mm - hmm , yeah , OK , so now I 've  
B:  commercial services ? 
D:  I 've been involved with some of that . 
D:  At  at CogSci , 
D:  um  
D:  So , Susan E 
D:  Susan Ervin - Tripp , 
D:  who you know 
D:  um would typically , and I 've done this too , supervise undergrads 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  to 
D:  do this kind of thing 
D:  and they c 
D:  you know , 
D:  you can give them like  
D:  if you give them a little bit of instruction and  
D:  and make it interesting for them 
D:  they can do it as a two ninety - eight or s 
D:  or , not two ninety - eight , what is it , one whatever , 
D:  undergraduate research credit . 
D:  Because what you do is , you can  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Oh , really ? 
D:  you know , build it into some sort of a  
B:  So we only have to give them credits , 
B:  We don't have to give them money ? 
D:  Well uh , you have to be sure you give them compensation for  you know . 
D:  of some  of some sort . What I mean is it 's not necessarily monetary . 
B:  Oh , you do have to pay them . 
A:  Awesome . 
D:  But if they feel like they 're getting something out of it , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  sometimes you can do it that way . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And otherwise , as part of a grant , 
D:  you can  
D:  you can do it . 
D:  some sort of 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  minimal 
D:  wage . 
B:  Well , we  we need to  
B:  We need to find out how much that will cost , so I can pass that on to Morgan , 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  cuz right now we have almost no money . 
D:  Yeah , OK . 
B:  So  so the cheaper we can do it , the better . 
C:  Well ,  
D:  OK . 
D:  Well , you also want to get quality . 
D:  I mean , someone 's going to have to pass through  
C:  Yeah , absolutely . 
D:  Either a higher level person will have to pass through , or you have to be sure you get 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  good quality 
B:  Right . 
D:  to begin with . 
D:  But um , 
D:  yeah , that 's quite  
D:  you know  we 've  
D:  That 's been 
D:  done . 
D:  I can ask Susan Ervin - Tripp 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  what she would recommend on that . She 's really  
D:  She 's done  
D:  Of the people that I know , she 's the one who 's supervised the most of those things locally . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  What 's her name ? 
D:  Uh 
D:  uh Doctor Susan Ervin - Tripp . 
C:  OK . 
D:  faculty member in Psychology , recently retired ,

C:  the 
C:  problem of starting off with some recordings and trying to get word transcripts 
C:  is kind of  
C:  I mean , it 's not a  it 's not an unfamiliar problem . 
C:  So that  
D:  Oh , it 's very common . 
C:  So that I mean that basically , 
D:  Yeah .  
C:  there are standard solutions and we should just adopt  
C:  adopt them and it 's going to cost however much it 's going to cost , 
C:  I mean there 's  
C:  We 're  we 're probably not going to have a lot of flexibility in 
C:  bringing down the cost cuz probably 
C:  the low cost solution 's already been established . 
C:  And so that 's just whatever it is . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  That 's 
C:  how we 'll do it . 
D:  <inbreath> 
C:  See what I mean ? 
D:  I think there 's always this question of the trade - off between uh 
D:  paying more for the first pass , 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  and then h 
D:  and then editing less later . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
D:  or

C:  I mean the only thing is 
C:  I wonder if our requirements are different from um  
C:  I mean there 's  than  
C:  than what 's been done in the past 
C:  than discourse analyzers 
C:  because 
C:  maybe we have different requirements in terms of time align 
C:  you know , how much time  aligned detail we need 
C:  and uh how much detail in terms of people . 
D:  Oh , 
D:  But that 's a s 
D:  Mm - hmm . OK . 
C:  I don I don't know how much ti I don't think we do need any time aligned detail . 
C:  I think we just have 
C:  basically one text file which runs from beginning to end . 
B:  <inbreath> 
C:  But . 
B:  Well , if  in terms of transcripts , sure , but in terms of speaker change it might be 
B:  nice to get the actual 
B:  time . 
C:  Sure . 
C:  But not if it costs more .  
B:  Right . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> 
C:  the  it 's sort of it 's  a little  
C:  In some sense it 's a little bit easier with it  with 
C:  Switchboard because the telephone is so  
C:  actually people 
C:  are less flexible in what they do . In this kind of situation where 
C:  we 've got 
C:  nonverbal 
C:  channels 
C:  then there 's a lot of overlap 
C:  and there 's just that it 's not a very good model . 
A:  Right . 
B:  Oh , 
topic_description:	time alignment


A:  Well , OK . So what happened with Switchboard 
A:  was 
A:  at least , 
A:  I mean , the output 
A:  was that they had 
A:  speaker turns 
A:  and they 
A:  um 
A:  analyzed it in terms of , 
A:  you know , " this is where this speaker change came in " 
A:  and of course that gets really 
A:  difficult when you 're talking about  I mean , this is some of the stuff that you were 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  talking about in 
A:  uh 
A:  your lunch talk , is that  is that 
C:  Right . 
A:  you know , you get backchannels and stuff like that , that 
A:  that , 
A:  you know , disrupt the 
A:  um 
A:  the 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  segment you know the 
C:  Right , I mean , 
A:  segmentation .

B:  in terms of data format , what are we going to do about that ? 
B:  I mean , 
B:  you have the S T M format , where you have 
B:  you know , every phrase , every utterance is  is 
B:  a single speaker . 
B:  I mean , is that the right way to do it ? Or  
C:  Well , 
C:  every utterance is a single speaker , right ? 
C:  It 's just that utterances can overlap . 
C:  I mean , 
B:  Is that the right way to do it ? 
C:  I think so . 
C:  I think  I think  I mean , I think when I 'm  when  
B:  OK . 
C:  Like , So , Eric made a s made a sentence , 
C:  and that should be like one 
C:  utterance 
C:  and then I had a couple of backchannels in there 
C:  and they should be just overlapping things that  
C:  I don't think that we should break Eric 's sentences for those . I think  
B:  OK . So that means that for each utterance , we 'll need the time marks , 
A:  Right . 
B:  the start and end of each utterance . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  So . 
A:  So  
C:  Well , we 'll have to go in from somewhere 
C:  but we can't necessarily  
C:  I mean , we  we may be able to get the transcriber to give them to us 
C:  if we 
C:  give them software 
C:  but 
C:  we may not 
C:  in which case we 'll have to get them 
D:  <inbreath> 
C:  some other way , like with forced alignment later , I mean 
C:  you know all this can be done .

B:  In terms of data formats , uh 
B:  what I did for the Digits stuff was just 
B:  to hand - rolled my own . 
B:  That looks like this form . 
B:  You know , it 's just uh something that 's easy to parse in Perl . 
B:  Um . 
B:  Probably for

B:  I mean , some format that our tools already work with . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well , 
C:  Yes , 
C:  although that might @ @ 
C:  presumably we 'll have one  
C:  we 'll have several formats that you can interconvert between . 
A:  Right . 
B:  Yeah , presumably . 
C:  When we want to do recognition we 'll do STM , but 
C:  if we 're  
C:  rather than  rather than designing our own format , 
C:  we 'll just take whatever 
C:  comes out of the tools that we can find to use , I think . 
B:  Yeah , I guess that 's true . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  I  I  I 've got no idea

A:  Well I know that

A:  I know that um

A:  does not come out in STM format . 
C:  Right . 
A:  They  they basically give 
D:   
A:  um 
A:  They subdivide into WAVE files

D:  uh 
D:  seeing how this  
A:  Right . 
D:  Here 's another thing I got . 
A:  Oh , so this 'd  this w is 
A:  probably what the L D C uses . I mean they do a lot of transcription at the L D C . 
D:  OK . 
A:  I could ask my contacts at the LDC what  
A:  what it is they actually use .

C:  Can I see ? 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  This is the other think that  um  This is part of EAGLES , but 
D:  um , 
D:  but here again , it 's focusing on representation rather than the tools to do this . 
D:  Why do I feel like I 'm whispering ?

B:  Oh , no ! It has the word " X M L " in it ! 
C:  Oh , good . <laugh> 
C:  It must be  It must be fundable then . 
D:  " KCM file formats " ,  
A:  Oh , looks like  
D:  This is the 
A:  Looks like uh work packages . 
A:  Must be  a European  project . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh , yeah . 
C:  @ @ 
D:  Yeah , it is European . Both of these are Eur - European , 
D:  but they have 
D:  you know , American contributions , and stuff . 
A:  Oh , so they 're using the Alembic 
A:  Workbench , from Mitre . 
C:  Alembic ? 
A:  I guess . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Is that free ? 
A:  I don't know . 
D:  Well i but you see they have a whole bunch of things . 
D:  What they 're doing is trying to bring together  
D:  and they rate things . I wasn't focused on that so I didn't  
D:  Let me show y 
D:  Have you seen this one , Dan ? 
C:  No . 
D:  And I 'll try to get one for you , too .  
D:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh , you 've got one . 
D:  What are you looking at here ? 
D:  He 's got the Mark - up Framework . 
D:  Oh , yeah . 
D:  Different coding schemes . 
B:  But it doesn't have enough pictures . 
B:  So , I think 
D:  OK . 
B:  it will require too much reading to understand whether this is anything 
A:  Oh , 
A:  this is , 
A:  I see . 
A:  They 're reviewing , and  
B:  that we can easily use . 
D:  What they 're doing is they 're comp comparing all these existing things that have been submitted and 
A:  I see . 
D:  And it includes , this one includes the TEI and 
D:  uh 
D:  so it 's  it 's um 
D:  pretty broad - based . 
B:  " TEI " is  ?  
D:  These things do seem to be  
A:  Mitre , 
D:  That 's the Text Encoding Initiative . 
B:  Oh . 
D:  That 's a way of marking mark - up . 
D:  so , you know , but focus on  tools to do this stuff 
D:  um , I do have a file also in addition to those things , but 
D:  it 'll take me just a second here 
B:  Well , I guess XML 
B:  makes some amount of sense . I 'm not actually familiar with it but 
B:  it seems to be the sort of thing 
B:  that this would be good for . 
B:  But  
D:  Well , yeah , I mean , if you start with a  
D:  a basic transcription 
D:  and a good filter . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  You can  
D:  I mean , that 's 
D:  sort of my feeling about it , that you should be  
D:  you should be able to  translate between 
D:  an XML and non - XML version cuz most  
B:  Right . 
D:  at least , you know , with a focus on discourse , mostly . 
D:  Oh ! I wanted to m 
D:  and then  
D:  I have one more thing I need to find .

D:  This  this approach here  This is Uli Heid from Stuttgart  
D:  is um a query language for research in phonetics where he 
D:  wants to build in ToBI tags and  so you can 
D:  determine 
D:  um  I wanted to mention this to you .  I was 
D:  going to come by and ask you about this . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Do you know about the Stuttgart um people ? 
D:  Because he 's saying if you represent  
C:  I don't think so . 
D:  He says that uh in German 
D:  " selbst " is used in two different ways so you have 
D:  It either means uh " himself " or it means " even " 
D:  and you can tell the difference in terms of uh intonation . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  So , 
C:  Hmm . 
D:  they have the recordings such that they 
D:  can locate things  uh 
D:  with  by searching 
D:  for 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  part of speech and also 
D:  intonational  tags . 
D:  Anyway ,  that 's  that . 
C:  Because the transcriber 's put in intonational tags ? 
D:  This is true . 
D:  This is true . 
D:  Which of course is another issue . 
C:  Or maybe not . 
D:  Exactly so .

D:  There 's this one 
D:  um 
D:  This is called " Transcriber " .

D:  " Transcriber is a tool for assisting creation of speech corpora . "  
C:  Who 's it from ? 
C:  Right . 
D:  " It allows 
D:  to manually segment , label and transcribe speech signals " 
D:  And , 
C:  Is it the French one ? 
D:  uh , let 's see , where did I get this ? I got this from U Penn . 
C:  U Penn . 
C:  I think that I 've heard of this one . It was the one that Steve Renals 
D:  But  
C:  mentioned . 
D:  It is possible .

D:  or are you talking about tools that would allow the time alignment 
D:  as well ? 
B:  No , we 're not going to do time alignment . 
A:  No . 
C:  Well  
D:  OK . 
C:  Well , 
C:  We are going to do time alignment . 
C:  but we 'll probably do it ourselves , right ? 
C:  So we 're not  we 're not concerned about getting  getting  
A:  Right .

C:  bringing in tools . 
A:  We 're very good at time alignments .

A:  Uses what ? 
C:  It uses Snack . 
C:  That 's a  TCL  audio  thing that I  had some involvement with . 
B:  OK , then we 'll have to use it . 
D:  Oh , cool . 
D:  Very cool . 
B:  No  no question . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  If I have to use it I 'm sure  I 'm sure

D:  OK . 
B:  gacks 
C:  Transcriber 
D:  Whoa !  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  So it 's very interest I mean , 
A:  it 's interesting that 
A:  one of the coordinators on that is Mark Liberman 
D:  @ @  
A:  from the LDC 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Which means that  
A:  I don't know what 
A:  " coordinator " means 
A:  in  in terms of that . 
A:  I mean 
B:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
B:  Well , I think  
A:  What  
A:  what is  what is  what is this web page from ? 
D:  Well , I apparently ,  
D:  you know , I roam around 
D:  on  on topics like this 
A:  Sure . 
D:  And I think I got this off the U Penn 
D:  and it does in fact cite a French site , so um 
D:  they have some sort of an arrangement . 
B:  Well , I just wrote down 
A:  I see . 
B:  the French site and I will check it and try to download it 
A:  Right . 
B:  And uh see what it looks like . 
D:  Good . 
D:  You - you can access it through um  
D:  through the , uh , 
D:  whatever  
D:  I can't remember which 
D:  aspect of U of U Penn I was 
A:  Right . 
D:  following , but 
D:  It must have been the LDC . 
D:  I  I  I bet you anything . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , they have a  
B:  I vaguely recall that they have a pages uh tools page 
B:  somewhere , 
D:  Mm - hmm . OK . 
B:  with like 
A:  OK . 
B:  lists and lists and lists of uh 
D:  Yes . 
B:  various and assorted tools . 
D:  Well there 's  
D:  They have a special project , as I 'm remembering , 
D:  and um , usually it doesn't deal with much that has to do with discourse , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  but they uh  
D:  they show up in 
D:  resources . 
B:  So , 
B:  Um , 
B:  we 'll start with " Transcriber " and if it looks like that 's not gonna 
B:   do  what we need , 
B:   we 'll  move on to the Mississippi State and if it doesn't look like that 's going to work , 
B:  we 'll look at something else . 
D:  I like that very much , and I and I like the idea of also doing one that 's tied in with 
B:  OK . 
D:  these larger corp  corpus projects . So that , you know , the fact that , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  yeah , it 's U Penn and all that .

B:  Also , I wanted to mention just in passing that 
B:  uh another thing that we 're going to want to start collecting is queries for the meetings . 
B:  So if over the next couple of days you find yourself wondering what we talked about in the meeting , 
B:  write down the sort of query you 'd like to make . 
D:  Oh , good idea . 
B:  Do you understand what I mean ? 
D:  It 's like the PDA thing . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  So , 
B:  imagine that we had Meeting Recorder all done , 
B:  and you had one , 
B:  what might you do 
B:  with it ? 
B:  So , 
B:  if they occur to you . 
D:  So , like 
D:  " did the French system use Tcl ? " 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Right . 
B:  <laugh> That 's a good one .  
A:  Actually what I would have 
B:  Send m

B:  So , if you could just email me them . 
A:  w w 
A:  " What was the web address of that <laugh> thing " , 
A:  which we didn't  
B:  Yeah , except we didn't record . 
A:  we didn't record that .

A:  Right .

B:  And then , uh 
B:  there 's also just the general question of  will it handle multiple channels or should we just  
B:  Dan and I spoke about this briefly , 
B:  do we want to try to combine channels somehow 
B:  to make the transcriber 's job easier ? 
B:  I was listening to some of it and uh 
B:  like , if you just listen to the far 
B:  P Z M 
B:  the person sitting at this end of the table you can hardly hear at all . 
B:  on  on the transcript , so there may be  
B:  it may be worthwhile to at least 
B:  try a little bit 
B:  to combine the channels . 
A:  Right . 
C:  I  
topic_description:	handling multiple channels


C:  Uh , the stuff I did , I combined pairs of these into stereo pairs , listened to them in stereo . 
B:  Huh . Neat ! 
C:  And I was very impressed by how 
C:  well you could hear 
C:  separate speakers , but I haven't  
C:  I haven't done very extensive tests . 
B:  Oh , so , that would be 
B:  interesting as well to do that . 
A:  Oh ! 
A:  Yeah , cuz you 'd get 
A:  you get  
C:  you get a certain amount of spatial information . 
A:  Right ! 
C:  It 's not  It 's not consistent but it 's

C:  Well , what is  what is the goal ? 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  again ? 
C:  We 're going to end up with some  
C:  I mean , ultimately , we 're going to end up with 
C:  transcriptions of these meetings . 
B:  And we 'll run a  
B:  train a neural net

B:  create a recognizer and 
B:  do 
C:  What , and then  
C:  Then  
B:  information retrieval and  
C:  Then we 'll be done , huh ? 
B:  Well , that 's my interest . 
B:  I mean , other people have different interests , so . 
C:  Um . 
B:  That 's what I want . 
C:  Of course , there are different kinds of recos 
B:  Y 
A:  W 
A:  We also need to d 
A:  do this in terms of SmartKom , 
A:  I mean , we 're collecting this as  
A:  to build general 
A:  English acoustic models . 
A:  that

A:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh , I didn't know that . 
C:  OK . 
D:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
topic_description:	what is goal?


C:  so we 're going to actually train a recognizer based on these 
C:  uh , far - field mikes  cuz what we  that 's the problem we 're trying to solve . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
C:  OK . 
C:  We need a lot of  I mean  
B:  Well , what  the  
B:  so , the reason we 're doing near field as well is if that doesn't work we wanna back 
B:  we want some  
C:  Well  
C:  and also the near field will allow us to do the time alignment accurately . 
B:  something that will work . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
C:  Um . 
D:  So these are near  near field ? 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah .  Close mikes . 
D:  there 
D:  OK .  
C:  I mean I  yeah , I feel like  
C:  that  What we 're actually going to do with these data is 
C:  very unclear to me 
B:  Why ? 
C:  Well , because I don't think that 's a

B:  That 's right , 
B:  Well , but you know we have to try . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  We  we  we could simply not do the project .

D:  You know , if  if we were to add  in addition , 
D:  and I 'm offering this , 
D:  um 
D:  to the word level , 
D:  also 
D:  the  
D:  uh , so , stressed words , 
D:  within 
D:  utterances 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  I do think that that would help the information retrieval . 
C:  Well , I mean , that would be tremendously useful information 
D:  OK . 
C:  assuming that we actually 
C:  pursue it , 
C:  but 
C:  um 
C:  we 've got a huge problem , because if we ge if we want train a recognizer we need tens of hours of labelled data .

D:  intonational and  and stress - oriented transcription 
D:  they

B:  Well , I think to some extent with things like

D:  One thing about that is that is that 
D:  um 
D:  in the process of

D:  information retrieval aspects from that . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  And I wouldn't be too surprised  I mean , it 's  it 's like uh 
D:  I mean I don't know how  how reliable Lea is ,

D:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  I mean 
A:  Are you certain ? 
C:  Lea ? 
B:  No . 
D:  The claim that 
D:  uh words that get stressed 
D:  are easier to recognize . 
C:  I see . 
D:  So , 
D:  I mean , I  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  I think it c there 's be sort of a benefit with very minimal input . 
D:  Cuz when you listen to a sentence , 
D:  you can tell  
D:  If it 's contrastive stress you say " Oh ! that word was stressed " 
D:  and why the heck not put it in at the word level ? So  
D:  so , I mean , 
D:  the part that I 'm doing , I 'm really happy to supply that without any
