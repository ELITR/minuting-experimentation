E:  Wow . 
E:  Alright . 
E:  So . 
E:  It is uh , must be February fifteenth . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  We didn't have a front - end meeting today . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  OK . 
E:  So . 
E:  Agenda . 
E:  Any agenda items today ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK audio monitoring , Jane . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Um . 
E:  I mean , were this a professional audio recording , <laugh> what we would do   what you would do is  in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that  that  that things are not giving that kind of performance . 
E:  And if they are , then they can't be used . 
E:  So . 
E:  Um . Let 's see . 
E:  I guess  I would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh , recording , transcription 
E:  you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus . 
E:  And then um , the other thing which I would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , I think , deal is , uh , agendas . 
E:  So maybe I 'll  I 'll start with that actually . 
E:  Uh , um . <mouth noise> Andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about 
E:  because he 's sort of peripherally involved to this point , 
E:  and if there 's gonna be a topic about  discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come 
E:  and  And I think part of  part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out , 
E:  in the  because of uh the fact that the meetings are  are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up 
E:  and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing  
E:  and  and I 'm sure help out his own time . 
E:  by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's  he 's  
E:  So , uh in order  
E:  I 'd  I think that this is a wish on his part . 
E:  Uh . It 's actually gonna be hard 
E:  because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated 
E:  and  and  
E:  But um , we could try anyway , 
E:  uh , do another try at coming up with the agenda uh , at some point before the meeting , 
E:  uh , say the day before . 
E:  OK . 
E:  You  you wanna volunteer to do that ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  Alright so we 'll send out agenda request . 
E:  Uh . 
E:  Yeah , I have to tell you for the uh  for the admin meeting that we have , Lila does that um every time before an admin meeting . 
E:  And uh , she ends up getting the agenda requests uh , uh ten minutes before the meeting . 
E:  But  but   But . 
E:  Uh .  But we can try . 
E:  Maybe it 'll work . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Actually it  
E:  This  this maybe brings up another topic which is um  
E:  So we 're done with that topic . 
E:  The other topic I was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Why  why don't we do that . 
E:  So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ? 
E:  So , um . 
E:  So let 's see we  
E:  And right now we can have up to six . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh . 
E:  So yeah so the only  
E:  Beyond the mike  the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars . 
E:  Oh , we should do it . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Basically we found  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  But we 've had more problems with that . 
E:  And that sort of bypasses the whole  the whole Jimbox thing and all that . 
E:  And so um , we  we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes , 
E:  as long as we 're conscious about the batteries . 
E:  That seems to be the key issue . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Um , <mouth> That 's the only thing with them . 
E:  But the quality seems really good 
E:  and  
E:  Um I heard from UW that they 're  they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . 
E:  They 're  they 're  they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Uh , I don't know . 
E:  Probably we shouldn't  probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  But anyway there 's  there 's  there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and  and uh  and NIST and UW . 
E:  So . 
E:  Um . But  but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is  is quite positive with the Sony , 
E:  uh , radio - mikes . 
E:  Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets 
E:  meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something , 
E:  right ? 
E:  No ? 
E:  Oh . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Nothing against you and your hand - soldering 
E:  but  
E:  Uh , OK , so that 's being done professionally 
E:  and  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Well , it could  
E:  if they do a lot of it , it 's  
E:  Well , we 'll see what it  it 's like . 
E:  That  tha that can be quite good . 
E:  Th - this  
E:  Yeah , OK . 
E:  Good . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So let 's go with that . 
E:  Uh , 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So , um , uh , Dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits . 
E:  Uh , so he 'll be interested in what 's going on with that . 
E:  I guess  
E:  Was  the decision last time was that the  the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ? 
E:  Has that started , or is that  ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  So anyway  
E:  So anyway I think we  we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be Dave . 
E:  Yeah , he might  he might be asking  
E:  Right . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Uh , is Dave  
E:  I don't know if Dave is on the list , 
E:  if he 's invited to these meetings , 
E:  uh 
E:  if he knows . 
E:  I don't know . 
E:  Uh , well i it 's uh  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , so this might be a conflict for him . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Uh , so . 
E:  Oh , OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  So , that 's why we 're not seeing him . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Uh , transcriptions , uh , beyond the digits , where we are , and so on . 
E:  And the  and the recordings also , 
E:  just where we are . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  And  and that 's  that 's uh  
E:  How much of that is digits ? 
E:  It 's uh  
E:  that 's including digits , 
E:  right ? 
E:  So  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours , 
E:  or something of  
E:  There 's got to be more than thirty hour  
E:  i it couldn't  
E:  of  Of non - digits . 
E:  Yeah , yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And  and again the main track that you 're working with is elev eleven hours ? 
E:  Is that right ? 
E:  Yeah , OK . 
E:  Is that  is that  that including digits ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So let 's say roughly  ten hours or so of  
E:  I mean it 's probably more than that but  but with  of  of non - digits . 
E:  Oh , OK . 
E:  Oh , I see . 
E:  Oh , I see . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  So what  what  what 's the deal with  with your  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh , I see . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  What are some of the other features ? Besides the energy ? 
E:  You said you 're trying some different features , or something . 
E:  Cu - Cube root ? 
E:  Ah . 
E:  Fletcher Munson ? 
E:  No . 
E:  Oh , OK . 
E:  Yeah , alright . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Um , let 's see . 
E:  I think the uh  
E:  Were  were you basically done with 
E:  the transcription part ? So I guess the next thing is this uh  bleep editing . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I  I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed . 
E:  I mean if people have  
E:  Uh , 
E:  I mean , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it . 
E:  And then  um  if I thought it was OK , I 'd say " it 's OK " . 
E:  And , I  
E:  uh  I mean it depends how this really ends up working out , 
E:  but I guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was OK or not and needing to listen to it was gonna be extremely rare . 
E:  OK . 
E:  That 's  
E:  I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say <breath> " here is a  here is  " 
E:  I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but  but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , uh , " here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ? 
E:  and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK " . 
E:  And then they 'd hand it back to you . 
E:  You find it easier to go through a large  
E:  I mean how do you read books ? 
E:  Really ? 
E:  I mean , it  
E:  Going to a web site is easy , 
E:  but flipping through a hundred pounds  a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the web . 
E:  Really ? 
E:  So here 's the way I was imagining it , and maybe I 'm wrong , 
E:  but the way I imagined it was that um , the largest set of people is gonna go " oh yeah , I didn't say anything funny in that meeting 
E:  just go ahead , 
E:  where 's the  where 's the release ? " 
E:  And then there 'll be a subset of people , 
E:  right ?  
E:  OK there 's  
E:  I mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly . 
E:  OK there 'll be a subset of people , who um , will say uh " well , yeah , I really would like to see that . " 
E:  And for them , the easiest way to flip through , if it 's a really large document , 
E:  I mean unless you 're searching . 
E:  Searching , of course , should be electronic , 
E:  but if you 're not  
E:  so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that , 
E:  but see then we 're getting more elaborate with this thing . 
E:  Um if  if uh you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document , 
E:  I mean whenever I 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , I 've always ended up printing it out . 
E:  I mean , so it 's  it 's  
E:  I mean , you  you 're  you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time , 
E:  you wanna figure you have a train ride , and there 's all these situations where  where I  
E:  I mean , this is how I was imagining it , anyway . 
E:  And then I figured , that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go " hmm you know I 'm really not sure about this section here , " 
E:  and then that group would need it  
E:  S It seems like i 
E:  if I 'm right in that , it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case . 
E:  So that uh , now we have to worry about privacy , 
E:  we have to worry about all these passwords , for different people 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Um , yeah , that 's true . 
E:  I guess  
E:  Yeah , I guess we don't need their signature . 
E:  I guess an email OK is alright . 
E:  Uh  I don't know about that . 
E:  But th what they signed in the consent form , was something that said you can use my voice . 
E:  Right ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , but that 's our decision then . 
E:  Right ? 
E:  I think it is . 
E:  I see . 
E:  OK , well , if that 's what it said . 
E:  Um  I mean it 's also a mixture of people , 
E:  I mean some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web , 
E:  and others do not . 
E:  Others would consider it  
E:  this uh  a  a set of skills that they would have to gain . 
E:  You know ? 
E:  It depends on what meetings . 
E:  In the meetings so far , yeah . 
E:  But we 're trying to expand this , 
E:  right ? 
E:  So I  I  I actually think that paper is the more universal thing . 
E:  No , I think we have to be able to print it out . 
E:  It 's not just if they want to print it out . 
E:  I  I think  
E:  I  I th 
E:  well  we  
E:  there was this  
E:  No . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Certainly for everybody who 's been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient . 
E:  I 'm just wondering about  
E:  There 's another aspect to this which maybe  is part of why this is bothering me . 
E:  Um , I think you 're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this . 
E:  I  I  I understand . 
E:  I think that 's the bad idea . 
E:  See because you 're gon you 're  uh  
E:  Really . 
E:  You 're gonna end up with all these little patchy things , whereas really what we want to do is have the  the  the bias towards letting it go . 
E:  Because nob you 
E:  know it  
E:  There was a  
E:  one or twi once or twice , in the re in the meetings we 've heard , where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by , 
E:  but overall people are talking about technical topics . 
E:  Nobody 's gonna get hurt . 
E:  Nobody 's being l libeled . 
E:  You know , this is  this  we 're  we 're covering  
E:  We 're playing the lawyer 's game , and we 're playing we 're  we 're  we 're looking for the extreme case . 
E:  If we really orient it towards that extreme case , make it really easy , we 're gonna end up encouraging a headache . 
E:  That  I think that 's  
E:  I 'm sort of psyching myself out here , 
E:  I  I 'm trying to  uh  
E:  but I  I think that 's  
E:  Well , it 's  
E:  but i 
E:  And  and it really depends on what kind of research you 're doing . 
E:  I think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there 's a bunch of stuff in there  that 's missing from the dialogue . 
E:  You know , it depends on the kind of research they 're doing , 
E:  but it might be , uh  it might be really a  a pain . 
E:  And , you know where it 's really gonna hurt somebody , in some way  
E:  the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about ,  we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out . 
E:  But I really think we wanna make it the rare incidence . 
E:  And  and uh , I am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do , 
E:  and so much fun ! <laugh> that they 're gonna go through and bleep out stuff . 
E:  and they can bleep out stuff they don't like too , 
E:  right 
E:  from somebody else , as you say , 
E:  you know , so " well I didn't like what he said . " 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  No , no , I  I  I don't  
E:  You - you 've talked me into that , 
E:  but I  I just think that we should make it harder to do . 
E:  So maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it . 
E:  So  so  so 
E:  I 'm sorry  
E:  so  so  So maybe this is a s a way out of it . 
E:  You 've provided something that 's useful for you to do  handle , 
E:  and useful for someone else if they need it . 
E:  But I think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh , they get access to this if they really need it . 
E:  Right . 
E:  W w 
E:  There 's  there  
E:  y 
E:  but you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what I 'm saying . 
E:  So  
E:  No , no , no . 
E:  But you aren't necessarily giving them  
E:  Right . 
E:  But  we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at all . 
E:  No , no . 
E:  You 're missing the point . 
E:  We 're  We 're trying i We 're trying to make it less of an obvious just l l l l uh fall off a log , to do this . 
E:  Right ? 
E:  So th so what I would see , is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the  
E:  not just for fun , 
E:  OK ? 
E:  but to  to check this for uh things that they 're worried about having said or if they 're willing to just send an approval of it , at  from their memory . 
E:  Um  and , uh , and we should think carefully actually we should review  go through how that 's worded , 
E:  OK ? 
E:  Then , if someone uh  wants to review it , uh , 
E:  and I know you don't like this , but I 'm offering this as a suggestion , is that  is that we then give them a print out . 
E:  And then if they say that " I have a potential problem with these things , " then , you  you say " OK well you might wanna hear this in context to s think if you need that , " you issue them a password , i in the  
E:  I know you 'd prefer it , but the proble 
E:  we have  
E:  there 's a problem with it . 
E:  Well you can go too far in that direction , and you need to find somewhere between I think , 
E:  because  
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Having access to it doesn't necessarily mean , that  having it 
E:  right ? 
E:  It just means they have the right to have it . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Um . <inbreath> Yeah , I mean I don't wanna fool them , 
E:  I just meant that e every  ev any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a  a bias that is presented , 
E:  right ? 
E:  of  and  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I  
E:  Yeah , uh no that  it  tha 
E:  that 's right . 
E:  I I  
E:  Yeah , OK , 
E:  so . wh um  I think I have an idea that may be sat may satisfy both you and me in this which is , um , 
E:  it 's a  it  we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded . 
E:  So I  I just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre it gives very , I mean nothing hidden , v very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data . 
E:  That  that we really would rather it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out , 
E:  that it would be better for , um , our , uh , field if that is the case . 
E:  But if you really think something is gonna  
E:  And I don't think there 's anything in the legal aspects that  that is hurt by our expressing that bias . 
E:  And then  then my concern about  which  
E:  you know you might be right , it may be it was just paranoia on my part , uh but people just  
E:  See I 'm @ @ worried about this interface so much fun <laugh> that people start bleeping stuff out  <laugh> just as  just because they can . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Well I don't know . 
E:  I kind of had fun when you played me something that was bleeped out . 
E:  You know . 
E:  I 
E:  Oh they won't ? 
E:  Oh good . 
E:  So you haven't made it so much fun . 
E:  Oh good . 
E:  OK , 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Alright , so I think  
E:  Yeah so if we have if  i 
E:  Again let 's you know , sort of circulate the  the wording on each of these things and get it right , 
E:  but  but  
E:  OK . 
E:  Uh , fair enough . 
E:  Turn about is fair play , 
E:  Sorry . 
E:  I 'm  I 'm  I 'm  I thought  I  I thought about it with one of my background processes 
E:  and I  uh it 's  uh it 's uh , it 's fine to do the email . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  And  
E:  Well and furthermore I  
E:  it 's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that I do with people on contracts and so forth 
E:  that  that uh if it 's  if it 's that sort of thing where you 're you 're saying uh " OK I agree , we want eighty hours of this person at such - and - such amount , and I agree that 's OK , " 
E:  uh if it 's a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it 's often done in email now 
E:  so it 's  it 's OK . 
E:  Um . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Liz will like it . 
E:  We had a pretty strong disagreement going there . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  But it  the  
E:  some something might sometime , and they  uh  
E:  if  if it 's something that they said , they might  
E:  i i 
E:  I mean , you might be very accurate in putting down what they actually said , 
E:  but , when they hear it , themselves , they may hear something different because they know what they meant . 
E:  No , I 'm serious . 
E:  So  the  so  i the  
E:  so we might  we might get some feedback from people that such - and - such was , you know , not  not really what I said . 
E:  Yeah , but , 
E:  Yeah , sure . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Well yeah , but you can't dep 
E:  I mean , most people will not wanna take the time to do that , though . 
E:  And they  they have to  
E:  But I mean if you were at a meeting , and  and you  you don't think , at least , that you said anything funny 
E:  and the meeting was about , you know , some  some funny thing about semantics or something , or uh  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . You would think it would be rare , 
E:  I mean we 're not talking about the energy crisis or something , people have  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I think we 're uh  
E:  Kind of done . 
E:  Actually , I was gonna  
E:  Di - Did you have anything n that 's going on , or  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's fine . 
E:  I just didn't wanna go by you , if you had something . 
E:  You don't have anything to say . 
E:  Nah . 
E:  Transcribers , he was rattling the b marbles in his brain back and forth just then this  this  
E:  Oh yeah . 
E:  Wow .
