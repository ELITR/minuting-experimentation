C:  He had the  the long form . 
C:  I see . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Have  Have we thought about having a conference call to include him in more of  <laugh> in more of the meeting ? 
C:  I  I mean , I don't know , 
C:  if we had the  if we had the telephone on the table  
C:  I see . OK . 
C:  No .  It 's not good . 
C:  That 's not good . 
C:  This is  this  that one 's better . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  If you have a strong fe if you have a strong preference , you could use this . 
C:  It 's just we  we think it has some spikes . 
C:  So , uh , we  we didn't use that one . 
C:  But you could if you want . 
C:  I don't know . 
C:  And Andre - Andreas , your  your microphone 's a little bit low . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  So if you see the picture 
C:  and then you have to scr 
C:  That looks good . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well . 
C:  Yeah . This would be OK . 
C:  We  we  we think that this has spikes on it , 
C:  so it 's not as good acoustically , 
C:  but  
C:  Well , if you 'd rather have this one then it 's  
C:  And there 's a screw that you can tighten . 
C:  Good . 
C:  That looks good . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Sorry . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I  OK . 
C:  I have to ask you something , 
C:  is i does it have to be Waves ? Because if we could benefit from what you did , incorporate that into the present transcripts ,  that would help . 
C:  And then , um , the other thing is , I believe that I did hand 
C:  So . One of these transcripts was gone over by a transcriber 
C:  and then I hand - marked it myself so that we do have , uh , the beginning and ending of individual utterances . 
C:  Um , I didn't do it word level , 
C:  but  but in terms  
C:  So I  so for  for one of the N S A groups . 
C:  And also I went back to the original one that I first transcribed and  and did it w uh , w uh , utterance by utterance for that particular one . 
C:  So I think you do have  
C:  if that 's a sufficient unit , I think that you do have hand - marking for that . 
C:  But it 'd be wonderful to be able to <inbreath> benefit from your Waves stuff . 
C:  OK . 
C:  I used it in Transcriber 
C:  and it 's  it 's in the  
C:  Yeah , that 's right . 
C:  Middle of the word , or  
C:  Well , I th I 'm thinking just ch e e incorporating it into the representation . 
C:  I mean , if it 's  if it 's  
C:  if you have start points , if you have , like , time tags , 
C:  which is what I assume . 
C:  Isn't that what  what you  ? 
C:  Well , see , Adam would be  
C:  If it  ? 
C:  OK . 
C:  So you would know this more than I would . 
C:  It seems like she  if she 's g if she 's moving time marks around , 
C:  since our representation in Transcriber uses time marks , it seems like there should be some way of  of using that  benefitting from that . 
C:  We have two . 
C:  Oh , good . 
C:  Good ! 
C:  Uh - huh . Yeah , exactly . Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Yes . 
C:  Yes , I did . 
C:  And furthermore , I found that there were a certain number where  <breath> not  not a lot , but several times I actually <breath> moved an utterance from <inbreath> Adam 's channel to Dan 's or from Dan 's to Adam 's . 
C:  So there was some speaker identif 
C:  And the reason was because <breath> I transcribed that at a point before  <inbreath> uh , before we had the multiple audio available 
C:  f 
C:  so I couldn't switch between the audio . 
C:  I  I transcribed it off of the mixed channel entirely , 
C:  which meant in overlaps , I was at a  at a terrific disadvantage . 
C:  In addition it was before the channelized , uh , possibility was there . 
C:  And finally I did it using the speakers of my , um  <breath> of  you know , off the CPU on my  on my machine 
C:  cuz I didn't have a headphone . 
C:  So it @ @ , like , I mean  
C:  Yeah , I  I mean , i in retrospect <laugh> it would 've been good to ha <inbreath> have got I should 've gotten a headphone . 
C:  But in any case , um , thi this is  this was transcribed in a  in a , <inbreath> uh , less optimal way than  than the ones that came after it , 
C:  and I was able to  you know , an and this meant that there were some speaker identif identifications 
C:  which were changes . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Fixed that . 
C:  Oh , well  
C:  Uh - oh . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  That was fixed , um , before  
C:  i i i I think I I think I understood that pretty  
C:  Thank you for mentioning . 
C:  Yeah , no , tha that  That I think went away a couple of versions ago , 
C:  but it 's good to know . 
C:  Yeah . So , with  under  um , uh , listening to the mixed channel , there were times when , as surprising as that is , I got Adam 's voice confused with Dan 's and vice versa  
C:  not for long utterances , 
C:  but jus just a couple of places , 
C:  and embedde embedded in overlaps . 
C:  The other thing that was w interesting to me was that I picked up a lot of , um , backchannels which were hidden in the mixed signal , 
C:  which , you know , I mean , you c not  not too surprising . 
C:  But the other thing that  
C:  I  I hadn't thought about this , 
C:  but I thou I wanted to raise this when you were  uh , with respect to also a strategy which might help with the alignments potentially , 
C:  but that 's  
C:  When I was looking at these backchannels , they were turning up usually  <inbreath> very often in  w well , I won't say " usually "  but anyway , very often , I picked them up in a channel <inbreath> w which was the person who had asked a question . 
C:  S so , like , someone says " an and have you done the so - and - so ? " 
C:  And then there would be backchannels , 
C:  but it would be the person who asked the question . 
C:  Other people weren't really doing much backchannelling . 
C:  And , you know , sometimes you have the  Yeah , uh - huh . 
C:  I mean , i it wouldn't be perfect , 
C:  but  but it does seem more natural to give a backchannel when  when you 're somehow involved in the topic , 
C:  and the most natural way is for you to have initiated the topic by asking a question . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Exactly . 
C:  Exactly . 
C:  Exactly my point . 
C:  An - and so this is the expectation thing that  uh , uh , 
C:  just the dyadic  
C:  But in addition , you know , if someone has done this analysis himself and isn't involved in the dyad , but they might also give backchannels to verify what  what the answer is that this  that the  the answerer 's given  
C:  There you go . 
C:  There you go . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh , yeah . 
C:  Well , that 's right . 
C:  And that would  
C:  Well , an 
C:  And what you say is the  is the re uh , o other side of this , 
C:  which is that , you know , so th there are lots of channels where you don't have these backchannels , w when a question has been asked 
C:  and  and these  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  So that 's good news , really . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Good . 
C:  Actually  
C:  Well , see , I know S Sue wrote about spurts of development . 
C:  But , in any case , I think it 's a good term , 
C:  and , uh  
C:  And ma maybe  maybe Chafe did . 
C:  I know  I know Ch - Chafe dealt with  
C:  Chafe speaks about intonation units . 
C:  But maybe he speaks about spurts as well 
C:  and I just don't know . 
C:  Yeah , go ahead . 
C:  Great . 
C:  That 's wonderful . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah , that 's right . 
C:  What 's interesting is it 's exactly what , um , i in discussing with , um , Sue about this , 
C:  um , she , um , i i i indicated that that  you know , that 's very important for overlap analysis . 
C:  And that 's another thing she said . 
C:  This is  This is Bever 's  Bever 's effect , 
C:  when  where  In psy ps psycho - linguistics you have these experiments where people have perceptual biases a as to what they hear , 
C:  that  that  Not the best  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Superb . 
C:  Well , what I 'm thinking is  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well , my  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I think we can ha 
C:  Nah . 
C:  And good ones , 
C:  good ones , 
C:  which sometimes means  a little extra time . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  I 'm looking forward to seeing your representation . 
C:  That 'd be , uh  
C:  I 'd like to see that . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  I see . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Great . 
C:  OK . 
C:  It 's , uh , two thousand eleven twenty - one one thousand . 
C:  Great . 
C:  I sent email when I finished the  that one . 
C:  That was sort of son 
C:  Yeah , that 's right . That 's right . 
C:  That 's much simpler . 
C:  Yeah . Not that NSA . 
C:  Interesting . 
C:  I guess it does w 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  It also raises the possibility of , um , using that kind of representation  I mean , I don't know , this 'd be something we 'd wanna check ,  but maybe using that representation for data entry 
C:  and then displaying it on the channelized , uh , representation , 
C:  cuz it  I think that the  I mean , my  my preference in terms of , like , looking at the data is to see it  in this kind of musical score format . 
C:  And also , s you know , Sue 's preference as well . 
C:  And  and  
C:  but , I mean , this  if this is a better interface for making these kinds of , uh , you know , lo clos local changes , then that 'd be fine , too . 
C:  I don't  I have no idea . 
C:  I think this is something that would need to be checked . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  Ah . 
C:  Nice . 
C:  Great . 
C:  Thank you . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well , we have a time  
C:  Well , we have a s a time  time constraint . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
C:  That 's nice . 
C:  Wow . 
C:  Wow . 
C:  Very nice . 
C:  Nice . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Hey , you 've done this before . Haven't you ? 
C:  You 've read  digits together with us , haven't you  
C:  I mean , at the same time ? 
C:  Oh , you haven't ! 
C:  Oh , OK . 
C:  Oh , and the groupings are important , 
C:  so yo you 're supposed to pause between the groupings . 
C:  No . 
C:  No . 
C:  Yeah . That 'd be good . 
C:  And then  then we can sing them next time . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Mmm ! 
C:  He had the h 
C:  He had the  the long form .
