C:  OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Is the question . 

C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Ah . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  DTD . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  It 's possible . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Sure . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yep . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I  I think is not  
C:  I think it 's not necessary to put uh " Optional " . 
C:  I think people decide uh , in that moment . 
C:  Because if you put " Optional , " I think you  you give eh  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . OK . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Is better . 
C:  I think it 's better . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Not the year . 
C:  The PIN ! 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  So - and - so and so  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Interesting . 
C:  Role , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Ah , yeah yeah . 
C:  I  I found the error , and I repeated the experiments 
C:  eh and here , eh  you can find the new results eh  with  
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  OK ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Another side . 
C:  an alteration in th in the tracking way . 
C:  You mean that eh you ehm  mmm  
C:  I understand that eh you  you mean eh to  to study the alteration between the  the tracking of the pitch eh if we compare the overlapping zone with a speaker zone . 
C:  in the co in the context . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  OK . 
C:  I don't normalicized eh in these er experiments . by the moment . 
C:  I don't normalicize . 
C:  Yeah ? 
C:  Nnn . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  The different zone . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  The product of the deviation is the vari is the variance . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  But  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  No . 
C:  It 's a pu pure overlapping zone . 
C:  I mean that eh overlapping between two , three , four eh eh speaker . 
C:  Th 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Because they  they 're  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Sorry ? 
C:  Say this graphic ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I use the mixed signal without normalization  without normalization , 
C:  but  but 
C:  Ah . 
C:  I  I don't study the single channel yet 
C:  but eh is eh  is an idea . 
C:  to  to begin to work with the  eh  with the one single channel . Now . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Ah . 

C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Here in the  yeah it  it 's a new   new  a new diapositive with information about the context for overlapping zone . 
C:  Um . 
C:  How define ? 
C:  I Eh  
C:  j my ? 
C:  eh , I  I 'm  working now with pitch detector . 
C:  I 'm working now , but eh I haven't eh results yet . 
C:  But eh at this moment I  I  I prepare , I am  I am preparing the  the pitch eh eh tracking . pitch tracker eh algorithm that I have 
C:  but eh 
C:  No . 
C:  eh , I  I  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  It 's based on uh a correlation between frame the utterance 
C:  but eh I don't know what is ehm  eh  
C:  because it 's no my  my algorithm . 
C:  Is  
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  For most @ @ . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  For b for both , for eh the frame energy and eh residular LPC eh energy too . 
C:  For both . 
C:  but eh I test different normalization 
C:  I  eh 
C:  What kind of normalization ? 
C:  I  I  
C:  This is  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  But this is very short . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Is a problem to detect . 
C:  But  It 's a problem to  It 's a problem to identify and to detect , <laugh> too , with eh the Javier system , for example . 
C:  For example . 
C:  It 's a problem . 
C:  Uh 
C:  Eh , what  
C:  sorry . 
C:  What  what happened with the different contexts 
C:  because eh  eh  you are talking about eh the period or the  the duration of the  the window to eh the  the long of the window to  to consider normalization 
C:  no ? 
C:  But eh we have different contexts . 
C:  The  the  the  the period  the  the  the length of the window to  to normalize eh the energy is eh in the context of the overlapping zone ? 
C:  Is eh in the  in the  left context as in th in the right context , considering eh the  these frames ? 
C:  You mean ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Because  because the  the  the problem is that we have different contexts . 
C:  Different situation , and  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  What the bu 
C:  Ah , the bug . 
C:  The bug of  was the  the F - seek function in C . 
C:  because doesn't work uh when you eh  you try to  to  to ass n n to do an  a dated access to  to a file , a big file , eh eh moving the  the head of the  in the hard disk , eh e forward and backward a lot of time 
C:  eh in a moment <laugh> F - seek function doesn't work . 
C:  and I had an problem . 
C:  Yes , this is  this is  it 's incredible . 
C:  I  I  I do the same in  in another  in another way 
C:  and I haven't problem . 
C:  I  I  I don't know , 
C:  but uh I  I think the  the position in the file eh doesn't work eh eh in long file , 
C:  a very long file . 
C:  The typecast . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  eh it 's ehm  No , no , it 's unsigned . 
C:  Signed . 
C:  I  I  I don't know 
C:  I don't know 
C:  but eh I  I solved the problem with eh a similar way and <laugh> I haven't problem 
C:  but eh I  I  I don't know because eh eh it doesn't eh happen to me before . 
C:  but eh  I  I  I have the same codes in different parts , 
C:  and uh I  I had to  to  to change all  all the points in the  in the code , eh to substitute eh for another way , 
C:  but eh  is 
C:  Oh , OK . 
C:  Sorry . 
C:  OK .
