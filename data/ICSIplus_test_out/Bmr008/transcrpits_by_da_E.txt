E:  So it was positioning randomly ? 
E:  Yeah I  I just tried it . 
E:  I think my  head is too big . 
E:  Oh yeah . 
E:  The distance isn't  
E:  Status ? 
E:  Oh  oh , stats kind of status , OK . 
E:  Student , Non - student . 
E:  Sitting . 
E:  How about  You could say , if you 're giving a talk , how likely are you to be challenged ? 
E:  Well , sounds like you really need to know something kind of like that . 
E:  You need to know sort of <2 uncodeable fragments> Bas - in in this meeting , sort of what is your social status ? 
E:  But  but  but it 's gonna depend on who 's  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  I g 
E:  I guess  I guess it seems to me like you know I  trying to deduce information about the person 's status from the meeting independent form  will be useless because  
E:  But , that will depend on what the meeting 's about , 
E:  right ? 
E:  Let 's say the undergrad was an expert in physics , and  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  I guess I 'm wondering how can you make a conclusion based on that , if you don't know about the meeting ? 
E:  I don't know . 
E:  I 'm just  That 's why I was  wondering about if you can put something about the d 
E:  For the European  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  No , I like the idea of putting down the  the status information 
E:  because I think you probably can get a lot of interest there can be a lot of interesting research on that . 
E:  I 'm wondering could we add something to the form that gets filled out at each meeting that would somehow  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Well  I guess I was thinking maybe , you know how you were taking information off of the digits and putting it onto that ? 
E:  Could we put one more thing on here maybe ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  Cuz you said separate forms so I thought maybe  
E:  OK . 
E:  Oh , right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  How about  
E:  How about " optional but highly desirable " ? 
E:  Yeah , <laugh> If not given we will estimate . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  They 're very strong - willed . 
E:  You know ? 
E:  People  <inbreath> <laugh> He 
E:  I think  I think  you can put " optional " 
E:  it 's not gonna  
E:  You know people who lie about it ? 
E:  Yeah , I think it 's OK . 
E:  People will put it , I  I  
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Where you lived between the ages of  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Which is more objective . than somebody evalu saying , I think I speak this or that . 
E:  Yeah , I was just gonna ask the same thing . 
E:  Region  
E:  Does that mean region of  
E:  Region of the US , or region of the world  
E:  OK . 
E:  Do you mean state , <static or something> or do you mean more broad than the state level ? 
E:  You mean like you know southern US , or northeastern or 
E:  If you wanted to get regions for American English you could copy what they did in TIMIT . 
E:  They had divided things up into regions . 
E:  No , no . 
E:  It would only be f if you said American English 
E:  then you 'd put the regions . 
E:  For the others , you would just leave it . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  We wouldn't have enough to really make them  difference on those . 
E:  Oh , it 's like six regions of the country or something . 
E:  Very  just a limited number 
E:  and then if you 're American you would just circle the region where  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  You 'd just leave them . 
E:  You don't even ask . 
E:  One  one good reason to use the TIMIT ones is if anybody asks you you know , about the data later on you can say " well I chose these based on TIMIT " , And  
E:  And that would apply to everybody then ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  And then you could map those to the TIMIT regions later , if people wanted to . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's more general . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's true . 
E:  A lot of post - processing . 
E:  Yeah , y there is actu  you made me think about another wrinkle in this whole thing , which is that  just asking them where they grew up between certain ages isn't enough , 
E:  because somebody could grow up in Germany but live on an army base speaking English . 
E:  Yeah , so you sort of have to say what languages were spoken in the home between the ages of  
E:  Oh that 's nice , OK . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Sort of like as soon as you get to the  cases on the edge , the complexity just shoots up . 
E:  Well , you know the other thing , too , is that it seems like th one of the reasons you would gather real detailed information about their native language is if you were gonna do fine - grained phonetic analysis or something . 
E:  and  I don't  
E:  Well that 's what I was gonna ask , 
E:  is that  
E:  Were they putting down where they lived  at the moment they m recordings were made ? 
E:  Is that why ? 
E:  Rather than where they grew up ? 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So , then we probably don't need the fine - grained information . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  It can't be relied on only . 
E:  Yeah , I think those are good . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I don't think you really have to do all that much . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  N Right . Yeah . 
E:  N detec 
E:  And then there will be people who  live in an English speaking country , but all their meetings are held in another language . 
E:  So , 
E:  Yochai 's company is like that . 
E:  Everybody speaks Hebrew . 
E:  PIN . 
E:  what about all of the meetings that have been recorded so far that  without this ? 
E:  Will  Will somebody go back and fill that in , or we just won't have it , or  
E:  Mmm . 
E:  So it wouldn't be that hard to go back and  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  What about that error that  that uh  the  the supposed lub 
E:  no , the supposed bug  that was  that we were  
E:  We were guessing you had a bug before 
E:  because  you went through and you concatenated all of these things together  
E:  Ah . 
E:  Are  Are the things in the  
E:  So , uh , from  from these charts , are  
E:  hmm , I 'm just trying to remember where we were , 
E:  but uh , were  you were interested in finding out if you can tell the difference between  overlap and single speakers by looking at the e energy , 
E:  like say , for example , the mean of the energy . 
E:  Was that the idea ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  So , if you look at  on this page that has uh frame energy , 
E:  you look at the mean for the overlap , that 's forty - four point sixty - two versus the mean for the speakers , thirty - nine point sixty - two , 
E:  so there seems to be more energy when there 's overlapping which makes sense , 
E:  but  
E:  Yeah , 
E:  different than standard deviation . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  so the um  just one more clarifying question  
E:  On the overlap category ,  is that overlapping of speakers only ? 
E:  It doesn't include some of the other sounds ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Just out of curiosity , what was the bug ? 
E:  What was the bug that you found ? 
E:  The bug from last uh meeting ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Hmm ! 
E:  So it was positioning randomly ?
