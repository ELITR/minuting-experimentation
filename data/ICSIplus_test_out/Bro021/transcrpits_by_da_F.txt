F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Should we take turns ? 
F:  You want me to run it today ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Um . 
F:  Let 's see , maybe we should just get a list of items  
F:  things that we should talk about . 
F:  Um , 
F:  I guess there 's the usual  updates , 
F:  everybody going around and saying , uh , you know , what they 're working on , 
F:  the things that happened the last week . 
F:  But aside from that is there anything in particular that anybody wants to bring up 
F:  for today ? 
F:  No ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  So why don't we just around and people can give updates . 
F:  Uh , do you want to start , Stephane ? 
F:  This is  what  what do you , uh  what 's in the paper there ? 
F:  The one that we s we submitted the last round ? 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Where  where 's it gonna be this year ? 
F:  Oh , OK . 
F:  Mmm . 
F:  Are the means pretty different  for the two ? 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  Wasn't there some experiment you were gonna try 
F:  where you did something differently for each , um , <mouth> uh  I don't know whether it was each mel band or each , uh , um , FFT bin or someth 
F:  There was something you were gonna  uh ,  some parameter you were gonna vary depending on the frequency . 
F:  I don't know if that was  
F:  For each , uh  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I  I thought , Morgan , you brought it up a couple meetings ago . 
F:  And then it was something about , uh , some 
F:  and then somebody said " yeah , it does seem like , you know , C - zero is the one that 's , you know , the major one " or , uh , s 
F:  I can't remember exactly what it was now . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  So why does that m  smooth things out ? 
F:  I don't  I don't understand that . 
F:  Huh . Oh , OK . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  So would that  be similar to , like , doing the smoothing , then , over time 
F:  or  ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So performance went down ? 
F:  Oh . 
F:  So what was the  what was the threshold part of it ? 
F:  Was the threshold , uh , how far down  ? 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  And  and so what 's  
F:  ho I don't understand . 
F:  How does it go ? 
F:  If it  if  if the peak value 's above some threshold , then you add the noise ? 
F:  Or if it 's below s 
F:  Oh , oh . I see . 
F:  I see . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I see . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So do you have  more , Stephane , 
F:  or  ? 
F:  Do you have anything , Morgan , 
F:  or  ? 
F:  How about you , Barry ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So do you just take the probabilities of the other ones and spread them out evenly among the  the remaining ones ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mmm . 
F:  Cool . 
F:  That will be really interesting to see , 
F:  you know . 
F:  So then you 're gonna feed the  those into  some standard recognizer . 
F:  Uh , wh are you gonna do digits 
F:  or  ? 
F:  With TIMIT . OK . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Oh , so then you 'll feed those  
F:  Sorry . 
F:  So where do the outputs of the net go into if you 're doing phone recognition ? 
F:  An - and you 're gonna  the  you 're gonna do phone recognition with that ? 
F:  OK , OK . 
F:  I see . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Cool . 
F:  Great . 
F:  Uh  
F:  OK . 
F:  Um  
F:  Let 's see , I haven't done a whole lot on anything related to this this week . 
F:  I 've been focusing mainly on Meeting Recorder stuff . 
F:  So , um , <mouth> I guess I 'll just pass it on to Dave . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  OK . 
F:  How about you , Sunil ? 
F:  Oh . How about you , Carmen ? 
F:  What  what is VTS again ? 
F:  Oh , yes . 
F:  Right , right . 
F:  I think I ask you that every single meeting , 
F:  don't I ? 
F:  I ask you that question every meeting . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  " What is VTS ? " 
F:  Great . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Well , I guess we 're about done . 
F:  Um , 
F:  so some of the digit forms don't have digits . 
F:  Uh , <laugh> we ran out 
F:  there were some blanks in there , 
F:  so not everybody will be reading digits . 
F:  But , um , 
F:  I guess you 've got some . Right , Morgan ? 
F:  So , 
F:  why don't you go ahead and start . 
F:  And I think it 's  just us down here at this end that have them . 
F:  So . 
F:  Whenever you 're ready . 
F:  Uh , leave it on , 
F:  uh , 
F:  and the  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  OK .
