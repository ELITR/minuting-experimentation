topic_description:	opening


G:  Does anybody have an agenda ? 
A:  No . <laugh> 
F:  Well , I 'm  I sent a couple of items . They 're  they 're sort of practical . I don't know if you 're  
G:  I thought  somebody had . Yeah , that 's right . <mike noise> 
F:  if  if that 's too practical for what we 're  focused on . <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  Yeah , we only want th useless things . Yeah . <mouth> No , why don't we talk about practical things ? Sure . 
A:  I mean , we don't want anything too practical . Yeah , that would be  
F:  OK . 
B:  <breath> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  Well , um , I can  give you an update on the  transcription effort . 
E:  <breath> 
G:  Great . 
F:  Uh , maybe <mike spike> raise the issue of microphone , uh , um procedures 
E:  <mike noise> 
G:  <mouth> b 
F:  with reference to the  cleanliness of the recordings . 
D:  <mike noise> 
G:  OK , transcription , uh , microphone issues  <inbreath> 
F:  <inbreath> And then maybe <mike spike during "be"> ask , th uh , these guys . The  we have great  great , uh , p steps forward in terms of the nonspeech - speech pre - segmenting of the signal . 
G:  OK . 
A:  Well , we have steps forward . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> Well , it 's a  it 's a big improvement . 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
G:  Yes . 
C:  I would prefer this . <laugh> 
G:  Yeah , well . OK . 
G:  Uh  
D:  We talk about the  <laugh> the results of 
G:  You have some  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  OK . 
D:  <mouth> 
A:  I have a little bit of IRAM stuff but  I 'm not sure if that 's of general interest or not . 
D:  use  
E:  <breath> 
G:  Uh , bigram ? 
A:  IRAM . 
G:  IRAM . 
D:  IRAM . 
G:  Well , m maybe . 
A:  IRAM , bigram , you know . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Bi - Bigram . 
G:  <inbreath> 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  Yeah , let 's  let 's see where we are at three - thirty . Um  
B:  Hmm . 
B:  <mouth> 
B:  Since , uh  since I have to leave as usual at three - thirty , can we do the interesting stuff first ? 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  I beg your pardon ? <spikes on /g/ of "beg" and /p/ of "pardon"> <laugh> 
G:  Well  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> What 's the interesting stuff ? 
C:  <laugh> Which is  ? 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  I beg your pardon ? 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  Yeah . Th - now you get to tell us what 's the interesting part . But  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Please specify . 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Well , uh , I guess the 
G:  OK . 
B:  work that 's been  done on segmentation would be most  Yeah . 
G:  <laugh> 
F:  I think that would be a good thing to start with . 
topic_description:	summary of meeting agenda items


G:  Um , and , um , <mouth> the other thing , uh , which I 'll just say very briefly that maybe relates to that a little bit , which is that , um , 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  uh , one of the suggestions that came up in a brief meeting I had the other day when I was in Spain 
G:  with , uh , Manolo Pardo and 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  Javier , uh , Ferreiros , who was  here before , 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  was , um , 
G:  why not start with 
G:  what they had before but add in 
G:  the non - silence boundaries . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  So , in what Javier did before when they were doing , um  
G:  <mouth> h he was looking for , uh , speaker change  points . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  Um . 
G:  <mouth> As a simplification , he originally did this only using  silence 
G:  as , uh , a  putative , uh , speaker change point . 
G:  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  And , uh , he did not , say , look at points where you were changing broad sp uh , phonetic class , for instance . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  And for Broadcast News , that was fine . 
G:  <inbreath> Here obviously it 's not . 
G:  <breath> 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  And , um , so one of the things that they were pushing in d in discussing with me is , um , 
B:  <breath> 
G:  w why are you spending so much time , 
G:  uh , on the , uh , feature issue , 
G:  uh , when perhaps if you sort of deal with what you were using before 
G:  <inbreath> 
D:  Uh - huh . 
G:  and then just broadened it a bit , instead of just ta using silence as putative change point also  ? 
G:  <inbreath> So then you 've got  you already have the super - structure with Gaussians and H - you know , simple H M Ms and so forth . 
D:  Nnn , yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  And you  you might  
G:  So there was a  there was a little bit of a  a  
G:  a  a difference of opinion because I  I thought that it was  it 's interesting to look at what features are useful . 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  <breath> 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  But , uh , on the other hand I saw that the  they had a good point that , uh , 
G:  if we had something that worked for many cases before , maybe starting from there a little bit  Because ultimately we 're gonna end up 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  with some s su kind of structure like that , where you have some kind of simple HMM and you 're testing the hypothesis that , 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  uh , there is a change . So  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  so anyway , I just  reporting that . But , uh , uh  
D:  <mouth> OK . 
G:  <inbreath> 
topic_description:	using non-silence boundaries in alignments


topic_description:	speech, non-speech segmentation


G:  So . Yeah , why don't we do the speech - nonspeech discussion ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Do  I  I hear  you  you didn't  
C:  Speech - nonspeech ? OK . 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  Uh - huh . Yeah . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Um , so , uh , what we basically did so far was using the mixed file to  to detect s speech or nonspeech  portions in that . 
G:  <mike noise> 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <yawn> 
G:  <mike noise> 
C:  <inbreath> And 
C:  what I did so far is I just used our old Munich system , which is an HMM - ba based system with Gaussian mixtures for s speech and nonspeech . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  And it was a system which used only one Gaussian for silence and one Gaussian for speech . And now I added , uh , multi - mixture possibility for  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  for speech and nonspeech . And I did some 
C:  training on  on one dialogue , which was transcribed 
C:  by  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah . We  we did a nons s speech - nonspeech transcription . Adam , Dave , and I , we did , 
D:  Jose . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  for that dialogue and I trained it on that . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  And I did some pre - segmentations for  for Jane . And I 'm not sure how good they are or what  what the transcribers say . They  
C:  they can use it or  ? 
F:  Uh , they  they think it 's a terrific improvement . And , um , it real it just makes a  a world of difference . 
G:  Hmm . 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And , um , y you also did some something in addition which was , um , for those in which there <spike during "there"> was , uh , quiet speakers in the mix . 
D:  <mike noise> 
C:  Yeah . Uh , yeah . That  that was one  one  one thing , 
D:  <mike noise> 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  uh , 
C:  why I added more mixtures for  for the speech . So I saw that there were 
B:  <breath> 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <breath> 
C:  loud  loudly speaking speakers and quietly speaking speakers . And so I did two mixtures , one for the loud speakers and one for the quiet speakers . 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  And did you hand - label who was loud and who was quiet , or did you just  ? 
C:  I did that for  for five minutes of one dialogue and that was enough to  to train the system . And so it  it adapts , uh , on  
A:  Right . 
B:  <inbreath> W 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  What  ? 
C:  while running . So . 
B:  What kind of , uh , front - end processing did you do ? 
C:  Hopefully . 
D:  OK . 
C:  It 's just our  
C:  our old Munich , uh , loudness - based spectrum 
C:  on mel scale twenty  twenty critical bands and then loudness . 
C:  <inbreath> 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  And four additional features , which is energy , loudness , modified loudness , and zero crossing rate . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  So it 's twenty - four  twenty - four features . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
F:  And you also provided me with several different versions , which I compared . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And so you change <spike in "change"> parameters . What  do you wanna say something about the parameters <spike on /p/> that you change ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  You can specify 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  the minimum length of speech or  and silence portions which you want . And so I did some  some modifications in those parameters , basically changing the minimum  
G:  <breath> 
C:  minimum  length for s for silence 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  to have , er to have , um  yeah  <inbreath> 
C:  to have more or less , uh , silence portions in inserted . So . 
A:  Right . So this would work well for , 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
A:  uh , pauses and utterance boundaries and things like that . But for overlap I imagine that doesn't work at all , that you 'll have plenty of s sections that are  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  That 's it . Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . <mouth> That 's true . But <spike on "but"> it  it saves so much time  the  the <spike> transcribers just enormous , enormous savings . Fantastic . 
G:  <mouth> Um  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  But  
A:  Yep . 
G:  That 's great . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  Um , just qu one quickly , uh , still on the features . So 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  you have these twenty - four features . Uh , a lot of them are spectral features . Is there a  a transformation , uh , like principal components transformation or something ? Just  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  No . 
A:  Yeah . It was IS two . <laugh> 
C:  No . W w we  originally we did that 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  but we saw , uh , when we used it , uh , f for our close - talking microphone , which  
C:  yeah , for our  for our recognizer in Munich  <inbreath> 
C:  we saw that w it 's  it 's not  it 's not so necessary . It  it works as well f 
B:  <mike noise> 
G:  OK . 
C:  with  with  without , uh , a LDA or something . 
G:  OK . No , I was j  curious . Yeah , I don't think it 's a big deal for this application , but  but  Yeah , it 's a  
C:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <cough> 
topic_description:	Thilo's results


F:  <inbreath> OK . But then there 's another thing that also Thilo 's involved with , which is , um  
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  OK , and  and also Da - Dave Gelbart . So there 's this  this problem 
F:  of  and w and  so we had this meeting . Th - the <spike>  also Adam , before the  the  before you went away . <inbreath> 
F:  Uh we , um  regarding the representation <spike on /p/ of "representation"> of overlaps , because at present , <spike on /p/> 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  um , because <spike on /b/> of the limitations of <inbreath> 
F:  th the interface we 're using , overlaps are , uh , not being <spike on /b/> encoded by <spike on /b/> the transcribers in as complete <spike on /p/> and , uh , 
F:  detailed a way as it might be , <spike on /b/> and as might be desired  I think would be desired in the corpus ultimately . <inbreath> 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
F:  So we don't have start and end points <spike on /p/> at each point where there 's an overlap . We just have the  the <spike on "the"> overlaps <spike on /p/> encoded in a simple bin . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  Well , OK . So <spike> @ @ the limits of the <spike on "the"> over of  of the interface are 
B:  <breath> 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  such that we were  at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand <spike on /p/> the  the 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  interface or find other tools which already  do what would be useful . Because what would ultimately be , 
F:  um , ideal in my  my view and I think  I mean , I had the sense that it was consensus , is that , um , 
F:  a thorough - going musical score notation would be <spike on /b/> the best way to go . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  Because <spike on /b/> you can have multiple channels , there 's a single time - line , it 's very clear , flexible , and all those nice things . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  OK . So , um , 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  um , I spoke  I had a meeting with Dave Gelbart on  on  and he had , 
F:  uh , excellent ideas on how  the interface could be  modified to  to do this kind of representation . <inbreath> 
F:  But , um , he  in the meantime you were checking into the existence of already , 
F:  um , existing interfaces which might already have these properties . <spike on /p/> So , do you wanna say something about that ? 
C:  Yes . Um , I 
C:  <mouth> talked with , uh , 
C:  Munich guys from  from Ludwi - Ludwig Maximilians University , who do a lot of transcribing and transliterations . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  And they basically said they have  
C:  they have , uh , a tool they developed  themselves <inbreath> 
C:  and they can't give away , uh , f it 's too error - prone , and had  it 's not supported , a a a and  
G:  <laugh> 
G:  Yeah . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  But , um , 
C:  <mouth> Susanne Bur - Burger , who is at se CMU , he wa who was formally at  in Munich and w and is now at  with CMU , 
B:  <breath> 
C:  <inbreath> she said she has something <inbreath> 
C:  which she uses to do eight channels , uh , trans transliterations , eight channels simultaneously , <inbreath> 
G:  <noise> Excuse me . 
C:  but it 's running under Windows . 
F:  Under Windows . Mm - hmm . 
C:  So I 'm not sure if  if  if we can use it . She said she would give it to us . It wouldn't be a problem . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <inbreath> 
F:  <mouth> 
C:  And I 've got some  some kind of manual  down in my office . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  Well , maybe we should get it and if it 's good enough 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  we 'll arrange Windows machines to be available . 
F:  Mm - hmm . We could  uh , potentially <spikes on /p/ and /t/> so . I also wanted to be sure  
A:  So . 
F:  I mean , I 've  I 've seen the  this  this is called Praat , PRAAT , <spike on /p/> which I guess means spee speech in Dutch or something . 
A:  Yep . 
C:  Yeah , but then I 'm not sure  that 's the right thing for us . 
F:  <inbreath> But  
F:  <inbreath> In terms <spike on /t/> of it being <spike on /b/> Windows <spike on /d/> versus  But I 'm just wondering , is  ? 
G:  Yeah . 
A:  No , no . Praat isn't  Praat 's multi - platform . 
C:  No . No , Praat  
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
F:  Oh ! I see . Oh , I see . So Praat may not be  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  That 's not Praat . It 's called " trans transedit "  I think . The  the , uh  the tool from  from Susanne . 
F:  It 's a different one . 
F:  I see . Oh , I see . 
F:  OK . OK . Alright . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  The other thing , uh , to keep in mind , uh  I mean , 
B:  <breath> 
G:  we 've been very concerned to get all this rolling so that we would actually have data , 
F:  Mmm , yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  but , um , I think our outside sponsor is actually gonna kick in and ultimately that path will be smoothed out . So I don't know 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  if we have a long - term need to do lots and lots of transcribing . I think we had a very quick need to get something out 
G:  and we 'd like to be able to do some later because just it 's inter it 's interesting . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  But as far a you know , uh , with  with any luck we 'll be able to wind down the larger project . 
A:  Oh . 
B:  <breath> But you s <breath> 
A:  What our decision was is that  we 'll go ahead with what we have with a not very fine time scale on the overlaps . 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Yeah . 
A:  And  and do what we can later  to clean that up if we need to . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <breath> 
G:  Right . 
F:  <mouth> And  and I was just thinking that , um , 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  if it were possible to bring that in , like , 
F:  <breath> 
F:  you know , this week , <laugh> then <spike on /th/> when they 're encoding the overlaps <spike on /p/> 
G:  Uh - huh . 
F:  it would be nice for them to be able to specify 
F:  when  you know , the start points and end points of overlaps . 
G:  Yeah . 
F:  uh Th - they 're <spike> making really quick progress . 
G:  That 's great . 
F:  And , um , so my  my goal was  w m my charge was to get eleven hours by the end of the month . And it 'll be  I 'm  I 'm  I 'm clear that we 'll be able to do that . 
G:  That 's great . Yeah . 
A:  <inbreath> And did you , uh , 
A:  forward Morgan Brian 's  thing ? 
F:  <inbreath> I sent <spike on /t/> it to , <spike on /t/> um  who did I send that to ? I sent it to a list and I thought <spike on /t/> I sent it to <spike on /t/> the <spike on "the">  
E:  <sniff> 
F:  e to the local list . You saw that ? 
E:  Meeting Recorder . 
A:  Oh , you did ? OK . So you probably did get that . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  So Brian did tell <spike on /t/> me that <spike on /th/> in fact what you said , that , <spike> uh  that <spike on /th/> our  
F:  that they are  making progress and that he 's going  that <spike on /th/> they 're <spike on /th/> going  he 's gonna check the f the output of the first transcription and  <inbreath> 
B:  <yawn> 
G:  <inbreath> 
F:  and  
G:  I mean , basically it 's  it 's all the difference in the world . I mean , basically he 's  he 's on it now . 
B:  <breath> 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh , that 's  this is a new development . <spike on /d/> OK . 
G:  So  so  so this is  so i it 'll happen . 
D:  <noise> 
F:  Super . Super . OK . Great . 
G:  Yeah . I mean , basically it 's just saying that one of our  one of our best people is on it , 
G:  you know , who just doesn't happen to be here anymore . Someone else pays him . So  <laugh> So . <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> Isn't that great ? 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <mouth> 
B:  But about the need for transcription , I mean , don't we  didn't we previously 
G:  Yeah . 
B:  <breath> 
B:  decide that the  IBM  transcripts would have to be  checked anyway and possibly augmented ? 
F:  Yes . That 's true . 
C:  <mike noise> 
B:  So , I think having a good tool is worth something no matter what . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Yeah . S OK . That 's  that 's a good point . 
A:  Yeah , and Dave Gelbart did volunteer , and since he 's not here , I 'll repeat it  
F:  Good . 
A:  <inbreath> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  to at least modify Transcriber , which , if we don't have something else that works , I think that 's a pretty good way of going . 
C:  Mmm . 
B:  <breath> 
F:  Mm - hmm . <inbreath> 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  And we discussed on some methods to do it . My approach originally , and I 've already hacked on it a little bit  
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  it was too slow because I was trying to display all the waveforms . But he pointed out that you don't really have to . I think that 's a good point . 
C:  <mike noise> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Hmm . 
A:  That if you just display the mix waveform 
B:  <breath> 
A:  and then have a user interface for editing the different channels , that 's perfectly sufficient . 
F:  Yeah , exactly . And just keep those <spike on /th/> things separate . And  and , um , Dan Ellis 's hack already allows them to be <spike on /b/> able to display 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  different <spikes on /d/ and /t/> waveforms to clarify overlaps and things , so that 's already  
A:  No . They can only display one , but they can listen to different ones . 
F:  Oh , yes , but  
F:  Well , <breath-laugh> uh , yes , but <spike on /b/> what I mean is  that , uh , from the transcriber 's <spike on /t/> perspective , uh , 
F:  those <spike on /th/> two functions are separate . And Dan Ellis 's hack handles the , 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  um , choice <spike on /ch/>  the ability to choose different waveforms <inbreath> 
F:  from moment to moment . 
D:  <cough> 
A:  But only to listen to , not to look at . 
F:  <inbreath> Um  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  The waveform you 're looking at doesn't change . 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  That 's true . Yeah , but <spike on /b/> that 's  that 's OK , cuz they 're  they 're , <spike on /th/> 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  you know , they 're focused on the ear anyway . And then  and then 
A:  Right . 
G:  Hmm . 
F:  <blowing> the hack to 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  preserve the overlaps <spikes> better would be one which creates different output files for each channel , 
F:  <inbreath> which then <spike on /th/> would also serve Liz 's request  of having , 
A:  Right . 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  you know , a single channel , separable , uh , cleanly , 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  easily separable , uh , transcript tied to a single channel , uh , audio . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
topic_description:	developing a tool for coding speaker overlap


G:  <inbreath> Have , uh , folks from NIST been in contact with you ? 
F:  <mouth> Not directly . I 'm trying to think if  if I could have gotten it over a list . <spike on /t/> I don't  I don't think so . 
G:  OK . 
G:  OK . Well , holidays may have interrupted things , cuz in  in  in  They 
E:  <sniff> 
G:  <breath> 
G:  seem to want to  get absolutely clear on standards for  transcription standards and so forth with  with us . 
F:  Oh ! This was from before December . Yeah . 
G:  Right . Because they 're  they 're presumably going to start recording next month . 
F:  OK . OK . 
G:  So . 
A:  Oh , we should definitely get with them then , and 
A:  agree upon a format . 
A:  Though I don't remember email on that . So was I not in the loop on that ? 
G:  Um . Yeah , I don't think I mailed anybody . I just think I told them to contact Jane  that , uh , if they had a  
A:  Oh , OK . 
F:  That 's right . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  if , uh  that  that , uh , as the point person on it . But  
A:  Yeah , I think that 's right . Just , uh  
G:  So , yeah . Maybe I 'll , uh , 
B:  <breath> 
G:  ping them a little bit about it to 
G:  <inbreath> 
F:  OK . 
F:  I 'm keeping the conventions  absolutely  as simple <spike on /p/> as possible . <spike on /p/> 
G:  get that straight . <long outbreath> 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  Yeah . So is it  cuz with any luck there 'll actually be a  a  there 'll be collections at Columbia , collections at  at UW  
B:  <mike noise> 
G:  I mean Dan  Dan is very interested in doing some other things , 
A:  Right . 
F:  Yeah . Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
A:  Well , I think it 's important both 
G:  and collections at NIST . So  
A:  for the notation and the machine representation to be the same . 
F:  <mouth> 
G:  Yeah . 
A:  So . 
topic_description:	NIST, transcription standards


F:  N there was also this , <spike on /th/> uh , email from Dan regarding the  speech - non nonspeech segmentation thing . 
A:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  I don't know if , uh , 
F:  uh , we wanna , uh  and Dan Gel - and Dave Gelbart is interested in pursuing the aspect <spike on /p/> of using amplitude <spike on /t/> as a  
B:  <breath> 
F:  a  a  as a basis for the separation . 
G:  <mouth> Oh , yeah . He was talking  he was talking  I mean , uh , we  he had  
A:  @ @ Cross - correlation . 
F:  Cross - 
G:  Yeah , cross - correlation . I had mentioned this a couple times before , the c the commercial devices that do , uh , 
C:  Cross -  
F:  Uh - huh . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  uh , voice , uh  you know , active miking , 
G:  basically look at the amp at the energy at each of the mikes . And  and you basically compare the energy here to <inbreath> 
B:  <breath> 
G:  some function of all of the mikes . So , 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  by doing that , you know , rather than setting any , uh , absolute threshold , you actually can do pretty good , uh , selection of who  who 's talking . 
B:  <breath> 
G:  <inbreath> Uh  
F:  OK . 
G:  And those  those systems work very well , by the way , I mean , so people use them in 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  panel discussions and so forth with sound reinforcement differing in  in sort of , uh  
D:  Uh - huh . 
G:  <inbreath> and , uh , those  if  
G:  Boy , the guy I knew who built them , built them like twenty  
G:  twenty years ago , so they 're  <laugh> it 's  the  the techniques work pretty well . 
A:  Hmm . 
F:  Fantastic . 
F:  <inbreath> 
G:  So . 
F:  Cuz there is one thing that we don't have right now and that is the automatic , um , 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  channel identifier . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  That  that , you know , that would g help in terms of encoding of overlaps . <spike on /p/> The  the transcribers would have less , 
F:  uh , disentangling to do  if that were available . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  Yeah . So I think , you know , basically you can 
D:  <inbreath> 
F:  But . 
G:  look at some  p you have to play around a little bit , uh , to figure out what the right statistic is , but you compare each microphone to some statistic based on the  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  on the overall  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  OK . 
G:  Uh , and we also have these  we have the advantage of having  distant mikes too . So that , you cou yo 
A:  Yeah , although the  the  
A:  using the close - talking I think would be much better . Wouldn't it ? 
F:  Yeah . 
G:  Um . 
G:  I  I don't know . I just  it 'd be  
A:  Yeah . 
G:  If I was actually working on it , I 'd sit there and  and play around with it , and  and get a feeling for it . I mean , the  the  the , uh  But , 
G:  uh , you certainly wanna use the close - talking , as a  at least . 
A:  Right . 
G:  I don't know if the other would  would add some other helpful dimension or not . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm .

D:  OK . What  what are the different , uh , classes to  to code , uh , the  the overlap , you will use ? 
F:  <inbreath> 
A:  <inbreath> 
F:  Um , to code d so types of overlap ? <multiple spikes during this> 
D:  What you  you  Yeah . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  Um , so <spikes during "so"> at a meeting that wasn't transcribed , we worked up a  a typology . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And , um  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Look like , uh , you t you explaining in the blackboard ? The  ? Yeah ? Yeah . 
F:  Yes , exactly . That hasn't changed . So it <spike on /t/> i the  it 's basically a two - tiered structure 
F:  where the first one is whether <spike on /th/> the person who 's interrupted continues or not . And then 
F:  below that there 're <spike on /th/> subcategories , uh , that have more to do with , <spike on /th/> you know , is it , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  uh , simply <spike on first syllable> backchannel  or is <spike> it , um , someone 
F:  completing someone else 's thought , <spike on /th/> or is it someone in introducing a new thought . <spike on /th/> 
A:  Right . 
D:  <mouth> Huh . 
A:  And I hope 
A:  that if we do a forced alignment with the close - talking mike , that will be enough to recover 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  at least some of the time 
A:  the time information of when the overlap occurred . 
F:  Mm - hmm . Well , <inbreath> one would  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  We hope . 
A:  Yeah . Who knows ? 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  That 'd be  that 'd be nice . I mean , 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  I  I  I  I 've  
B:  So who 's gonna do that ? Who 's gonna do forced alignment ? 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Well , u uh , IBM was going to . Um  
B:  Oh , OK . 
D:  Oh . 
A:  and I imagine they still plan to but  but , you know , I haven't spoken with them about that recently . 
B:  OK . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
G:  <inbreath> Well , uh , my suggestion now is  is on all of these things to , uh , contact Brian . 
B:  <breath> 
F:  <inbreath> This is wonderful <spike on /d/> to have a direct contact like that . 
A:  OK . I 'll do that . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
F:  <inbreath> uh Well , th lemme ask <spike on /k/> you this . It occurs to me  <inbreath> 
G:  Yeah . 
F:  one of my transcribers t <spike on /t/> told <spike on /t/> me today that she 'll <spike on "she'll"> be finished with one meeting , <inbreath> 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
F:  um , by  well , she said tomorrow <spike on /t/> but then she said <spike on "said">  you know , but <spike on "but">  the , you know  let 's  let 's just , uh , say 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  maybe the day after just to be s on the safe side . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  I could send Brian the , <spike on "the"> um  
F:  the <spike on "the"> transcript . I know these <spike on "these"> are  
F:  er , uh , I could send him that <spike on /th/> if <spike on /f/> it would be possible , <spike on /p/> or a good idea or not , to <spike on /t/> try <spike on /t/> to do a s forced alignment on what we 're  
A:  <mouth> 
F:  on the way we 're encoding overlaps now .  
G:  Well , just talk to him about it . 
A:  Yep . 
F:  Good . 
G:  I mean , you know , basically he 's  he just studies , he 's a colleague , a friend , and , 
B:  <breath> 
G:  <inbreath> 
F:  Yeah ! Super . Super . 
G:  uh , they  and  and , you know , the  the organization always did wanna help us . It was just a question of getting , you know , the right people connected in , who had the time . So , 
D:  <mike noise> 
F:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Right . 
G:  <inbreath> um , eh  
A:  Is he on the mailing list ? 
A:  The Meeting Recorder mailing li ? We should add him . 
F:  <inbreath> Oh ! 
F:  Yeah . I  I  I don't know for sure . 
G:  Yeah . 
E:  Did something happen , Morgan , that he got put on this , or was he already on it , or  ? 
A:  Add him . 
G:  <inbreath> No , I , eh , eh , p 
G:  It  it oc I  h it 's  
B:  <inbreath> 
G:  Yeah , something happened . I don't know what . But he 's on it now . 
B:  He asked for more work .

topic_description:	microphone issues


A:  Um , 
A:  so one thing is that I did look on Sony 's for a replacement for the mikes  
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  for the head m head - worn ones cuz they 're so uncomfortable . 
D:  @ @ 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  But I think I need someone who knows more about mikes than I do , because I couldn't find a single other model that 
A:  seemed like it would fit the connector , 
A:  which seems really unlikely to me . 
A:  Does anyone , like , 
A:  know stores or 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  know about mikes who  who would know the right questions to ask ? 
G:  Oh , I probably would . I mean , my knowledge is twenty years out of date but some of it 's still the same . So  <laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Uh , so maybe we c we can take a look at that . 
E:  You couldn't  you couldn't find the right connector to go into these things ? 
A:  Yep . 
E:  Huh ! 
A:  When I looked , i they listed one microphone and that 's it 
A:  as having that type of connector . But my guess 
A:  is that Sony maybe uses a different number for their connector than everyone else does . 
A:  And  and so  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Well , let 's look at it together and  
A:  it seems  it seems really unlikely to me that there 's only one . 
F:  And there 's no adaptor for it ? 
F:  Seems like there 'd be a  OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  As I said , who knows ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <inbreath> Who  who are we buying these from ? That 'd be a  
A:  Um , 
A:  I have it downstairs . I don't remember off the top of my head . 
B:  <breath> 
G:  Yeah . OK . 
G:  Yeah . We  we can try and look at that together .

topic_description:	replacing head-mounted microphones


A:  And then , uh  
D:  <cough> 
B:  <breath> 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  just in terms of how you wear them  
A:  I mean , I had thought about this before . I mean , when  when  when you use a product like DragonDictate , they have a very extensive description about how to wear the microphone and so on . 
F:  <mouth> Oh . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  But I felt that 
A:  in a real situation we were very seldom gonna get people to really do it and maybe it wasn't worth concentrating on . 
F:  <mouth> 
A:  But  
G:  <mouth> 
G:  Well , I think that that 's  that 's a good 
G:  back - off position . That 's what I was saying <laugh> earlier , th that , you know , we are gonna get some 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  recordings that are imperfect and , hey , that 's life . But I  I think that it  it doesn't hurt , 
G:  uh , the naturalness of the situation 
G:  to try to have people  wear the microphones properly , if possible , because , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  um , the natural situation is really what we have with the microphones on the table . I mean , I think , 
A:  Oh . That 's true . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  you know , in the target applications that we 're talking about , people aren't gonna be wearing head - mounted mikes anyway . So this is just for u these head - mounted mikes are just for use with research . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  And , uh , it 's gonna make  
D:  Yeah . @ @ 
G:  You know , if  if An - Andreas plays around with language modeling , he 's not gonna be m wanna be messed up by people breathing into the microphone . So it 's  it 's , uh , uh  <laugh> 
A:  Right . 
A:  <mouth> Well , I 'll dig through the documentation to DragonDictate and ste s see if they still have the little  form . 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <breath> 
G:  But it does happen . Right ? I mean , and any  <breath> 
B:  <breath> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  It 's interesting , uh , 
B:  I talked to some IBM guys , uh , last January , I think , I was there . And  <inbreath> 
B:  so people who were working on the  on their ViaVoice 
G:  Yeah . 
B:  dictation product . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  And they said , 
B:  uh , the breathing is really a  a terrible problem  for them , 
B:  to  to not recognize breathing as speech . 
F:  Wow . 
B:  So , anything to reduce breathing is  
G:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , that 's the  
B:  is  is a good thing . 
A:  <mouth> 
A:  It seemed to me when I was using Dragon 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  that it was really microphone placement helped an  in , uh  an enormous amount . So you want it 
B:  Right . 
A:  enough to the side so that when you exhale through your nose , it doesn't  the wind doesn't hit the mike . 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  And then , uh  
F:  <mike noise> 
A:  <laugh> Everyone 's adjusting their microphones , of course . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  And then just close enough so that you get good volume . So you know , wearing it right about here 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
A:  seems to be about the right way to do it . 
F:  <inbreath> Is   Uh - huh .  
G:  <inbreath> I remember when I was  when I  I  I  I used , uh , 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  um , 
G:  <mouth> 
G:  a prominent laboratory 's , uh , uh , speech recognizer about , <laugh> uh  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  This was , boy , this was a while ago , this was about twelve  
G:  twelve years ago or something .  
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  And , um , <mouth> 
G:  they were  they were perturbed with me because I was breathing in instead of breathing out . And they had models for  they  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  they had Markov models for br breathing out but they didn't have them for breathing in . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  Uh  <laugh> 
B:  <mouth> 
A:  <breath> <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  That 's interesting .  
F:  <inbreath> 
D:  <mike noise> 
F:  Well , what I wondered is whether it 's possible to have  <inbreath> 
F:  to maybe use the display at the beginning to be able to  to judge how  how correctly  I mean , have someone do some routine whatever , 
G:  <mike noise> 
A:  <mouth> Yeah . 
F:  and  and then see if when they 're breathing it 's showing . I don't know if the  if it 's  
G:  <inbreath> I  
A:  I mean , when  when it 's on , you can see it . You can definitely see it . Absolutely . Absolutely . 
F:  Can you see the breathing ? Cuz I  
F:  Oh . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> I 
A:  And so , you know , I 've  I 've sat here and watched 
A:  sometimes the breathing ,  and the bar going up and down , and I 'm thinking , 
E:  <breath> 
A:  I could say something , but 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  <inbreath> I mean , I think  
A:  <click> 
A:  I don't want to make people self - conscious . Stop breathing ! 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  It  it 's going to be imperfect . You 're not gonna get it perfect . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . Uh - huh . 
G:  And you can do some , uh , you know , first - order thing about it , which is to have people move it , 
G:  uh , uh , a away from being just directly in front of the middle 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Good . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  but not too far away . 
F:  <mouth> Yeah , i 
G:  And then , you know , I think there 's not much  Because you can't al you know , interfere w 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  you can't fine tune the meeting that much , I think . It 's sort of   
A:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  <inbreath> That 's true . It just seems like i if something l simple like that can be tweaked <inbreath> 
F:  and the quality goes , you know , uh , dramatically 
A:  Yep . 
F:  up , then it might be worth  doing . 
A:  And then also  the position of the mike also . If it 's more directly , you 'll get better volume . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  So  so , like , yours is pretty far down  below your mouth . Yeah . 
F:  <inbreath> But  Mm - hmm . <outbreath> 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  <mike noise> <laugh> <mike noise> 
F:  <inbreath> My  my feedback from the transcribers is he is always close to crystal clear and  and just fan fantastic to  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
D:  Mmm , yeah . 
A:  I don't know why that is . <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  Well , I mean , you  Yeah , of course . You 're  you 're also  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  uh , your volume is  is greater . But  but still , I mean , they  they say  
A:  I 've been eating a lot . 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> Uh . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <inbreath>

A:  <breath-laugh>

topic_description:	transcriptions


F:  <mouth> I could say something about  about the  Well , I don't know what you wanna do . Yeah . 
G:  About what ? 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  About the transcribers or anything or  ? I don't know . 
G:  <inbreath> Well , the other  why don't we do that ? 
B:  <mouth> 
B:  But , uh , just to  to , um  
B:  One more remark , uh , concerning the SRI recognizer . Um . <inbreath> 
B:  It is useful to transcribe and then ultimately train models for things like breath , and also laughter is very , very frequent and important to  
B:  <inbreath> 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  to model . 
B:  So , <inbreath> 
B:  if you can in your transcripts mark  <inbreath> 
A:  So , 
A:  mark them ? 
B:  mark very audible breaths and laughter especially , um  OK . 
C:  Mmm . 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  <breath> They are . They 're putting  Eh , so in curly brackets they put " inhale " or " breath " . 
G:  <mike noise> 
G:  <mike noise> 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  It  they  and then in curly brackets they say " laughter " . Now they 're  <inbreath> 
A:  Oh , great . 
F:  they 're not being  awfully precise , uh , m So they 're two types of laughter that are not being distinguished . One is 
B:  Mm - hmm .  
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  when sometimes s someone will start laughing when they 're in the middle of a sentence .  
B:  Mm - hmm .  
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And  and then the other one is when they finish the sentence and then they laugh . 
F:  So , um , I  I did s I did some double checking to look through  I mean , <laugh> you 'd need to have extra 
F:  hhh  
F:  e extra complications , like time tags indicating the beginning and ending of  
B:  <inbreath> 
F:  <inbreath> 
B:  It 's not so  I don't think it 's , um  
F:  of the laughing through the utterance . And that  and what they 're doing is in both cases just saying " curly brackets laughing " a after the unit . 
B:  <breath> 
D:  <clears throat> 
B:  As  as long as there is an indication that there was laughter somewhere between  two words <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  Good . 
F:  Oh ! 
F:  OK . 
B:  I think that 's sufficient , because <inbreath> 
A:  Against  they could do forced alignment . 
B:  actually the recognition of laughter once you kn um  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  you know , is pretty good . So as long as you can stick a  
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh , I didn't know that . 
B:  you know , a t a tag in there that  
B:  that indicates that there was laughter , <inbreath> 
F:  OK . 
B:  that would probably be , uh , sufficient to train models . 
F:  <inbreath> Then  
A:  That would be a really interesting  prosodic feature , when  
F:  And let me ask y and I gotta ask you one thing about that . So , um , 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
F:  if they laugh between two words , you  you 'd get it 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  in between the two words . But if they laugh across three or four words you  you get it after those four words . Does that matter ? 
B:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Well , the thing that you  is hard to deal with is whe <inbreath> 
B:  when they speak while laughing . 
B:  <inbreath> 
F:  <mouth> Yeah .  
B:  Um , and that 's , uh  I don't 
F:  OK . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  think that we can do very well with that . So  <inbreath> 
A:  Right . <outbreath> 
D:  <mouth> Yeah . 
B:  But , um , that 's not as frequent as just laughing between 
B:  speaking , so  
A:  <mouth> 
G:  <mouth> Uh is it ? 
A:  So are  do you treat breath and laughter as 
F:  <laugh> I think he 's right . Yeah . 
D:  Huh . 
D:  I  I think it 's frequent in  in the meeting . 
A:  phonetically , or as word models , or what ? 
B:  <mouth> 
B:  <mouth> We tried both . Uh , currently , 
B:  um , we use special words . 
B:  There was a  
B:  there 's actually a word for  
B:  uh , it 's not just breathing but all kinds of mouth  uh , mouth  mouth stuff . 
A:  Mm - hmm . Mouth stuff ? 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  And then laughter is a  is a special word . 
D:  @ @ 
A:  How would we do that with the hybrid system ? 
G:  Same thing . 
B:  Same thing ? 
A:  So train a phone  in the neural net ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . You ha Oh . And each of these words has a dedicated phone . 
G:  No  
B:  <inbreath> 
A:  Oh , it does ? 
B:  So the  so the  the mouth noise , uh , word has just a single phone , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  um , that is for that . 
A:  Right . So in the hybrid system we could train the net with 
G:  Yeah . 
A:  a laughter phone and a breath sound phone . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
G:  <mouth> 
G:  I mean , it 's  it 's  it 's always the same thing . Right ? I mean , you could  you could say well , let  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  @ @  
G:  we now think that laughter should have three sub sub 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  sub - units in the  the three states , uh  different states . And then you would have three   I mean , you know , eh , eh , it 's u <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  And the  the pronun the pronunciations  the pronunciations are l are somewhat non - standard . They actually are  
A:  Do whatever you want .  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
G:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  No . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  uh , it 's just a single , 
B:  s uh , you know , a single phone in the pronunciation , but it has a self - loop on it , so it can  
A:  To  go on forever ?  
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  r can go on forever . <inbreath> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  And how do you handle it in the language model ? 
B:  It 's just a  it 's just a word . We train it like any other word . Yeah . 
A:  It 's just a word in the language model . Cool . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  We also tried , <inbreath> 
B:  um , absorbing these  uh , both laughter and  
B:  and actually also noise , and , um  
H:  Sorry to interrupt . 
D:  Yeah . 
H:  Is  
G:  If you want , I got it .  
H:  Andreas .  
B:  Yes . 
H:  The copies are ready . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  OK . <inbreath> 
B:  Anyway . We also tried absorbing that into the pause model  I mean , the  the  the model that  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  that matches the stuff between words . <inbreath> 
B:  And , um , <inbreath> 
B:  it didn't work as well . So . 
A:  Huh . OK . 
F:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  <mike noise> 
F:  <mouth> 
A:  Can you hand me your digit form ? 
B:  Sorry . 
B:  <mike noise>  
A:  I just wanna mark that you did not read digits . 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  OK . 
G:  <inbreath> Say hi for me . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <mike turns off> 
A:  <noise> 
F:  Good . 
F:  <inbreath> You  you did get me to thinking about  I  I 'm not really sure which is more frequent , whether 
F:  f f laughing  I think it may be an individual thing . Some people are more prone to laughing when they 're speaking . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . I think  
A:  I was noticing that with Dan in the one that we , uh  
F:  But I can't  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  we hand tran hand - segmented , that  th he has these little chuckles as he talks . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  <inbreath> I 'm sure it 's very individual . And  and  
F:  Yeah . OK . 
G:  <inbreath> 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  one thing that c that we 're not doing , of course , is we 're not claiming to , uh , get  be getting a representation of mankind 
G:  in these recordings . We have <laugh> this very , very tiny sample of  of   
F:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <mouth> Speech researchers ?  <laugh> 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  Uh , yeah . And  <laugh> Yeah , r right .  So , uh , who knows . 
D:  <mouth> <laugh> Speech research . <laugh> 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  Uh  
topic_description:	transcribing audible breaths, laughter


G:  Yeah . Why don why don't we just  since we 're on this vein , why don't we just continue with , uh , what you were gonna say about the transcriptions and  ? 
F:  <inbreath> OK . 
F:  Um , um , the  I  I 'm really very for I 'm extremely fortunate with the people who , uh , applied and who are transcribing for us . They 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  are , um , um , uh really perceptive and very , um  and I 'm not just saying that cuz they might be hearing this .  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Cuz they 're gonna be transcribing it in a few days .  
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <mike noise> 
G:  <laugh> 
F:  No , they 're super . They 're  the they  very quick . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  OK . Turn the mikes off and let 's talk . 
F:  Yeah , I know . I am  I 'm serious .  They 're just super . 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  So I , um , 
F:  e you know , I  I brought them in and , um , trained them in pairs because I think people can 
F:  raise questions  you know , i i the they think about different things and they think of different   and um , 
A:  That 's a good idea . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  I trained them to , uh , 
F:  f on about a minute or two of the one that was already transcribed . This also gives me a sense of  
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  You know , I can  I can use that later , with reference to inter - coder reliability kind of issues . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  But the main thing was to get them used to the conventions and , 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  you know , the idea of the  th th the size of the unit versus how long it takes to play it back so these  th sort of calibration issues . 
F:  <mouth> And then , um , I just set them loose and they 're  
F:  <breath> they all have e a already background in using computers . They 're , um  they 're trained in linguistics . They got  
A:  Good .  
G:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Oh , no . Is that good or bad ? <laugh> 
F:  Well , they they 're very perce they 'll  So one of them said " well , you know , he really said " n " , not really " and " , 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  so what <laugh>  what should I do with that ? " And I said , " well for our purposes , 
A:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  I do have a convention . If it 's an  a noncanonical p " That one , I think we  you know , with Eric 's work , I sort of figure we  we can just treat that as a variant . 
F:  <inbreath> 
G:  OK . 
F:  But I told them if  if there 's an obvious speech error , 
G:  Yes . 
F:  uh , like I said in one thing , and I gave my  my example , like I said , " microfon "  in instead of " microphone " . 
F:  Didn't bother  I knew it when I said it . I remember s thinking " oh , that 's not 
F:  correctly pronounced " . <laugh> But it  but I thought <laugh> it 's not worth fixing cuz often when you 're speaking everybody knows what  what you mean . 
A:  You 'll self - repair .  Yeah . 
F:  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah .  
F:  But I have a convention that if it 's obviously a noncanonical pronunciation  a speech error with  you know , wi 
F:  within the realm of resolution that you can tell in this native English  
F:  American English speaker , you know that I didn't mean to say " microfon . " 
D:  <cough> 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  Then you 'd put a little tick at the beginning of the word , and that just signals that , um , this is not standard , and then in curly brackets " pron <spike on /p/> error " . 
G:  Yeah . 
F:  And , um , and other than that , it 's w word level . But , you know , the fact that they noticed , 
F:  you know , the " nnn " . " He said " nnn " , not " and " . What shall I do with that ? " I mean , they 're very perceptive . <spike on initial /p/> 
F:  And  and s several of them are trained in IPA . <spike on /p/> C they really could do phonetic transcription if  if we wanted them to . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <mouth> Right . Well  <inbreath> 
F:  <inbreath> But  <spike on "but"> <outbreath> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Hmm . Where were they when  we needed them ? 
G:  Well , you know , it might be something we 'd wanna do with some , uh , s small subset  of the whole thing . 
F:  <mouth> I think  
G:  We certainly wouldn't wanna do it with everything . 
F:  <outbreath> 
F:  And I 'm also thinking these people are a terrific pool . I mean , if , uh  so I  I told them that , um , we don't know if this will continue past the end of the month and I also  
G:  Uh - huh . 
F:  <inbreath> m I 
F:  think they know that the data p source is limited and I may not be able to keep them employed till the end of the month even , although I hope to . 
G:  <mouth> The other thing we could do , actually , uh , is , 
F:  And  
F:  <breath> 
G:  uh , use them for 
G:  a more detailed analysis of the overlaps . 
F:  <mouth> Oh , that 'd be so super . They would be so  s so terrific . 
G:  Right ? 
A:  <mouth> I mean , this was something 
A:  that we were talking about . We could get a very detailed overlap if they were willing to transcribe each meeting four or five times . 
A:  Right ? One for each participant . 
A:  So they could by hand  
F:  <breath> 
G:  Well , that 's one way to do it . But I 've been saying the other thing is just go through it for the overlaps . Right ? <inbreath> 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm , that 's right . And with the right in interface  <outbreath> 
G:  Given that y and  and do  so instead of doing phonetic , uh , uh , transcription for the whole thing , which 
D:  <breath-laugh> Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  we know from the  Steve 's experience with the Switchboard transcription is , you know , very , very time - consuming . And  
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  and you know , it took them I don't know how many months to do  to get four hours . And so 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  that hasn't been really our focus . 
G:  Uh , we can consider it . But , I mean , the other thing is since we 've been spending so much time thinking about overlaps is  is maybe get a much more detailed 
G:  analysis of the overlaps . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <breath> <mouth> 
G:  But anyway , I 'm  I 'm open to c our consideration . 
F:  <breath> That 'd be great . <breath> 
G:  I  I don't wanna say that by fiat . I 'm open to every consideration of 
D:  Hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  what are some other kinds of detailed analysis that would be most useful . And , uh , uh , 
F:  Mm - hmm .  
D:  Hmm . 
G:  I  I  I think 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  this year we  we actually , uh , can do it . 
D:  <clears throat> 
F:  Oh , wonderful . 
G:  It 's a  we have  we have  due to 
G:  @ @  
G:  variations in funding we have  we seem to be doing , uh , very well on m money for this  this year , and <inbreath> 
G:  next year we may have  have much less . So I don't wanna hire a  
A:  Is  you mean two thousand one ? 
G:  <mouth> 
A:  Calendar year or  ? 
G:  Uh , I mean , calendar year two thousand one . 
A:  OK . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  Yeah . So it 's  uh , it 's  we don't wanna hire a bunch of people , a long - term staff , because 
A:  Full - time . Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  the  the funding that we 've gotten is sort of a big chunk for this year . But 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  having  temporary people doing some specific thing that we need is actually a perfect match to that kind of , uh , funding . So . 
F:  Wonderful . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And then school will start in  in the sixt on the sixteenth . Some of them will have to cut back their hours at that point . <spike on /p/> But  <spike on /b/> 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
E:  Are they working full - time now , or  ? 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  Some of them are . Yeah . 
A:  Wow . 
F:  Well , why do I wouldn't say forty - hour weeks . No . But what I mean is  
F:  Oh , I shouldn't say it that way because <spike on /b/> that does sound like forty - hour weeks . No . 
F:  I th I  I would say they 're probably <spike on /p/>  they don't have o they don't have other things that are taking away their time . 
A:  <mouth> I don't see how someone could do forty hours a week on transcription . 
E:  Hmm .  
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  But <spike on /b/> it 's  you can't . 
G:  <inbreath> Yeah . Yeah . 
F:  No . You 're right . It 's  i it would be too taxing . But , um , they 're putting <spike on /p/> in a lot of  
G:  Yeah . 
F:  And  and I checked them over . I  I  I haven't checked them all , but  just spot - checking . They 're fantastic . 
G:  I  
A:  <inbreath> 
G:  I remember when we were transcribing BeRP , uh , uh , 
A:  I think it would be  
D:  <laugh> 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  uh , Ron Kay , uh , volunteered to  to do some of that . And , he was  the first  first stuff he did was transcribing Chuck . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  And he 's saying " You  you know , I always thought Chuck spoke really well . " 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . Yeah . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  <breath> Well , you know , and I also thought , y Liz has this , eh , you know , and I do also , this  this interest in the types of overlaps that are involved . These people would be <spike on /b/> 
F:  great choices for doing coding of that type if we wanted , or 
A:  We 'd have to mark them . 
G:  <clears throat> 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
F:  whatever . So , um .  
D:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  Yeah .  
A:  I think it would also be interesting to have , uh , 
A:  a couple of the meetings have more than one transcriber do , 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <mouth> 
A:  cuz I 'm curious about inter - annotator agreement . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Yeah . Th - that 'd be  
G:  Yeah . 
F:  I think that 's a  a good idea . You know , there 's also , the e In my mind , 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  I think A An - Andreas was  leading to this topic ,  the idea that , um , 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  we haven't yet seen the  the type of transcript that we get from IBM , and it may just be , 
F:  you know , pristine . But on the other hand , given the lesser interface  Cuz this is , you know  we 've got a good interface , we 've got 
F:  great headphones , m um  
topic_description:	transcriber pool


G:  <inbreath> It could be that they will uh  theirs will end up being a kind of fir first pass or something . 
F:  Something like that . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  Maybe an elaborate one , cuz again they probably are gonna do these alignments , which will also 
F:  <inbreath> That 's  that 's true . Al - although you have to s Don't you have to start with a close enough approximation <spike on /p/> of the  
G:  clear things up . 
F:  of the verbal part <spike on /p/> to be able to  ? 
G:  Well , tha that 's  that 's debatable . Right ? I mean , so the  so the argument is that if your statistical system is good 
F:  OK . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  it will in fact , uh , clean things up . Right ? So it it 's got its own objective criterion . 
F:  OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  And , uh , so in principle you could start up with something that was kind of rough  
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  I mean , to give an example of , um , something we used to do , uh , at one point , uh , back  back when Chuck was here in early times , is we would take , 
G:  <inbreath> um , <mouth> 
G:  da take a word and , uh , have a canonical pronunciation 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  and , uh , if there was five phones in a word , <clears throat> you 'd break up the word , 
D:  <breath> 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  uh , into five equal - length pieces  which is completely gross . 
A:  Wrong .  Yeah . <breath-laugh> 
G:  Right ? I mean , th the timing is off  all over the place in just about any word . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <inbreath> 
F:  OK . 
G:  But it 's O K . 
G:  You start off with that and the statistical system then aligns things , and eventually you get something that doesn't really look too bad . 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  <inbreath> 
F:  Oh , excellent . OK . 
G:  So  so I think using a  a good  aligner , um , actually can  can help a lot . Um . 
G:  <breath> 
G:  But , uh , you know , they both help each other . If you have a  if you have a better starting point , then it helps the aligner . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  If you have a good alignment , it helps the , uh , th the human in  in taking less time to correct things . So  so  
E:  <breath> 
D:  <mike noise> 
D:  <mike noise> <cough> 
F:  OK . 
F:  Excellent . 
topic_description:	alignment


F:  <inbreath> I guess there 's another aspect , too , and I don't know  uh , this  this is  
F:  very possibly a different , uh , topic . But , <spike on /b/> uh , just let me say  with reference to this idea of , um , 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  higher - order organization within meetings . So like in a  <inbreath> 
F:  you know , the topics that are covered during a meeting with reference to the other , uh , 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  uses of the data , so being able to  find where so - and - so talked about such - and - such , 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  then , um , 
F:  um  
F:  e I mean , I  I  I did sort of a  
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  a rough  pass <spike on /p/> on encoding , like , episode - like level 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  things on the , uh , transcribed meeting  
F:  already transcribed meeting . 
F:  <inbreath> 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And I don't know if , um  
F:  where <spike on /wh/> that  i if that 's something that we wanna do with each meeting , sort of like a , um  
F:  <laugh> it 's like a manifest , when you get a box full of stuff , <spike on /f/> <laugh> or  or if that 's , um  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I mean , i I  I don't know what 
F:  uh , 
F:  level of detail would be most useful . I don't know i if that 's something that  I should do when I look over it , or if we want someone else to do , or whatever . 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
F:  But this issue of the contents of the meeting 
F:  in an outline form . 
F:  OK . 
G:  Yeah . 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  <mouth> 
G:  Meaning really isn't my thing . 
G:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  Um  
G:  <laugh> 
A:  I think it just  
A:  whoever is interested can do that . 
A:  I mean , so if someone wants to use that data  
F:  OK . 
G:  <inbreath> 
F:  <inbreath> 
topic_description:	classifying meeting events


G:  We 're running a little short here . We , uh , uh , cou trying to  
F:  That 's fine . 
F:  I 'm finished . 
G:  eh , was  p Well , you know , the thing I 'm concerned about is we wanted to do these digits and  and I haven't heard , uh , from Jose yet . So  
F:  Oh , yeah . 
D:  <noise> 
F:  Oh , yes . Mm - hmm . 
D:  OK . What do you want ? 
G:  Uh  
A:  We could skip the digits . We don't have to read digits each time . 
G:  Uh  
G:  I  I  I think it  you know , another  another bunch of digits . More data is good . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  OK . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . Sure . 
G:  <laugh> So  so I 'd like to do that . But I think , do you , maybe , eh  ? 
G:  Did you prepare some whole thing you wanted us just to see ? Or what was that ? 
D:  Yeah . It 's  it 's prepared . 
G:  Yeah . Uh , how long a  ? 
F:  Oh , k Sorry . 
D:  I  I think it 's  it 's fast , because , uh , 
D:  I have the results , eh , of the study of different energy without the law length . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Eh , um , eh , @ @ in the  in the measurement , uh , the average , uh , dividing by the  by the , um , variance . 
D:  <inbreath> 
G:  Yeah . 
D:  Um , I  
D:  th i 
D:  the other , uh  the  the last w uh , meeting  
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  eh , I don't know if you remain   we have problem to  with the  
D:  <mouth> 
D:  with  with the parameter  with the representations of parameter , <inbreath> 
G:  Yes . 
D:  because the  the valleys and the peaks in the signal , eh , look like , eh , it doesn't follow to the  to the energy in the signal . 
G:  Right . 
D:  And it was a problem , uh , with the scale . 
E:  <mike noise> 
D:  <mouth> Eh , the scale . 
A:  With what ? 
F:  Scale . 
A:  Scale . 
D:  Eh , and I  I change the scale and we can see the  the variance . 
G:  <inbreath> OK . 
G:  But the bottom line is it 's still not , uh , separating out very well . Right ? OK . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . The distribution  the distribution is  is similar . 
G:  So that 's  
G:  that 's  that 's enough then . OK . 
G:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
G:  No , I mean , that there 's no point in going through all of that if that 's the bottom line , really . So , I  I think we have to start  
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Uh , I mean , there there 's two suggestions , really , which is , uh  what we said before is that , 
D:  Mmm , yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  um , it looks like , 
G:  @ @  
G:  at least that you haven't found an obvious way to normalize so that the energy is anything like a reliable , uh , indicator of the overlap . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  Um , I  I 'm  I 'm still  a little f think that 's a little funny . These things l @ @ seems like there should be , but  <inbreath> 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  but you don't want to keep , uh  keep knocking at it if it 's  if you 're not getting any  any result with that . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  But , I mean , the other things that we talked about is , uh , 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  pitch - related things and harmonicity - related things , so  which we thought also should be some kind of a reasonable indicator . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  Um  
G:  But , uh , 
E:  <breath> 
G:  a completely different tack on it wou is the one that was suggested , uh , by your colleagues in Spain , 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  which is to say , don't worry so much about the , uh , features . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  That is to say , use , you know , as  as you 're doing with the speech , uh , nonspeech , use some very general features . 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  And , uh , then , uh , look at it more from the aspect of modeling . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <mike noise> 
G:  You know , have a  have a couple Markov models and  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  and , uh , try to indi try to determine , you know , w when is th when are you in an overlap , when are you not in an overlap . 
D:  Hmm . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  And let the , uh , uh , statistical system  determine what 's the right way to look at the data . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  I  I , um , 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <mouth> 
G:  I think it would be interesting to find individual features and put them together . I think that you 'd end up with a better system overall . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  But given the limitation in time 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  and given the fact that Javier 's system already exists  doing this sort of thing , 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  uh , but , uh , 
G:  its main limitation is that , again , it 's only looking at silences which would  
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  maybe that 's a better place to go . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  <mouth> 
G:  So . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  I  I  I think that , eh , the possibility , eh , can be that , eh , 
D:  <mouth> Thilo , eh , working , eh , with a new class , 
D:  not only , eh , nonspeech and speech , but , eh , in  in  in the speech class , <inbreath> 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  dividing , eh , speech , eh , of  from a speaker and overlapping , <inbreath> 
D:  to try  to  to do , eh , eh , a fast  a fast , eh , <inbreath> 
D:  experiment to  to prove that , nnn , this fea eh , general feature , <inbreath> 
G:  Yeah . 
D:  eh , can solve the  the  the problem , and wh what  
D:  nnn , how far is  
G:  Maybe . Yeah . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  And , I  I have prepared the  the pitch tracker now . <inbreath> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And I hope the  the next week I will have , eh , some results and we  we will show  we will see , eh , the  the parameter  the pitch , 
G:  I see . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  eh , tracking in  with the program . 
topic_description:	Jose's update on detecting speaker overlap


G:  <inbreath> Ha - h have you ever looked at the , uh , uh  Javier 's , uh , 
D:  <mouth> And , nnn , nnn  
C:  <inbreath> 
G:  speech segmenter ? 
C:  No . 
E:  <mike noise> 
G:  Oh . Maybe m you could , you kn uh show Thilo that . 
D:  No . 
C:  No . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Sure . 
G:  Cuz again the idea is there  the limitation there again was that he was  he was only using it to look at silence as a  as a  as a  as a p putative 
D:  I  
D:  Yeah . 
G:  split point between speakers . But if you included , uh , 
C:  OK . 
G:  broadened classes then  in principle maybe you can  cover the overlap cases . 
D:  <breath> Yeah . 
D:  Mmm , yeah . 
C:  Yeah , but I 'm not too sure if  if we can  really represent 
G:  Uh   
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  overlap with  with the s  detector I  I  I used up to now , the  to speech - nonspeech as  
F:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  I think with  
D:  Ah . 
G:  <inbreath>  
C:  it 's only speech or it 's  it 's  it 's nonspeech . So . 
A:  That 's right . But I think Javier 's  
D:  Yeah . <inbreath> 
F:  <clears throat>  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <inbreath> N n <inbreath>  
A:  I think Javier 's might be able to . It doesn't have the same Gaus - uh , H M M modeling , which is I think a drawback . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
A:  But , uh  
G:  Well , it 's  sort of has a 
D:  Mmm , yeah . 
G:  simple one . Right ? It 's  
D:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  Does it ? 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  it 's just  it 's just a  isn't it just a Gaussian 
G:  for each  ? 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  Yeah . 
A:  And then  he ch you choose optimal splitting . 
G:  Oh , it doesn't have  it doesn't have any temporal , uh  ? I thought it  
A:  @ @ 
A:  Maybe I 'm misremembering , but I did not think it had a Markov  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  I gues 
G:  I guess I don't remember either . 
G:  Uh . It 's been a while . <inbreath> 
F:  <mouth> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Javier  
G:  Uh . <long outbreath> 
C:  Yeah . Uh , I could have a look at it . So . 
D:  You mean Ja - eh , eh , Javier program ? No , Javier di doesn't worked with , uh , a Markov  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah , I didn't think so . 
G:  Oh , OK . So he 's just  he just computes a Gaussian over potential  Oh , I see . I see . And  and  
D:  He on only train  
A:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah . It was only Gaussian . 
D:  This is the idea . 
A:  And so I  I think it would work fine for detecting overlap . 
A:  It 's just , uh , 
A:  that i it  he has the two - pass issue that  
A:  What he does is , as a first pass he  he  p he does , 
A:  um , a guess at where the divisions might be and he overestimates . 
A:  And that 's just a data reduction step , 
A:  so that you 're not trying at every time interval . 
C:  OK . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  And so those are the putative  places where he tries . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . OK . 
A:  And right now he 's doing that with silence  and that doesn't work 
A:  with the Meeting Recorder .  
A:  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  So if we used another method to get the first pass , I think it would probably work . It 's a good method . 
C:  Yeah . Sure . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , OK . 
G:  <mouth> 
A:  As long as the len as long the segments are long enough . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> O - k OK . So let me go back to what you had , though . Um . 
A:  That 's the other problem . 
C:  So  
F:  <mouth> 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
topic_description:	Javier's speech segmentation algorithm


G:  The other thing one could do 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  is  Couldn't  I mean , it 's  So you have two categories 
C:  Yeah .  
G:  and you have Markov models for each . 
G:  Couldn't you have a third category ? 
G:  So you have , uh  you have , 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  uh , nonspeech , single - person speech , and multiple - person speech ? 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <mouth> He has this on his board actually . 
C:  <breath> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  Don't you have , like those  those several different <laugh> categories on the board ?  
G:  Right ? And then you have a Markov model for each ? 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  Um  
F:  <laugh> 
C:  I 'm not sure . I  I thought about , uh , adding , uh , uh , another class too . But it 's not too easy , I think , the  
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  the transition between the different class , to model them in  in the system I have now . But it  it  it could be possible , I think , 
G:  <mouth> I see . 
G:  I see . 
C:  in principle . 
G:  <inbreath> 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  Yeah , I mean , I  @ @ 
G:  This is all pretty gross . I mean , the  th the reason why , uh , I was suggesting originally that we look at features is because I thought , well , we 're doing something we haven't done before , 
F:  @ @ 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  we should at least look at the space and understand  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  It seems like if two people  two or more people talk at once , it should get louder ,  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  uh , and , uh , uh , there should be some discontinuity in pitch contours ,  
C:  I had the impression . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  and , uh , there should overall be a , um , smaller proportion of the total energy that is explained by any particular harmonic  sequence in the spectrum . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  So those are all things that should be there . So far , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  um , uh , Jose has  has been  
E:  <breath> 
G:  By the way , I was told I should be calling you Pepe , but   
G:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  by your friends , but  
D:  Yeah . 
F:  <mouth> Oh .  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  Anyway , <inbreath> um , 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  uh , the  has  has , uh , 
G:  been exploring , uh , e largely the energy issue and , 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  um , 
G:  as with a lot of things , it is not  uh , like this , it 's not as simple as it sounds . And then there 's , you know  Is it energy ? Is it log energy ? Is it LPC residual energy ? Is it  is it  
C:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  is it , uh , delta of those things ? Uh , what is it no Obviously , just a simple number  
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  absolute number isn't gonna work . So 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  it should be with  compared to what ? Should there be a long window for the 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  normalizing factor and a short window for what you 're looking at ? Or , you know , how b short should they be ? So , 
C:  Yeah .  
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  th he 's been playing around with a lot of these different things and  and so far at least has not come up with 
D:  Hmm . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  any combination that really gave you an indicator . So 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  I  I still have a hunch that there 's  it 's in there some place , but it may be  given that you have a limited time here , it  it just may not be the best thing to  
G:  <inbreath> 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  to  to focus on for the remaining of it . So pitch - related and harmonic - related , 
F:  <clears throat> 
D:  To overrule , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  I 'm  I 'm  somewhat more hopeful for it .  
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> But it seems like if we just wanna get something to work , 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  <breath-laugh> that , uh , their suggestion of  of  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <inbreath> 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  Th - they were suggesting going to Markov models , 
G:  uh , but in addition there 's an expansion of what Javier did . And one of those things , looking at the statistical component , 
D:  One . 
G:  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah .  
G:  even if the features that you give it are maybe not ideal for it , it 's just sort of this general filter bank or  
C:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  or cepstrum or something , um  
D:  <clears throat> 
G:  Eee <vocal gesture, intonation of "you know" but not segmentals> it 's in there somewhere probably . 
topic_description:	feature based versus overall statistical approach


D:  But , eh , what did you think about the possibility of using the Javier software ? 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Eh , I mean , the , uh  the , uh  the BIC criterion , the  the  t to train the  the Gaussian , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  eh , using the  the mark , eh , by hand , eh , eh , to distinguish be mmm , to train overlapping zone and speech zone . I mean , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  eh , <mouth> I  I  I think that an interesting , eh , experiment , eh , could be , 
D:  th eh , to prove that , mmm , if s we suppose that , eh , the  the first step  <inbreath> 
D:  I mean , the  the classifier 
D:  what were the classifier from Javier or classifier from Thilo ? 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  W What happen with the second step ? 
D:  I  I mean , what  what happen with the , eh  the , uh , clu the , uh  the clu the clustering process ? 
D:  <inbreath> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Using the  the Gaussian . Yeah . 
A:  You mean Javier 's ? 
A:  What do you mean ? 
D:  I  I mean , that is  is enough  is enough , eh , to work well , eh , to , eh , separate or to distinguish , eh , between overlapping zone and , eh , speaker zone ? 
D:  <inbreath> Because th <inbreath> if  if we  if we , eh , nnn , develop an classifier  
A:  I  
D:  and the second step doesn't work  well , eh , we have  another problem . <inbreath> N 
A:  <mouth> 
A:  Yeah . I had tried doing it by hand at one point with a very short sample , and it worked pretty well , but I haven't worked with it a lot . 
A:  So what I d I d I took a hand - segmented sample and I added 
D:  Nnn , yeah . 
A:  ten times the amount of numbers at random , 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh . 
A:  and it did pick out 
D:  Yeah . But is  is  if   
A:  pretty good boundaries . But this was just very anecdotal sort of thing . 
D:  But it 's possible with my segmentation by hand  that we have information about the  the overlapping , uh  Yeah . <inbreath>  
A:  Right . So if we  if we 
A:  fed the hand - segmentation to Javier 's 
D:  The   
D:  N n Yeah . No . 
A:  and it doesn't work , then we know something 's wrong . 
D:  The demonstration by hand . Segmentation by hand I  I  I think is the fast experiment . <inbreath> 
A:  Yeah . I think that 's probably worthwhile doing . 
G:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Uh , we can prove that the  
A:  Whether it 'll work or not .  Yeah . 
D:  this kind o
