H:  but the c but the recorder just crashed . 
H:  Oh , 
H:  so , 
H:  you have to turn those things on if they 're not on already . 
H:  Are they  
H:  There 's a switch on top . 
H:  OK , 
H:  Looks good . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  No , no , no , no , no , no . 
H:  But you have to  the channel  uh the number on the mike is the number on the screen plus one , of course . 
H:  Cuz , uh , otherwise we would 've  
H:  That 's right . 
H:  Oh , god . 
H:  Oh , yeah . 
H:  Uh , it means I was trying to think of things they put on real mixers that I should have on mine . 
H:  But it it 's really good . 
H:  The solo actually  
H:  cuz it 's actually  you know , it 's  it 's how to  it 's what can I  what application can I have for a  for a , uh , a class method rather  or a class  you know , a class procedure . 
H:  So the solo by sa satellite . 
H:  Then if you click on one of the other ones , it clears that one . 
H:  Doesn't do anything , 
H:  no , no . 
H:  But I mean , it 's  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah , 
H:  the uh , 
H:  those  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Right , 
H:  right . 
H:  But , uh , yeah , 
H:  but it 's not such a  it 's not such a directional microphone probably . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Right , 
H:  cuz you 've got  
H:  Yeah it is , 
H:  yeah . 
H:  So  
H:  no , I mean , the  
H:  Hang on , hang on ! 
H:  Oh , right , right , right . 
H:  I mean th 
H:  Yeah it 's y 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  It depends , 
H:  yeah I 've  
H:  No , we got a Japanese version , 
H:  you know that 's  that 's it , 
H:  yeah . 
H:  Uh the  
H:  It 's funny , I li I kind of like this . 
H:  So it actually gets most of its strength from   from you know , the fact this thing 's stuck in your ear . 
H:  And , yeah , 
H:  uh I  and originally  
H:  Oh yeah , it does . 
H:  When I bought those things I originally got this version , cuz Plantronics makes uh you know , an in - the - ear one . 
H:  And I really liked it 
H:  but , other people didn't . 
H:  So it just depends . 
H:  I guess , you know , I 've been using in - the - ear Walkman headphones , for you know , a long time , 
H:  so I 'm kind of used to that weird sensation having something stuck in my ear . 
H:  But if , uh , 
H:  If you 're not used  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Hmm . 
H:  So , yeah . 
H:  I don't know . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Mmm . 
H:  Yeah , it 's not  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Right . 
H:  I was gonna say that , um , you know , in terms  
H:  So , Adam has a  you know , a particular agenda , 
H:  um , but obviously there are lots of other things . 
H:  And you know , it 's the way that a project like this works 
H:  so that a group like this where we have students coming in , you know  It 's  it 's meant to be sort of a long term thing that will get us data 
H:  and people will be able to come along and look at different aspects of it . 
H:  So it 's not clear , you know , whether s someone at UW 's gonna look at , um , beam - forming or whatever . 
H:  But , 
H:  you know , 
H:  it 's goo it 's a good property for us that there are a lot of different things you could do with it , 
H:  and so it 's  We  we haven't thought it through . 
H:  But that 's OK , 
H:  you know , it 's kind of  it 's fair enough . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  You can get the ground truth . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Which , uh  Wha - Evaluation of  
H:  Of the speaker ID or something ? 
H:  And what 's the  what  wha So what has the data been ? 
H:  What  what  what data are they using ? 
H:  What is the  
H:  Oh , OK . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Uh - huh . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  But it @ @  bu 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Right . 
H:  I  I can pause if you wanna say something that  that 's sensitive . 
H:  I mean  
H:  OK . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  That 's right . 
H:  It 's so funny , like we close the door and it 's  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah , I know . 
H:  That  that 's  That 's  that  that  that portable thing 's been mentioned . 
H:  But that was  
H:  Oh , well . 
H:  I think  I think somebody 's got a unit which is something like the ADAT or something , 
H:  which , you know , it 's a device which will record onto tape , uh , multiple channels . 
H:  And so I think that was  that was gonna be 
H:  and we were g Like someone actually has this knocking around . 
H:  Some company that we were gonna  uh , was gonna lend it to us , something like this . 
H:  The same  it might be the same company or it might be a different company . 
H:  There 's another company which also has a  apparently has purchased a very  a big multi - channel thing . 
H:  Um , 
H:  and so if we  if they could lend us that , we could imagine doing these kinds of recordings . 
H:  I mean that you know , that like you said , the fundamental thing is it doesn't have to be this hardware . 
H:  It 's just the idea that you have multiple channels to synchronize data 
H:  and then the post - processing can be uniform and stuff like that , 
H:  so . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Right . 
H:  No , it has to be  has to be error complete . 
H:  So the computer has to  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah , yeah . 
H:  No , but  No but , y 
H:  But it 's like , you know , if it really was an intelligent assistant sitting there you could say , " Oh , perhaps the computer could show us this . " 
H:  And you 'd be talking to someone else 
H:  but the computer 's meant to be listening , and so saying , " Oh , 
H:  it means me . " 
H:  You know , " I shou I should  I should do something now . " 
H:  So the  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  I mean , that 's the question . 
H:  If  if we are collecting these at different sites , different kinds of tasks , different people , what is there that 's gonna be uniform about this collection ? 
H:  And part of it will be , well , this combination of close talking and uh , and uh , environmental mikes . 
H:  And  and then part of it will just be the data presentation , 
H:  you know , maybe if  if we have common transcription standards and , you know , that it 's all transcribed 
H:  or 
H:  there 's  there 's some integration of the standards thing . 
H:  But I mean I u u as long as that makes sense , then it 's nice to have a variety of tasks , right ? 
H:  To have sort of , you know , different  
H:  Right . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  But  
H:  yeah . 
H:  Well , i w if we 're gonna have  if we 're gonna  
H:  there 's an opportunity to share tools , 
H:  right ? 
H:  The - if we  
H:  That 's right . 
H:  Oh , right . 
H:  Wha 
H:  Yeah , yeah . 
H:  Right . 
H:  We  we  we 've thought about doing  
H:  Right , right , right . 
H:  That 's  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Oh , yeah . 
H:  Yeah , sure . 
H:  I think  
H:  No , 
H:  I think the idea is to train on the , uh  on these mikes but use these to get the alignments that we 're gonna train to , 
H:  right ? 
H:  I don't know . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Well , also , I mean , I  I  I suspect that it may  we may not be able to get anywhere without doing something , 
H:  right ? 
H:  So . 
H:  We may end up having to do that . 
H:  Uh - huh . 
H:  Hang on . 
H:  You mean , you ne 
H:  You mean , uh , bu to  combining the  the posteriors on full band recognition like from  from three different or four different mikes . 
H:  Cool . 
H:  It 's something like tens of hours  
H:  tens of hours of data , I think . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Really ? 
H:  I think we 've run it  
H:  well , uh . 
H:  Not quite 
H:  but  
H:  Yeah , yeah . 
H:  It 's not  we  we  it 's a  
H:  We  
H:  we need to , uh . 
H:  Right . 
H:  OK . 
H:  Cuz we 're very naturalistic here . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Um , 
H:  bu but how much  how valuable  
H:  Given that you 're interested in this computer - directed data and we 're not gonna have any of that ? 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  I see . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Hmm , <mouth> right . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  But it  but it  
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  That 's interesting . 
H:  Well , the  I mean , and in some ways that does change the , uh , the economics of doing that . 
H:  But , um . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Mm - hmm , 
H:  mm - hmm . 
H:  But we still  
H:  yeah . 
H:  That 's interesting . 
H:  Right , we need  we need some kind of browsing . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  It 's  
H:  He 's allowed to speak , 
H:  he ca 
H:  yeah . 
H:  Hmm , @ @ . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Hmm . 
H:  Right . 
H:  I mean , it 's difficult because you want it to be real speech , right ? 
H:  And also it 's not clear how well people can even adjust to even adjust to that kind of rule . 
H:  But if there  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  We  
H:  no  
H:  Yeah , in general 
H:  yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah , yeah . 
H:  We  we give people a list of digits 
H:  and they have to like put them into their discussion , 
H:  like say , " Five , one , seven , seven , three . " 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  But  but there is  
H:  but there is also this fascinating prosodic thing that goes on 
H:  because you  what we  we have is like these lists of ten digit strings or twenty digit strings 
H:  and they 're like one  one to five or one to seven digits . 
H:  And people read through them . 
H:  And you know , we 're saying , well we won't to be able to separate them 
H:  so please pause between 
H:  but it 's very  people don't like doing that . 
H:  And so there is this prosodic thing which is  which is indicating when  whe the pauses between these digit strings . 
H:  And then when they finish , the actual  the whole sheet , there 's this nice , wonderful  yeah , phrase @ @ . 
H:  And it  
H:  Right . 
H:  Oh right . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Yeah , yeah . 
H:  Treat especially  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Right , 
H:  right . 
H:  There 'll be a common  
H:  That 'd be great . 
H:  Yeah , that 's a good idea . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Yeah , 
H:  it 's TI - digit strings . 
H:  It 's actually  
H:  it 's like  but  from one to  one to nine digits . 
H:  It is actually the  the actual digit strings from TI - digits . 
H:  OK . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  The order , 
H:  yeah . 
H:  Put them on the Internet , 
H:  put them on a web page . 
H:  I  
H:  We should do that 
H:  cuz y you can turn it off on that  that thing right there 
H:  and it makes a huge difference . 
H:  But the projector , 
H:  yeah . 
H:  This is the first time we 've done it with a projector . 
H:  Wow , 
H:  but the c but the recorder just crashed .
