D:  That 's  that 's really something . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  It looks pretty slick though . 
D:  That 's great . 
D:  Ca - can  can we fast forward through this conversation ? 
D:  No . 
D:  That 's really nice . 
D:  Huh . 
D:  I mean , on  on the temple 's the pressure ? 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  I think we have to add that to the  to the form they sign .

D:  OK . 
D:  I 'll just take  
D:  I didn't know that you could whistle that  
D:  You 're a very soft whistler , 
D:  you 're mostly able to do that without much air at all , 
D:  aren't you ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Wow , that 's amazing ! 
D:  Oh , how fun ! 
D:  Can you project it pretty well ? 
D:  I mean  
D:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
D:  But they 're just very , very sensitive . 
D:  Fascinating ! 
D:  Wow . 
D:  Huh . 
D:  We could  
D:  Can  can't we buy an expander that you just  
D:  Mm - hmm , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  There are  there are some with a lot of overlap . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well  
D:  But the  but the worst  the worst case is Politically Incorrect where they don't really make any adjustments at all . 
D:  And  and it 's hard to even follow what they 're saying . 
D:  It 's just  it 's truly  totally overlapped . 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK , you guys are more in business that I am . 
D:  My feeling is that when I  when I  when I 've seen that show it 's like there  there are sometimes people who totally take over the floor 
D:  and other people are trying to get in , and they can never  never get access . 
D:  It depends very much on the mix . 
D:  Yeah , it 's just , I  I know that there are periods where two people are talking in  t at the same time 
D:  and you 're only able to hear um , parts of the weaker voice . 
D:  And , you know , that 's  It 's a style . 
D:  It 's a style . 
D:  Uh , but I  but I 've seen debates where  
D:  And you know it 's apparently engaging people . 
D:  Uh , it 's been going on for a while now . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Sure . 
D:  Absolutely . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Or in New York  
D:  or in New York , 
D:  high involve  high in high involvement style . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That 's what it 's called . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  What I can do is say , la - la - la - la - la - la - la - la - la . 
D:  I know , 
D:  but we can blend it for the public . 
D:  Uh . 
D:  So like saying , like " Hal ? " 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Is it the three , I see , 
D:  mm - hmm . 
D:  I wanna ask one question though . 
D:  So is  is it the same three people each time or a different three people ? 
D:  OK , OK . 
D:  That 's good . 
D:  Hmm , hmm . 
D:  Well , the other thing too is , I mean , i if  if you have the equipment then , i i it could be different . 
D:  Then the recording is easy 
D:  and maybe  maybe they  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I 'd give you my mike . 
D:  Oh , I 'm not allowed to . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Alrighty . 
D:  Should we  should we interpret what he says ? 
D:  Morgan says  
D:  There we go . 
D:  Is it  is it gonna be like an HPSG kind of grammar ? 
D:  I see . 
D:  Is  is Morgan nodding his head ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  Well , he could be reached  he could be reached by the far field , 
D:  couldn't he ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I wanted to ask one question about the  the nature of the design . 
D:  Th - Given that the overlaps are up  up uh , where the difficulty comes , in a bunch of a areas , um , whether it would be useful to have some of the sessions have like an additional rule 
D:  where if a person , you know , the  that there 's someone who recognizes people to speak or something like that to cut down on the  
D:  so you  then you have the meeting context , 
D:  you have multiple channels , 
D:  you have the microphones n varying the way you want them to vary , 
D:  but you 'd cut down substantially on the overlaps . 
D:  It wouldn't be f for all meetings 
D:  but whether maybe just sprinkled through there once in a while , something like that might be useful or not . 
D:  Just wanted to raise that . 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Well , what I can say is that wha sometimes , you know , if  if  if we were to have this kind of coordination thing , some  some of the overlap is due to someone wanting to claim the floor at a certain point 
D:  without knowing that other people have the same desire at the same point in time . 
D:  And if  and if you were to have someone who was like a moderator , then you raise your hand , the moderator would say , you first , 
D:  you know , 
D:  or yeah , 
D:  press the button . 
D:  And  and I think , you know , there are always gonna be backchannels , 
D:  I think that 's natural and lovely . 
D:  But these  these overlaps that are due to people n not knowing other people wanna leap in at the same time and  and wanting to coordinate  you know , I think that , uh , it could be lessened . 
D:  Not eliminated entirely . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And they 've been collecting digits too . 
D:  OK . 
D:  That 's a good idea . 
D:  That 's a good idea . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  That 's right , 
D:  this  we could each make up a string . 
D:  I know the numbers that were used 
D:  but I don't remember the combinations . 
D:  We could do some digits . 
D:  OK . 
D:  That 's what I was wondering . 
D:  Ha - wha I mean , we could just make  make numbers up , 
D:  can't we ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Oh , can you bring them up from the  
D:  no , 
D:  OK . 
D:  Alright . 
D:  I wanted to ask about also the air conditioning . 
D:  Are  uh , is there a plan to  to turn the air conditioning off in some of these meetings or is it always gonna be on ? 
D:  Yeah , 
D:  but I was just thinking , he was showing it  on what he showed us on the web site , 
D:  you could see the contribution of the air conditioning . 
D:  And I just wondered if that was gonna be sometimes clear . 
D:  Hmm , hmm . 
D:  Oh wow , 
D:  there you go . 
D:  Perfect . 
D:  I think I recognize those .
