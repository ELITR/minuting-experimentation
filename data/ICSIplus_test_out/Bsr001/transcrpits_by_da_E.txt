E:  so it 's in a separate room . 
E:  Hello ? 
E:  Right . 
E:  No , no . 
E:  You subtract  He was just saying trap subtract one . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Ch - ch . 
E:  Oh ! 
E:  Really ? 
E:  Uh . 
E:  I 've been clicking plenty . 
E:  But they don't show up . 
E:  They don't show up on that thing . 
E:  Yeah , I 'm sure  I 'm sure they 're recorded . 
E:  They tend to clip . 
E:  Ahh . 
E:  So you 've implemented radio buttons . 
E:  What happened ? 
E:  They have so much pressure at th it 's  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Just trying to give you a hard transcription task . 
E:  No . 
E:  I 'm sorry . 
E:  No , I wish . 
E:  No . 
E:  No . 
E:  Just studied phonetics in general . 
E:  Yeah , it 's weird . 
E:  It 's kind of , uh , 
E:  apical - alveolar kind of thing . 
E:  I don't know . 
E:  It 's   You know ? 
E:  Get a very high pitch that way too . 
E:  And you get dogs to d cock their heads and stuff . 
E:  It 's really good . 
E:  Cuz you can get really high . 
E:  No . 
E:  Not too well . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  But it 's that you get enough of the high frequencies . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  that you really get  you really get animals like  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I 'm surviving . 
E:  Yeah , I uh 
E:  You guys gave up too soon . 
E:  I think you just get used to it after five minutes . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  We  
E:  You 'd mentioned there was some possibility that somewhere else is going to  you might contract out to do the transcription ? 
E:  Can y 
E:  Yeah , that 's what I was wondering . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Well , 
E:  one thing that Horacio h hadn't mentioned is , 
E:  um , 
E:  I mean , y you were talking about uh the same  the same sort of idea of just collecting a meeting and  and looking at it afterwards . 
E:  But the  the thing that I 'm interested in , and I 'm probably the one who 's gonna start doing the collection ,  um , <mouth> is e is having this situation where people are talking to each other and talking to a computer in the machine  in  in the room . 
E:  Um , 
E:  and 
E:  so that 's probably  that 's probably what  
E:  u 
E:  that 's certainly what 's gonna come out of , uh , of our group first . 
E:  Uh um . 
E:  And it  
E:  Well , 
E:  so , you know , what we 're  we 're basically doing is  is waiting to look at the pilot and see what people wanna do 
E:  but it 's going all be Wizard of Oz at first . 
E:  So we 're gonna let them do what they wanna do first and then see if we should um , you know , subsequent things . 
E:  Try to  try to constrain them 
E:  or not constrain them . 
E:  Or try  try to figure that out . 
E:  That 's one of them  
E:  Pardon ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  e 
E:  and it 's all of these things  i i is a g 
E:  It is exactly these things that I mentioned . 
E:  This is  these are the main things that I 'm interested in . 
E:  Exactly these . 
E:  When  when  do you know when you 're starting and when you know you 're ending . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So . 
E:  Right . 
E:  So we wanna  we wanna look at exactly those sorts of things . 
E:  of  of us , at least in the beginning , is gonna have a number of different characteristics . 
E:  It 's not going to be natural . 
E:  It 's not gonna be a regular meeting . 
E:  It 's gonna be an artificial situation cuz we 're gonna have to , you know , mock up some back - end . 
E:  Um . 
E:  So the kinds of , you know  the kinds of speech is  the speech is gonna be slightly different . 
E:  People are gonna be in an unnatural task . 
E:  We 're  we 're t gonna be trying to figure out how they 're gonna  
E:  But 
E:  But we will have the , you know  We 'll  we 'll have all this  all the m microphones set up all the same . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Right . 
E:  And  Yeah . 
E:  And if your task is to just sort of , you know , generally do , um , summary and , uh  and large vocabulary speech recognition over the thing , then it doesn't matter that much which , uh , that there 's much a difference . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah , actually we could do that at our site too 
E:  even though that 's not what I 'm normally gonna be collecting , 
E:  but there 's no reason we can't collect that , 
E:  and , uh , then you 'd have a more  m your normal kind of meeting . 
E:  They 're going to be goal directed . 
E:  You 're supposed to  
E:  Yeah , you know . You 're supposed to  you 're  a budget meeting or something 
E:  and you have a spreadsheet up there , 
E:  and everybody has to sort of work out the  you know , some particular goal of where to p allocate money . 
E:  And they can t ask the computer to switch things around in different columns or something like that . 
E:  But everybody  s 
E:  and acs actually a o another characteristic is that we 're only dealing with three people . 
E:  Um . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So . 
E:  We 're gonna start with just three people , 
E:  yeah . 
E:  Um , I think it 's mainly  It 's partly channel limitation 
E:  because we wanna  we wanna double mike everybody . 
E:  Um , it 's also to a large extent , 
E:  um  
E:  And we have eight channels . 
E:  Um . 
E:  It 's also I think , uh , e e sort of what came up I think when even Liz was , uh , involved a little while ago with  and Christine I think just in terms of the thinking of the subjects and trying to have enough people . 
E:  We sort of wanted to , you know , encourage like everybody to talk , 
E:  try to figure out some way that everybody would be able to participate 
E:  and  
E:  A g 
E:  Yes , 
E:  that was  that was the idea . 
E:  Uh , but 
E:  I don't know , 
E:  that was , you know , w we 're not uh planning to do anything with  with all that like right away . 
E:  So if there were  is there  you know , we  h we 're happy to take input on that . 
E:  And also , I very much wanna find out about the , you know , the specs on the board that you have in the ma in the  i in the PCI card 
E:  cuz I think we might wanna go with that . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  No , no , 
E:  we 're ho we 're hoping to just bring in different groups of three people apiece . 
E:  Uh . 
E:  In a given  in a given meeting ? 
E:  What we 're try what we 're trying to do is not make it too  eh  you know , not make it too , um , ar artificial . 
E:  You know , 
E:  not like say , " OK , 
E:  mmm , let 's role play . 
E:  Your , y " you know , " you do this , you wanna  " 
E:  but rather give them an actual task . 
E:  So actually have  
E:  Yeah , 
E:  and they all just have their own  they just happen to have their own opinions . 
E:  And another possible thing that we 're thinking of is something like , uh , you know , we have these regular Wednesday lunches 
E:  and you gotta plan a menu , right ? 
E:  So everybody has things that they like 
E:  an and , uh  
E:  But a lot of the  
E:  No . 
E:  None of that . 
E:  N no eating during meetings . 
E:  Maybe salivating if you 're thinking about the food , 
E:  but it  
E:  Um . 
E:  OK , 
E:  so the idea is we wanna start off with a somewhat simple back - end 
E:  and we 're thinking of , um , agentifying an EXCEL spreadsheet and having s like some kind of spreadsheet  
E:  So basically , what  wh people will see a spreadsheet and they can ask it to move numbers around . 
E:  So 
E:  we thought that would be a  be a useful kind of task for budget meetings or that kind of thing . 
E:  So starting off  we would start off definitely with a Wizard of Oz task 
E:  but it would be something  
E:  Uh yes , 
E:  but it would be something  uh but everything would be an agent . 
E:  And so it just be  you know , we wouldn't have the recognition grammar to begin with . 
E:  We wouldn't have the NL grammar to begin with . 
E:  But these are all components that are obvious to us how to build . 
E:  Nothing  nothing that 's sort of far in the future . 
E:  It 's just a matter of  of work . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So , 
E:  sort of  
E:  Right . 
E:  Something that can be built up , you know , relatively quickly 
E:  and makes sense how to do . 
E:  So a fairly simple back - end . 
E:  Um . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  That 's good . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Great . 
E:  Oh , that 's really interesting . 
E:  We 're starting off with digit stuff too <laugh> for  for  for our different  for  for this , um , endpointing stuff . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  We were thinking something like , you know , ten hours to begin <laugh> with . 
E:  It 's about  
E:  Oh , the  
E:  Right . 
E:  That 's actually , that 's the other thing . 
E:  We weren't  
E:  Uh . 
E:  One thing I should point out , we were n we were not planning on tra doing transcription of the full thing right away , 
E:  u cuz that 's not  I mean , I was initially interested in just the speech that was directed at the computer . 
E:  And so we were not planning on doing the  transcribing the entire thing . 
E:  But I mean , that 's something to talk about . 
E:  If you wanted  if you wanted to transcribe , <laugh> you have the 
E:  yes , @ @ you 'll be fine . 
E:  So what is the company ? 
E:  I heard a " sh " . 
E:  Ah ! 
E:  OK . 
E:  Well , that 's me personally . 
E:  Our group in general as Horacio was saying is also interested in some of the same general issues . 
E:  Um , 
E:  and I 'm also interested in prosody , um , use  you know , u used over person to person stuff 
E:  like segment and helping for segmentation and stuff . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  N the language models c Yeah . 
E:  Really ? 
E:  Oh , sure . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  On the language model  we 're  
E:  uh we 're  we 're gonna be using the same thing that we 've done in the past 
E:  which is , you know , we need a natural language grammar written anyway . 
E:  It 's written in unification grammar framework . 
E:  um , but with context free grammar , power , 
E:  and so it 's just changed directly into something the recognizer recognizes off of directly with  with no , 
E:  um , 
E:  It 's  it 's  it 's hand - coded . 
E:  Because we need  we need to write the natural language grammar anyway to understand . 
E:  So it 's  it 's a small , you know , ATIS - sized type task . 
E:  So , 
E:  yeah , that 's  that 's the way we 've been approaching it . 
E:  Eh if we  if we 're ge 
E:  yeah , we  you know , 
E:  if we 're gonna be able to interpret it then  I mean , if we 're not gonna be able to interpret that then it 's not gonna do us much good anyway to recognize it . 
E:  So we might as well go directly from the natural language grammar . 
E:  It is a unification base , 
E:  it 's not  it 's not as  as theoretically bound as HPSG in particular , 
E:  although the couple of people that we have working on it have HPSG backgrounds . 
E:  It 's all up to when I have free time . 
E:  Anybody else want to work on this by the way , Horacio ? 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Well I know they 're all working on mediated spaces 
E:  but there 's a lotta aspects o e to that  to that project . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Yes . 
E:  Yes . 
E:  Well , so we haven't even  you know , we haven't collected a byte yet 
E:  so . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  And we have the same sampling rate . 
E:  One  one thing we do know is that we 're  we 're all producing NIST Sphere files in  in , uh , eh in the standard format . 
E:  Sixteen bit , sixteen kilohertz . 
E:  So at the end we 're all  
E:  And the amazing thing is that even  even , you know , the entire way through we 're actually using some very , very similar stuff . 
E:  And so tha 
E:  yeah . 
E:  So , 
E:  Yeah , it 's coincidence that it 's very fortunate cuz  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  We actually have , yeah , quite similar hardware as it turns out . 
E:  Which is ver it 's  it 's very good , 
E:  yeah . 
E:  Um , so we 're actually  
E:  Well  
E:  Uh  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I mean , all those issues yeah I 'm sure we  
E:  I mean , @ @ like I say . I 'm  I 'm personally not interested in those for my particular aspect of the project 
E:  but SRI in general is  is the  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  And s I don't know , maybe we will end up transcribing stu 
E:  if Hor - if Horacio wants , you know , wants that done , maybe that 'll be  maybe we 'll end up doing that . 
E:  I mean , it 's kind of amazing too that , you know , the transcription tool we just converged on the same  
E:  All these things were very , very similar . 
E:  It 's  
E:  We  we  we were gonna use the same tool . 
E:  We  we set up that tool already , 
E:  yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  that 's right . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  I don't think we have any problem . 
E:  I mean , we had certainly in our  you know , the proposal that we tried to make to NSF , we were assuming we would distribute this through the LDC . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  so we have no problem with that . 
E:  It 's terrific . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I mean , s it  tho those  those kinds of things are sorta the kind of things that we were thinking of  of trying , 
E:  cuz we are having  we do have a more artificial set environment again . 
E:  We 're trying something totally new 
E:  having people speak to the computer . 
E:  I don't think we talked about that in particular 
E:  cuz we didn't  we haven't done any pilots , 
E:  we haven't seen this , <laugh> incredibly difficult data of overlapping . 
E:  But this is 
E:  uh , Christine Helverson , who 's working on this with me from the s um , aspect of user , you know , usability and stuff , would , y you know  
E:  sh she 's interested in these sorts of things . 
E:  What  what can you ask people to do that , um , that they can reliably do and without too much , you know , cognitive load , um , that can help things out , 
E:  or , you know , those sorts of issues . 
E:  So , 
E:  I don't know . 
E:  Maybe it 's something that could fit easier in  in our context than in a general meeting context . 
E:  I don't know . 
E:  Just have a button . 
E:  And ring the buzzer . 
E:  Mm - mmm . 
E:  I don't know . 
E:  We  <laugh> For a  t for a completely different reason I assume 
E:  but  
E:  And  and not within a  not within a big room . 
E:  Just , uh . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  But you need the room and the set up . 
E:  Yeah , we 're doing digits  
E:  yeah , we 're not doing digits in the  in the room set up at all . 
E:  We 're doing it for a complete 
E:  I mean , 
E:  one of the specific things I 'm interested in is knowing  um , is the open mike issue . 
E:  When you 're talking to the computer , knowing when you 're done speaking . 
E:  And so I 'm loo interested in  in  well , in interested in looking at prosody . 
E:  Um , 
E:  and so we 're just having  we 're just doing lists of digits to see when people pause to know , you know , " there was a big gap in time here 
E:  but , they "  you know , we can tell prosodically they weren't done , 
E:  so . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  right . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Oh , right , 
E:  just look at the very last  <laugh> look at the very end . 
E:  Funny . 
E:  And what are these  what are the digit strings  are from TI digits and , <clears throat> uh  
E:  Uh  
E:  I don't  
E:  Uh  
E:  How  how long are  how long chunks are they , 
E:  a 
E:  OK , 
E:  yeah , I 've never looked over the TI - digits corpus , 
E:  I don't know . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Huh . 
E:  But the projector 's not part of your meeting 
E:  or  or  or is it ? 
E:  Do  is this normally gonna be on during collection ? 
E:  For ours it will 
E:  but we have a rear projector , 
E:  so it 's in a separate room .
