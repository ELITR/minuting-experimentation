F:  Oh no ! 
F:  Yeah , that 's right ! 
F:  Thanks . 
F:  So . 
F:  There 's a switch on top . 
F:  So . 
F:  " On - off " . 
F:  The  the wireless ones are actually labeled . 
F:  They have a little piece of tape . 
F:  That 's r exactly the problem . 
F:  Subtract one from the mike number to get the channel number . 
F:  Or maybe add one . 
F:  Of course . 
F:  So I guess I am channel eight . 
F:  You look ni You look nine . 
F:  Funny , you don't look a day over seven . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  so it 's r it 's remarkable how quickly people forget . 
F:  So far , e 
F:  You h you must have much better ear . 
F:  And so far every meeting I 've recorded someone has at one point or another said , " Oh , I probably shouldn't have said that . " 
F:  So I think they 're  they 're  
F:  Well , I  I bet they 're recorded 
F:  quite loudly . 
F:  Yeah , so it  
F:  That 's a nice user interface , Dan . 
F:  Very  
F:  what does " solo " mean ? 
F:  Ah ! 
F:  Oh , 
F:  but it doesn't actually do anything else ? 
F:  Oh , yeah , that 's right . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  I think a lot o a lot of us ended up wearing it around your neck and then facing up . 
F:  I kn and , uh , just because there doesn't seem to be a good way to mount it . 
F:  This  this thing ? 
F:  Or  or just that one ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So  
F:  so the  
F:  I think  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh , yeah . 
F:  But this is very comfortable . 
F:  I mean , I  I could wear this without any difficulty . 
F:  I  
F:  We c we 'd  we 'd have to buy new ones . 
F:  The  the other wa 
F:  the other way I had it , which might work , is you put one over an ear 
F:  and then you can adjust the other one . 
F:  And that didn't  that seemed to be pretty  
F:  That doesn't work for you ? 
F:  So  so you see how Jane 's wearing it ? 
F:  That seems to work OK too . 
F:  And you just have to bring it up . 
F:  Well , except you can bring it quite a bit closer to your mouth . 
F:  So . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  So . 
F:  Yeah , we  maybe we should look into  if we can buy a replacement . 
F:  If they 're eighty bucks , that might be worth doing cuz they 're very uncomfortable . 
F:  Well , I mean , what you 'd rather do is nothing at all , 
F:  of course , 
F:  but to get  to get a good quality  I mean , if  if you were listening to it downstairs , that one 's quite a bit lower quality . 
F:  So . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Well  well try this one on . 
F:  I 








F:  Well , I guess my feeling is that this is for collecting a corpus not for an actual end - user application . 
F:  And so I think a little bit of intrusion is not  ridiculous . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  I agree . 
F:  Training s Training speech recognition systems . 
F:  We wanna do both . 
F:  So  so the  the point is that if you  if we try , from the get go , to do it off the PZM , we won't get anything . 
F:  You won't be able to align . 
F:  You won't be able to segment . 
F:  You won't be able to do anything . 
F:  Right ! 
F:  Well , I mean , we haven't done the  the detail experiment 
F:  but just from listening to it , it 's pretty bad , 
F:  whereas these are m are very good . 
F:  I mean , that 's why  That 's why if you  if you use DragonDictate or  or ViaVoice , or any of those others to do dictation you need to use these . 
F:  There 's just no other way around it . 
F:  Well , and as I said , I find this one  
F:  I find this one is no problem at all . 
F:  The only thing is <mike noise> a little bit of audio  a  a little bit of audio degradation in one ear , 
F:  and I get a little bit of peripheral vision , 
F:  but other than that , it 's not bad at all . 
F:  Those , on the other hand , are very uncomfortable . 
F:  So . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  So I  I guess  
F:  you know , maybe the problem is we got the kid 's version . 
F:  It 's wired . 
F:  Whereas I used speech recognition for about four years using one of these , 
F:  so I 'm used to this . 
F:  I don't use it anymore . 
F:  Uh , my hands got better 
F:  so I stopped using it . 
F:  But , uh . 
F:  So , for about four years I used DragonDictate and NaturallySpeaking 
F:  to do all my work . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  It was really a pain . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  but I didn't have a choice . 
F:  I mean , I couldn't type . 
F:  So , 
F:  uh . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  In fact , when I first came back to grad school that was a project I wanted to work on , 
F:  " voice environments for programmers " , 
F:  but we couldn't get any funding for it and my hands got better . 
F:  So 
F:  that 's how I ended up working on this project instead . 
F:  Anyway . 
F:  So  so what are you guys doing ? 
F:  What 's your project ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Worse acoustics . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  This is  this is  
F:  The PDA one is very , very ambitious . 
F:  And it 's also  it 's depending on not only that  
F:  Uh , not only does it depend on IRAM taping out and working as specified , it also depends on writing vectorized speech recognition algorithms 
F:  which is non - trivial . 
F:  So . 
F:  Right , I mean , 
F:  so  so one of our  
F:  our back off policy on that if  if there 's problems with IRAM is it 'll be a wireless link , 
F:  right ? 
F:  You 'll dump the  the  dump the audio wirelessly to a network somewhere 
F:  and you 'll do the recognition . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Well , we  we  we 've had a lot of discussions about it 
F:  and I think 
F:  maybe  I think t to some extent it comes down to a religious issue . 
F:  My religion is personal computers are good and terminal mainframes are bad . 
F:  And so if you can get away with it , I don't want to have a terminal in my hand and a mainframe somewhere else . 
F:  Um , the  too many things to cont can go wrong and you lack control . 
F:  I think the PC revolution has shown how good it is if you can have the power yourself . 
F:  And so the IRAM project provided us a method of having a very powerful thing in your hand . 
F:  And so we wanna see what we can do with it 
F:  but we 'd also don't want the project to actually completely depend on it . 
F:  So , 
F:  the project will go forward regardless of whether IRAM works or not . 
F:  Right . 
F:  So w 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So a 
F:  Right . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right , 
F:  so the  so for us the Meeting Recorder project has a very similar uh , approach . 
F:  Me personally , for my P H D thesis , I 'm sorta doing the other way and seeing how much speech recognition can I do on this little unit . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  So  so the  
F:  As I said , the Meeting Recorder project , 
F:  so we have people at UW , people here working on robust algorithms that will be running on work stations . 
F:  They won't be running on IRAM . 
F:  And then what I 'm trying to do is see how much of it I can put on IRAM . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  That 's right , 
F:  we don't even know what to do with it . 
F:  We don't need to n 
F:  Right . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  Yeah , we don't even know what to do with their cycles . 
F:  We w 
F:  Like  
F:  As an example , we had a visitor who was working on speaker ID , acoustic change detection . 
F:  And he has a very good system for that 
F:  and  and he wants to use this corpus . 
F:  So . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Oh , it  th what 's nice about  
F:  What 's nice about getting this corpus is , i with the people wired you have a excellent baseline . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  You have a very easy problem and you can get the right answer , to ground truth very easily 
F:  and then you can degrade it by using the P Z 
F:  you can degrade it further by using those things . 
F:  And  and really see what you can do with a real system . 
F:  So . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  Oh , really ? 
F:  They 're doing an unknown number ? 
F:  That 's good . 
F:  I mean , just mixing it wouldn't work because the channel characteristics are too different . 
F:  So , uh , what we  what we were working on here was parts of Broadcast News . 
F:  And so that  that 's a slightly strange task because they tend to be long segments . 
F:  But they were  they were parts that were interviews that he worked on . 
F:  And , uh . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah , he had  he got very good results . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Yeah , so I  I tried his on  his system on the Meeting Recorder stuff , 
F:  um , 
F:  but of course we don't have any trained neural nets 
F:  or , uh  
F:  So  so his system was based on our hybrid neural net system that we use for speech recognition . 
F:  And so , uh , I was using the Broadcast News nets on this data . 
F:  So of course it didn't do  didn't do t tremendously well . 
F:  And then the other problem also was that it doesn't handle overlap very well , 
F:  his algorithm . 
F:  Hmm ? 
F:  Right . 
F:  That 's right , with all the i interrupts . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  Mixing , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  Like 
F:  But yeah , they  they have  
F:  I think in  in  
F:  Oh , I 'm sure they do . 
F:  They  I 'm sure they have an audio engineer in the back . 
F:  Well , but that that 's different than an audio engineer fiddling with the mixing parameters . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  High involvement . 
F:  That 's  that 's a 
F:  good way of saying it . 
F:  So what do we do ? 
F:  It seems like there 's a lot of overlap between our projects , 
F:  so it would be nice to work together . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So is your intention to start collecting some meeting data ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  More data is better . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  So what would be nice is if we could , uh , converge on  on formats and conventions , and so on , 
F:  and software . 
F:  I mean , just  
F:  Right . 
F:  I , uh  uh  It shouldn't be done . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  We 're talking about that right now . 
F:  I 'm not sure how much I should say about it . 
F:  So that the , 
F:  uh  
F:  there 's some possibility that we 're gonna get a third c party company to do the transcription for us in exchange for the corpus . 
F:  Right , 
F:  and  
F:  We have a little bit of DARPA . 
F:  Uh , under the communicator project . 
F:  So  so that 's part of it . 
F:  And then , uh , part of it 's on the IRAM group . 
F:  IRAM group is paying for part of it . 
F:  And then part of it 's just ICSI general funds , is paying for it as well . 
F:  The infrastructure , yeah , they  th they were paid  
F:  but they don't expect anything in return . 
F:  They 're just being very nice and good neighbors 
F:  and  
F:  and so they  they basically wanted stuff anyway . 
F:  And then they just sort of allowed us to direct the audio portion of it to what we needed . 
F:  So . 
F:  And to our listening audience . 
F:  Feedback . 
F:  Right . 
F:  We  we talked about that and  It was  
F:  Well i w when I spoke with him he  he really just said it was a money issue . 
F:  That it 's certainly not any sort of intellectual property issue <laugh> where we 're perfectly willing to give people those boxes . 
F:  The boxes are cheap . 
F:  Um , but , you know , can they afford to get a six channel Sony wireless 
F:  and can they afford the P Z 
F:  and that sort of stuff . 
F:  Well  
F:  Oh . 
F:  This is  
F:  this is the same  same company that may be doing the transcripts for us , 
F:  may be giving us  
F:  may be giving us , 
F:  uh - huh . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  And it would also  it would be really nice to be able to do it in other rooms , 
F:  cuz otherwise we 're gonna learn a lot about this air conditioning . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  That 'd be great . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  I agree . 
F:  So  so are you gonna m uh , i is there gonna be some sort of mark for that ? 
F:  I mean , are they gonna say , " Computer , bring up a web page on  " 
F:  or  ? 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  Oh , I see . 
F:  I 'm just thinking , from a discourse point of view it 'd be very interesting to somehow mark " I 'm talking to the computer " . 
F:  Right . 
F:  " Computer , show me a web page on X , " return . 
F:  Are you talking to me ? 
F:  Are you talking to me ? 
F:  XML , 
F:  that solves everything . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  We 're gonna make  
F:  Right . 
F:  Someone will make some assumption that 's different than someone else . 
F:  And then we suddenly won't be able to interoperate . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  So that 's something we should try to  
F:  I I 'm not sure what  wh I mean what 's a good solution than that other than trying to keep in touch with each other . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  I mean , meetings like this are good because we can actually record them . 
F:  Yep , 
F:  absolutely . 
F:  Right . 
F:  So  
F:  When you 're talking about your artificial meetings , i they are gonna be goal directed , though . 
F:  So they 're gonna s say , you 're  you 're having a meeting to do this . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  So that will be different . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  So if  
F:  You 're double miking everyone , 
F:  so that 's a close talking and a lapel , and then two environmental mikes , 
F:  is that right ? 
F:  Right . 
F:  Well , if you ha m u eh  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah that  
F:  That is , uh . 
F:  Yes , 
F:  or drinking . 
F:  Y getting  getting coffee on these is definitely a bad thing . 
F:  Wizard of Oz . 
F:  So a real computer but a w uh , someone driving it . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  I  I think that 's close enough to what we 're interested in that it would t it 'd be useful for training uh , the acoustic models , without any question . 
F:  Oh , absolutely . 
F:  Yeah , cuz if you don't the  the accuracy 's gonna be horrendously bad . 
F:  So . 
F:  Well , we 'll definitely need to do both . 
F:  Right . 
F:  It  it really  i 
F:  It will really depend on if we have someone who really wants to do that . 
F:  So . 
F:  I 
F:  Well it 's  
F:  just as an example , I I 've done some very simple digits recognitions 
F:  where , uh , I said if I had known we were having this meeting I would have done this before , 
F:  uh . 
F:  Having people read digit strings 
F:  cuz digits are much easier . 
F:  Um . 
F:  And just combining  just doing multis 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  of course . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  But , uh , just mixing the  
F:  just doing multi - stream on the different mikes helped enormously . 
F:  And I was a little surprised . 
F:  Yeah , so you  so you  
F:  Wh - why ? 
F:  I have no idea . 
F:  Because they 're a little different . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  And that actually helped . 
F:  That gave several percent improvement . 
F:  Absolute . 
F:  So that , uh , 
F:  I think just  just having stereo will help 
F:  cuz they 're a little different . 
F:  You get a little  slightly different estimators 
F:  and , uh , 
F:  uh , you combine them together , and you do a little better . 
F:  Right , 
F:  so that the  
F:  M 
F:  So our initial plan for ICSI was to do forty hours . 
F:  And then U W is talking about doing an additional sixty to a hundred hours if they have the money . 
F:  If they can actually do it . 
F:  I mean , that 's what they had said before 
F:  but I guess that was more ambitious . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  recording it 's easy . 
F:  It 's transcription that 's a pain . 
F:  OK , but you have to put on a  You have to put on a mike . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  We 're out of mikes . 
F:  Don't  don't switch mikes . 
F:  Don't switch mikes . 
F:  That 's way too confusing . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  But if you had the data and we had  a  a company . 
F:  I didn't know whether I should name the company that may be providing us transcription or not . 
F:  IBM . 
F:  So we 've been  we 've been trying  we 've been trying to work with them for a while on these projects 
F:  and they don't  
F:  it 's hard for them to give us money 
F:  but they  they seem to be willing to give us time . 
F:  And so one of the po potentials is for them to do transcription in exchange for access to the corpus . 
F:  It would be great . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yes , 
F:  absolutely . 
F:  I think that would be excellent . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  Morgan says thumbs up . 
F:  Well , and I think that  
F:  So al 
F:  Right . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So  so how are you gonna get dra ground truth on that ? 
F:  So  so we should  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  But anyway , what I was gonna say is that although we 're not gonna have speech directed to a computer , my expectation is that the acoustic models will be very similar . 
F:  The language models probably won't be . 
F:  Yeah , I  if it 's Wizard of Oz I think it will be . 
F:  If they know that  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  The language model will be  certainly be different 
F:  but  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And you 're gonna hand  c hand - code that ? 
F:  Oh , I  I uh 
F:  sure , sure , sure , sure . 
F:  I see . 
F:  Right , if you wanna interpret it you uh need to do  do that anyway . 
F:  So what 's your time frame look like for  doing meetings , actually starting to record some ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Well the  the reason I 'm asking is that it 's certainly better to get in early with standards , and data formats , and conventions . 
F:  Um . 
F:  Well , yeah , 
F:  it 's a  it 's ex excellent , excellent . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  that 's right . 
F:  I mean , just  just  just agreeing on a sampling rate and a number of bits , and , uh , header formats and all that . 
F:  Sixteen bit , sixteen kilohertz ? 
F:  Eh , good good . 
F:  Big endian , little endian ? 
F:  Well , but that 's  that was coincidence , right ? 
F:  So I  I think probably the biggest thing would  
F:  Well , no 
F:  that  that wouldn't be true . 
F:  If you 're not gonna transcribe it yourself , then you 're not gonna care too much about our transcription conventions . 
F:  Right of it . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Well  
F:  Well , so it 's a  
F:  so it seems like , um , if you and Jane  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So if you and Jane keep  keep in touch about transcription conventions , that would be very helpful . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  Right . 
F:  It 's much more worth while to do if someone else is gonna use it . 
F:  Although again if this now named company is the one who 's gonna do the transcription , I sus I suspect they have in house tools that they 'll end up using . 
F:  That 's alright . 
F:  He can talk anyway . 
F:  I was . 
F:  LDC is what we were thinking too . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Robert 's rules . 
F:  Well I think that  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  There are certainly f formal meeting settings where that 's what 's happens , 
F:  y that you know , Robert 's rules of order and all that . 
F:  Uh , so that 's not something we had thought about before 
F:  but I think it  it  it certainly is another type of meeting that could be done . 
F:  Uh , no , 
F:  I didn't . 
F:  I didn't know we were gonna be recording this meeting , 
F:  so I didn't . 
F:  Yes , 
F:  in the other meetings we have . 
F:  So that 's another thing we should talk about , is making sure that we 're doing it in the same way . 
F:  So I  I  
F:  Yeah , if I had known and here we have all these new speakers , I could have gotten lots of digits in 
F:  but  
F:  No , no , I have people read them . 
F:  Seven . 
F:  Oh , cool . 
F:  Nice falling , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  So . 
F:  Oh , 
F:  I hadn't thought about that . 
F:  I hadn't even thought about throwing out the last couple . 
F:  Definitely should . 
F:  Don't throw it away 
F:  but don't use it in your training . 
F:  Cool . 
F:  And  
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  The only thing I don't like about it is that it 's not phonetically very rich , 
F:  but . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  that 's right , 
F:  TIMIT . 
F:  So we actually talked about that . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  it 's plenty bad . 
F:  It 's plenty bad just with digits , 
F:  although I haven't trained any nets on it . 
F:  I 've just been using existing digits or Broadcast News nets 
F:  since we don't have enough data yet . 
F:  One , seven , eight , two , three , one , three , seven , eight , four . 
F:  M that sorta thing . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  But what were they ? 
F:  They vary from  
F:  I  I just extracted exactly the same ones , 
F:  so . 
F:  That 's like the TIMIT sentences . 
F:  Greasy wash water , 
F:  oh . 
F:  But , so I have a bunch of tools for generating these and for helping transcribe them . 
F:  Since you know what  you know what the transcript is you don't have to type it in , you just have to segment it . 
F:  So I have tools for doing that . 
F:  Using X - X Waves , Tcl - TK , Perl , and maybe some C programs too . 
F:  Well I  I don't have any of the print outs . 
F:  I  I print them out a a as I need them . 
F:  So what I should do is just print out a whole stack and leave them up here 
F:  but I haven't done that . 
F:  Well , but i 
F:  It 's  it 's a different task . 
F:  It 's a different task than read . 
F:  You  you do it differently if it 's sitting in front of you and you 're reading it than if it 's not . 
F:  So , 
F:  I guess we could write them down and then read them , 
F:  but . 
F:  I  I  we can get digits . 
F:  I mean , a as you said , we don't have to be in a meeting . 
F:  And so if we 're short on digits I can just , you know , capture people in the hallway , 
F:  drag them in here , 
F:  and have them read digits for me . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  Well , 
F:  the  the hum we hear right now is actually the projector ,
