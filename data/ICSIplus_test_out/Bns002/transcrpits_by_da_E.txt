E:  OK . 
E:  Eh , you  you want me to  say  
E:  Oh ! 
E:  Of course . 
E:  Eh ,  well , I 'm working in the em  Broadband Commu 
E:  Ah , it 's not a hear  
E:  It works  like  like this . 
E:  Ah , 
E:  that 's  
E:  Ah , 
E:  that 's uh  much more comfortable . 
E:  Thank - <inbreath> thank you . 
E:  I 'm uh  working in the Broadband Communications Group 
E:  and eh , 
E:  eh 
E:  well , the research topics at this moment is uh ,  I P - eighty traffic monitoring and characterization and em  eh  tool  developing tools uh for quality of service , eh  performance analysis . 
E:  That 's eh   And we have several projects eh  both Spanish and European projects , ongoing 
E:  eh  in this area . 
E:  Excuse me @ @ . 
E:  If I understood correctly , the mechanism eh  you should eh  look for um the minimum eh  coverage range 
E:  in order to maximize the throughput of the network . 
E:  So there  the  the power control eh  algorithm should work , in order to use at each instant of time the minimum power need to reach 
E:  the neighbor . 
E:  That  Because this is the way  eh  eh more transmissions uh 
E:  may take  take place at the same time . 
E:  So you need the adaptive mechanism to minimize the coverage range . 
E:  That  
E:  Ah , thank you  thank you very much . 
E:  Who is ? 
E:  Perez . 
E:  Ah , Peire . 
E:  No . 
E:  I don't know . 
E:  I don't know who he is .
