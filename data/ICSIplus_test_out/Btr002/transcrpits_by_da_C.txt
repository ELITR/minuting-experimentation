C:  Sure . 
C:  Hello . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  Hello . 
C:  Hello . 
C:  That 's good . 
C:  OK . @ @ Not sure . 
C:  Thank you . 
C:  Whoa . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  " Ish decay . " 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Ah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  It  it  
C:  Right , as though it 's leading into something else . 
C:  Bu  And  
C:  yeah . 
C:  I 
C:  A new subject . 
C:  The first one , too , is more like  
C:  To me , I don't necessarily put , um , like a d a p a p a period after that " so " . 
C:  I might actually either put a dash after it depending on whether or not they got unt interrupted or something , 
C:  or I would maybe even act as though they were , um , just trailing off . 
C:  So put that  those two dots after it . 
C:  Um , uh , which depending on what 's going on , like , I 'll do that . 
C:  Cuz to me it sounds more like they 're trailing off . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Period . Right . 
C:  That 's another thing , is i if you 're not a native speaker of English you might not pick up , 
C:  because , uh , you know , every language has different , um , intonation mappings . 
C:  And  
C:  Right . 
C:  And also if you 're a non - native speaker transcribing it , you wouldn't necessarily <inbreath> kn uh , kn understand the conventions of English t intonation as , you know , intimately as a native speaker might . 
C:  n Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Not so much . No . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  g Group . 
C:  " Groups of " , 
C:  " gruesome " . 
C:  Yeah . If you  if for some reason they didn't hear the " F " , if they didn't hear the " fuh " ,  it might just sound like  
C:  Yeah , " grou " uh , " gruesuh " . 
C:  You know . And then you would kind of have to come up with some sort of consonant 
C:  and maybe it 's an " M " to you . 
C:  " Fff " .  Because also , I mean , " F " is " Fff " .  is , um , <vocal click> " Fff " . 
C:  Right . " Fff " .  Because it 's  
C:  Yeah , because it 's , um , bilabial too . 
C:  " Fff " .  you know , you 'll 
C:  di uh , or interl interdental , " fff " . 
C:  you know , it 's close enough , I guess , to " mmm " ,  you know . 
C:  You 're getting the closure of the lips . 
C:  So maybe that 's <laugh> what they were do getting . 
C:  I don't know . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well , maybe it 's because they don't realize that you 're supposed to sp 
C:  Do they ? 
C:  I mean , maybe they don't really realize that you 're supposed to split it up . Or something 
C:  like , they maybe think , " Well , I hear it just as clearly  
C:  I hear this other person 's voice just as clearly 

C:  and I realize it 's not Jane , 
C:  and I realize it 's not a female even , 
C:  but , um , because it 's so clear on this channel , I 'm supposed to transcribe it . " 
C:  I  I 'd imagine that 's p that might be what that is . 
C:  That 's true . They do  they do say that m men 's voices c carry better . 
C:  I mean , that 's why they use , like , I think 
C:  who was telling me ? 
C:  Ian Maddieson was talking about this , that they use male voices in , um , <mouth> in , um , airports . 
C:  Because the acoustics of it  it just fits into the hea a hearer 's range  
C:  Yeah , that 's th It fits into a hearer 's range of perception , um , better than a lot of female voices . 
C:  And so that 's why they use male voices . 
C:  We were just talking about that . 

C:  d Yeah , depending on their auditory , um , capabilities . 
C:  I mean , if their auditory capabilities , uh , have been , you know , um , squished down <laugh> like in a certain place where it would be n easier for a person with normal ,  um , hearing to hear a male 's voice , 
C:  um , like if  I 'm saying if  if they  d if they had a  some sort of , um , you know , damage to part of their brain that processes auditory information , then  
C:  and , i uh , e i u 
C:  if that part of the brain normally codes for , you know , male voices , uh , in a normal hearer ,  then they might not be able to . 
C:  You know . Does that make sense ? 
C:  Like if that part is damaged . 
C:  So , but , um  
C:  but yeah , if  I guess for most h hearers it 's just easier . 
C:  And it 's like a certain , uh , kind of , like , rough male voice too , 
C:  kind of graspy  
C:  raspy , I mean , 
C:  apparently . 
C:  Is better . 
C:  Yeah , I guess so . 
C:  It 's really interesting . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Right . Yeah . I was just saying that it , like , you know , sometimes , um , if  Remember I was saying , like , if there 's a discrepancy between fricatives , you know , like , um , " shuh "  or " suh "  will show up in a certain part of the spectrum , 
C:  and  and , uh , oftentimes the " fuh "  is like knocked out of the spectrum by  
C:  um , by filtering in some of the older phones . 
C:  And that 's why , like he 
C:  That they don't  
C:  Y right . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  I didn't get that from him , actually . 
C:  I felt like , um , he 's basically saying that for our  for all intents and purposes with this , it 's covering whatever sounds are necessary to be covered , like everything . 
C:  That 's  that 's what I th 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , I do too . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . So , like , you were saying , like  in the case of something with clipping , 
C:  does it  were you saying that , uh  it  it increases to  or , expands to accommodate that ? 
C:  Or , 
C:  no ? 
C:  Oh . 
C:  Right . Oh , OK . Yeah . 
C:  I see what you 're saying . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  Huh . 
C:  Uh  
C:  I do remember those , actually . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . I remember I had one . One with that and it was just , al all the time . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Especially if they also got louder  too ,  and they hit it , 
C:  it was just like " whoahh ! " 
C:  Yes . 
C:  Take one off , or something . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Oh , yeah . 
C:  T Yeah . 
C:  That 's true . 
C:  Right . 
C:  And otherwise you have to drag it . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I s Oh , yeah . Um , something  Um , maybe I just don't know how to do this , 
C:  but when I wanna expand a timebin back 
C:  or even forward , 
C:  I 'll use the mouse , 
C:  the middle  
C:  Oh , uh , in terms of , um , if , uh  if it 's  it 's  if it 's cut off , 
C:  like the beginning of an utterance , 
C:  I 'll move it  move the line back . 
C:  And I usually just use the mouse . 
C:  How do you do that with the keyboard ? 
C:  Oh .  y 
C:  Oh , OK . So you just do it that way . 
C:  OK . OK . 
C:  OK . To me that 's takes longer than to do it with the mouse . 
C:  Because you can just click  y 
C:  I just drag the line . 
C:  Oh yeah , that 's true . 
C:  Right , then I 'll drag it . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Ah . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yep . Yep , yep , yep . 
C:  Yep . 
C:  Yep . 
C:  Yep . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  That would be great . 
C:  I 've erased entire utterances before , accidentally . 
C:  But then when you go to type on your keyboard at home , 
C:  do you do this too ? 
C:  I 'm so scared . 
C:  Like I <laugh>  I won't hold shift down  
C:  I won't do it . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ! 
C:  I 'm just like , " What am I doing ? " 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  But then , like , I think there 's a different keyboard on 
C:  I always forget th 
C:  oh , Linguine , than on , um  
C:  No , the other one . 
C:  Amaretto . 
C:  I i 
C:  Right . And it 's  and I always use  I tend to use Linguine . 
C:  But the last couple times , like , you 've stolen Linguine before I can get to it . 
C:  So I 
C:  go onto Amaretto , 
C:  which is fine . 
C:  But then like , um , it takes me a good , like , ten minutes to get re - used to that keyboard . 
C:  And so I keep  
C:  No , it 's really OK . 
C:  But , yeah . I  I  I have noticed that I 'll screw some stuff up , like , when I 'm trying to get re - adj 
C:  The PC ? 
C:  I would vote for the PC . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Or no ! 
C:  I like the Linguine keyboard . 
C:  That 's all I know . 
C:  To the left  
C:  Yep . 
C:  Linguine is the one in the corner . 
C:  Yeah . So , basically , right as you walk in the door , the one straight ahead of you is Amaretto . 
C:  And the one to the left of that against the far corner is Linguine . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Nice . 
C:  Yeah , I could get used to it too . 
C:  i Right . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  Oh yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  That kind of makes sense 
C:  because  
C:  Yeah , i 
C:  Cuz , yeah , if the s the resolution  If it 's moving too slowly  then , like , if you were to click on some place then it makes sense that it would get kind of confused . 
C:  But if it 's moving quickly ,  seems that it 's covering more ground faster , 
C:  so  I don't know . 
C:  I usually just don't use that , I think . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  I tend to make it move fast . 
C:  Right . Right . Right . Right . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Yeah . That 's the reason I separate it out . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh , yes . 
C:  Because the , uh  the waveform becomes too stretched out . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Because  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  It 's nice to have  
C:  Right . 
C:  A sort of , like , happy medium , so you can make sure that the waveform has its , like , th g shape . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Now I know what you 're talking about . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Really ? 
C:  Oh . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  The little intricacies and idiosyncracies of people 's voices 
C:  and  
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Eah .  Depends on the person . 
C:  Yeah , that 's true . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I don't like the technical ones 
C:  cuz I don't understand what they 're talking about . 
C:  And so I 'm just  
C:  Yeah . And I 'm sitting there bored 
C:  cuz I r I really have no concept of what they 're talking about . 
C:  So I 'm going " OK . " 
C:  " I 'm just gonna listen to you . " 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  The ones with Liz , and you . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I li that 's why I like Johno . 
C:  Really ? 
C:  Oh , it 's so funny . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  That 's why I like listening to him . 
C:  He 's always making fun of transcribers . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
C:  Oh my god ! 
C:  No . 
C:  Oh ! 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  I like transcribing you 
C:  cuz you 're very polite . 
C:  No , really . 
C:  You 're always like " Well , <mouth> I was just thinking about this , 
C:  and maybe this might be if  " 
C:  I  uh , you know . 
C:  It 's just  it 's just kind of cute 
C:  because everybody 's like , " Oh . Well , OK . " 
C:  And they 'll just listen to you , you know . 
C:  They don't interrupt you , 
C:  they 're just like , " Well , OK . " 
C:  It 's kind of neat . 
C:  Right . Right . 
C:  Now I 'm  now I 'm just wondering how they 're gonna transcribe you saying that . 
C:  The " doink " . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> I know . 
C:  No ! 
C:  Joel 's like , " I am not amused . " 
C:  Aw ! 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Mm - mmm . 
C:  Oh , no . 
C:  Oh g 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  It 's interesting cuz like , um , when I 'm working late at night ,  I actually don't feel so lonely 
C:  because there 's so many voices in my head . 
C:  No , no . While I  while I 'm working here , 
C:  it 's like nine o ' 
C:  and nobody 's here except for me , 
C:  and I 'm like , " You know , I don't feel so lonely 
C:  because there are like eight people talking to me all at once " . 
C:  I 'm like , " Wow " . 
C:  Takes a long time . 
C:  Takes a long time . 
C:  Sometimes . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  One thing I noticed is that , like , 
C:  uhhh !   There was this one meeting I was transcribing , there were nine  nine speakers , 
C:  and by the end of it , I was so entirely sick of listening to the same conversation all over again 
C:  nine times in slow - mo ! 
C:  I was going nuts . 
C:  I was like , " I cannot take this anymore . 
C:  I can't listen to this anymore . 
C:  Oh my god ! " 
C:  I swear it 's like  it 's like a bad dream . 
C:  It 's like , " This is  this is keep happ this keeps happening to me " . 
C:  Oh . OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yes ! Yeah , yeah , yeah . Oh yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I still do that . I still do that . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yep . Or , like , I 'll think  
C:  No , yeah . N Yeah . 
C:  I would also be really aw aware of w how I was speaking . 
C:  Cuz I also tend  
C:  Like , we were talking about " so " . 
C:  I do that . 
C:  I 'll end utterances with " so " or " and " . 
C:  and it 'll just be a trailing off , and I 'll think , " Man . I would be such a pain in the butt to transcribe . " 
C:  Like I just , uh , I  g 
C:  yeah . 
C:  I 'll  I 'll do the same thing as you do , 
C:  and I  I 'll listen to somebody and his or her speech will be particularly idios idiosyncratic , 
C:  and I 'll go , " Wow , I just  I 'm glad I 'm not transcribing him or her " . 
C:  Right . 
C:  I 'm amazed sometimes that we manage to communicate . 
C:  You know ? <laugh> Cuz people will say just , like , you know , monosyllabic little grunts and squeaks and things , 
C:  and it means something . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yes . 
C:  Yep . Mhh . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Yeah , cuz then you know exactly what 's going on , 
C:  what the context cues are  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Maybe this is what it 's like to be blind . 
C:  No  no visual input at all . 
C:  Right . 
C:  And you get so much more aware of all of it too . 
C:  Oh wow . 
C:  That 's neat . 
C:  Huh . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  That 's true . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Indecipherable . 
C:  Machines . 
C:  Yeah , the one I kn I kn get all the time is " tsk " 
C:  It 's  it 's , uh  like I don't know how  I just transcribe it as  I say , like , " click " 
C:  and then I say , " It 's like a vocal gesture . " 
C:  Like a shrug or a vocal  some  some sort of like , " Well , there it is " . 
C:  Or , " That 's it . " 
C:  Or something like that , you know . 
C:  That  people do that one a lot . 
C:  And there was one speaker who used to do it constantly . 
C:  And after a while , <swallow> I started getting confused as to whether or not he was , like , just going " tsk - tsk - tsk - tsk - tsk " to himself , 
C:  or whether he was meaning it in conversat 
C:  Sometimes it was really obvious that he meant it as some sort of vocal cue . 
C:  But then sometimes it was more ambiguous . 
C:  Like it was tough to tell , 
C:  um , because he would just always be clicking . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Oh , OK . 
C:  Yeah , this guy does a lot of single ones . 
C:  Yeah , just kind of , um  
C:  And , uh  that 's another thing like I  I realize I do that too . 
C:  I can't remember the name actually . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Oh . Yeah , that 's a different person . 
C:  Yeah . OK , I know who you 're talking about . 
C:  But this is somebody  somebody differ 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  The one you 're talking ab 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Right . Yeah , th I was thinking the one that you just did , like " tsk " .  makes me think of the  what people would write as " tsk tsk " . 
C:  You know , like , uh , as though they 're like , you know , trying to communicate displeasure . 
C:  And so that  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  U i cu there 's  there 's at least two or three that I can think of that to me are very different . 
C:  You know , there 's like , you know , that , 
C:  and there 's like , um , you know , well , the one I did before that 's like 
C:  I don't know , like , um  Hhh . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I 'll put like a  
C:  I 'll usually put a  an exclamation point  somehow . 
C:  Like I 'll go  
C:  " Hmph . " 
C:  Oh really ? 
C:  Laugh . Right . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  That 's interesting . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  s Yeah . I was gonna say , I put  
C:  I put " breath - laugh " in the brackets when I don't know whether it 's a breath or a laugh , 
C:  which is what  I remember you telling me to do that . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  A lot of people go , 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  I guess I try to be more careful in my speech , more often . 
C:  Unless I 'm really not paying any attention 
C:  like , you know , if I 'm at a party or something , and I 'm just sort of having a good time , then it doesn't really matter , 
C:  but in n you know , normal one - on - one speech I  I think I tend to try to enunciate more . 
C:  Cuz I 've been told I mumble . 
C:  Um , and I guess I used to be worse about it . 
C:  I was told by my parents that I used to mumble a lot . 
C:  Uh , and also I  I have this sort of East Coast accent that comes in sometimes that makes it hard for people on the West Coast to understand what I 'm saying . 
C:  A lot of times like , uh , if I 'm not paying attention I 'll say something that , uh , will not really be heard . 
C:  I tend to leave off final consonants , for instance , 
C:  and people , uh , n I have to be conscious of that sometimes . 
C:  Yeah , so . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . I tend to think of a conversation that has no interruptions as being something that 's  n unnatural and forced . 
C:  Or something like a meeting where , you know , I mean everybody says  their little schpiel 
C:  and people are meant to be , you know , pretty  pretty quiet and attentive for the most part . 
C:  And then they let them finish , 
C:  and then somebody else comes in 
C:  and says something about it . 
C:  Um , 
C:  and in a n like a friendly conversation I  I notice that that 's not really true . 
C:  Like what you were saying . 
C:  Huh ! 
C:  That 's interesting . 
C:  No , not at all . 
C:  Kind of makes sense 
C:  because if you 're  if you wanna speak next , it 's almost like you got y you gotta get your foot in the door . 
C:  You gotta be the one who  you know , make sure people recognize that you 're the one who 's gonna speak next . 
C:  Oh , I see . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Oh , OK . OK . 
C:  I 'm glad you ment brought that up 
C:  because I actually  
C:  I 'm one of the culprits that puts in all the little itsy bitsy tiny sounds in the middle of everything , 
C:  because I was  
C:  because  
C:  Yeah . Cuz I was thinking , like , you 're just supposed to write down everything you hear as closely as possible . 
C:  And so , I 'm glad you said that 
C:  because , um , that actually takes a good amount of time , and like pretty strict concentration <laugh> to d to do that . 
C:  Um , 
C:  and so  
C:  I do that if it 's unintelligible , 
C:  but if I can tell something  if somebody goes " r " I 'll put an " R " . 
C:  Eh  Um , so if they go " r e m m " , I 'll go " R " " EH " " mmm " m " M " " M " . 
C:  So like I  I 've been doing that 
C:  because like that 's what I can hear . 
C:  And I 'm pretty damn sure that  
C:  sorry . Sorry ! 
C:  Sorry . Hhh ! 
C:  Sorry ! 
C:  I 'm sorry . 
C:  I feel really bad now . 
C:  Oh no ! 
C:  I 'm sorry ! 
C:  OK  
C:  Oh no , I 'm so sorry . 
C:  Oh yeah  I  I was  
C:  Ah  and then  tha Yeah , that 's wha 
C:  I 'm sorry . 
C:  I 've heard the  
C:  I 've heard the swearword version . 
C:  Remember that ? 
C:  Remember that ? 
C:  It was a while back . 
C:  I  it was a long time ago . 
C:  Yeah , and I was like , " Oah ! " 
C:  I emailed you , 
C:  I was like , " M You might wanna check this out . " 
C:  Yeah , I do remember that . 
C:  But it was very quiet . 
C:  So I can see how that would have been sort of gone over by accident . 
C:  It was just very quiet , 
C:  like kind of under the breath  kind of thing , 
C:  so that 's why it was missed . 
C:  I can understand . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh ! <laugh> I was just   I was just <laugh> saying that , um , I  I can <laugh>  I 'm pretty sure that I can tell what  exactly what sounds are being produced . 
C:  So if it 's " er " , I write an " R " . 
C:  If it 's " mmm " , I can tell it 's  
C:  Just not useful ? 
C:  Yeah ? 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Right . 
C:  So even if it 's " er " , or  
C:  Oh , you would keep " er " . 
C:  Right , right . 
C:  Right . Oh , OK . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  We add the  
C:  So that 's probably why you , like , added in that , um , thing that automatically puts in the people 's initials . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Oh yeah . 
C:  Initials . 
C:  Right . Oh yeah . 
C:  To fill in . I see . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  We did it  
C:  The time we start digits ? 
C:  OK . 
C:  I can go . 
C:  Sure .
