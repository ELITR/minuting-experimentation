F:  We have littler heads so . 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  <clears throat> 
E:  OK . So , everything 's  Oh , the microphone adjustments , we should check  Would you check the microphone adjustments , please ? 
E:  Is  is M So , is  is Marisa 's close enough ? 
G:  Everyone just talk . 
E:  We  could we look  
D:  I 'm  Yes . 
A:  Hmm ? 
E:  But , I mean , also , to get the  do  you  you  what you said about  is i is it close  ? 
G:  It doesn't really matter . 
G:  OK . Thanks . 
E:  OK . Alright . 
C:  Hello . 
B:  Hello ? 
D:  I can change it . I was just trying a new head position . 
A:  Hmm . 
E:  But this w You know , he 's , like , the expert , and I don't know exactly , uh  
G:  Hmm . And so , about a thumb and a half , maybe two thumb widths away from your mouth . So that 's a little far . And then , right near the corner . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <mike noise> 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  Oh . 
G:  " Thumb " , as in this way . 
G:  @ @ Just  just  So it should be right about there . 
A:  OK . I see . 
B:  Hello ? OK . 
G:  And then you can look on the screen , and if you see breath noise , in other words , when you 're breathing , if you see it going up and down a lot ,  then move it a little further away from  from your nose . 
C:  Hello .  
F:  Hmm . 
E:  It 's interesting .  
C:  Hello .  That 's good . 
E:  Hello ? Yeah .  
G:  OK . @ @ 
E:  <laugh> Your voice is so  is so  i it 's like , s you can see across all the channels when you talk . <laugh> It 's great . <laugh> Thanks very much . Thanks very much . Alright . 
A:  Hello . OK . Mine 's good . 
D:  OK . 
B:  Hello ? 
E:  So . Uh , welcome back . Thank you for coming . 
A:  <sniff> 


E:  Um , so , what I thought we 'd do today is pick up where we were last time and maybe , uh , go over some  
E:  some ideas about , um , 
D:  <sniff> 
E:  well , i the  return to the conventions , but I also wanted to , 
E:  uh , <laugh> share with you a couple of the 
E:  things that I 've picked up in terms of checking . And these are  uh , th these are things that came up with the tra with the Tigerfish transcripts . I 'm just doing this cuz I think it 's interesting . 
E:  OK . So , um , 
E:  I have an example <laugh> 
D:  <clears throat> 
C:  OK . @ @ Not sure . Thank you .  
E:  which  
B:  Oh , there 's  Hold on .  
E:  But , uh . <inbreath> OK . Now having said that I 'm  I 'm impressed by h 
E:  how  by how , um  
E:  well , how infrequent these  
E:  these kinds of extreme cases are . Most of the types of things that I find in checking are much  much more mild . Yeah . So  so . Do you wanna  <outbreath> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah , I mean , it 's very useful in like all senses cuz  
F:  Oh yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh , yeah . 
D:  It 's very good .  <outbreath> 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  Sometimes it doesn't pick up backchannelling , though , and so sometimes you have to , um , 
D:  No . 
F:  try to listen  there 's no visual but  
D:  Or , turn up 
F:  Yeah , you have to  the resolution , right ?  So . 
D:  Yeah . Or , like  
A:  Right . 


E:  <inbreath> um , <laugh> so there 're a couple of examples . I have one in front of you which is the one where , um , 
E:  um , 
E:  u 
E:  Leah  Leah noticed this one where I said something and , um , the 
E:  transcriber interpreted it as " twosome gruesome , uh , different sizes different this " , <laugh> and , um , actually what I meant to say was 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  um , " so you 're saying groups of different sizes , different size groups ? " <laugh> Yeah . I I  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  Whoa . 
A:  Wow !  
E:  It 's really enormously far away . Now this  this could be one of those cases where the auditory was just really bad . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  That 's what I was just thinking , or maybe it was really quiet or something ? I don't know . 
E:  Maybe very  very soft . Maybe with the microphone noise , or something from someone else , or an overlap , or  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  but they 're not usually that bad , I  I don't think . <breath> 
F:  Mm - mmm .  
E:  Then , um , I have a couple of others . So , there 's one , um  So , 
E:  the person said , " interesting idea " , but Tigerfish thought it was , " uh , just an idea " . Now that changes the meaning . 
F:  <gasp> 
C:  Right . 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  It 's interesting . 
A:  Hmm . 
F:  Right . 
E:  And then there are various ones like , um , <laugh> um , " ish decay " instead of " HTK " . 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Oh . 
D:  Ugh !  
E:  And now this one  
F:  i " Ish decay " ? 
E:  " Ish decay " . Now " ish " was in parentheses  
C:  " Ish decay . "  
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , what 's an " ish " ? 
E:  Well they  they  they were suspicious that wasn't right , but that was the closest they could come . And , you know , with  when you 're dealing with acronyms , that 's  that 's  that shows one of the problems with acronyms . Is that it 's clear if you know it , but  
F:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm .  
D:  Wow . 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  I wonder if that was someone who was  
D:  who had an accent , maybe ? 
E:  Always conceivable . I don't remember off hand . I did check the example . 
E:  And , um , 
E:  well , and this  this would be consistent . So , uh , it was transcribed as " with H " , but it was really " with age " . <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  Mmm . 
C:  Mmm . 
A:  Uh - huh .  
E:  And , uh , then there are some where actually punctuation 
E:  changes the meaning . So , this is  the these are things that Barbara show uh , found . " Spurts wouldn't be right " was what it looked like . But , actually when you listen to it , it would be " Spurts wouldn't be . Right ? " <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Hmm . 
C:  Oh . 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  Oh . 
E:  <laugh> A 
D:  That 's very subtle . 
E:  It is subtle . And yet , you know , it 's like   And instead of  instead of " and it 's " 
E:  they put " Annette 's " . 
A:  Annette 's ?  
E:  <laugh> Now this  this is interesting because it 's like , you know , we know that there 's no Annette on any of the meetings we 've ever dealt with , 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
C:  Right . <outbreath> 
E:  but , um , it 's , 
E:  you know , conceivable . And then , 
A:  Hmm . 
E:  um , 
E:  let 's see . There 's one other here I thought was interesting . 
E:  Well this was  OK , so it should have been " the quals w the  the quals slides will be fine " .  
E:  This is Jerry Feldman . 
E:  And , uh , instead it was transcribed with " the " and then an uncertain syllable " the  the " and then " all the slides will be fine " . 
F:  <inbreath> Oh . 
C:  Ah .  
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Which is interesting . And  and , you know , this was a case where the timebin was off . I wanted to bring an example where th 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Oh . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  So " all the slides " it 's w started too late . It 's another case of devoicing at the initial   Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
E:  So , I thought that was very interesting . 


E:  <inbreath> And I think that it shows , um  these sorts of things , I was thinking it would be interesting to do an analysis of these things because I think that , 
E:  um , 
E:  if  well first of all , there 's this overall point that it shows a degree to which , when you listen to speech , and when you 're just , in general , listening , probably , 
E:  but it shows espec specifically this  to this task , that it 's very constructive . You 're not going on simply the auditory there 's a huge contribution from the top - down processing , 
E:  and the  you know , e different types . You 've got the contextual information , you have syntax , you have 
D:  <clears throat> 
E:  your mastery of English , and these various things . But I think these kinds of errors , it just shows the degree which it 's not strictly an acoustic 
E:  task . 
A:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
D:  Oh , yeah . 
E:  And the other thing I think that 's interesting is , 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  the types of  
E:  the types of confusions that happen , 
E:  um , do preserve certain aspects of the stimulus . So , 
E:  the stress tends to be preserved , you know , the content word will be substituted for another content word , 
E:  and , um , 
E:  It 's  it 's not surprising that they would hear this . I 'm o I 'm often surprised by how  
E:  how plausible something can be with  without it being correct . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Because it really seems like it 's  And then often , 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  you know , i it 's , um , i there 's ex the parentheses are used , so the person knew it wasn't really a perfect match . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 


F:  Actually , that comes back to a point . 
F:  We had talked about this last week , where you were interested in " so " .  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Saying " so " at the end of something .  And sometimes that would get transcribed as  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  OK , so , let me just think of an example . Um , 
F:  OK , let 's say I say , " Well , that would be hard to do , so . " 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  OK , right ? And the way I would transcribe it , I would put that 
F:  " so that would be hard " , 
F:  comma , " so " 
F:  at the end . Cuz it 's kind of just the end of that  the  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . Would you put a period after " so " ? 
F:  Right . 
A:  You would or you wouldn't ? 
F:  " So . " 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , I would just sort of end it . 
A:  Yes . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  But then sometimes they transcribe it like " So that would be a problem " , period , 
F:  new word , like  capitalized " So " . 
C:  Oh . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
D:  Oh , like it 's a whole new utterance . Like it 's not connected . 
F:  Right . And  and it just seems to sotal totally  that  that 's not the meaning . And  and it changes the meaning , I think . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <inbreath> In a way  So , uh , let me be sure I understand . So , you 're saying  <laugh> s boy , it 's hard to ig uh , ignoi that  ignore that word . <laugh> Um , 
F:  Um  
B:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh - huh . 
E:  So y the example is , " That would be hard "  
F:  Or whatever , yeah , " that would be a problem " , whatever . Yeah . 
E:  " That 'd be a problem , " 
A:  Right . 
E:  " so . " 
F:  " So . " 
E:  And how does it change the meaning ? What 's  what are the two different meanings there ? 
F:  It seems like  because if I was just reading that 
F:  thing , I would say , 
F:  " So that would be a problem .  So . "  
E:  OK . 
F:  You know what I mean ? Th - if  if it was like , " period , capital SO " , as opposed to , 
E:  <inbreath> Oh , I see what you 're saying ! 
F:  um , " That would be a problem , so . "  
F:  " That would be a problem .  So . "  
A:  Right . 
C:  It  it  <outbreath> 
A:  I think the second one where the " so " is all by itself , it 's like , " So that would be a problem .  So . "  You know , the " so " is like 
D:  It 's like  kind of like introducing  
F:  <inbreath> Some - 
C:  Right , as though it 's leading into something else . 
A:  disconnected from the  Yeah , the first one is  like , the " so " is connected to the sentence , and  " That 'd be a problem , so . "  You know , it 's  but the next one is like 
C:  Bu  And  yeah . 
C:  I 
A:  not  not connected to " that would be a problem " . It 's like , " So . "  Yeah , less  
D:  It 's like introducing a new thing that they don't talk about . 
C:  A new subject . 
F:  Right , yeah . So  
C:  The first one , too , is more like  To me , I don't necessarily put , 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  um , like a d a p a p 
C:  a period after that " so " .  I might actually either put a dash after it depending on whether or not they got unt interrupted or something , or I would maybe even act as though they were , um , just trailing off . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
C:  So put that  those two dots after it . 
A:  I do that too . I 
C:  Um , uh , which depending on what 's going on , 
C:  like , I 'll do that . Cuz to me it sounds more like they 're trailing off . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Sometimes , though , it does sound like they ended a sentence and then I do  like sometimes it 's just like , " That 'd be hard , so " .  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
F:  Right . 
A:  You know , and but  and then ofte often it sounds like they were trying to think of something else to say , but they couldn't really , you know  And then they get interrupted and then I put a dash . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
A:  You know , but I never usually put period and then new word " so " unless it 's like , end of the sentence and then , " So . "  
D:  " What are we gonna do now , " but they don't say that . 
A:  Mmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 


E:  It 's  it 's interesting that there are so many cases . And I agree . I th I think those are very good conventions . I also like w you know , this  this whole point about how  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <clears throat> 
E:  how that y th th the fact that you 're raising this , I  li I like this example that , um , 
E:  we have 
E:  several things that are being cued by intonation , 
F:  Right . 
E:  because if  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  if that 's a f nice full falling intonational contour on " that 's a problem " , " eh , that 'll be a problem " .  
E:  then I would think that there should be a period there . 
C:  Period . Right . 
D:  Yeah .  
A:  Right . 
E:  And then especially if you 've got a pause following it , but you don't always  y these things are correlated but they 're not perfect . 
D:  Yeah .  
A:  Oh . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  That 'd be nice . 
D:  meetings in English you would have native speakers transcribing it because it  you would have more intuitions about what should be there . Even if you can't fully 
E:  I agree . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  n Yeah . 


C:  That 's another thing , is i if you 're not a native speaker of English you might not pick up , because , uh , you know , every language has different , um , intonation mappings . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . That 's always one of the hardest parts about the native speakers , is you don't know exactly like how to do the punctuation because their intonation is totally different . 
E:  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
C:  And  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Right . 
E:  You mean non - native na Non - native speakers ? Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .  
A:  I mean  Non - native speakers is what I meant . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Absolutely . Yeah , absolutely . 
C:  And also if you 're a non - native speaker transcribing it , you wouldn't necessarily <inbreath> kn uh , kn understand the conventions of English t intonation as , you know , intimately as a native speaker might . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  That 's true . 
A:  Right . Mm - hmm . 
D:  Well , I would hope they would have native speaker transcribers 
E:  Ideally , wouldn't that be something . I ideally it would be nice to have like a Spaniard t tran transcribing the   
D:  transcribing . 
D:  Oh  y yeah . 
E:  Oh , is that what you mean ? Or  
D:  No , that 's not what I meant , but that would be cool . <laugh> No , what I meant was that I would hope that , for 


D:  understand the word , you can make a guess , you can  that isn't completely off like some of these are , but they 're pretty rare  
C:  Right . 
D:  those things , the f 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <mouth> the really bad mistakes that they make are pretty rare I think , so .  
E:  I  I  OK - So , in terms of like when you 're going through the Tigerfish transcripts , you don't find a lot of these kinds of extreme cases ? 
D:  Not this  t t 
C:  Not so much . No . 
E:  OK . 
D:  I mean  
A:  Mmm , not " twosome gruesome " . <laugh> 
D:  No , not " twosome gruesome " .  
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Sometimes , but  they tend to be pretty good about parentheses . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Good . Good to hear . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah , sometimes they p they usually put them in prethen parentheses , and you think to yourself , " You were way off , but at least you knew you were way off . " <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . <laugh> 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Exactly . 


F:  Yeah . I just wonder , like , what influences them to think of " twosome gruesome " , like maybe this person just saw a horror movie or something ? And , 
E:  Good . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  uh , this is <laugh> the interpretation that came to mind or something ? 
E:  It 's  Could be . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  You know what I mean ? Like , where would you get the word " gruesome " ? 
D:  I don't know . 
F:  You know , you just sort of pull it out of the air ? Anyway . 
D:  Well , I mean , you get the " GR " from " groups " , I guess , but 
F:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  I don't know where the rest of it came from . 
A:  Uh , " groups of " , " gruesome " . 
C:  g Group .  
F:  OK . 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  " Groups of " , " gruesome " .  
A:  You 've got the , uh , " S " in the middle . 
C:  Yeah . If you  if for some reason they didn't hear the " F " , if they didn't hear the " fuh " ,  it might just sound like  Yeah , " grou " uh , " gruesuh " . 
A:  " Gruesome " . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . It 's both labial  at the end . 
F:  Mmm - hmm .  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  You know . And then you would kind of have to come up with some sort of consonant and maybe it 's an " M " to you . <laugh> 
D:  " Groups of "   
D:  <inbreath>  
D:  Well , also  
F:  Right . 
D:  " Group of , groups of , groups  of , group  s "  
C:  " Fff " .  Because also , I mean , " F " is 
A:  Gruesome  groups of  gruesome  groups of   
C:  " Fff " .  is , um , <vocal click> 
C:  " Fff " .  
D:  I wonder where the " P " went , though ? 
C:  Right . " Fff " .  Because it 's  
A:  Maybe the " P " wasn't pronounced very well , like " groups of "  
D:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah ? 
F:  " Pss " .    
C:  Yeah , because it 's , um , 
C:  bilabial too . " Fff " .  you know , you 'll 
C:  di uh , or interl interdental , " fff " .  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  you know , it 's close enough , I guess , to " mmm " ,  you know . You 're getting the closure of the lips . So maybe that 's 
D:  Nnn , I guess . 
C:  <laugh> what they were do 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  getting . I don't know . 
D:  It 's possible . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 


E:  Well , you know , there 's also this problem that they didn't have context to constrain the interpretation , cuz  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , that 's really hard , th 
E:  OK . 
A:  to not be able to go and listen to the other channels and figure out the context of what it 's occurring in . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , when I 'm clearing the par parentheses , I find that very useful . I  I  
A:  Yeah . 
E:  sometimes I try to just go through and pick up the parentheses , see if I can do it just by itself , but 
A:  <sniff> 
E:  it  it 's remarkable how sometimes something can be so totally opaque , and then you go back to , you know , the person 's previous utterance or you go to the mixed channel , or you , 
E:  uh , check on the other things and suddenly it becomes perfectly clear . It 's very  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  very surprising . 
E:  Very surprising .  
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Good . 


F:  But this other business , um , that you have at the bottom with people 
F:  getting transcribed on another channel  
E:  Yes . 
F:  is , uh  is much more common . 
D:  Is that what it 's about ? 
D:  I wasn't  I couldn't u I don't know , for some reason that didn't make sense to me . But th it 's about when things are transcribed on other channels than what they 're set on ? OK . 
F:  Right . 
F:  And what 's always funny to me is when it 's th you know , they m mi miss the gender completely , like , you know , Morgan 'll be on Jane 's channel , or just something bizarre like that . 
D:  <cough> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Um , 
B:  <sniff> 
F:  so . 
C:  <inbreath> Well , maybe it 's because they don't realize that 
C:  you 're supposed to sp Do they ? I mean , maybe they don't really realize that you 're supposed to split it up . Or something like , they maybe think , " Well , I hear it just as clearly  I hear this other person 's voice just as clearly and I realize it 's not 
C:  Jane , and I realize it 's not a female even , but , um , because it 's so clear on this channel , 
D:  I 'm supposed to do it . 
C:  I 'm supposed to transcribe it . " 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <inbreath> h  Yeah .  
C:  I  I 'd imagine that 's p that might be what that is . 
D:  They probably don't even know how many people are at the meeting , or w anything . 
E:  Yeah , it 's really a an odd task in  in a way because they 're  
E:  they have no clues at all about how dominant the speaker is on the channel they 're transcribing . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And the pre - segmenter doesn't give them any or the information eith either . I 'm  I 'm sure that it 's because of the  
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Wow . We 're  we 're really spoiled , then , with our 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Mmm . 
F:  Fancy - schmancy . <laugh> 
D:  interface here , right ? 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  I mean  
D:  s it 's 
D:  very useful . 
F:  If I was gonna make just a guess , though , from my experience it would seem like the men get mis um , 
D:  <clears throat> 
E:  Yes . 
F:  the men get moved onto other channels , maybe more frequently . And it 's just probably cuz they have deeper voices and they 're getting picked up on more channels , 
E:  <inbreath> That would make  that would make some sense . 


F:  um , than their own channel . Um , for w you know , it 's an acoustic thing . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
D:  Or they just tend to sp peak  louder , maybe ? 
C:  That 's true . They do  they do say that m men 's voices c carry better . I mean , that 's why they use , like , I think who was telling me ? Ian Maddieson was talking about this , that they use male voices in , um , 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  <mouth> in , um , 
C:  airports . 
E:  Oh ! 
C:  Because the acoustics of it  it just fits into the hea a hearer 's range  
A:  Hmm . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  For announcements and things ? 
C:  Yeah , that 's th It fits into a hearer 's range of perception , 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  um , better than a lot of female voices . 
F:  Hmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
C:  And so that 's why they use male voices . We were just talking about that . <laugh> 
D:  They should do that at BART , too , because 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  sometimes it 's hard to hear . <laugh> 
E:  I see . 
B:  And now they have those strange computerized voices that n <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  So - 
D:  Yeah . Those are  i a w actually probably just the computer problem not the gender problem . <laugh> 
A:  Hmm . 
C:  @ @  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  Huh . So  so this means that people with hearing problems would hear , uh , uh , one of these announcements 
E:  better if it were a male voice then . 
C:  d Yeah , depending on their auditory , um , capabilities . I mean , if their 
E:  Uh - huh . 
C:  auditory capabilities , uh , have been , you know , um , 
C:  squished down <laugh> like in a certain place where it would be 
C:  n easier for a person with normal ,  
C:  um , hearing to hear a male 's voice ,  
C:  um , like if  I 'm saying if  if they  d if they had a  some sort of , um , 
C:  you know , damage to part of their 
C:  brain that processes auditory information , then  and , i uh , e i u 
C:  if that part of the brain normally codes for , 
C:  you know , male voices , uh , in a normal hearer ,  then they might not be able to . You know . Does that make sense ? Like if that part is damaged . So , but , um  
E:  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Selective . 
C:  but yeah , if  I guess for most h 
C:  hearers it 's just easier . And it 's like a certain , 
C:  uh , kind of , like , rough male voice too , kind of graspy  raspy , I mean , 
F:  Hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
C:  apparently . 
E:  Is better ? Ah , it 's a wider band then . Because of  do you think it might be from the   
D:  Hmm . 
C:  Is better . 
C:  Yeah , I guess so . 


E:  <inbreath> She asked this question last time which was , um , whether 
E:  our system here , the recording system , 
E:  may have some of the same channel restr some sort of s channel restrictions , such as 
E:  they ran across when they were looking at telephone , 
E:  uh , transmissions at a certain point . Cuz , you know , telephone transmissions , um , there 's some filtering going on . You don't hear the full  the full band of frequencies . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Oh . 
A:  Right . 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  And , w uh v 
E:  I asked c a couple of people and they c 
E:  answer came back that  
C:  It 's really interesting . 
E:  It was intere an interesting  it 's reminded me because of the comment about noise , noise being sp really spreading frequencies across , 
C:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  uh , using frequencies across a broader spectrum . So in a way , bandwidth can increase with some of these cases of distortion that we have . 
D:  <clears throat> 
E:  <laugh> But it 's n it 's not 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  a useful kind of increase <laugh> in frequency range . 
C:  Right . Yeah . I was just saying that it , like , you know , sometimes , um , 
C:  if  Remember I was saying , like , if there 's a discrepancy between fricatives , you know , like , um , " shuh "  or " suh "  will show up in a certain part of the spectrum , and  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  and , uh , oftentimes the " fuh "  is 
C:  like knocked out of the spectrum by  
D:  By filtering or something ?  
C:  um , by filtering in some of the older phones . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  And that 's why , like he 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  the telephone corpora , they did run into limitations and  
E:  uh , certain types that they  when  what their speech recognition approach is because of the  of the filtering . 
F:  Hmm . 
E:  I mean it does seem like when I hear these things , except for the distortion parts , 
E:  where the volume 's too high , or th of course when the volume 's too low , but that 's a different problem , 
E:  um , except for those cases , it seems to me that 
E:  it really is as if the person were speaking in my ear . I don't feel that it 's being reduced in any way . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah , that 's what it seems like . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , I do too . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah ? 


D:  So what was the answer here ? It  that 's not the case ? 
E:  Answer ? 
E:  <inbreath> 
C:  That they don't  
E:  That they  that they don't . We don't have a reduction 
D:  Oh , OK . 
C:  Y right . 
A:  Oh .  
E:  in that direction . 
D:  Good . 
E:  That , uh , I mean , you know , one could have if one had cheaper microphones than we have , but we 've got good microphones <inbreath> and another  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
E:  there is sort of an upper limit set on our bandwidth by the sampling rate 
E:  but then that becomes  So Adam 's ans that  then it becomes a matter of , Is that something that would be relevant to perceptual range . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And , I didn't really have the sense that it would . 
C:  I didn't get that from him , actually . I felt like , um , he 's basically saying that for our  for 
E:  @ @  
C:  all intents and purposes with this , it 's covering 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  whatever sounds are necessary to be covered , like everything . That 's  that 's what I th 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Good . I  I  that was my impression also . It wa so we don't have that kind of reduction like you have on telephones . And actually in the work that they were doing with 


E:  And he was saying in the  in the , uh , areas where you have clipping , where it 's recorded too high , and  and it <laugh> starts to saturate and you have trouble , um  
C:  Right . 
E:  I thought that was very interesting . So bandwidth then gets  gets actually wider instead of narrower because you have , 
E:  um  
E:  <laugh> Uh - oh . <laugh> You have these  y y you still have  The frequencies are represented but the energy distributions are thrown off , 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  and , um , in fact you have also some additional frequencies . So you end up with a wider bandwidth functionally , I mean  
C:  Yeah . So , like , you were saying , like  
E:  But not helpful for speech . 
C:  in the case of something with clipping , does it  were you saying that , uh  it  it increases to  or , expands to accommodate that ? Or , no ? 
E:  <inbreath> No , technically , the bandwidth is wider 
E:  than  so it 's actually paradoxical in a way cuz you usually think bandwidth  better bandwidth is better . 
C:  Oh . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  But in the cases of  of distortion than you can end up with , 
C:  Right . Oh , OK . Yeah . I see what you 're saying . 
E:  uh , 
E:  a wider bandwidth which isn't useful in terms of understanding speech . 
C:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
F:  Hmm . 
E:  So . 


D:  I have a question . 
E:  Yes . 
D:  In the  <clears throat> some of the earlier meetings I guess , there was a lot of spikes , or what I called spikes . 
E:  Yes . 
D:  I was wondering what that 
D:  is . I don't even know if it 's relevant or useful to know , but I 'm just curious . 
E:  One source was , there was a problem with a connection 
E:  where the microphone went int went into a box  I was trying  trying to think of this as prior to  yes , it was prior to the wireless . There was a particular connection which wasn't wireless , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  which was , um , mechanically bad in some  some sense , and if it got touched , it would s it would send an impulse , 
D:  Loose .  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Oh . 
D:  <clears throat> 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  i in al 
E:  an uh  
E:  an irrelevant non - wanted <laugh> artifact . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  Cuz those ones sometimes were 
C:  Huh . 
D:  extraordinarily bad and pai Yeah . 
A:  Painful .  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> I agree . Absolutely painful . 
A:  They were painful . 
C:  Uh  
E:  Exa - I agree . And that 's  that 's th you know , I would watch the visual sis signal to avoid that . It 's like  <laugh>  
A:  <laugh> Oh yeah . And then you see it , and off with the headphones ! <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , and like not listen to them . <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  I do remember those , actually . 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , you could see it coming and you 'd turn the volume down or something . 
D:  Or just uh s   
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . I remember I had one . One with that and it was just , al all the time . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Or , like , skip it entirely . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Especially if they also got louder  too ,  and they hit it , it was just like " whoahh ! "  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  Y y yeah . 
E:  Oh !   
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . That 's really awful . You 've noticed that those have gotten better over the intervening  ?  Good . 
D:  Yes . Absolutely . 
A:  Oh yeah . Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yes . 
E:  <inbreath> 
F:  But sometimes you 'll see like 
F:  something coming up like , " Uh - oh . Someone 's gonna cough really loudly " , and I could tell because of the way it looks ! Or " someone 's about to laugh really loudly " , 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And so you turn it down ? 
E:  <inbreath> Oh . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . <laugh> 
F:  um  yeah , and then you 're just sort you 've got like  you know <laugh>  you 're sort of like   Yeah . So unless there 's gonna be some speech in there , I don't think I need to listen that carefully . 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm .  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Take one off , or something . <laugh> 
D:  No , a I think  
B:  Hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  I think that 's really important . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , I think that 's really important because I generally have the volume turned up 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So . 
D:  to above normal volume just so I can hear more clearly , and if it 's like that for someone screeching into the microphone than it would be really painful . 
A:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  Right .  
F:  You could h really hurt your ears . Yeah . 
D:  I think you could , yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  I think so too . Yeah , I  
F:  Oh , yeah . So . 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah , that 's  
D:  Especially  we have really good headphones , like  
E:  when I realized  
E:  yeah , when I realized , I  I meant to tell everyone to watch that visual signal cuz that 's  
D:  <laugh> 
E:  that 's saved me a bunch of times . 
F:  Gives some good clues , yeah . 


E:  It might be useful to  to talk about the interface for  for a bit , in terms of what it is that you like particularly , and what you don't , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  and , uh , that kind of thing . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  But , um  
D:  Uh , 
E:  One thing that you learn with this interface right away is that if you have really , really , really long utterances , it 's extremely inefficient to do anything . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  Because you end up  
E:  p p p 
E:  if you try to n 
E:  go up in the transcript , you end up with this huge  huge space of time and things covering several screens and it 's just horribly 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yep . 
F:  <inbreath>  
D:  Yeah .  
A:  Yeah .  
E:  i inefficient , so . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 


A:  You know what I would think would be a really n um , neat feature for the interface ? 
A:  Some sort of backwards tab where it could go backwards without you having to 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  Ooh , interesting . 
A:  go up and do it manually , and , you know , press the button and " juh - juh - juh - juh - juh - juh - juh " .  Cuz if you miss something  and you wanna go back to it , it 's such a  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  T Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  That 's true . 
A:  such a hassle . It 'd be so nice if there was just some sort of like , you know , 
A:  uh , opposite of tab that you could hit , that it would just sort of move backwards . There wouldn't even have to be any , um  
F:  Hmm . 
D:  But it would play it backwards too . 
A:  I know . It w you wouldn't even have to have the audio . That 's not  I wouldn't  I mean  
D:  But just to move back , but not necessarily a whole timebin ? 
F:  Just to jump it back . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  Interesting . 
F:  Right , cuz sometimes you 'll hear  It 'll be in  right in the middle of the timebin , and you don't have to listen to the whole thing again cuz you 've already gotten the first part . 
E:  Hmm . 
C:  Right . 
A:  Right 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  Oh yeah . Yeah . 
F:  So you just want it to go back , 
F:  I don't know  
A:  Yeah , some  
C:  And otherwise you have to drag it . 
A:  Yeah , some timebins are humongous , and 
D:  Or otherwise , drag it , or like click on it . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  if you miss it , you know , you 've gotta go back and find it , and 
E:  <clears throat> 
C:  Right . 
A:  dragging it and looking for it and you may not be able to see it , even . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  You know ? 
F:  That 's true . 
D:  I think that would be useful . 
F:  Hmm . Yeah .  
A:  Yeah . 
E:  Interesting idea . I 'll  I 'll s I 'll suggest that to the charer . 


F:  Yeah , the less you have to click on the mouse , I think the faster you could go . 
D:  Yeah , because I noticed I started feeling like I was getting some sort of carpal tunnel issues . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah , you were having some wrist problems and stuff , right ? 
D:  Much better now that I have the keyboard st tray , but it was  
F:  Yeah . 
D:  I think cuz I had my hand in one position using it all the time . 
A:  Mmm . 
D:  And that I would  it would crack  a lot . It was very weird . 
F:  Yeah . Ooh ! 
B:  Mmm . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  But .  
C:  Yeah .  
E:  That 's  it 's good to be careful about the mousing . You were gonna say ? 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath-laugh> Yeah . 
D:  Oh . Do you drag  do you drag the line ? See , I never  I never do that for some reason . 
A:  Oh really ? 
C:  Because you can just click  y I just drag the line . 
A:  I don't do that either . 
B:  I didn't n even  even know you could do that . <laugh> 
E:  I vary . I  I should  it depends on how much I wanna go back and how certain the boundary is . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  If I can see it  if it 's  if I can see this thing 's coming up and it 's just so clear , it 's that mountain right there , I can tell , 
C:  Oh yeah , that 's true . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Right , then I 'll drag it . Y 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  then  yeah , dragging is really f efficient . But if it 's like a mess in there , then it helps me to be able to locate it with 
D:  <breath> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <breath> 
E:  the actual clicking . 
C:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <mouth> Right . 
F:  Mmm .  
B:  Mmm . 
E:  And then do this  what th you were just describing . 


C:  I s Oh , yeah . Um , something  Um , maybe I just don't know how to do this , but when I wanna expand a timebin back  
E:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  or even forward , I 'll use the mouse ,  the middle  
C:  <mouth> <outbreath> 
E:  How do you mean " expand " ? What do you mean by " expand " ? 
C:  Oh , uh , in terms of , um , 
C:  if , uh  if it 's  it 's  if it 's cut off , like the beginning of an utterance , I 'll move it  move the line back . And I usually just use the mouse . 
E:  OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Oh . I see what you 're saying . <breath> 
E:  OK . OK . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mmm . Really ? Oh , I do that with the keyboard .  
C:  How do you do that with the keyboard ? 
D:  Well , I would press " tab " and listen to where I wanted it to stop , and then press " return " , create a new timebin , 
F:  I do that with the mouse , yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . " Return " and then  
C:  Oh .  y 
D:  and then " shift "  " shift " , what is it ? " Shift " , " backspace " to c collapse it , yeah . 
A:  and then " shift " " backspace " . That 's  that 's what I do , yeah . I do it all on the keyboard . 
C:  Oh , OK . So you just do it that way . OK . OK . 
F:  Oh . 
C:  OK . To me that 's takes longer than to do it with the mouse . 


D:  Um , one thing that 's gotten me into problems a little bit is having 
D:  the " shift - backspace " as the collapser .  
C:  Ah . Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Because I 'll tend to delete things , or go too far , or something , or I 'll be holding down " shift " because I wanna type something as a capital , and then end up collapsing the timebins . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Ni - 
A:  Mm - hmm . <laugh> 
F:  Oh yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yep . Yep , yep , yep . 
A:  And  and then collapse it . I did that so much . <laugh> 
C:  Yep . 
C:  Yep . 
D:  So , it might be better to 
E:  Oh that 's annoying ! This  if I were to  
C:  Yep . 
D:  use a different keys or something . 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  if I were to add an option , it might be to have an undo for that . 
B:  Oh , that 'd be good . That would be good . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . Yeah ! 
E:  Because I have had that happen .  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . That would be nice . 
C:  That would be great . I 've erased entire utterances before , accidentally . 
D:  Or just , I mean  
E:  Yeah , s Good . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  but , or just to change the keys used , you know , for  for that option . 
A:  Yeah . I 'm rather used to it now , though . Yeah . 
D:  I 'm used to it too , but , I mean  
E:  <clears throat> 
C:  But then when you go to type on your keyboard at home ,  
A:  Mm - hmm . <laugh> You 're so scared , yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  do you do this too ? I 'm so scared . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  To  to hold shift down while you 're backspacing ?  
C:  Like I <laugh>  I won't hold shift down  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Like  Yeah .  
C:  I won't do it . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  You 're typing capitals , and you 're backspacing , and you 're like 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ! <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  " <mock gasp> Oh , take the shift off ! I 'll collapse everything ! " <laugh>  
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  I 'm just like , " What am I doing ? " <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  I totally do that now . <laugh> 
D:  I don't think I 'm that bad , but  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , yeah . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 


F:  Oh yeah , I do find that the keyboard is different here than it is even at my s for my school computer and so I 'll al I 'll just be  
E:  Mmm . 
F:  if I was just at school , and I come here , it 's just  
A:  Oh yeah . 
F:  or vice versa it 's just , uh  it 's like 
A:  Or vice versa , yeah . 
F:  I 'll  I 'll reach for one key and it 'll do something completely different , and I have to just get used  just get used to it again  Yeah , the backspace is in the wrong place . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Uh - huh . <laugh> 
A:  Th - that backspace and the little  
A:  and the  th yeah , that little evil <laugh> apostrophe that keeps showing up . " I don't want you ! " <laugh> 
B:  The little accent thingy . 
B:  Right . 
D:  Yeah , I do that too . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Oh yeah , and then I 'll keep  I keep caps - locking too cuz the caps - lock 's in a different spot . 
E:  Oh . 
A:  Oh , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <inbreath> Oh . 
F:  So . 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  How do you get per I don't know the evil apostrophe . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Um , <laugh> yeah , it 's one of the backspaces on the keyboards that most of us are probably used to . So you wanna backspace and you get apostrophe , apostrophe , apostrophe , apostrophe . Yeah , t you 're like , " No ! " 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  It 's just th right above the  backspace . 
F:  Th - 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  <inbreath> Oh , oh ! 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Mmm . 
E:  I see . 
F:  Oh ! Yeah , I do that all the time . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . So this is the difference between the PC keyboard and the SUN keyboard ? So , like I only have one  I have one versus two of the others . Is that right ? So it 's  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  I think so . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Did it  
D:  Right . 
A:  Right . I  I 'm used to it now too . 
D:  I 'm actually used to  
D:  I 'm used to the SUN one , I guess , now . 
E:  OK . 
C:  Yeah .  <inbreath> But then , like , I think there 's a different keyboard on 
C:  <outbreath> <mouth> I always forget th oh , Linguine , than on , um  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  There 's  
E:  Basmati ? 
C:  No , the other one . 
E:  Amaretto ? 
C:  Amaretto . 
E:  OK . 
C:  <inbreath> I i 
D:  Amaretto has a different one . Linguine is  Basmati have the same . 
C:  Right . And it 's  and I always use  I tend to use Linguine . 
D:  Right ? 
C:  But the last couple times , like , you 've stolen Linguine before I can get to it .  <laugh> So I go onto Amaretto , which is fine . But then like , um , it takes me a good , like , ten minutes to get re - used to that keyboard . And so I keep  
D:  <laugh> Ooh ! <laugh> 
F:  <gasp> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  I don't know . You seem very upset about it , so . We  maybe we should trade . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> No , it 's really OK .  
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  But , yeah . I  I  I have noticed that I 'll screw some stuff up , like , when I 'm trying to get re - adj 
E:  S so which t I  I 've forgotten which one is which . So , which one do you 
D:  But just the beginning . 
A:  I 'm  
E:  But , um , 
E:  OK . 
E:  That 's good . 


E:  prefer ? Is it  is it the  So , if we had a show of hands , how many people would vote for the SUN keyboard 
A:  OK . 
E:  versus the  So let 's put it the other way . How many people would not vote for the SUN keyboard ? 
E:  Would vote for the other one ? The PC  PC keyboard ? 
D:  Which is the  
C:  The PC ? I would vote for the PC . 
A:  The PC one ? 
D:  The PC one is the Amaretto one , right ? 
E:  I don't know . I don I 'm not sure . It 's the  
C:  Yeah . Or no !  
F:  Huh . 
A:  I I 'm not sure which one is which . 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  <clears throat> Uh - oh . 
F:  I just get used to it . So . 
C:  <click> 
A:  Yeah . I mean like , when I first had started working I would have definitely wanted the PC keyboard , but now I 'm  I 'm just used to it . 
C:  I like the Linguine keyboard . <laugh> That 's all I know .  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  The Linguine is  OK . 
E:  You 're multi - keyb 
D:  I prefer th I prefer the one on Linguine or Basmati . I don't know what it 's called . 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  OK , let 's do it that way . So  so if we  if we have a map of the room , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  the one when you first walk in  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Is Basmati .  
D:  Oh . 
C:  To the left  
E:  the one on the left is that Basmati ? OK . 
B:  By the light switch , yeah . 
C:  Yep . 
F:  I believe that 's correct , yeah . Linguine must be the one in the left - hand corner . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  And  
A:  It 's the one in  in that corner , right ? That  that has the PC  
C:  Linguine is the one in the corner . 
D:  In the c 
D:  Yeah , the one in the  
E:  And then the f the far right corner as you walk in ? 
A:  Yeah , r Yeah , that 's  that one 's got the  the PC keyboard , and then the two on those sides have the , um , SUN keyboard . 
C:  Yeah . So , basically , right as you walk in the door , the one straight ahead of you 
A:  Right . 
E:  Yep . 
C:  is Amaretto . 
E:  U u 
F:  Hmm . 
C:  And the one to the left of that against the far corner 
E:  Good . 
C:  is Linguine . 
E:  OK . 
F:  Hmm . 
E:  And the one close to you is Basmati . OK . So now , ha ha who would 've  So , 
D:  Yeah .  
C:  Right . 
A:  Yes . 
E:  if you have a strong  Now you 're bi - keyboardal  so , 
A:  Uh , yeah . <laugh> 
E:  s but  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Nice . 
E:  but , um , 
E:  who  who would prefer the keyboard on Linguine ? 
E:  OK . We got two votes for Linguine . And who would prefer Amaretto ? 
E:  Amaretto ? So we got more  more multi - keyboardal people ? 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  Ready . 
F:  I just have no preference . 
E:  Well , that 's lovely . Same here ? Excellent . OK , so i 
B:  Yeah , it doesn't really matter . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  It just goofs me up for like maybe a minute and then I sorta get used to it . 
A:  Exactly , exactly . 
D:  I  I I could get used to  I could get used to it too . 
C:  Yeah , I could get used to it too . 
E:  OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  I just am very used to  
F:  Huh . 
C:  i Right . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  I don't know . Cuz I always use it . 
E:  I pr I see . I  I have experienced this keyboard conflict , and f with me the things that are confusing are th where the control key is , so I end up 
F:  <inbreath> 
D:  Mmm . 
E:  pressing shifts and control keys whenever I want the other one , whiche whichever it is . 
A:  Oh , that 's true .  I forgot about that one , yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
C:  Oh . 
F:  Mmm .  
B:  Mmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  I could easily put a PC keyboard in there if anyone had  I  we already have one , I could add ane another one  we  so , w 
A:  Right . 
E:  you know , maybe  let me know if you want it  to have it shifted . 


E:  Oh , let me see . So , um , <laugh> I  I wanted to , 
E:  um , m maybe comment a little more on the interface in terms of what aspects of it are helpful in this , and one thing that I 've 
E:  really been surprised by is how 
E:  unique the shapes of some of these things are . I know we had this interface for a time when people were doing marking of the numbers , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  and , um , 
E:  um , 
E:  I 've forgotten  Someone said that they could recognize a seven when they saw it . They could see the  the waveform and  " Oh , it 's gonna be a seven . " Becau - 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh wow . 
C:  Oh yeah .  
D:  I  I remember recognizing certain numbers . I don mmm , I don't remember which 
D:  ones , but I think it was maybe  
D:  well , I could recognize when there was a fricative at the beginning of a number for some reason . It was like , a little bit of energy , or some whatever you call it , and then it grew really big . So like " four " and " five " 
D:  and " three " all had this same characteristic , and " six " 
D:  and " seven " o both had the same characteristics to their  in the beginnings . But " six " and " eight " ?  
A:  Hmm . 
D:  " Eight " ,  um , I remember 
D:  tended  that people tended to not pronounce the 
D:  last " T " . 
E:  Oh . 
D:  And when they did , it was slightly 
D:  farther away from the rest of the word than you would have es expected . Same with " six " . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  The " X " , well the " KS " or whatever , at the end . But   Yeah . 
F:  Hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  That was a  
D:  that was really interesting to notice that . 


D:  It 's a very different interface , though . I mean , it seems very 
E:  Mm - hmm . It is different . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  strange . 
E:  Well , it w it would  it had the benefit 
E:  of it  So , this  this was to handle the digits , uh , only , which is what you figure . And , um , did you  I thought you might have done that , Joel . Did you also ? So , two people did that , i 
A:  OK . 
A:  Nn - nnn .  No . 
E:  um , I thought . 
F:  I did it a little . 
E:  Did you do it ? I thought so . Good , good . OK . 
F:  Just a little bit . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I only did it a little bit , too . 
F:  Yeah , what happened to that , you just stopped doing it ? Or  ?  
E:  Well , I think that we 'll bring it back .  
E:  @ @ 
F:  Oh , OK . 
E:  The  th 
A:  This was a different interface entirely ? 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Uh , Adam wrote this as  uh , using the same , uh , computer language as Channeltrans is written in , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  and what it would do is present you with the digit string that the person was supposed to have said , 
E:  and then you would listen to it , and everyth the j 
E:  there were two parts to the task , one of them was to see if that 's what they actually said , 
E:  and to indicate , you know , in the  i transcribe errors of it . And then the other aspect was to tighten the timebins . 
C:  Mmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
E:  And those data were actually used in some analyses which showed 
F:  Right . 
E:  uh , very  very good results . 
F:  Good . 
A:  Oh wow . 
E:  And so it shows , I mean  it 's  it 's useful . This is  this is why we do these digits . It 's a nice standard task , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  and you have lots of different voices , 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  and it 's very clear . <laugh> You know what the canani canonical answer is when a person says a number , 
E:  um , at least most of the time , you know what number it was they said . So its 
A:  Right . 
E:  " ground truth " , as they call it , is very clear . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
C:  Right . 
E:  So . <inbreath> 
E:  But i  it was , um , really rather minimal . I mean , I  I like that interface . Very efficient , and really is , um  
E:  I th think that we 'll probably use it for getting the digits refined in terms of their timebins . 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  If I remember correctly , it seemed to be very efficient in the key strokes that you used 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  to do certain things . I can't remember what they were , now , but I just remember that it was  once you learned them , it was very 
D:  neat and concise and , th like  
E:  Excellent . 
D:  couple keys that you used . 
F:  Yeah the hardest thing 'd be finding them . 
D:  Hmm ? 
F:  Cuz I would get the whole tr I 'd get the whole transcript of the meeting and you had to find them . You 'd have to find where the digits were .  
E:  <gasp> Oh , that 's right ! 
A:  <laugh> Oh wow . 
D:  Oh . 
F:  And they 'd usually be at the end somewhere , but you had to fig figure out where the heck in the meeting to  to look for them , so . 
C:  <mouth> Oh . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  I also think that  wasn't this a stage where some of these meetings hadn't been transcribed , so I don't think you could use a string search , right ? I mean , I was trying to remember how that worked . 
D:  Yeah .  
A:  Mmm . 
E:  But it was difficult finding them for some reason . 
F:  Yeah ! 
D:  Yep . 
E:  Well , y it was also , like you  
F:  Yeah , the interface was different . I  I  yeah , it was  
F:  it was more complicated . But anyway , than what it would be now , so . 
E:  That 's a down side .  
E:  Mm - hmm . 


E:  <inbreath> Actually , you  you also did a different type of transcription i uh , with res respect to , um , 
E:  our sister project , the SmartKom project , which involved listening to people 
E:  who were supposed to be wandering through Germany , and this is s supposed to be something that would be useful in developing an interface to help them find their way . 
A:  Oh , right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  So , um  someone else did that too , I 've forgotten who  who else did that ? Did anybody else here do that ? 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> <outbreath>  
E:  OK . 
D:  I feel like I did a little 
D:  checking or something on that . 
E:  Actually , I think you might have done this also , as I think about it . 
D:  Yeah . I don't know  I don't remember actually transcribing it , but I remember listening to  
E:  Oh . <inbreath> 
E:  Mm - hmm . So actually we started with the words and it was a matter then of trying to find the most efficient way to match the words up with the s with the actual sounds . Cuz they were reading from a script . 
A:  Yeah .  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
C:  Mmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm .  
E:  And then there was some conversation in addition , that  that , um , needed to be transcribed . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  But , um , 
E:  yeah . 


D:  One thing that I still can't figure out with the interface , 
D:  it does this sometimes but other times it doesn't ,  
D:  is when you click on  
D:  you know , there 's a bar above where this sound wave is , that has , um , 
D:  n the  it has a little bar of where the meeting is , like in  
E:  Yes . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  and it goes along as you 're listening to the meeting and then it ends up the end .  And if you click on that bar to 
D:  the right of that little marker then it moves forward , if you click on the left it moves back . But sometimes it moves two 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mmm . 
D:  frames  or two screens ,  and sometimes it doesn't .  
E:  Oh yes . Mm - hmm . I 've noticed that . 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  I think that 's totally dependent w on how you have the resolution set . So that little tiny thing . 
D:  Really ? 
E:  And if I increase the resolution so it 's spread out a bit more , then I seem to have more control over it . 
D:  OK . 
E:  But , I don't have  
A:  Mmm . 
D:  Cuz I noticed that a few times it would do it  it would move twice 
C:  That kind of makes sense because  Yeah , i 
E:  Yes . 
D:  and then in  n sometimes i it wouldn't , and maybe i maybe I had resolution set differently or I s 
C:  Cuz , yeah , if the s the resolution  If it 's moving too slowly  
C:  then , like , if you were to click on some place then it makes sense that it would get kind of confused . But if it 's moving quickly ,  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  seems that it 's covering more ground faster , so  I don't know . 
E:  I 'm gonna report that to him , cuz I  I 've  I know  that 's one of the reasons why , when I 
E:  uh  
E:  suggested to visual scan the record , that I suggested doing it by 
E:  clicking on the right of the  of that navigation bar you 're mentioning . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Or , actually , clicking on the right of the sound wave and then letting it run past the boundary , because I had the same problem . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That 's what I tend to do , is I use a soundwave , but if I 'm trying to scan through a long period of what appears to be silence 
E:  It 's  
E:  cuz you always know  
E:  Yes . 
E:  Yeah , much more  Mm - hmm . 
D:  sometimes I 'll s 
D:  ry and be sc try to scan it , but I can't because 
E:  Cuz you end up missing entire frames .  Ye - I was surprised by that . Yeah . 
D:  it skips . Yeah . So then I end up clicking on the arrow , they have the arrow at the far right ,  
E:  Yes , OK . OK . 
D:  and so I use that sometimes . 
E:  So , on the  on that  on that bar you were describing . Clicking  
D:  Yeah . Mm - hmm . At the far right and far left there 's a little arrow that 
E:  OK . 
A:  I didn't know about that . 
D:  allows you to go like second by second or something , I don't know . Not second by second , but little bit by bit , yeah . 
A:  Really ? 
E:  So , is this the arrow on the right , it would be underneath that little resolution bar ? 
A:  Oh . 
D:  <clears throat> 
E:  I mean , it 's like in that u cluster up there ? 
D:  Um , it 's not on the resolution part . It 's where you have  
D:  it 's where you have the marker of where you are in the meeting . So you have this bar , uh , and then you have a time marker that 
D:  moves along . Say , you 're halfway through the meeting , it 's gonna be halfway along the line . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  I have to do something visually .  So , my  
E:  I would say you have  
E:  the transcript screen , 
E:  and then you have a bar . I think you 're referring to this bar , aren't you ? And then there 's like this little resolution changer . 
D:  I think  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . It 's  Yeah . 
E:  And then down here you have the soundwave , and then something down here , and then you got the cha the different channels come out . 
D:  Exactly . 
A:  Oh . 
D:  So right at the right and left of that  
E:  So r right in here you have this bar that you move and as y as you go along it  OK , so , is  Are you saying  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh that ! Yeah . 
E:  you saying that there 's an arrow right here ? 
D:  Yeah ! 
E:  OK . And then there 's an arrow right here ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  So you can @ @  
D:  Exactly . 
A:  Oh . Does  
A:  That doesn't  
C:  I usually just don't use that , I think . 
A:  Yeah , that skips  Oh , is that what you 're talking about ? If you use that  I 've never used  
C:  Oh .  
B:  Mmm . 
A:  been able to use that cuz it  I s feel like it skips such huge 


D:  Maybe we have resolution set totally different . Cuz I noticed when  Jen and I have totally different resolutions , cuz hers 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  portions . Maybe we do . 
E:  <inbreath> 
C:  I tend to make it move fast . 
D:  moves so much quicker than mine , 
A:  Oh , I d I  I  Yeah , I wouldn't  
D:  which means it 's more stretched out , right ? 
A:  I wouldn't use that unless I was trying to get to a whole 
C:  Right . Right . Right . Right . 
D:  Yeah . I usually have it set to where it has , um , 
A:  different part of the  
F:  Right . That 's when I use it too . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  point five second intervals on the numbers . 
C:  Hmm . 
E:  Oh . That 's interesting . I haven't paid attention to the numbers . I sort of like  visually , i 
E:  it helps me to have it be separated enough that I could find a new breaking point if I needed it . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . That 's the reason I separate it out . 
D:  Yeah . I  
A:  <inbreath> Right . 
C:  Yeah .  
D:  I do too , but sometimes if it gets too  
D:  too  for me too stretched out , um , I 'll tend to think that 
E:  Expanded ? 
D:  there 's a break in between 
D:  a pause inside of a word or something .  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Oh , yes . 
D:  I don't know . 
C:  Because the , uh  the waveform becomes too stretched out . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . Because  Yeah . 
D:  So I prefer it to be a little bit tighter , but I 'll stretch  I 'll stretch it in a particular place if I need to , or something . 
C:  It 's nice to have  Right . 
C:  A sort of , like , happy medium , so you can make sure that the waveform has its , like , th g shape . Yeah . 
A:  Uh , right . Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Now I know what you 're talking about . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That 's kind of interesting , though . 


D:  <sniff> 
E:  Well , we 're coming kind of close to the end of our time here . Um , 
E:  I did ask about dessert and they told me it was ice cream and it doesn't save well , so . <laugh> I mean  
A:  Oh .  
D:  Well if there 's any left we can grab it . 
E:  <laugh> That 's right .  
F:  If there was pie again , if there was those tarts again , 
D:  Ooh , those were good . 
A:  Hmm . 
F:  I 'd be like , " Set us some aside some there . " But  
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , there 's some  Those are  those are nice . 
F:  I 'm not a big ice cream fan . 
C:  Really ? Oh . 
F:  Nah . 
A:  No ?  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 


E:  But I did  I was thinking i you know , it is interesting to me to think about how each  each of us have sampled different meetings , and 
E:  yet , 
D:  I don't know . 
A:  Oh , thank you . 
A:  <inbreath> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> It was fun . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . Cool ! 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  You know , I 'm really interested in this topic . Would it be a problem if we continued a little bit longer on this ? Or do you need to g do people need to leave . I don't wanna keep you longer than  Are we OK ? 
C:  Mm - mmm .  
A:  I 'm fine . 
B:  I can stay . 
D:  I don't have to be anywhere until five , so . 
F:  Sure . 
E:  Oh , OK . We won't be that long , I don't think . But  but I really appreciate it . 
F:  No . 
D:  Good . <laugh> 
F:  Sure . 
A:  OK . 
E:  This is just really i it 's so interesting to me , the  
E:  the specific experiences of  of having 
E:  encountered these data in this way . 
E:  Does , um  Did anybody else wanna say anything about  
E:  It is true that this is kind of an artificial and i um , 
E:  discourse c aspect , the mixed channel is artificial because we 're boosting it in order to make everything audible . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  It 's interesting cuz like , um , when I 'm working late at night ,  
B:  Hmm . 
E:  But  
C:  I actually don't feel so lonely because there 's so many voices in my head .  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  You mean when you leave here ? When you 're somewhere else ? 
C:  No , no . While I  while I 'm working here , it 's like nine o ' clock and nobody 's here except for me , and I 'm like , " You know , 
E:  No , no . OK . 
C:  I don't feel so lonely because there are like eight people talking to me all at once " . <laugh> I 'm like , " Wow " . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh , yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh , OK . 
C:  Oh . OK . 
A:  Mmm . 
C:  I 'm amazed sometimes that we manage to communicate . 
D:  Yeah ! 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Actually . <laugh> 
F:  <laugh-breath> 
C:  You know ? <laugh> Cuz people will say just , like , you know , monosyllabic little grunts and squeaks and things , and it means something . 
D:  I think that shows a lot of  I think that shows a lot of how , um , 
D:  it 's not all acoustic . I mean , there 's other things involved ,  eye contact , body language , gesture , whatever . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
D:  Hmm .  
D:  Which is a very  it 's  that 's how I tended  
E:  That 's right . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  <clears throat> 
E:  OK , well , let 's see , 


E:  i i it 's intriguing to me to think that if I were to describe someone 's characteristics in terms of their speech patterns , I bet you , 
E:  we would all agree on who it  who it was . You know . I think that 's so interesting . 
C:  Mm - hmm .  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , it 's  it 's a statement of speaker style , of course , but . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And also that we can  
D:  I don't know , that we have this shared realm of knowledge , kind of , and 
D:  can laugh about things that other people would not understand whatsoever , or  You know ? 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  The little intricacies and idiosyncracies of people 's voices and  
D:  Yeah . Yeah . I mean , i it 's really cool . 
D:  Yeah , or even just about what we were talking about with the technical part , you know , the interface . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 


E:  Do you have a favorite group that you  that you like ? I don't  I don't wanna cause any partisanship here , but  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Wait , a favorite what ? 
E:  A  a fav a favorite t type of meeting that you like , or , um  
F:  Oh , you mean like , eh , meeti like  like , um , 
E:  or  
F:  Meeting Recorder as opposed to EDU as oppo Like , those groups ? 
E:  It  whichever . I that way or  or a nature of a meeting , or  
F:  Oh . 
D:  I think it 's funny when there 's little side conversations like that , that happen at the same time too . I think those are interesting . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  I don't know . <sniff> 
A:  Yeah . 


E:  Do you have any favorite parts of these meetings ? Things that you  I mean , we di we talked briefly about this last time . 
F:  When people get really loopy , and start telling lots of 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
F:  jokes , I think . <laugh> I enjoy always transcribing those sections . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath> Is this  do you think this is usually toward the end of the meeting , or does it vary ? Cuz it could  
F:  It 's  yeah , it seems to be more at the end . 
C:  Eah .  Depends on the person . 
E:  The  the person   <laugh> 
B:  Or in the beginning , the very beginning . 
F:  Like  
D:  Yeah , in the very beginning . Yeah .  
F:  Yeah , yeah . Yeah , they 'll be joking around . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
C:  Yeah , that 's true . 
D:  Yeah . 


D:  I prefer ones that are somewhat linguistically related , cuz it 's more interesting for me . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . I like those . 
C:  I don't like the technical ones cuz I don't understand what they 're talking about . And so I 'm just  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Exactly . And it 's f really hard t t 
C:  Yeah . And I 'm sitting there bored cuz I r I really have no concept of what they 're talking about .  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  So I 'm going " OK . "  <laugh> " I 'm just gonna listen to you . " 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
A:  M yeah , the ones that  where they 're talking about linguistic things , though , are great . I love those . I like those  
C:  <mouth> Yeah . 
D:  I  
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Those are th E - would these be the EDU meetings ? That 's what I think . Is that true ? 
C:  The ones with Liz , and you . 
A:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
E:  Oh , really ? OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . You guys do some in the mee in the Meeting Recorder ones , there 's some talk of , 


D:  D d I don't know , discourse stuff . I think it 's really fun too to listen to when you give reports on transcription . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Oh , I I 'm  really ? Oh , I 'm glad . 
D:  Yeah . Cuz there are always people like , 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  you know , talking bad about the transcribers , and just making fun of u And so it 's really funny , I don't know . It 's really funny to listen to . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I li that 's why I like Johno . 
F:  I 've never heard anyone make fun of transcribers . No ! 
D:  You haven't ? <laugh> It 's really funny . <laugh> 
C:  Really ? Oh , it 's so funny . Yeah . 
E:  Oh , Johno does a lot of that . 
F:  When you guys were saying that last week , I was like 
C:  That 's why I like listening to him . He 's always making fun of transcribers . 
F:  " Never heard that . " 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <mouth> 
E:  It would be a kick  Yeah , in a  uh , in a good - natured way @ @ . It would be really fun to have a collage of all these things , like , " Well , the transcribers  " so , " Rer - rer - rer - rer "  
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  and then s be some horrible thing , " The transcriber 's gonna have trouble with this . @ @ " <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . <laugh> 
E:  Did you hear the meeting where the guy was doing , um , clicks like from African languages ? Wasn't that a kick ? 
F:  Yes . 
D:  No !  
A:  Oh my . 
C:  Oh my god ! No . 
B:  <gasp> 
F:  I did that . 
E:  That was really a kick . 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  And whistles .  
C:  <laugh> 
F:  He was  it  I  you must have been sittin There was a meeting where there was this guy , he was making these funky sounds and making funny whistles , 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yep . 
F:  and you must have been sitting next to him cuz you sort of engaged him in a conversation about it . 
E:  I was . Exactly . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Exactly so . Exactly . 
F:  And he was like , " Yeah , I can make dogs , uh , raise their ears <laugh> cuz I can whistle so high . " 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Exactly ! <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Wow . 
F:  And you were like , w " That 's fascinating . " <laugh> I remember that meeting . I thought it was pretty funny . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 


D:  And I think it 's really cool when people 
D:  start getting really excited about something or angry about something because then they tend to 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  interrupt each other a lot , and  
D:  I don't know . I mean , I remember one where 
D:  one person , um , was really trying to get something out , really , really desperately , and he kept getting interrupted by like three p three other people , and he was like , 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  " I I I I I I I I I " <laugh> And it was  I mean it was 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Oh !   
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  kind of sad but it was , like , also really interesting to watch ,  or to listen to . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Both . 
E:  Have  have you noticed that sometimes you have these 
E:  a  a g g greater frequency of speech errors , I think , during times of inter of overlap which  which is  you can just tell a person 's m monitoring at two levels and it 's  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  They 're like just trying really hard to get it out before they get interrupted or something , and it just n 
E:  it 's difficult . 
C:  Right .  
D:  falls apart . 


C:  I like transcribing you cuz you 're very polite .  
E:  Oh , thank you ! <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> No , really . You 're always like " Well , <mouth> I was just thinking about this , and maybe this might be if  "  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  I  uh , you know . <laugh> It 's just  it 's just kind of cute because everybody 's like , " Oh . Well , OK . " 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  And they 'll just listen to you , you know . They don't interrupt you , they 're just like , " Well , OK . " <laugh> It 's kind of neat . <breath> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Yep . 
E:  Thank you . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  <outbreath> Hmm . <outbreath> 


E:  Let 's see . Have you noti th one of the things that I found is  is , 
E:  um , surprisingly difficult these days is to co is to get certain electronic sounds , to try and describe them . Have  I was thinking about that the other day , it was like  it 's like , 
D:  Yeah .  
E:  y y you know , 
E:  someone in one of these EDU meetings , they have a laptop and they hit the thing and the  and there 's an error screen that comes up and it has this " doink "  kind of sound . And it  
B:  Hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Right . Right .  
E:  What is that ? It 's not a beep . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  It 's not a bell . 
E:  It 's not s it 's not a " dong " .  It 's not a  I mean , you  there 're all these words that I could imagine and  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  so , it 's like , it 's a " tinny kind of electronic sound that comes up when you make an error with your laptop " . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  And that 's  <laugh> that 's not really very helpful . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  I wonder if like Microsoft has a word for it . 
C:  Now I 'm  now I 'm just wondering how they 're gonna transcribe you saying that . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yes . <laugh> 
E:  Oh . <laugh> You mean the voice quality ? The  the shift in  
C:  <laugh> 
C:  The " doink " .  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Bling .  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> I know .  <laugh> No !  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Now you did it again ! <laugh> 
E:  Oh , that thing . Oh th <laugh> 
A:  Stop torturing them ! <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  Let 's not make things hard on ourselves later . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  I know . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah .  


E:  Yeah . Well and then , you know , there are these other things that I think are really interesting , like the vocal changes in character . 
E:  People shifting into a  kind of a comic voice , or sort of a mock - this or mock - that , you know , the sighing and 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  Mmm . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  the , " Oh no ! " You know , it 's  it 's , uh , i There are lot 's of nuances which we  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  uh , which we use 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  very often . 
E:  Comic words and things like that . And  Yeah ? 
D:  You know , I 
B:  Huh . 
A:  Sorry .  
A:  <laugh> 


D:  sorry , to  <laugh> I just remembered one thing that really was  you needed  I think it was you that pointed out 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  the problem . Like you needed to be at the meeting to be able to transcribe correctly , the noise . I think it was Adam was making this really strange noise , 
D:  and apparently he was pretending  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> What ?  
E:  " Eech - eech " ,  or something . 
D:  he was like pretending to r screw something into his head ? Was that what it was ? 
E:  " Whee - whee " .  
E:  s s 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Yes . It was one of these  it was this kind of deal . 
A:  Oh yeah , I had that one . <breath-laugh> Oh yeah . 
D:  Yeah ! Y yeah !  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  Yes . Oh , yes . And he got to transcribe this meeting . 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , that was fun . 
E:  And there was all this meta stuff about  Cuz I was giving a report on what the comments were , and it was  one of these was this , s so  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  " Whee - whee " .  is what he said . 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> And he was going like this at the time .  <laugh> 


C:  <laugh> Joel 's like , " I am not amused . " <laugh> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> I don't even wanna , like , try to repeat what he said because I don't wanna put the transcriber through it again . <laugh> But they actually had a big list of , like , 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Yes , that 's right . Let 's just  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  things that people had transcribed and then they were reading one  them one by one and being , like , " What 's this ? This ? "  You know , and then doing the sounds , and then , " This sound must be this sound ! This sound must be this ! "  
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  Aw ! 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Oh wow . 
D:  y I had one like that where they were describing the different f qualities of " uh - huh " and " uh " and " uah "  and like what " EH " is versus " UH " versus " AH " .  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <gasp> 
A:  u u I had  yeah , I had one like that too . 
F:  Yeah ! 
E:  Oh man .  
B:  Hmm . 
D:  That was really hard . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> I had   
D:  That 's really interesting . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I had one where they were just  
A:  they were just , like , talking about each word , you know , and they were saying  
A:  they were just describing the word over and over again , and just the q the quotes around the word were driving me crazy . When they  kn knowing 
A:  when to put the quotes and when  And then they were talking about like the difference between 
A:  " uh " when it 's " a "  or when it 's " uh " ,  and at some point they were saying it so much , I didn't know how to transcribe it anymore . I was like , " I don't know if you 're saying " a " or " uh " anymore " . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah .  
D:  Yeah .  
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Right .  
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh , yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  You did an excellen excellent job . 
E:  That was really  it was like m transcription , a meta - transcription and meta meta meta .  It 's really @ @ . 


F:  I mean , just weird things like 
F:  before  
F:  like , I had kind of a weird thing happen , and we 'd talked about it . It was when I 'd first started working on the project I got this discussion where  
F:  this was before we had the different channels , and , um , Dan Ellis  it was when Dan Ellis was still here so it was like kind of early on , right ? 
E:  Yes . 
F:  And , um , 
F:  he  
F:  everyone 's talking , and then all of the sudden , you hear 
F:  Dan talking to someone else and it 's different people that you 'd never heard before . 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  And  and what he had done , is he had left the room to g 
E:  <gasp> 
B:  <inbreath> 
F:  He 'd li and he had brought the microphone with him . And this is without the channelized interface . So you  you have no idea . You think everyone 's just become schizophrenic or something . And they 're all like in they 're own r 
C:  Oh , no . 
B:  <gasp> 
A:  <gasp> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Oh my gosh .  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh man . 
A:  Oh wow . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh n  
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  world or something because  Then all of the sudden he 's talking about a co he needs a copy machine . And I don and I 'm just assuming , well he 's s s 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Oh g 
F:  still in the room and what the heck 's he talking about ? But just sort of just weird things like that , and , um  Yeah , he had just left the room and 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Wow ! 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  gone and made a copy and he still had his microphone on , and then you could hear the  the  the r the women behind the desk talking to him , and just sort of stuff like that .  It was just really bizarre . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  So . 
D:  That 's really funny . 
F:  Anyway . Just sort of weird things like that . 
E:  Well , it is  There 's another case where I ran across like o of that type , um , i when 
E:  I was sitting here and we were doing  This was like o one of the first meetings I ever participated in and  and 
E:  Dan was adjusting something here and Adam was in the next room , and , 
E:  um , <laugh> Adam says , " So I 'll come in here and check the levels , " and  and 
E:  he says something 
E:  and 
E:  Dan says , " No " . And it sounds like he 's saying " no " to Adam , and it was w if  if  if so , this would have been extremely rude . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Mmm . 
E:  But - but the thing  and  and the reason that it would be rude is because 
E:  you don't have this information from hearing all these equalized volume channels , 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  Uh - huh .  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Right . 
E:  you don't know that they 're not participating in the same conversation at all . <laugh> It really is strange . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  I it lead us  it ta if we w 
F:  So . 


E:  How about these meetings when  where there are like eight speakers i in one meeting . Are those  What are those like ? Are  
C:  Takes a long time . 
F:  They take longer to do . 
D:  It takes a long time , yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
E:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Takes a long time .  
F:  In a way they 're more fun , though . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  There 's just more variety . 
C:  Sometimes . <laugh> 
D:  I  tends  I  you know what I noticed , is it tends to have 
D:  a  still , a dominant group of speakers and then there are two or three people generally who don't talk at all except to say their digits or something , or who  
B:  Mmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  Who won't talk .  
F:  And to breathe .  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  or to breathe and cough and sniff and whatever . Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . But I  I think that 
F:  <laugh> There 'll be lots of breathing . <laugh> Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh , god ! <laugh> 
C:  Right .  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  still overall you 're gonna have 
D:  probably three or four or five dominant 
D:  speakers . 
C:  One thing I noticed is that , like , uhhh !   There was this one meeting I was transcribing , there were nine  nine speakers , 
C:  and by the end of it , I was so entirely sick of listening to the same conversation all over again nine 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> Definitely . 
C:  times in slow - mo !  I was going nuts . I was like , " I cannot take this anymore .  I can't listen to this anymore . Oh my god ! " 
D:  Exactly . 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  I had that same reaction . Absolutely . And sometimes these are meetings I participated in . It 's - it 's like  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Mm - hmm . 
D:  So you 've  this is like the tenth time for you , then . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> That 's righ that 's right .  
C:  I swear it 's like  
C:  it 's like a bad dream . It 's like , " This is  this is keep happ this keeps happening to me " . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  Never changes . I 'm gonna check out outside to make sure that we 're OK with the , um  


F:  Did you guys ever , when  This happened to me when I first started transcribing ,  cuz I had never really transcribed stuff like this before ,  but , um , 
E:  <door opens> 
E:  Is it OK if we stay for another half hour in this room ?  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Good , thanks .  
F:  I would leave here , and I would go out and do my daily business , and I would hear people speaking to me ,  and I would transcribe them in my head ! 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Oh yeah ! <laugh> That 's fun !  
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Oh , man .  <laugh> 
C:  Yes ! Yeah , yeah , yeah . Oh yeah . 
F:  I 'd imagine what I would type . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah ! Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
F:  It went away , like maybe after a couple of weeks , but it was just bizarre . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh really ? I still do that . 
C:  I still do that . I still do that . Yeah . 
B:  No , I don't - Yeah . <laugh> 
F:  Really ? 
D:  Occasionally . Like on the bus or something when I 'm bored . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yep . Or , like , I 'll think  
B:  Right . It 's something you 're not interacting with , you 're just listening . 
F:  Oh . No , for me it was unconscious . It was  I didn't 
D:  Oh , really ? 
F:  mean for  to be doing it . It would just intru it was an intrusion . Um , not a te not a bad intrusion , but 
D:  Oh , OK . 
C:  No , yeah . N Yeah . 
A:  Oh , oh . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Oh , that 's funny . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  not something I was sort of volitionally sort of  
D:  Huh , that 's interesting . 
C:  I would also be really aw aware of w how I was speaking . 
A:  Hmm . 
F:  Yes ! 
C:  Cuz I also tend  Like , we were talking about " so " . I do that . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  I 'll end utterances with " so " or " and " . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  and it 'll just be a trailing off , and I 'll think , " Man . I would be such a pain in the butt to transcribe . " 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah !  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
C:  <laugh> Like I just , uh , I  g yeah . I 'll  I 'll do the same thing as you do , and I  
F:  Yeah ! 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  I 'll listen to somebody and his or her speech will be particularly idios idiosyncratic ,  and 
C:  I 'll go , " Wow , I just  I 'm glad I 'm not transcribing him or her " . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I noticed a lot of my speech i 
D:  I don't know , I wouldn't call them errors , I guess disfluencies , 
D:  a lot more once  when I started transcribing . 
D:  I just noticed  and in ge people in general , that people 
B:  Mmm . 
F:  <inbreath> Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  break up their speech interestingly . 


E:  That raises a question . Um , do you think that , um , you would have been considerably 
E:  helped if we had had video tapes of these things ? 
F:  Oh sure . 
C:  Yes . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
D:  I definitely think so . 
C:  Yep . Mhh .  
D:  And I think there would be a lot more interesting data to analyze later on , <laugh> personally . <laugh> 
E:  Mmm , well , mm - hmm , mm - hmm that 's right , cuz you 're involved in gesture research . Mm - hmm . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <clears throat> 
D:  Yeah .  
C:  Yeah , cuz then you know exactly what 's going on , what the context cues are  
D:  And you can really get a feel for the re interpersonal relationships ,  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  which kind of comes into play , maybe not for speech recognition ,  but for other things , maybe ? 


C:  Maybe this is what it 's like to be blind . 
E:  Mmm - hmm . Oh , interesting . 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  Maybe . 
F:  Hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Huh . 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
A:  Hmm . 
C:  No  no visual input at all . 
D:  Yeah , you just have to rely on your intonation , and other things like that . <inbreath> 
C:  Right . 
E:  <inbreath> 
C:  And you get so much more aware of all of it too . 
D:  Yeah . Mm - hmm . Maybe . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  That 's  <inbreath> 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  I know someone who actually recognizes perfumes in the elevator .  I mean , there 's a  there 's a blind man in this  in this building , and  and , 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
E:  um , Lila was in the elevator one day . And they hadn't spoken yet cuz he just came on the elevator and he says  
C:  <laugh> 
E:  uh , and then she  then she said something and he says , 
E:  " Y you sp you 've changed your perfume . " <laugh> Yeah , it 's pretty interesting . Pretty interesting . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  Oh wow . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Huh . 
D:  That 's pretty amazing . 
F:  Had she changed her perfume ? Oh , wow . 
C:  That 's neat . 
E:  Yes , she had . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  Huh . 
A:  Hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  Oof !  
E:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  It 's very interesting . 
D:  Enhanced other senses , I guess . That 's really cool . 
C:  Right . 


E:  Have you  I  I 've learned several things about having been 
E:  Wi - i with the close - talking mikes . This is  this is a new experience . Cuz I have of course been involved in  in this kind of thing for quite a while , but 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  th there are several things I didn't realize you could hear so reliably , and  some of these are the things like 
E:  when the mouth opens and the inbreath and stuff and it  and how extremely audible and  and visual , I mean , you can see these  the inbreaths and things . It 's  that was really surprising to me , that you  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  That 's something you don't hear in normal speech too . In normal conversations ,  unless it 's very dramatic or very loud , 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <clears throat> 
E:  it 's that tangible . 
D:  that people click their  Their lips are always making funny noises and  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Unless  you 're on , uh , talking on the phone , and the phone is  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  the levels are funny . Then you hear it . So , th it 's kind of like that . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 


E:  I guess it 's also one of these things that u usually is not meaningful , so we sort of screen it out . 
D:  Yeah .  
E:  u all these different in cuz , you know , I mean , we do that all the time with all other  well , lots of other aspects of the acoustic signal . 
A:  Right . 
C:  <clears throat> 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
E:  It sounds like it 's a nice smooth melody , but <laugh> these things are voicing and unvoicing , are tripping in and out , and they don't  
E:  The contour is really not nearly that neat . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  Right . Yeah  well , yeah , most of the time when we 're listening to other people 's speech , we 're just trying to get the gist . Not literally what people are saying and so , 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
F:  you know , all the " uh "  " uh 's " and " um 's " , and all those different things , we just tune it out , yeah . 
C:  That 's true . 
D:  We - yeah , we filter all that out . Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And , uh , it 's that top - down thing again . Just  right ? In a way . Just trying to get the , um , 
E:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah , absolutely . Absolutely . 
F:  you know , what is the p 
F:  " what is the point of what this person is trying to communicate ? " kind of thing . So . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  That 's right . 
B:  Hmm . 


D:  before studying linguistics anyways and , uh , definitely before doing transcription ,  how I tended to look all conversations , and then 
D:  coming here and doing this , you have to look at speech in a totally 
D:  more intense way . Um . 
D:  Including , I mean , every little aspect . 
D:  I  and when I tell people what I do here , 
D:  and tell them , " Yeah , I 'm transcribing " . And they 're  they think I 'm like a stenographer or something . 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  Right . 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  I 'm like , " No , I don't correct the grammar . <laugh> I don't erase the " um " 's and " uh " 's , I record all the sighs , and the laughs , and the breaths , and  " 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  And they 're  I don't know . This is a very different thing than 
D:  most people 
D:  can relate to , I guess . 
D:  Or know about .  
E:  Mm - hmm . The  I agree . Another thing that I think is interesting in these meetings is , 
D:  <clears throat> 


E:  certain speakers have a tendency to embed utterances in other embed uh , in other utterances . And , um , you know , it 's very clear when you see it  
E:  when you hear it with the intonational markers , but  well , just the contours , but 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  the words on the page , it 's not at all clear . And there are a couple people who do this in particular . I  I would say 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  that it 's both  I would say that both Jerry and Morgan do this . And  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  it 's amazing how fluent it is  when you hear it , 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  but how very 
E:  complicated it is when you see the words . Yeah . 
C:  Indecipherable .  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And when you think about it , they pick up exactly where they left off , 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  even though maybe it 's several seconds later , there 's no glitch in the syntax or anything . It 's  
D:  We 're pretty amazing 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  machines . 
A:  <laugh> Mm - hmm . 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Or creatures , whatever . 
E:  Hmm . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Mmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  That 's really cool . 
C:  Machines .   


E:  So , and then of course there are these  these things which I think are also nicely represented in the data which are these funny sounds people make , 
E:  which to some degree is borrowing from comic talk . So , 
E:  I notice people going , " Pfft "  you know , if they 're trying to 
E:  say something is done . The Germans do this I think in particular . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  And there are others that we use like that th which are sort of semi - conventionalized , but you wouldn't think that you would write them down . 
C:  <inbreath> Right . Yeah , th I was thinking the one that you just did , like " tsk " .  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  makes me think of the  what people would write as " tsk tsk " .  
E:  Yes . 
D:  Yeah . Me too . @ @  
E:  Same here . Yeah . I would too . 
C:  You know , like , uh , as though they 're like , you know , trying to communicate displeasure . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh , right . 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  That 's true . Yeah . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  And so that  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
C:  U i cu there 's  there 's at least two or three that I can think of that to me are very different . You know , there 's like , 
F:  Right . 
C:  you know , that , and there 's like , um , you know , well , the one I did before that 's like " <lateral tongue click> " .  
C:  I don't know , like , um  
C:  Hhh .  
E:  I would say " tongue click " for that . But I would also probably put in parentheses it  that I thought it was a vocal gesture . Because I think it 's communicative of a certain thing . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <lateral tongue click>  
C:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 


C:  Yeah , the one I kn I kn get all the time is " tsk "  
A:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh yes ! Good example . 
B:  Mmm . 
C:  It 's  it 's , uh  like I don't know how  I just transcribe it as  I say , like , " click " and then I say , " It 's like a vocal gesture . " Like a shrug or a vocal  some  
D:  Mmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm .  
D:  It 's like 
D:  " tisk " . <laugh> 
E:  Yes . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  some sort of like , " Well , there it is " . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Or , " That 's it . " Or something like that , you know . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  That  people do that one a lot . And there was one speaker who used to do it constantly . And after a while , 
C:  <swallow> 
C:  I started getting confused as to whether or not 
C:  he was , like , 
C:  just going " tsk - tsk - tsk - tsk - tsk " to himself ,  
C:  or whether he was meaning it in conversat Sometimes it was really obvious that he meant it as some sort of vocal cue . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  But then sometimes it was more ambiguous . Like it was tough to tell , 
C:  um , because he would just always be clicking . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  This cou Is this the one that  I mean , it could be the one that we were thinking about . 
D:  It could be . 
D:  But I 
D:  noticed it more as it was obviously 
D:  not  
D:  because it was always in a g the one I 'm thinking of always came in groups of four or something .  
E:  Yes . Uh - huh . 
D:  And so it wasn't ever like a , 
C:  Mmm . 
D:  um , 
C:  Oh , OK . 
D:  single 
E:  It would be  it would  
C:  Yeah , this guy does a lot of single ones . 
D:  l 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh , how interesting . 
C:  Yeah , just kind of , um  And , uh  that 's another thing like I  I realize I do that too . 
E:  I 'll ask you who this is later . I don't wanna <laugh> cuz <breath> 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  I can't remember the name actually . 
E:  OK . 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  The  the one that I 'm thinking of , i it 's a matter of you can tell it 's in context where he 's looking in his agenda to see , you know , " Do I have time to do this ? " and he 's 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  calculating it in his mind . So it 's sort of li almost like a stand - in for calculator , kind of thing . 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  And i uh , but it 's signaling . I 'm sure that everybody  I 'm sure that other people can hear it . So it 's sort of like , " Wait a minute , I 'm thinking . " 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Right . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  But it 's not lexicalized . This is not a  
A:  Hmm . 
D:  That 's kind of the impression I got too . 
E:  i not in a standard way , it 's  
C:  Oh . Yeah , that 's a different person . 
E:  OK . OK . OK . 
C:  Yeah . OK , I know who you 're talking about . But this is somebody  somebody differ 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  He must do this in a lot of meetings because I think  you know , I 've run across it several times . 
A:  I don't think I 've ever heard it . 
D:  No . 
F:  No . 
D:  Hmm . 


F:  I 've heard " <mouth> " .  
A:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  Which I just transcribe as " mouth " . 
E:  Heard that one . 
E:  Oh , I see . 
F:  I just make a mouth  Cuz I think I had talked to you about this  about what  what did we do  cuz  wha what was it that I  oh , I was  " Lipsmack " ! 
A:  Huh . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh yes . 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  I was marking " lipsmack " , and  and you said  
D:  That 's more like the " @ @ " . <mouth> 
F:  yeah , that 's  It 's a different noise , but , um , it 's what made me think of it , but , um , 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Ah .  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  The one you 're talking ab 
F:  and  and you said , " Don't do " lipsmack " , just do  we don't need  it 's too specific . Just do " mouth " for all tha all those noises " . 
E:  <inbreath> Yeah , OK . Now what I would say  um , it 's good to know this . C what I  what I would say is , um , if it 's communicative s 
F:  Um  
E:  beyond just the p 
E:  mouth opening and the 
E:  w oh , you know , the mechanical aspects that happen when you happen to be about to speak , 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  then I would like to have it  if it 's communicative , I 'd like to have it preserved . 
A:  Right . 
E:  a But if it 's just this mechanical stuff , " mouth " is fine . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  The  It seems like the computer science people use " lipsmack " for that . 
E:  I  Personally , my choice  
E:  eh , w we 've  we 're still deciding on how we 're gonna encode it in the final version . 
E:  But I tend to not like " lipsmack " because I think that that 's  could be meaningful and it 's a little confusing . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  People talk about , you know , " Oh gee , that was really good , " and then they do a  I 'm not gonna do it cuz I don't really know how to do lipsmack . But  but it seems like it would be a  a vocal gesture , a definite type of thing . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  It could be . 


A:  I don't know what  I am never sure whether or not to transcribe , um , a difference with , like , " hmm " ,  you know , and " hmm ! " .   
A:  <laugh> Like , how do you transcribe " hmm ! " ?   
D:  Oh yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Oh . Good point . Yes . 
D:  It 's like " humph " . 
C:  I 'll put like a  
E:  Really good point . Yeah . 
C:  I 'll usually put a  an exclamation point  somehow . Like I 'll go  
E:  I would too . I think it 's more emphatic . 
D:  Oh .  
A:  Yeah ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . W what about pre transcribing it , um , 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  But it  th it 's true that th segments are different too . 
A:  " HMPH " ? What about transcribing it that way , like " hmph " ? 
C:  " Hmph . " 
B:  Hmm ! 
F:  Oh . 
E:  Well , now , y This is a good question . I guess I would say th you know , sometimes we 've seen " hmph " in literature meaning in but it 's a s 
A:  Right . 
E:  a sigh  a si uh , sorry . A sound of indignation . 
A:  Right . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  So , if it 's meant as a sound of indignation then I think that would be how I would capture it , with the HMPH thing . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  I usually tend to think that it 's a  
D:  more of a  
D:  Hhh . <vocal gesture, expulsive outbreath, signalling difficulty> not indignation . Something more positive . I don't know exactly wha how to characterize it , but something more 
B:  Like  
B:  " Hmm ! I hadn't thought of that . "  
C:  Oh really ? 
E:  a sort of like a sup uh , an  uh , an elevated " hmm " ? It 's like a m sort of more surprise , or 
A:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . " Hmm . "  
D:  Yeah . Or   I  i I don't know . Maybe . 
B:  Hhh .  
E:  engagement ? 
A:  I yeah . I guess it could have  two meanings , sort of . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  If it 's surprise then the exclamation point makes sense , too . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And then there 's the other kind which sounds similar , but it 's really part of a laugh . So , " Hmm - hmm - hmm - hmm - hmm " .  
F:  Hmm . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Which is  
A:  Yeah . Mm - hmm . 
E:  I would just say " laugh " for that . 
C:  Laugh . Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 


F:  Yeah , once , Adam was laughing , and it was actually written out 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  phonetically , and I changed it . I 'm like " it 's just laughing " . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Good . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Well done . Well done . 
F:  Like somebody had written , like 
F:  " hyuh - hyuh " or  or  or something . And  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  I 've run across that also . And  Right . Change it to " laugh " . Well done . 
A:  That 's funny .  
F:  Yeah , i I  it was maybe Tigerfish had done something like they had written out a phonetic laugh , and they didn't do it at any other place in the transcript . It was just that one spot . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  That 's interesting . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  That 's interesting . 
E:  I ran across a couple " ho " 's occ 
E:  I 've seen " ho " 's and  <laugh> 
F:  It was just a regular old vanilla laugh , you know . It wasn't anything special . 
A:  " Ho - ho - ho " ? Oh , that is too much fun . <laugh> 
E:  and " heh " . <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  Yeah , that 's right . W we  
D:  I noticed , i m as far as problems with laughs , is that a lot of them were marked as breaths . 
E:  @ @ 
D:  Because a lot of people , 
E:  Yes . 
D:  I think we already talked about this last time , but  
A:  Right . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah .  
D:  but not so much as , I never saw that written out phonetically , or whatever . 
E:  Well i 
F:  Well  
F:  well , here 's a question , and there 's been some variance in transcripts that I 've looked at . 
E:  <noise> 
F:  When  OK . So when you laugh , you 're exhaling all this air , and so you need to i inhale , 
E:  Yes . 
E:  Yes .  
F:  and  so how do you transcribe the inhale ? Some people are transcribing it as a breath . 
F:  I I used to , 
F:  you know , back in the day  back when I was do transcribing , I would do the whole thing as a laugh  because to me the breath is part of the laugh . 
E:  Yeah ? Yeah , yeah , yeah ? 
D:  Yeah , that 's what I used to do too . 
E:  Uh - huh . Yeah , yeah . 
E:  I agree with you . That 's  that 's what I prefer . 
A:  Oh yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
F:  Um , so  cuz i cuz in the ones I 've been che the one I 've been checking actually right now , that breath gets marked as a breath , and I 've been taking them out . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  So you would have like " lef 
E:  Good . 
E:  Well done . 
F:  So that 's OK ? 
E:  Well done . 
D:  laugh , breath , laugh "  
F:  Actually , it 'd be a " laugh " and then two dots , like the next bin will be empty , and then it 'll be " breath " . 
D:  transcribed ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Oh , I 've  Yeah . OK . I see what you 're saying . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <inbreath> s Yeah . I was gonna say , I put  
F:  And so it 'll be that  
A:  Oh . 
A:  Yeah .  
F:  it 'll be three d 
F:  sort of separate units as opposed to  I think it 's sort of one coherent thing . So . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  I put " breath - laugh " in the brackets when I don't know whether it 's a breath or a laugh , which is what  I remember you telling me to do that . 
E:  That 's good . That 's good . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Oh , well , yeah , that 's  that 's a different thing . 
E:  That 's right . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . OK . 
F:  Yeah . S cuz sometimes it 's 
E:  That 's good . 
F:  not clear . Like sometimes " Hhh ! " is a laugh .  
D:  Sometimes it 's hard to tell . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's right . And  
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
F:  Um , and if other people are laughing , then I 'll usually give them  and say that they 're laughing . 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  I agree with you . And  and I think that 's important because we 're capturing then the communicative level . 
C:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Exactly . 
F:  Mm - hmm . Exactly . 
A:  Right . 
E:  And it 's likely that it has a different contour than most breaths as well . 
D:  Yeah .  
E:  Because it 's sort of expulsive and  and , uh , that kind of thing . Ex - exactly . Exactly . Well done . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  A lot of people go , 
F:  So . 
C:  " <four exhales from nose> " .  
E:  Yes they do . Yeah , the shyer ones sometimes will laugh i with the breath - laugh . And you can see it . You can see the little  little peaks , which is interesting . But yes . Yeah , exactly . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
F:  Right . 
E:  I wouldn't , uh  i That 's a case whe you know , I know generally with the Tigerfish things that they put " breath " and we leave it in . But absolutely there , yeah . " Laugh " , 
F:  Good . OK . 
E:  change it . And , you know , there are other places where it 's in the way , you know . 


E:  I  I mainly said not to change their " breath " 's simply because it would take time to move them if  and if they 're not in the way then don't  don't mess with it , but  
A:  <inbreath> A lot of times , though , the breaths are , um , 
A:  results of bad segmentation ,  and there 's a segmentation of nothing ,  and so they 
E:  Oh yes ! 
A:  just write it as a breath when it 's clearly not a breath .  And I usually always take those out . I mean , usually , 
D:  Yeah . I 've taken out some of those . 
F:  Yeah . 
A:  um , it seems like the segmenter , um , often 
E:  Great . 
A:  just sort of , um , segments  
A:  when there 's really long spaces ,  it segments random spaces in between .  And th you know , they get that and there 's nothing there , so they m s mark it as a breath when it 's really actually nothing .  
A:  So usually I take those out . 
E:  That 's right . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  <inbreath>  
F:  Well they give the segmenter , though  cuz they don't have the  the rich 
F:  interface that we do ,  so the they must be giving the pre - segmenter sort of the benefit of the doubt , " Well , there must be something there , 
A:  Right . Right . Exactly , exactly . 
F:  um , whether I can hear it or not . " So , they just say , " Well , it 's a breath then " . 
D:  Oh , yeah . I 'm sure they are . 
A:  Exactly . 
E:  One wonders what it might be  Yeah .  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Although , they did put a " missing segment " 
E:  Yeah , there are some where  
D:  so sometimes in brackets . 
F:  Yes ! 
A:  Oh really ? Oh , I always get  I always get " breath " . 
F:  That 's true . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Well , see , I  I do a previous filtering before I give the Tigerfish ones out , and  and I u 
D:  I 've gotten both . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
E:  I have tried to get the  that particular the  the " missing segment " removed . But I don't always 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . I 've seen a few of them , but I 've seen a  several " breath " 's too . 
F:  Hmm . 
E:  do it . So yeah , you 've s they slip through . 
F:  Well , frequently that 'll also be a misattribution too , of voice . 
A:  Hmm ! 
D:  Yeah ! Yeah . 
F:  Cuz then you 'll hear <laugh>  you 'll hear part of what another person is saying and th tha and that 's all transcribed on that one 
F:  level , but then you 'll hear a little bit of it and then " missing segment " . It 's like , " OK , well they just  it 's in the wrong  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  It 's just in the wrong place .  
F:  That person 's not talking at all " . So , you just get rid of it . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Hmm . 
F:  So . 
D:  Yeah .  
E:  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
E:  Interesting . 


E:  so , um , do you think that this has changed your speech  n 
E:  in other ways , in terms of  
E:  Myself , I do feel that I 'm  <laugh> when I spend a lot of hours doing this I become less fluent . I 
E:  have more false starts and things . Yeah . I don't know if it 's  It could just be because there 're so many more hours I haven't been talking . <laugh> 
D:  Really ? 
F:  Hmm ! 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Hmm . One thing that I noticed  
D:  I don't know if it 's a  really a question of me being more c 
D:  changing my speech necessarily ,  but I 'm much more aware of interruptions in conversation  in normal conversation . 
E:  Oh ! 
F:  <inbreath> Oh , yeah . That 's true . 
E:  Oh . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  So , uh , maybe I am more careful  in the sense that I 
D:  maybe don't interrupt as much , or j 
D:  I 'm more aware of it when I am doing it ,  or something like that ,  but , 
D:  um , I just 
D:  pay attention more to the fact that every  


C:  I guess I try to be more careful in my speech , 
C:  more often . 
E:  Good . 
C:  Unless I 'm really not paying any attention like , you know , if I 'm at a party or something , and I 'm just 
C:  sort of having a good time , then it doesn't really matter , but 
C:  in n you know , normal one - on - one speech I  
C:  I think I tend to 
C:  try to enunciate more .  
E:  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
C:  Cuz I 've been told I mumble . 
E:  Oh ! Huh ! 
C:  Um , 
C:  and I guess I used to be worse about it . I was 
C:  told by my parents that I used to mumble a lot .   
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Uh , 
C:  and also I  I have this sort of 
C:  East Coast accent that comes in sometimes that makes it hard for people on the West Coast to understand what I 'm saying .  
E:  Hmm ! 
C:  A lot of times like , uh , if I 'm not paying attention I 'll say something 
C:  that , 
C:  uh , will 
C:  not really be heard . I tend to leave off final consonants , for instance , 
D:  <clears throat> 
C:  and people , uh , n 
C:  I have to be conscious of that sometimes . Yeah , so . 
E:  Hmm ! 
E:  So mainly for clarity , it sounds like , like in phrasing or strategies . 


D:  pretty much all the time in normal conversation there are interruptions . There 's no  I mean , unless you have really aw I mean , I think if there were no interruptions it would sound really awkward . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  There would be a lot of pauses , and that would kind of i 
D:  imply uncomfortability , or something . 
F:  <inbreath> 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  But , 
E:  I guess it depends partly on the type of interruption . I mean , if it 's a clarifying type like  " well do you mean  ? " when they 're partway through it in a utterance . 
D:  yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  It 's different . 
C:  Yeah . I tend to think of a conversation that has no interruptions as 
C:  being something that 's  
C:  n unnatural and forced . Or something like a meeting where , you know , I mean everybody says  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  their little schpiel and people are meant to be , 
C:  you know , pretty  pretty quiet and attentive for the most part . And then they let them finish , and then somebody else comes in and says something about it . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Um , 
C:  and in a n like a friendly conversation I  I notice that that 's not really true . Like what you were saying . 
D:  <inbreath> But even in cases like that ,  
A:  Right . 
D:  even when it 
D:  is  
E:  y you  


D:  see now I 'm contradicting myself , but even when it is very  turn - taking is very w like people follow the turn - taking rules , or whatever , and don't really blatantly interrupt people ,  
D:  um , 
D:  and I  I remember this actually from a meeting because Liz was complaining there wasn't enough o interruptions , 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  or e not enough overlaps , or something . It wasn't interruptions it was overlaps , that I was thinking about . Not enough overlaps . And so she wanted to  there to be an argument or something so that there 'd d be more . And ch what she didn't realize was 
C:  Huh ! 
E:  Uh - huh . I think this is really  yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  that throughout the meeting up until then there had been , 
D:  they were just very small , but they were there . 
D:  I think they 're there pretty much a all the time . 
E:  I agree . I did  I did do one analysis wh where I looked at one meeting , 
C:  That 's interesting . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
E:  and , um  th cuz the claim had been , actually o one of the 
E:  people in the meeting had made the claim in the previous meeting that , " Well , there  probably the overlaps only occur during setup 
E:  and , um , you know , at the end when we 're leaving . " <laugh> 
D:  Oh ! 
F:  Oh yeah , that 's totally not true . 
B:  Hmm ! 
C:  No , not at all . 
E:  Exactly . Exactly . Well , and , you know , I think that that 's sort of the feeling you would get if  unless you looked at the data at this level . And so I did an analysis and in fact it was really a pretty constant rate 
D:  Yeah ! 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  Yeah ! 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  all the way through the entire meeting and everyone was involved . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Wasn't just one , you know , or two speakers . Everyone was  Yeah . It 's quite true . 
C:  Kind of makes sense because 
C:  if you 're  if you wanna speak next , it 's almost like you got y you gotta get your foot in the door . You gotta be the one who  you know , make sure people recognize that you 're the one who 's gonna speak next .  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  That 's true . <inbreath> I should say , I didn't distinguish between overlaps and  and interruptions . So some of these were backchannels and things like that . But it 's still  It 's still the case . You have  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh , I see . Uh - huh . 
A:  Yeah . 


A:  I think , um , silences are generally like <inbreath> not good in conversation too . Cuz once you get a 
E:  @ @ 
A:  sil You know , it  it  it 's to your benefit to  
A:  to try to get in right when you think they 're done because if there 's a silence , not only is it awkward ,  but then that sort of cues everybody to start thinking of a new topic to stop the silence ,   
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  and then you don't get to talk about what you wanted to talk about  because the whole subject has changed .   
B:  Hmm . 
D:  And then everybody talks at once . 
E:  That 's true . That 's very true . 
D:  You know , thinking about it ,  
A:  You know ? S 
D:  I  I think I 've only noticed a couple times where there 's been actual silence on all channels for a period of time . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> It 's true . That 's very rare . I agree . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm ! 
D:  It 's only been like twice . Yeah . 
F:  It 's rare . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Interesting observation . 


E:  Yeah . Well , if they 're i c if  this has raised a couple of things for me that I wanted to mention because , you know , at this point , we 're at the  at the really fine grain level of  
D:  Yeah .  
E:  of standardization which I hadn't really thought of specifying in advance before , and , um , 
E:  wanted to maybe just mention a couple of things . These are , 
E:  um  
E:  Yeah , I don't think that these are very common . But with the idea that  what we 're trying to do is encode the communicative stuff , 
E:  um , 
E:  when we have these grey areas , um , 
E:  w um , 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  OK . And I have like , uh , uh , two more things I wanted to say . One of them is , um  
C:  So that 's probably why you , like , added in 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  that , um , thing that automatically puts in the 
C:  people 's initials . 
D:  Initials ? 
E:  That 's  that 's  I did that partly to keep track of things . Absolutely . 
E:  Absolutely . Somet - 
D:  I I also found that it was easier to deal with the meetings when there are speaker initials . Yeah . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Oh yeah . 
C:  Initials . 
E:  The initials ? I 'm glad to hear that . I st I didn't do that systematically until , uh , really rather recently , so . I 
D:  Yeah . I find it much easier . 
E:  It 's really not  The same thing with the " QUAL " . Just so long as I can tell which of those three categories it is . Or  
D:  OK . 
E:  or " pron " ,  but , you know , those  that 's really very obvious , the pronunciation . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  So long as I can tell what they are . I think it 's good for you to add the " pron " .  I would appreciate the " pron " ,  come to think of it . 
D:  So we do need to add that one ? 
D:  OK . Sure . OK . 
F:  Good . 
E:  But the other three  i just so long as it 's clear to me , w 
E:  you know , from the comment which of those three it is , then I 'm fine . 
F:  Good . 
E:  That 's great . 


E:  I wanted to draw attention to the fact that there are sometimes these stretches where a person is trying to say something and formulating their thought , and they 're coming out with a bunch of 
E:  segments , which really aren't part of a word . 
E:  Have you run across that where they 're  they 're saying @ @  and then they say a word . 
D:  Hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
D:  Yeah , yeah .  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh . 
C:  Right . 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  And , my feeling on that is , that 
E:  this isn't really 
E:  a phonological transcript , 
E:  and potentially those things could probably be rendered , although some of them are not even full segments , they 're even sub s subsegmental , I would say . I mean , you got a  a single flap of a vocal cord sometimes , and , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . 
E:  you know , they 're th it 's like the  the apparatus is sort of 
E:  almost kicking in , they 're almost gonna say @ @ but it hasn't  somehow this  somehow this vibration hit before the rest of it and  
B:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  and that 's not communicative . So , um , my  my the way I do those things when I hear those , if  
C:  OK . 
E:  is to  I use in parentheses one " X " <laugh> so it 's marked . 
F:  <gasp>  
A:  Right . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Or if it 's @ @  then I   then I put six or seven or however many it is  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Then  Right . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  That 's what I usually do too . Yeah . 
F:  I was wondering who had been putting those in . 
E:  Great . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  And then  and then what I do is I put in , um , brackets , um , 
E:  uncodeable  Sorry , " Uncodeable vocal sounds " . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yes . 
C:  Oh , OK . OK . 
E:  And of course , potentially they 're codable , but i I just wanted to mark roughly how man how long it is , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  then indicate 
E:  what  what the nature of it is , so no one 's gonna try and go back and  and decode it as something that 's pechen a a word that was not  It has a different status than parenthesized , 
E:  uh , 
E:  parts when there are words involved , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  just to set it aside , have some sort of a length indication , and sometimes I 'll even put them in a  in a separate bin , although that 's  
E:  that 's not necessary . It 's just sometimes it works out that way that they @ @ ,  they do this thing . I shouldn't do that so often . I 'm sorry about that . <laugh> They do this sound , 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  and then there 's a pause , and then they start speaking , so then it 's really obvious , I can  I can split it apart and it won't be any problem . I wanted to mention that one , yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  I 'm glad you ment brought that up because I actually  I 'm one of the culprits that puts in all the little itsy bitsy tiny sounds in the middle of everything ,  
F:  Man ! 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Mmm . 
F:  I do that too ! I used to do that ! 
C:  because I was  
C:  because  Yeah . Cuz I was thinking , like , you 're just supposed to write down everything you hear as closely as possible .  
E:  Well  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  And so , I 'm glad you said that because , um , that actually takes 
F:  A lot of time . 
C:  a good amount of time , and like pretty strict concentration <laugh> to d to do that . Um , 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah .  I put in the " X "s . I put in  if it 's , um , unintelligible I put  I count how many syllables and then I put in " six X "  
E:  Excellent . 
C:  and so  
C:  I do that if it 's unintelligible , but if I can tell something  if somebody goes " r " 
C:  I 'll put an " R " . 
E:  Oh , I see . 
E:  I see . 
C:  Eh  Um , so if they go " r e m m " , 
C:  I 'll go " R " " EH " " mmm " m " M " " M " . 
A:  Oh . 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  So like I  I 've been doing that because like that 's what I can hear . And I 'm pretty damn sure that  sorry . Sorry ! 
E:  OK . 
A:  Right . 


A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  Sorry . Hhh !  
A:  <inbreath> That will have to be transcribed with little , uh , symbols .  
F:  <laugh> 
C:  Sorry ! I 'm sorry . <laugh> I feel really bad now .  
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . Like a  a skull and crossbones . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Right .  
C:  Oh no ! I 'm sorry ! OK   <laugh> Oh no , I 'm so sorry .  
E:  That 's OK . It 's alright . No problem .  
A:  <inbreath> You 've ruined the whole meeting ! <inbreath> We can't transcribe any of it now !  <laugh> 
F:  It 's not  i it 's  
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . <laugh> 
F:  It 's not like you said the F - word . It 's not  it 's not an  it 's still a PG  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  No , no , no . This is not  
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , seriously .  
B:  <laugh> 
E:  I wouldn't give it a second thought . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Oh yeah  I  I was  
D:  Do you remember what you were gonna say ?  
D:  <laugh> 
F:  She 's pretty darn sure that , uh , 
C:  Ah  and then  tha Yeah , that 's wha I 'm sorry .  
B:  <laugh> 
E:  You sh Yeah  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  she could make it out probably . <laugh> 
A:  OK .  Right . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 


F:  Yeah , no one 's ever sworn in any of the meetings ! That actually  
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Well , y you 've heard  have you heard " shoot " ? I 've heard " shoot " a couple of times . 
C:  I 've heard the  
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Not the swearword version . 
A:  Hmm  
E:  No , no , no , no , no , no , the 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Just " shoot " . 
E:  " shoot " type , yeah . 
C:  I 've heard the swearword version . Remember that ? Remember that ? It was a while back . I  it was a long time ago . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  That 's OK . 
A:  Oh , you have ? I 've never heard the swearword versions . 
E:  Yeah ? 
E:  Oh . 
E:  I do remember that . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , and I was like , " Oah ! "  <laugh> I emailed you , I was like , " M You might wanna check this out . " <laugh> Yeah , I do remember that . But it was very quiet . So I can see how that would have been sort of 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  That 's right . That 's right . Yeah . 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  gone over by accident . It was just very quiet , like kind of under the breath  kind of thing , so that 's why it was missed . I can understand . Yeah . 
E:  Uh - huh , yeah . Yeah , it was . 
D:  Uh - huh . Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Hmm ! 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 


E:  B but y t finish your point . So , y <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Oh ! <laugh> I was just   I was just <laugh> saying that , um , I  I can <laugh>  I 'm pretty sure that I can tell what  exactly what sounds are being produced . So if it 's 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Yes . Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
C:  " er " , I write an " R " . If it 's " mmm " , I can tell it 's  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
E:  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
A:  Then again , I always think that it 's closer to stick with the " X "s because it 's , like , 
A:  how effective is , you know , the Roman alphabet at deciphering all the sounds that a human can make . 
B:  <breath> 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  You know , it 's not the IPA and  it 's just , I  I just sort of think , um , 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  it 's best to leave it with " X "s because I  <inbreath> 
A:  y English orthography conventions are just so , 
A:  you know , uncertain anyway in the first place , and , um  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  you know , I  I usually only use them when I  I know that , um , 
A:  the person was trying to make a word . I mean , I know that the  the word they were trying to say and that they were stuttering that , then I feel fine just 
A:  you know , writing out the letters . But otherwise , I sort of don't 
A:  feel right trying to write them out because I feel like it 's , um  
A:  you can't really  
C:  Just not useful ? 
A:  Yeah , you can't really spell those things with the R with the Roman alphabet , you know ? It 's  it was only set up for  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah ? 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
A:  it was set up for a different purpose , you know . Not necessarily so phonological . 
E:  <inbreath>  
E:  I agree . And I think there 's another problem too , and that is that we do have some short words which are communicative . And  and sometimes  So , if you have an 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
E:  " ER " as part of one of these fragments , we do have a 
E:  lexicalized " er " which is a  which is a  
A:  <inbreath> Right . 
C:  Right . 
E:  a filler item . Does have a meaning . So I think for both of the reasons it 's good to just leave it in this category of not really communicating in a  in a word - like way . 


C:  So even if it 's " er " , or  
A:  Right . 
E:  I would keep " er " . Well , " E "  " er "  " er " if it 's a filler . So , " I mean , er , " 
C:  Oh , you would keep " er " . 
C:  Right , right . 
E:  th that  that  that stays . But if it 's p uh , part on these little fragments , no . 
A:  Mmm  
C:  Right . Oh , OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh yeah . I always  
A:  I often transcribe that as 
A:  " or " . I always thought that was " or " sort of with a strange pronunciation . 
E:  Oh . <inbreath> 
E:  I 'm making a distinction . 
F:  Oh . 
E:  So you have the , um , comic " er " where the person says something and then they pretend that they didn't wanna say that , and then they throw in an " er " . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Oh . Oh , I don't get that one . 
E:  m and that would be an " er " . ER . But if they 're saying " or " 
C:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
E:  in a reduced way so it comes out as " er " , do it as " or " . 
A:  R 
F:  <inbreath> 
A:  Right . 
A:  OK . m OK . 
E:  Cuz that 's  that falls within the realm of pronunciation variants . It 's just like different ways of saying " and " . 
D:  OK . 
C:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 


E:  Oh , yeah . This is an interesting category to me , and I don't , 
E:  um , y y don't have to mark this systematically . But 
E:  when you 're going through the meeting , and what I 'd like people to do if  if you 're not  uh , uh  is to go through the meeting , um  
E:  So , if you 're doing  you 're doing separate channels first and then as a final pass through the mixed channel , 
E:  I don't think I 've made that explicit but it w it 's really helpful to go through it a  a final time though the mixed channel so that you hear things in context . 
E:  And at that point what I sometimes pick up is this meta - level , 
E:  where someone is  finishes someone 's  someone else 's utterance . So you 'll suddenly have this stranded word out in the middle of nowhere , and it 's because 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  this other speaker on this other channel was trying to formulate this thought , and they paused , and they paused just enough that this person leaped in and gave them a word . 
D:  Mmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Right . 
E:  And I think those are interesting , so when I find that I  I note  note it as , you know , finishing  
D:  <clears throat> 
E:  put capital letters . Capital letter , capital letter , colon , 
E:  apostrophe " S " , utterance . 
D:  Oh ! 
F:  <inbreath> Wait , wait . How do you mark it ? 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  Wait . 
C:  We add the  
E:  So , if <clears throat>  so in the examp i in the instance in which  Let 's say that , um , 
E:  Morgan 's talking , 
E:  uh , so , 
E:  <tapping sounds, writing on whiteboard> 
E:  he 's talking . 
E:  And then somewhere there 's a bit of a pause , and let 's say Adam 
E:  fills in a word for him . 
E:  Then what I do is , on Adam 's channel , 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  I say  
E:  I say , " Completing  " 
F:  Oh , I see . 
E:  And this  this isn't that common of an occurrence .  " Completing speaker initial with a colon apostrophe " S " 's utterance " . 
D:  Oh ! 
A:  Oh . 
F:  OK . 
E:  And what that means is at the time when we  See we 're gonna go to a stage of anonymization . So it 's important to have the colon here because that 'll make it possible to easily know , 
A:  Oh . 
E:  you know , who it was without having to do the math involved in figuring out which channel it was . The problem with  I originally wanted to use channel numbers as the referent 
E:  index , but that  that 's not functional because we have these two different numbering schemes . You have the numbering in the 
E:  Channeltrans interface and you have the numbering in the " key " file and those can be very different . So , you know , to be able to , 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  uh  Th - this is redundant in a useful way in that you know that you 're not gonna make a mistake . I tried to do it with the numbers and I was making all sorts of inconsistent problems , so I stopped it . 


E:  I 'm glad to know that 's useful . It s takes an extra step . Glad it 's useful . OK , now I just have one more thing to say and that is that , um , um , 
D:  OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  like once  this is just such a rea I 'm getting down to like the really eensy - weensy stuff . But , um , 
E:  once <laugh> I found a comment that , uh , in in curly brackets about mumbling . And , um , 
E:  i g 
E:  that 's  that 's  this is just to mention an instance that happened once , it 's really grasping for details . But , um , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  <mike noise> 
E:  I  I  
E:  f I think , and it may be that it was not from anybody here , so . <laugh> But I think that , um , " mumble " is only useful in the s to me , in the sense of " whispered " , 
E:  if it 's like a manner of speaking , in which case it 's a " QUAL " . 
E:  But not in terms of replacing , like , this string of undecipherable fragments . So , 
A:  Oh , right . 
C:  Right . Oh yeah . 
E:  um , this  this was u when it was used  exactly . It was used in place of , uh , something that was in unintelligible . 
A:  They used " mumble " for  
D:  OK . 
C:  To fill in . I see . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Right . 
F:  <inbreath> 
E:  In which case , it would be better to use parentheses and  and 
A:  The number " X " . 
E:  either exclamation ,  or the number of syllables , if you know . 
F:  And then do " QUAL mumbled " or " QUAL whispered " or something . 
E:  Exactly . If it 's a manner of speaking , then it 's useful . And otherwise the parentheses with an estimate of syllables is better . 
F:  I see . 
A:  Right . 
D:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
E:  OK . So , I guess , you know , I don't wanna keep you . <laugh> I kept you so long . I really appreciate this . Yes ? 


D:  Can I ask one more thing about these comments . So we are for  
D:  " QUAL " is used for things like 
D:  " whispered " , or " said while laughing " , or things of that nature . Um , I remember at some point we were doing a difference between vocal and non - vocal sounds ? 
E:  Yes . Mm - hmm . 
E:  <inbreath> Oh . 
E:  Yes . Oh , but  Good question . And you don't have to add any of those tags . 
D:  Oh ! 
E:  The only tags that you need to add , is  So  th uh , there 's like one exception that 's just microscopic , and that is , sometimes  
E:  this is again really rare , sometimes I 've run across the word " noise " . 
E:  And offhand , I don't know if that 's a vocal noise or non - vocal noise . 
C:  Mmm . 
E:  And so then I listen to it and I figure it out . 
E:  But that 's the only place you would use a " vocal "  " non - vocal " tag , where it 's potentially ambiguous between those two categories . Cuz otherwise , what I do when I get these , is  
E:  and of course I do my checks , and then I have a , um  a script that I wrote which will separate everything in  out that has curly brackets , do a listing of them , 
E:  and then anything  
A:  Mmm . 
E:  Some of them already have tags from some previous , uh , modification , but anything that doesn't , I just go through this list , 
E:  and I  I k tag it right then . And so , in one  in one  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  in one change , I can modify , you know , five hundred 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  instances of this . So there 's no need to add the " vocal " or the " non - vocal " . 
D:  Very efficient . 
D:  OK . But for , like , noise that we 
F:  Hmm ! 
C:  Right . 
D:  know is 
D:  something like mike noise , or something like a door , whatever , then we can mark it as that and no 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yes . 
E:  You can either  if you mark it " mike noise " then I 'll know what kind of noise it is when I go through the thing and put VOC or NVC on the  in the substitution file . 
D:  Yeah ,  right . Or  o or if it 's  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right . 
E:  But it 's  it 's uh , very efficient for me to add those tags later . 


E:  Alright , so , um , I guess , um , 
F:  Do you wanna read digits ? Do you wanna do that ? 
E:  Oh , thank you , do we have time ? Would you mind ? Can we do digits ? OK , so why don't  do you wanna do it , uh , in unison this time ? 
D:  Yeah , that 's fine . 
A:  Yeah . That 's fine . 
F:  No ? 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  That 's what we did last time . 
F:  Well , we did it in unison last time . 
C:  We did it  
E:  Oh we did ! Oh ! Do it separately , then . OK . Good deal . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
F:  Sure did . 
A:  Yes . 
D:  <clears throat> 
F:  Oh , and do you want us to mark the t roughly the time we start ? 
E:  <clears throat> 
E:  That is really what that time field is . I used to think it was the beginning of the meeting , but yes . Quite right . Quite right . That 'd be good . 
A:  Oh , OK . 
F:  Oh , OK . 
A:  Oh , alright .  
F:  So we have to  
C:  The time we start digits ? OK . 
D:  Hmm .  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . So , who wants to start ? 
E:  Well , I guess I 'll start . <laugh> OK . Transc - And the time is  OK . Um , 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <mouth> OK . Wonderful . Thank you very , very much . I really appreciate this . 
D:  <cough> 
F:  No problem . 
A:  Sure . 
E:  And , um , so now we get to turn the microphones off , and , uh  
C:  Sure .
