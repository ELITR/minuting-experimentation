A:  Sure . 
A:  Hmm ? 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . I see . 
A:  Hello . 
A:  OK . Mine 's good . 
A:  Wow ! 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Annette 's ? 
A:  Right . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Would you put a period after " so " ? 
A:  You would or you wouldn't ? 
A:  Yes . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  I think the second one where the " so " is all by itself , it 's like , " So that would be a problem .  So . " 
A:  You know , the " so " is like disconnected from the  
A:  Yeah , the first one is  like , the " so " is connected to the sentence , 
A:  and  " That 'd be a problem , so . " 
A:  You know , it 's  but the next one is like not  not connected to " that would be a problem " . 
A:  It 's like , " So . " 
A:  Yeah , less  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  I do that too . 
A:  I 
A:  Right . 
A:  Sometimes , though , it does sound like they ended a sentence 
A:  and then I do  
A:  like sometimes it 's just like , " That 'd be hard , so " . 
A:  You know , and but  and then ofte often it sounds like they were trying to think of something else to say , 
A:  but they couldn't really , you know  
A:  And then they get interrupted and then I put a dash . 
A:  You know , but I never usually put period and then new word " so " unless it 's like , end of the sentence and then , " So . " 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . That 's always one of the hardest parts about the native speakers , 
A:  is you don't know exactly like how to do the punctuation 
A:  because their intonation is totally different . 
A:  I mean  Non - native speakers is what I meant . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . That 's true . 
A:  Right . Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mmm , not " twosome gruesome " . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , sometimes they p they usually put them in prethen parentheses , 
A:  and you think to yourself , " You were way off , 
A:  but at least you knew you were way off . " 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh , " groups of " , 
A:  " gruesome " . 
A:  You 've got the , uh , " S " in the middle . 
A:  " Gruesome " . 
A:  Yeah . It 's both labial  at the end . 
A:  Gruesome  groups of  gruesome  groups of 
A:  Maybe the " P " wasn't pronounced very well , 
A:  like " groups of " 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , that 's really hard , 
A:  th to not be able to go and listen to the other channels and figure out the context of what it 's occurring in . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Painful . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  They were painful . 
A:  Oh yeah . 
A:  And then you see it , 
A:  and off with the headphones ! 
A:  Oh yeah . 
A:  Oh yeah . Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  You know what I would think would be a really n um , neat feature for the interface ? 
A:  Some sort of backwards tab 
A:  where it could go backwards without you having to go up and do it manually , 
A:  and , you know , press the button and " juh - juh - juh - juh - juh - juh - juh " . 
A:  Cuz if you miss something  and you wanna go back to it , it 's such a  such a hassle . 
A:  It 'd be so nice if there was just some sort of like , you know , uh , opposite of tab that you could hit , that it would just sort of move backwards . 
A:  There wouldn't even have to be any , um  
A:  I know . 
A:  It w you wouldn't even have to have the audio . 
A:  That 's not  I wouldn't  I mean  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right 
A:  Oh yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , some  
A:  Yeah , some timebins are humongous , 
A:  and if you miss it , you know , you 've gotta go back and find it , 
A:  and dragging it and looking for it and you may not be able to see it , even . 
A:  You know ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Really ? Oh , I do that with the keyboard . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  " Return " 
A:  and then  
A:  and then " shift " 
A:  " backspace " . 
A:  That 's  that 's what I do , 
A:  yeah . 
A:  I do it all on the keyboard . 
A:  Oh really ? 
A:  I don't do that either . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  And  and then collapse it . 
A:  I did that so much . 
A:  Yeah . That would be nice . 
A:  Yeah . I 'm rather used to it now , though . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . <laugh> You 're so scared , 

A:  To  to hold shift down while you 're backspacing ? 
A:  Like  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  You 're typing capitals , and you 're backspacing , and you 're like " <mock gasp> Oh , take the shift off ! 
A:  I 'll collapse everything ! " 
A:  I totally do that now . 
A:  Oh yeah . 
A:  Or vice versa , yeah . 
A:  Th - that backspace and the little  
A:  and the  th yeah , that little evil <laugh> apostrophe that keeps showing up . 
A:  " I don't want you ! " 
A:  Oh , yeah . 
A:  Um , <laugh> yeah , it 's one of the backspaces on the keyboards that most of us are probably used to . 
A:  So you wanna backspace and you get apostrophe , apostrophe , apostrophe , apostrophe . 
A:  Yeah , t you 're like , " No ! " 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . I  I 'm used to it now too . 
A:  OK . 
A:  The PC one ? 
A:  I I 'm not sure which one is which . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I mean like , when I first had started working I would have definitely wanted the PC keyboard , 
A:  but now I 'm  I 'm just used to it . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  It 's the one in  in that corner , right ? 
A:  That  that has the PC  

A:  Yeah , r Yeah , that 's  that one 's got the  the PC keyboard , 
A:  and then the two on those sides have the , um , SUN keyboard . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yes . 
A:  Uh , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Exactly , exactly . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh , that 's true . 
A:  I forgot about that one , 
A:  yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  I 'm  
A:  Oh wow . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Nn - nnn .  No . 
A:  This was a different interface entirely ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Oh wow . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Oh wow . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Oh , right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yep . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  I didn't know about that . 
A:  Really ? 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Oh that ! 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh . Does  
A:  That doesn't  
A:  Yeah , that skips  
A:  Oh , is that what you 're talking about ? 
A:  If you use that  
A:  I 've never used  been able to use that 
A:  cuz it  I s feel like it skips such huge portions . 
A:  Maybe we do . 
A:  Oh , I d I  I  Yeah , I wouldn't  
A:  I wouldn't use that unless I was trying to get to a whole different part of the  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Uh , right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  No ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . I like those . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  M yeah , the ones that  where they 're talking about linguistic things , though , are great . 
A:  I love those . 
A:  I like those  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh my . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Now you did it again ! 
A:  Stop torturing them ! 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Sorry . 
A:  Oh yeah , I had that one . 
A:  Oh yeah . 
A:  Yeah , 
A:  that was fun . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I don't even wanna , like , try to repeat what he said 
A:  because I don't wanna put the transcriber through it again . 
A:  But they actually had a big list of , like , things that people had transcribed 
A:  and then they were reading one  them one by one 
A:  and being , like , " What 's this ? 
A:  This ? " 
A:  You know , and then doing the sounds , 
A:  and then , " This sound must be this sound ! 
A:  This sound must be this ! " 
A:  u u I had  yeah , I had one like that too . 
A:  I had 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I had one where they were just  they were just , like , talking about each word , you know , 
A:  and they were saying  they were just describing the word over and over again , 
A:  and just the q the quotes around the word were driving me crazy . When they  kn knowing 
A:  when to put the quotes and when  
A:  And then they were talking about like the difference between " uh " when it 's " a "  or when it 's " uh " , 
A:  and at some point they were saying it so much , I didn't know how to transcribe it anymore . 
A:  I was like , " I don't know if you 're saying " a " or " uh " anymore " . 
A:  Oh , thank you . 
A:  It was fun . 
A:  I 'm fine . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Oh wow . 
A:  Wow ! 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Definitely . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh yeah ! <laugh> That 's fun ! 
A:  Oh really ? 
A:  I still do that . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh , oh . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Huh . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  I don't think I 've ever heard it . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Huh . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  That 's true . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I don't know what  I am never sure whether or not to transcribe , um , a difference with , like , " hmm " ,  you know , and " hmm ! " . 
A:  Like , how do you transcribe " hmm ! " ? 
A:  Yeah ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  W what about pre transcribing it , um , " HMPH " ? 
A:  What about transcribing it that way , 
A:  like " hmph " ? 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  I yeah . I guess it could have  two meanings , sort of . 
A:  Yeah . Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  That 's funny . 
A:  " Ho - ho - ho " ? 
A:  Oh , that is too much fun . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Oh yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  A lot of times , though , the breaths are , um , results of bad segmentation , 
A:  and there 's a segmentation of nothing , 
A:  and so they just write it as a breath when it 's clearly not a breath . 
A:  And I usually always take those out . 
A:  I mean , usually , um , it seems like the segmenter , um , often just sort of , um , segments  
A:  when there 's really long spaces ,  it segments random spaces in between . 
A:  And th you know , they get that 
A:  and there 's nothing there , 
A:  so they m s mark it as a breath when it 's really actually nothing . 
A:  So usually I take those out . 
A:  Right . Right . Exactly , exactly . 
A:  Exactly . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh really ? 
A:  Oh , I always get  I always get " breath " . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Hmm ! 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I think , um , silences are generally like <inbreath> not good in conversation too . 
A:  Cuz once you get a sil 
A:  You know , it  it  it 's to your benefit to  to try to get in right when you think they 're done 
A:  because if there 's a silence , not only is it awkward ,  but then that sort of cues everybody to start thinking of a new topic to stop the silence , 
A:  and then you don't get to talk about what you wanted to talk about  because the whole subject has changed . 
A:  You know ? 
A:  S 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  That 's what I usually do too . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah .  I put in the " X "s . 
A:  I put in  if it 's , um , unintelligible I put  I count how many syllables and then I put in " six X "  
A:  Oh . 
A:  Right . 
A:  That will have to be transcribed with little , uh , symbols . 
A:  Right . 
A:  You 've ruined the whole meeting ! 
A:  We can't transcribe any of it now ! 
A:  OK .  Right . 
A:  Hmm  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh , you have ? 
A:  I 've never heard the swearword versions . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Then again , I always think that it 's closer to stick with the " X 
A:  because it 's , like , how effective is , you know , the Roman alphabet at deciphering all the sounds that a human can make . 
A:  You know , it 's not the IPA 
A:  and  it 's just , I  I just sort of think , um , it 's best to leave it with " X 
A:  because I  <inbreath> y English orthography conventions are just so , you know , uncertain anyway in the first place , 
A:  and , um  
A:  you know , I  I usually only use them when I  I know that , um , the person was trying to make a word . 
A:  I mean , I know that the  the word they were trying to say 
A:  and that they were stuttering that , 
A:  then I feel fine just you know , writing out the letters . 
A:  But otherwise , I sort of don't feel right trying to write them out 
A:  because I feel like it 's , um  
A:  you can't really  
A:  Yeah , you can't really spell those things with the R with the Roman alphabet , 
A:  you know ? 
A:  It 's  it was only set up for  
A:  it was set up for a different purpose , you know . 
A:  Not necessarily so phonological . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mmm  
A:  Oh yeah . 
A:  I always  
A:  I often transcribe that as " or " . 
A:  I always thought that was " or " sort of with a strange pronunciation . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Oh , I don't get that one . 
A:  Right . 
A:  R 
A:  Right . 
A:  OK . 
A:  m OK . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Wait . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Right . Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh , right . 
A:  They used " mumble " for  
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  The number " X " . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . That 's fine . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yes . 
A:  Oh , OK . 
A:  Oh , alright . 
A:  Oh . Right . 
A:  Sure .
