E:  Thanks . 
E:  Is that voiced or unvoiced ? 
E:  These poor transcribers . 
E:  Is there any way to change that in the software ? 
E:  Where like you just don't  like if you  if it starts catching zeros , like in the driver or something  
E:  in the card , or somewhere in the hardware  
E:  Where if you start seeing zeros on w across one channel , you just add some <breath> random , @ @  noise floor  
E:  like a small noise floor . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Huh ! 
E:  Did he mean face  like face - to - face ? 
E:  Or  ? 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  That 's  
E:  That 's me . 
E:  That 's right . 
E:  Yeah , we 're gonna be looking at that . 
E:  I 'd like to see that reference too . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's w That 's what I do . 
E:  Um  
E:  I 
E:  And , Andreas , um , sampled ? 
E:  I think so . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Um , so either we should regenerate the original <breath> versions ,   or um , we should just make a note of it . 
E:  Yeah , that 's the first meeting I cut both versions . 
E:  Just to check which w if there is a significant difference . 
E:  They 're all downsampled , 
E:  yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So  
E:  Probably by tomorrow 
E:  I can  
E:  I 'll send you an email . 
E:  Yeah , 
E:  because I mean  I I think Liz decided to go ahead with the  downsampled versions cuz we can  There was no s like , r significant difference . 
E:  It does take up less disk space , 
E:  and apparently it did even better  than the original  than the original versions , 
E:  which you know , is just , probably random . 
E:  But , um  they probably w want the originals . 
E:  Hey mon hafta booga . 
E:  Yeah , I have to go as well . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Thanks .
