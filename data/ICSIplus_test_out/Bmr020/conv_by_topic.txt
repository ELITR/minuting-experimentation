C:  <mike noise> 
A:  OK , we 're recording . 
F:  We can say the word " zero " all we want , but just  
G:  <sipping> 
G:  I 'm doing some <breath> 
G:  square brackets , coffee sipping , square brackets . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> <breath> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> <breath> 
E:  <laugh-breath> 
B:  That 's not allowed , I think .  <laugh> Curly brackets . <laugh> Oops .  <laugh-breath> 
D:  <breath> 
C:  <breath> Cur - curly brackets . <laugh> <breath> 
G:  <coffee sipping> Mmm !  <mouth> 
E:  Is that voiced or unvoiced ? 
F:  Curly brackets . Well , <breath-laugh> correction for transcribers . Yeah . <breath> 
A:  Curly brackets . Right . 
G:  Gar - darn !  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <breath> 
C:  Channel two . Yeah .  <breath> 
A:  <mouth> Do we use square brackets for anything ? 
F:  <inbreath> u 
E:  These poor transcribers . 
C:  Uh  <breath> 
C:  <breath> Not ri not right now . I mean  No . <mike noise> 
G:  <sipping> 
A:  <cough> 
F:  <breath> u 
D:  There 's gonna be some zeros from this morning 's meeting because I noticed that 
F:  <mike noise> 
D:  Barry , I think maybe you turned your mike off before the digits were  Oh , was it during digits ? Oh , so it doesn't matter . <breath> 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  Yeah .  
B:  So it 's not  it 's not that bad if it 's at the end , but it 's  in the beginning , it 's  bad . 
A:  It 's still not a good idea . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah .  
A:  Yeah , you wanna  you wanna keep them on so you get  good noise  
A:  noise floors , <breath> 
C:  That 's interesting .  
A:  through the whole meeting . 
C:  <breath> 
F:  Uh , I probably just should have left it on . Yeah I did have to run , but   <breath> 
C:  Hmm .  
G:  <mike noise> 
E:  Is there any way to change that in the software ? 
A:  Change what in the software ? 
E:  Where like you just don't  like if you  if it starts catching zeros , like in the driver or something  
E:  <breath> 
E:  in the card , or somewhere in the hardware  
E:  Where if you start seeing zeros on w across one channel , you just add some <breath> random , 
G:  <sipping> 
E:  @ @  
F:  <tap sound> 
E:  noise floor  like a small noise floor . 
A:  I mean certainly we could do that , but I don't think that 's a good idea . We can do that in post - processing if  if the application needs it . 
G:  <blowing air, perhaps to cool coffee> 
E:  Yeah . <breath> 
F:  Well , I  u I actually don't know what the default  is anymore as to how we 're using the  the front - end stuff but  
B:  Manual post - processing .  <breath> 
G:  <sipping> 
F:  for  for  when we use the ICSI front - end ,  
G:  <breath> <blowing air, perhaps to cool coffee> 
F:  but um , <breath> 
A:  As an argument .  
F:  there is an  there is an o an option in  in RASTA , which , <breath> um , <breath> 
F:  in when I first put it in , 
F:  uh , back in the days when I actually wrote things , uh , <laugh-breath> 
G:  <blowing air, perhaps to cool coffee> 
E:  <laugh-breath> 
F:  I  did actually put in a random bit or so that was in it , but 
E:  OK . 
F:  <breath> then I realized that putting in a random bit was equivalent to adding uh  adding flat spectrum , 
F:  <breath> 
E:  Right . 
F:  and it was a lot faster to just add a constant to the  <laugh> to the spectrum . So then I just started doing that instead of calling " rand "  or something , so . 
E:  Mmm . 
G:  <blowing air> 
G:  <swallowing and breathing> 
E:  OK . 
E:  Right . 
F:  <laugh> 
F:  So it d it does that . <mike noise on "that"> 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  Gee ! Here we all are ! 


A:  <mouth> Uh , so the only agenda items were Jane  was Jane wanted to talk about some of the IBM 
F:  There 's an agenda ? 
G:  <blowing air> 
G:  <sipping> 
A:  transcription process . I sort of <breath> 
A:  condensed the three things you said into that . 
G:  <blowing air> 
A:  <breath> And then just  I only have like , this afternoon and maybe tomorrow morning to get anything done before I go to Japan for ten days . 
A:  <breath> 
A:  So if there 's anything that n absolutely , desperately needs to be done , you should let me know now . 
C:  <mike noise> 
F:  <inbreath> 


G:  So , 
F:  or more . 
G:  uh , and that was basically it . And  and we  so we wrote this and then , <breath> we found we were at six pages , and then we started <breath while smiling> 
B:  Oops .   
G:  cutting furiously and <laugh> threw out half of the <breath> material again , and uh played with the LaTeX stuff and  <breath> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  uh , and  until it fi <breath>  
A:  Made the font smaller and the narrows longer . <laugh> 
B:  Font smaller , yeah . <laugh> 
G:  No , no . W well , d you couldn't really make everything smaller but we s we put  <breath> Oh , I  I  
D:  <breath> <clears throat> 
B:  Put the abstract end .  
G:  you know the  the gap between the two columns is like ten millimeters , so I d 
A:  Took out white space . 
B:  <mouth> Yeah . 
G:  shrunk it to eight millimeters and that helped some . And stuff like that . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  Anyway . <breath> 
G:  So the paper 's on - line and 
G:  y I  I think I uh  
G:  I CC ' ed a message to Meeting Recorder with the URL so you can 
A:  Yep .  <breath> 
F:  Yeah . 
G:  get it .  
A:  Printed it out , haven't read it yet .  


F:  Uh , and you just sent off a 
F:  Eurospeech paper , so . 
G:  Right . 
G:  I hope they accept it . I mean , I  <breath> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Right . 
G:  both actu as  as a submission and  <laugh> you know , as a paper . 
G:  <breath> 
G:  Um  but  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> Yeah , I guess you  first you have to do the first one , and then  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  <clears throat> but  <breath> 
A:  Well yeah , you sent it in  late . Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  We actually exceeded the delayed deadline by o another day , so . 
G:  <cough> 
B:  Oops .  <breath> 
F:  Oh they  they had some extension that they announced or something ? 
G:  Well yeah . Liz had sent them a note saying " could we please  have another "   I don't know , " three days " or something , and 
G:  they said yes . <inbreath-laugh> 
D:  And then she said " Did I say three ? I meant four . "  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <mouth> Oh , that was the other thing uh , 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh>  
G:  But u <breath> 
A:  uh , Dave Gelbart sent me email , I think he sent it to you too ,  that um , 
A:  there 's a special topic , 
A:  section in si in Eurospeech on new , 
A:  corp corpors corpora . <breath> 
A:  <breath> 
A:  And it 's not due until like May fifteenth . <breath> 
G:  <blowing air> 
F:  Oh this isn't the Aurora one ? It 's another one ? 
A:  No . It 's a different one . 
B:  No it 's  Yeah . 
E:  Huh ! 
B:  Yeah .  
A:  <mouth> And uh , <breath> 
F:  Oh ! 
B:  I got this mail from  
A:  I s forwarded it to Jane as I thought being the most relevant person . 
A:  Um  
A:  So , I thought it was highly relevant  have you  did you look at the URL ? 
F:  That 's  
C:  Yeah I 'm  
C:  Yeah . I think so too . 
C:  <mouth> <breath> 
C:  Um , I haven't gotten over to there yet , but what  our discussion yesterday , I really  I  I wanna submit one . 
A:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  Was this  SmartKom message ? <breath> 
C:  Yeah .  
B:  I think  Christoph Draxler sent this , yeah . 
C:  And , you offered to  to join me , if you want me to . Yeah . 
A:  I 'll help , but obviously I can't , 
G:  I think several people  sent this , yeah . 
C:  <mouth> Yeah , that 's right . 
A:  really do , 
A:  most of it , so . 
B:  Yeah .  
C:  Uh - huh .  
G:  <sipping> Yeah . 
A:  But any  any help you need I can certainly provide . 
F:  Well , 
F:  that 's  that 's a great idea .  
G:  <breath-sip> 


G:  Well  
G:  there  there were some interesting results in this paper , though . For instance that Morgan  uh , accounted for fifty - six percent of the Robustness meetings in terms of number of words . 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  Wow . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
C:  In  in terms of what ? 
C:  In term  
G:  Number of words . <breath-laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  One ? Wow ! OK . 
A:  <breath> That 's just cuz he talks really fast . <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
C:  <breath> Do you mean , 
F:  n No .  
B:  Oh . Short words .  <laugh> 
C:  because  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  I know  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <inbreath while smiling> 
C:  is it partly , eh , c correctly identified words ? 
C:  Or is it   
G:  No . Well , according to the transcripts . 
C:  or just overall volume ? 
A:  <mouth> But re well regardless . 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh . OK . 
A:  I think it 's  he 's  he 's in all of them , 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  I mean , we didn't mention Morgan by name we just  
A:  and he talks a lot . 
B:  <cough-breath> 
F:  Well  we have now , but  <laugh> 
A:  One participant . 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  We  we  we  something about  
A:  <mouth> <breath> Did you identify him as a senior  member ? 
G:  No , we as identify him as the person dominating the conversation . <laugh> 
F:  Well . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  <breath> I mean I get these AARP things , but I 'm not se really senior yet , but  
C:  OK .  
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  Right  
B:  <rasping noise> <breath> 
G:  Hmm . <inbreath> 
F:  Um , 
F:  but uh , other than that delightful result , what was the rest of the paper about ? <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  Um , well it was about  it had three sections uh  three kinds of uh 
F:  You sent it to me but I haven't seen it yet . 
G:  results , if you will . <breath> 
G:  Uh , the one was that the  just the  the amount of overlap um , 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  The good , the bad , and the ugly . 
G:  <breath> s in terms of  in terms of number of words and also we computed something called a " spurt " , 
A:  <breath while smiling> 
G:  <breath> 
G:  which is essentially a stretch of speech with uh , no pauses exceeding five hundred milliseconds . 
G:  <breath> 
G:  Um , and we computed how many overlapped i 
G:  uh 
G:  spurts there were and how many overlapped words there were . <mouth> 
D:  <page turning> 
G:  Um , for four different  corpora , the Meeting Recorder meetings , the Robustness meetings 
G:  <breath> 
G:  Switchboard and CallHome , 
G:  <mouth> and , found  and sort of compared the numbers . <breath> 
A:  <mouth> 
G:  Um , 
G:  and found that the , 
G:  uh , 
G:  you know , as you might expect the Meeting Recorder  meetings had the most overlap <breath> uh , but next were Switchboard and CallHome , which both had roughly the same , 
F:  <mike noise> 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  <mouth> 
G:  almost identical in fact ,  <breath> 
G:  and the Robustness meetings were  had the least , so  <breath> 
G:  One sort of unexpected 
G:  result there is that uh 
A:  I 'm surprised .  
G:  two - party telephone conversations have <breath> about the same amount of overlap , 
G:  sort of in gen you know  order of magnitude - wise as , uh  as face - to - face meetings with multiple  
A:  <mouth> I have  I had better start changing all my slides !  
G:  Yeah . <breath> Also , I  in the Levinson , the pragmatics book ,  in you know , uh , textbook , <breath> there 's  I found this great quote where he says <breath> 
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  <sniff> <breath> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  you know  
G:  you know , how people  it talks about how uh  how  how people are so good at turn taking , and <breath> so  they 're so good that <breath> 
G:  generally , u the overlapped speech does not  is less than five percent . <laugh> So , 
C:  <mouth> Oh , that 's interesting . Yeah . 
G:  this is way more than five percent . <breath> Um . <mouth> 
E:  Did he mean face  like face - to - face ? Or  ?  
G:  <breath> Well , in real conversations , everyday conversations . 
E:  Hmm . 
G:  It 's s what these conversation analysts have been studying for years and years there . 
C:  Mm - hmm .  
E:  <swallowing sounds> 
C:  Mm - hmm .  
C:  <mouth> <breath> 
C:  Well , of course , no , it doesn't necessarily go against what he said , cuz he said " generally speaking " . In order to  
B:  <breath> But  
G:  <breath> 
A:  Hmm . 
C:  to go against that kind of a claim you 'd have to big canvassing . 
B:  And in f 
G:  Well , he  he made a claim  Well  
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <mouth> <breath> Well  
C:  <breath> 
F:  Yeah , we  we have pretty limited sample here . 
A:  all So  
B:  But  
B:  Five percent of time or five percent of what ? 
C:  @ @  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , I was gonna ask that too . 
G:  Well it 's time . So  <breath> but still  but still  u 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Exactly . It 's  i it 's not against his conclusion , it just says that it 's a bi bell curve , and that , 
B:  Yeah , so  
C:  <breath> 
C:  you have something that has a nice range , in your sampling . 
G:  Yeah . So there are slight  There are differences in how you measure it , but still it 's  <breath> You know , the difference between um  
G:  between that number and what we have in meetings , which is more like , <breath> 
A:  <mouth> <breath> 
C:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  you know , close to  in meetings like these , uh  you know , close to twenty percent . <breath> 
F:  <breath> But what was it like , say , in the Robustness meeting , for instance ? 
C:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  That  
A:  <mouth> <breath> But  
G:  @ @  
G:  Robustness meeting ? It was <breath> about half of the r 
G:  So , <breath> in terms of number of words , it 's like seventeen or eigh eighteen percent for the Meeting Recorder meetings and <breath> about half that for , <breath> 
F:  Maybe ten percent ? 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  uh , the Robustness .  
A:  <mouth> <breath> But I don't know if that 's really a fair way of comparing between , 
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  <mike noise> 
A:  multi - party , 
A:  conversations and two - party conversations . 
B:  <mouth> Then  then  then you have to  
A:  Yeah . I  I  I don't know . I mean that 's just something  
F:  <mike noise> 
D:  Yeah , I just wonder if you have to normalize by the numbers of speakers or something . 
C:  Yeah .  
B:  Then  Yeah , then normalize by  by something like that , yeah . 
G:  <breath> Well , we didn't get to look at that , but this obvious thing to see if  if there 's a dependence on the number of uh  participants . <breath> 
C:  Yeah , that 's a good point . Yeah . 
C:  Good idea .  
A:  <mouth> I mean  <mouth> 
A:  I bet there 's a weak dependence . I 'm sure it 's  it 's not a real strong one . 
B:  Yeah .  
G:  Right . 
A:  Right ? Because you 
D:  Cuz not everybody talks . Yeah . 
G:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  You have a lot of  a lot of two - party , 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  Right . 
A:  subsets within the meeting . Well regardless  it 's an interesting result regardless . 
C:  Uh - huh .  
G:  So  
G:  Right . And  and  and then  and we also d computed this both with and without backchannels , so you might think that backchannels have a special status because they 're essentially just  
C:  Yes , that 's right . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <mouth> Uh - huh . 
A:  <laugh> So , did  we all said " uh - huh " and nodded at the same time , so . <breath-laugh> 
G:  R right . 
G:  <breath> But , even if you take out all the backchannels  so basically you treat backchannels l as nonspeech , as pauses , <breath> you still have significant overlap . You know , it goes down from maybe  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  For Switchboard it goes down from  I don't know  f 
G:  um   
G:  I don't know  f fourteen percent of the words to maybe 
G:  <breath> 
G:  uh 
G:  I don't know , eleven percent or something  it 's  it 's not a dramatic change , so it 's  <breath> 
A:  Mm - hmm .  


G:  Anyway , so it 's uh  
G:  That was  that was one set of  results , and then the second one was just basically the  <breath> 
C:  <mouth> <breath> 
C:  Hmm .  
G:  the stuff we had in the  in the HLT paper on how overlaps effect the  recognition performance . 
A:  Nope .  
G:  <breath> 
A:  Right .  
F:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  And we rescored things um , a little bit more carefully . We also fixed the transcripts in  in numerous ways . 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  <breath> Uh , but mostly we added one  
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  one number , which was 
G:  <breath> 
G:  what if you  uh , basically score ignoring all  
G:  <breath> 
G:  So  so the  the conjecture from the HLT results was that <breath> 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  most of the added recognition error is from insertions <breath> due to background speech . 
G:  <breath> 
G:  So , we scored <breath> all the recognition results , <breath> 
G:  uh , in such a way that 
G:  the uh  <breath> <mouth> 
A:  Oh by the way , who 's on channel four ? You 're getting a lot of breath . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's   
B:  I j was just wondering . Yeah .  
E:  That 's me . 
G:  uh , well Don 's been working hard . @ @ <laugh> 
E:  That 's right . 
E:  <laugh>  
G:  OK , so  <breath> so if you have the foreground speaker 
G:  speaking here , and then there 's some background speech , may be overlapping it somehow , <breath> 
G:  um , and this is the time bin 
G:  that we used , <breath> 
G:  then of course you 're gonna get insertion errors here and here . Right ? <breath> So we scored everything , and I must say the NIST scoring tools are pretty nice for this ,  
A:  Right . 
G:  <breath> where you just basically ignore everything outside of the , <breath> 
G:  uh , region that was deemed to be foreground speech . 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  And where that was we had to use the t forced alignment , 
G:  uh , results from s for  so  <breath> 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  That 's somewhat  that 's somewhat subject to error , but still we  we  <breath> 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  Uh , Don did some ha hand - checking <breath> 
G:  and  and we think that  based on that , we think that the results are you know , valid , although of course , some error is gonna be in there . 
G:  <breath> 
G:  But basically what we found is after we take out these regions  so we only score the regions that were certified as foreground speech ,  <breath> 
G:  the recognition error went down to almost <breath> 
G:  uh , the  level of the non - overlapped  speech . 
G:  <breath> 
G:  So that means that <breath> even if you do have background speech , if you can somehow separate out or find where it is , 
A:  That 's great . 
G:  <breath> uh , the recognizer does a good job , 
B:  Yeah .  
G:  even though there is this back <breath> 
A:  <mouth> <breath> Yeah , I guess that doesn't surprise me , because , 
A:  with the close - talking mikes , the  the signal will be so much stronger . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Right .  
G:  Mm - hmm .  
F:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  Um , so  <breath> 
A:  <mouth> 
A:  What  what sort of normalization do you do ? 
G:  Uh , well , we just  
G:  @ @  
G:  we do  u you know , vit 
A:  I mean in you recognizer , in the SRI recognizer . 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  Well , we do uh , VTL  <breath> 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  vocal tract length normalization , w and we uh  
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  you know , we  we uh , <mouth> 
G:  make all the features have zero mean and unit variance . <breath> 
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  <breath> 
F:  And   
A:  <mouth> Over an entire utterance ? 
G:  Over  over the entire c over the entire channel . Over the  but you know . <breath> 
A:  Or windowed ? 
B:  Don't  train   
A:  <mouth> 
A:  Hmm . 
G:  Um , now we didn't re - align the recognizer for this . We just took the old  <breath> 
G:  So this is actually a sub - optimal way of doing it , right ? So we took the old recognition output and we just scored it differently . <breath> 
F:  Right . 
A:  <mouth> Right . 
G:  So the recognizer didn't have the benefit of knowing where the foreground speech  a start 
F:  Were you including the  the lapel  in this ? 
G:  Yes . 
F:  And did the  did  did the la did the  the problems with the lapel go away also ? Or  
G:  Um , it  Yeah . It u not per  I mean , not completely , but yes , dramatically . <breath> 
F:  fray for  for insertions ? 
F:  Less so . 
G:  So we have to um  
F:  I mean , you still  
G:  <mouth> Well I should bring the  should bring the table with results . Maybe we can look at it  Monday . 
F:  I would presume that you still would have somewhat higher error with the lapel for insertions than  Yeah . 
G:  Yes . 
G:  It 's  It 's  Yes . Yeah . <breath> 
F:  <breath> Cuz again , looking forward to the non - close miked case , I think that we s still  <breath> 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  I 'm not looking forward to it . 
F:  i it 's the high signal - to - noise ratio 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  Right . 
F:  <mike noise> here that  that helps you . 
G:  u s Right . 


G:  So  so that was number  that was the second set of  
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  uh , the second section . And then , <breath> 
G:  the third thing was , we looked at , <breath> <mouth> 
G:  uh , what we call " interrupts " , although that 's  that may be <breath> a misnomer , but basically <breath> we looked at cases where  <mouth> <breath> 
G:  Uh , so we  we used the punctuation from the original transcripts <breath> 
G:  and we inferred the beginnings and ends of sentences . 
G:  So , you know    
C:  <mouth> <breath> 
G:  Um  
C:  Di - did you use upper - lower case also , or not ? 
G:  Hmm ? 
C:  U upper lower case or no ? OK . 
G:  No , we only used , you know , uh periods , uh , question marks and  exclamation .  <breath> 
G:  And we know that there 's th that 's not a very g 
G:  I mean , we miss a lot of them , but  but it 's f i i 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  Yeah . That 's OK but  
C:  <breath> <mouth> 
C:  Comma also or not ? 
G:  <mouth> No commas . No .  
C:  <mouth> OK .  
G:  <mouth> And then <breath> 
G:  we looked at locations where , 
G:  uh , <breath> 
G:  if you have overlapping speech and someone else starts a sentence , 
G:  you know , where do these  where do other people start their <breath> turns  not turns really , but you know , sentences , <breath> um  <mouth> 
B:  Ah .  <breath> 
G:  So we only looked at cases where there was a foreground speaker <breath> and then 
G:  at the to at the  so the  the foreground speaker started into their sentence and then someone else started later . 
G:  OK ? <breath> 
B:  Somewhere in between the start and the end ? OK . 
G:  And so what   Sorry ? 
B:  <breath> 
B:  Somewhere in between the start and the end of the foreground ? 
G:  Yes . <breath> Uh , so that such that there was overlap between the two sentences .  <breath> 
B:  Yeah . 
G:  So , the  the question was how can we  what can we say about the places where the second or  or actually , several second speakers , <breath> 
G:  um  start their  " interrupts " , as we call them . 
D:  Three words from the end .  
A:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> w 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <mouth> At pause boundaries . <breath while smiling> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  And we looked at this in terms of um  <mouth> <breath> 
A:  <breath> On T - closures , only . <laugh> 
F:  <laugh>  
G:  So  so we had  <laugh> we had um u 
C:  <laugh-breath> 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  to  for  for the purposes of this analysis , we tagged the word sequences , and  and we time - aligned them . 
G:  <breath> 
G:  Um , <breath> and we considered it interrupt  if it occurred in the middle of a word , we basically  
G:  you know , considered that to be a interrupt 
G:  as if it were at  at the beginning of the word . So that , <breath> 
G:  if any part of the word was overlapped , it was considered an interrupted  word . <breath> 
F:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  And then we looked at the  the locatio the , <mouth> 
G:  um , 
G:  you know , the features that  the tags because we had tagged these word strings ,  <breath> um , that  that occurred right before these  these uh , interrupt locations . <breath> 
B:  Tag by uh 
G:  And the tags we looked at are <breath> 
G:  the spurt tag , which basically says  <breath> 
G:  or actually  Sorry . 
G:  End of spurt . So  <breath> 
G:  whether 
G:  there was a pause essentially here , because spurts are a  defined as being you know , five hundred milliseconds or longer pauses , 
G:  <breath> 
G:  and then we had things like discourse markers , 
G:  <mouth> uh , backchannels , 
G:  <breath> 
G:  uh , disfluencies . 
G:  um , 
G:  uh , filled pauses  <breath> So disfluen the D 's are for , <breath> 
G:  um , <mouth> 
G:  the interruption points of a disfluency , so , where you hesitate , or where you start the repair there .  
G:  <breath> Uh , what else do we had . Uh , repeated  you know , repeated words is another of that kind of disfluencies and so forth . <breath> So we had both the beginnings and ends of these  <breath> 
D:  <mike noise> 
G:  uh so , the end of a filled pause  
G:  and the end of a discourse marker .  
G:  And we just eyeballed  I mean <breath> 
G:  we didn't really hand - tag all of these things . We just  looked at the distribution of words , and so every <breath> " so yeah " , and " OK " , uh , and " uh - huh " were  were the  were deemed to be backchannels and <breath> " wow " and " so " and <breath> uh " right " , uh were 
G:  um   Not " right " . " Right " is a backchannel . But so , we sort of  just based on the lexical  <breath> 
G:  um , 
G:  identity of the words , we  we tagged them as one of these things . 
G:  <clears throat> 
G:  <mouth> And of course the d the interruption points we got from the original transcripts . 
G:  <breath> 
G:  So , and then we looked at the disti so we looked at the  distribution of these different kinds of tags , overall uh , and  and  and particularly at the interruption points . <breath> 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  And uh , we found that there is a marked difference so 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  <breath> that for instance after  
G:  so at the end after a discourse marker or after backchannel or after filled pause , you 're much more likely to be interrupted <breath> than before . 
G:  OK ? <breath> And also of course after spurt ends , which means basically in p inside pauses .  So pauses are always an opportunity for   <breath> 
G:  So we have this little histogram which shows these distributions and , <breath> um , 
D:  <breath> I wonder  
G:  you know , it 's  it 's  it 's not  No big surprises , but it is  sort of interesting from  
A:  It 's nice to actually measure it though . <breath> 
G:  Yeah . 
D:  I wonder about the cause and effect there . <breath> 
D:  In other words uh  if you weren't going to pause you  you will because you 're g being interrupted . <breath> 
G:  Well we 're ne <breath> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh  
G:  Right . There 's no statement about cause and effect . This is just a statistical correlation , yeah . 
D:  Yeah , right . No , no , no . Right , I  I see . Yeah .  
F:  But he  yeah , he 's  he 's right , y I mean maybe 
F:  you weren't intending to pause at all , but  <laugh> You were intending to stop for fifty - seven milliseconds , <laugh> but then Chuck came in and so you <laugh> paused for a second 
G:  Right . 
B:  @ @ 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  Right .  
D:  Yeah . 
G:  Right .  <breath> Anyway .  


D:  Wasn't there  wasn't there some result , Andreas  I  I thought maybe Liz presented this at some conference a while ago about <breath> uh , backchannels uh , <breath> 
F:  Yeah  <breath> 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  Mm - hmm .  
D:  and that they tend to happen when uh  the pitch drops . You know you get a falling pitch . 
G:  Yeah . Well  
D:  And so that 's when people tend to backchannel . Uh - i i do you rem  
G:  <breath> y We didn't talk about , uh , prosodic , uh , properties at all , although that 's  I  I take it that 's something that uh Don will  will look at now that we have the data and we have the alignment , so . <breath> 
D:  Right . Right . 
D:  But   
E:  Yeah , we 're gonna be looking at that . 
E:  <breath> 
G:  This is purely based on 
G:  you know the words and   
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  I have a reference for that though . 
D:  Oh you do . 
G:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh - huh .  
D:  So am I recalling correctly ? About   
G:  Anyway , so . 
C:  <mouth> <breath> 
C:  Well , I didn't know about Liz 's finding on that , 
F:  <mike noise> 
D:  Uh - huh . 
C:  but I know of another 
C:  paper that 
C:  talks about something 
D:  Hmm . 
C:  that   
E:  I 'd like to see that reference too . 
D:  <breath> It made me think about a cool little device that could be built <breath> 
C:  OK .  
D:  to uh  
F:  <mike noise> 
D:  to handle those people that call you on the phone and just like to talk and talk and talk .  <breath> 
D:  And you just have this little detector that listens for these <breath> drops in pitch and gives them the backchannel . 
D:  And so then you <breath> hook that to the phone and go off and do the <breath>  do whatever you r wanna do , while that thing keeps them busy . 
E:  <laugh> <mouth> <breath> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <mouth> Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh - huh . <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  Oh yeah . <breath> Well  
G:  <breath> There 's actually  uh there 's this a former student of here from Berkeley , Nigel  Nigel Ward .  Do you know him ? 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh - huh . Sure . Yeah .  
G:  <breath> He did a system uh , in  he  he lives in Japan now , and he did this backchanneling , automatic backchanneling system . It 's a very  <breath> 
F:  Right .  
D:  Oh ! <laugh> 
G:  So , exactly what you describe , but for Japanese . And it 's apparently  for Japa - in Japanese it 's really important that you backchannel . <breath> 
D:  Huh . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  It 's really impolite if you don't , and  <breath> 
G:  So .  
F:  Huh .  
F:  <breath> Actually for a lot of these people I think you could just sort of backchannel continuously and it would  pretty much be fine . <laugh> 
D:  It wouldn't matter ? Yeah . <laugh> Random intervals . <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . <breath> That 's w That 's what I do . 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  <mouth> There was  there was of course a Monty Python sketch with that . 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh-breath> 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  Where the barber who was afraid of scissors was playing a  a tape of clipping sounds , and saying " uh - huh " , " yeah " , <breath> " how about them sports teams ? "  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh-breath> 


G:  <breath> Um , uh one more thing . So I  I 'm actually  <breath> 
F:  Yeah . 
G:  about to send Brian Kingbury an email saying where he can find the  
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  the s 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  the m the material he wanted for the s for the speech recognition experiment , so  <breath> 
G:  but I haven't sent it out yet because actually my desktop locked up , like I can't type anything . <breath> Uh b so if there 's any 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  suggestions you have for that I was just gonna 
G:  send him the  
D:  Is it the same directory that you had suggested ? 
G:  <mouth> <breath> I made a directory . I called it um  
C:  <mouth> <breath> 
G:  Well this isn't   
C:  He still has his Unix account here , you know . 
G:  <mouth> <breath> He does ?  
C:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah but  but  but he has to  
C:  And he  and he 's  
C:  I 'd hafta add him to Meeting Recorder , I guess , but    
G:  he prefe he said he would prefer FTP <breath> 
C:  OK . 
G:  and also , um , the other person that wants it  There is one person at SRI who wants to look at the <breath> um , 
G:  you know , the uh  the data we have so far , <breath> 
C:  OK . 
G:  and so I figured that FTP is the best  approach .  <breath> 
G:  So what I did is I um  
G:  <mouth> <breath> 
G:  @ @  
G:  I made a n new directory 
G:  after Chuck said that would c that was gonna be 
G:  a good thing . <breath> 
G:  Uh , so it 's " FTP <breath>  pub  real "  Exactly . <breath> 
A:  Pub real .   <breath> 
G:  MTGC  
G:  What is it again ? CR  
A:  <laugh> Ask Dan Ellis . <laugh> 
F:  u R D  RDR , yeah . 
G:  Or  Yeah . Right ? The same  the same as the mailing list , and  Yeah . <breath> 
F:  Yeah , the   No vowels . Yeah  <breath> 
G:  Um , <breath> and then under there  
G:  Um actually  Oh and this directory , <breath> is not readable . It 's only uh , accessible . So , <mouth> in other words , to access anything under there , you have to <breath> be told what the name is . 
G:  So that 's sort of a g <breath> quick and dirty way of doing access control . So  <breath> 
A:  Right . 
F:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  uh , and the directory for this I call it I " ASR zero point one " because it 's sort of meant for recognition . 
F:  <laugh> 
F:  <mouth> So anyone who hears this meeting now knows the  <laugh> 
A:  Beta ? 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  And then  then in there I have a file that lists all the other <breath> files , so that someone can get that file and then know the file names and therefore download them . If you don't know the file names you can't  <breath> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  I mean you can  
F:  Is that a dash or a dot in there ? 
A:  Don't  don't  don't say . 
G:  Dash . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh>  
F:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath> 
E:  @ @  
G:  Anyway . <breath> So all I  all I was gonna do there was stick the  the transcripts after we  the way that we munged them for scoring , because that 's what 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  <mouth> <breath> 
G:  he cares about , and   <breath> 
G:  um , 
F:  <yawn> <mike noise> 
G:  and also  and then the  
A:  <breath> 
G:  the  waveforms that Don segmented . I mean , just basically tar them all up f I mean  
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  <sniff> 
G:  w for each meeting I tar them all into one 
G:  tar file and G - zip them and stick them there .  <breath> 
A:  <mouth> 
A:  I uh , 
G:  And so .  
A:  put digits in my own home directory  home FTP directory , but I 'll probably move them there as well . 
G:  Oh , OK .  
G:  OK . 
D:  So we could point Mari to this also for her <breath> 
E:  <clears throat> 
G:  Yeah . 
D:  March O - one 
D:  request ? 
G:  March O - one . Oh ! 
D:  Or   You n Remember she was  
G:  Oh she wanted that also ? 
D:  Well she was saying that it would be nice if we had  they had a  Or was she talking  Yeah . <breath> She was saying it would be nice if they had eh  the same set , so that when they did experiments they could compare . 
A:  <laugh-breath> 
G:  Right , but they don't have a recognizer even . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath> 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Um  
G:  But yeah , we can send  I can CC Mari on this so that she knows  
E:  I 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  <breath> So , for the thing that  We need to give Brian the beeps file ,  so I was gonna probably put it  
C:  <mouth> That 's good .  
G:  Right . 
A:  We can put it in the same place . Just put in another directory . 
D:  Yeah , it 
G:  Well , make ano make another directory . You don't n m Yeah . 
D:  I 'll make another directory . Yeah . Exactly . Yeah . 


E:  <mouth> And , Andreas , um , 
G:  Yeah .  
E:  sampled ?  
E:  <breath> 
G:  They are ? 
E:  I think so .  Yeah . 
G:  OK . 
E:  Um , so either we should regenerate the original <breath> versions ,   or um , we should just make a note of it . 
G:  Oh . 
G:  <breath> Beca - Well  
G:  OK , because in one directory there 's two versions . <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
E:  Yeah , that 's the first meeting I cut both versions . Just to check which w if there is a significant difference . 
G:  OK . 
G:  <breath> And so I  but  OK so  but for the other meetings it 's the downsampled version that you have . <breath> 
F:  <mike noise> 
E:  They 're all downsampled , yeah . 
G:  Oh , OK . 
G:  Oh that 's th important to know , OK so <breath> 
F:  <breath> 
G:  we should probably  uh  give them the non - downsampled versions . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So  
G:  OK . 
G:  Alright , then I 'll hold off on that and I 'll wait for you um  
E:  Probably by tomorrow I can  
G:  gen 
G:  OK .  
E:  I 'll send you an email . 
A:  <vocalized yawn> 
G:  Alright . 
G:  OK . Yeah , definitely they should have the full bandwidth version , yeah . 
A:  <breath> 
E:  Right . 
G:  OK .  
E:  Yeah , because I mean  I I think Liz decided to go ahead with the  downsampled versions cuz we can  There was no s like , r significant difference . 
G:  Well , it takes  it takes up less disk space , for one thing . 
E:  <breath> 
E:  It does take up less disk space , and apparently it did even better  than the original  than the original versions , which 
G:  <yawn> 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . Right . 
E:  you know , is just , 
G:  Yeah , it was a small difference but yeah .  
E:  probably random . 
E:  But , 
E:  um  they probably w want the originals . 
G:  Yeah . OK .   
G:  OK , good . Good that  
G:  Well , it 's a good thing that   


A:  <mouth> OK , I think we 're losing , 
A:  Don and Andreas at three - thirty , right ? 
G:  <mike noise> 
A:  <breath> OK .  
G:  Yeah . 
E:  Hey mon hafta booga .  
F:  So , 
F:  that 's why it was good to have Andreas , say these things but  <breath> 
F:  So , we should probably talk about the IBM transcription process stuff that   
C:  OK .  
C:  <mouth> <breath> 
F:  Hmm .  


C:  So , um you know that Adam created um , a b a script to generate the beep file ? 
F:  <mike noise> 
C:  To 
C:  then create 
C:  something to send to IBM .  <mike noise> <breath> And , um , 
C:  <breath> 
C:  you  you should probably talk about that . But  but you were gonna to use the  originally transcribed file because I tightened the time bins and that 's also the one that they had already <breath> in trying to debug the first stage of this .  <breath> 
C:  <breath> And uh , <breath> 
C:  my understanding was that , um  
F:  <mike noise> 
C:  I haven't  <breath> I haven't listened to it yet , but it sounded very good and  and I understand that you guys <breath> were going to have a meeting today , before this meeting . 
F:  <mike noise> 
A:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  <mouth> <breath> It was just to talk about how to generate it . 
A:  Um , just so that while I 'm gone , you can regenerate it if you decide to do it a different way . 
C:  Excellent . OK .  
A:  So uh , Chuck and Thilo should , 
A:  now more or less know how to generate the file and , 
A:  <breath> 
A:  the other thing Chuck pointed out is that , 
A:  um , 
A:  <breath> 
A:  since this one is hand - marked , 
A:  <breath> 
A:  there are discourse boundaries . 
C:  Mm - hmm . <mouth> OK .  
A:  Right ? So  so when one person is speaking , there 's breaks . 
A:  <breath> 
A:  Whereas Thilo 's won't have that . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <mouth> <breath> 
C:  Oh ! OK . Ah , interesting . Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  So what  what we 're probably gonna do is just write a script , 
A:  that if two , 
A:  chunks are very close to each other on the same channel we 'll just merge them . 
C:  Oh , sure . Yeah , sure . Makes sense . 
A:  <mouth> So , uh , and that will get around the problem of , 
A:  the , 
A:  <breath> 
A:  you know " one word beep , one word beep , one word beep , one word beep " . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Ah !  Clever . Yes . Clever . 
B:  And  And it will be more  more close  close to  to the version they will get afterwards  after @ @ . 
C:  Yeah . Excellent . 
D:  <breath> 
D:  Yeah , in fact after our meeting uh , this morning Thilo came in and said that <breath> 
C:  And that 's the purpose . 
D:  um , 
D:  there could be  other differences between <breath> 
D:  the uh  already transcribed meeting with the beeps in it and one that has  just r been run through his process . So tomorrow , 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  <breath> when we go to make the um  uh , chunked file <breath> for IBM , we 're going to actually compare the two . So he 's gonna run his process on that same meeting , 
F:  <sniff> 
C:  <delighted gasp> Great idea ! 
D:  and then we 're gonna do the beep - ify on both , and listen to them and see if we notice any real differences . <breath> 
G:  Beep - ify !  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <breath> OK , now one thing that prevented us from apply you  you from applying  Exactly . The training  So that is the training meeting . 
B:  Yeah , it 's the training meeting , but  
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , w and we know that . Wel - uh we just wanna if  if there 're any major differences between <breath> 
C:  OK . <breath> 
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  But , yeah  
C:  Uh - huh . 
B:  I only used the first twenty minutes for training , so we can <laugh> use the @ @ 
D:  doing it on the hand 
C:  <mouth> Oh , interesting . Ah ! OK . Interesting idea . 
B:  But it 's the same speakers and the same channels @ @ 
A:  Hmm .  <breath> 
G:  So this training meeting , uh w 
C:  Great . 
G:  un is that 
G:  uh  some data where we have uh very um , <mouth> 
G:  you know , accurate  time marks ? for  <breath> 
C:  <breath> I went back and hand - marked the  ba the bins , I ment I mentioned that last week . 
G:  OK , yeah . <breath> Because  
D:  But the  but there 's  yeah , but there is this one issue with them in that there 're  <breath> there are time boundaries in there that 
D:  occur in the middle of speech . 
D:  So  <breath> 
D:  Like when we went t to  um  
D:  When I was listening to the original file that Adam had , it 's like you  you hear a word then you hear a beep <breath> and then you hear the continuation of what is the same sentence . <breath> 
A:  <mouth> That 's on the other channel .  <breath> 
A:  That 's because of channel overlap . 
D:  Well , and  and so the  th 
C:  Hmm .  
D:  So there are these chunks that look like uh  <breath> 
A:  It 's  i <mike noise> 
D:  that have uh  
A:  <mouth> I mean that 's not gonna be true of the foreground speaker . That 'll only be if it 's the background speaker . 
D:  Right . So you 'll  you 'll have a chunk of , you know , channel <breath> A which starts at zero and ends at ten , 
F:  <mike noise> 
D:  and then the same channel starting at eleven , ending at fifteen , <breath> 
D:  and then again , starting at sixteen , ending at twenty . Right , so that 's three chunks where <breath> actually we w can just make one chunk out of that <breath> 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
D:  which is A , zero , twenty . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Sure . 
A:  That 's what I just said , yeah . 
C:  Sure . 
D:  Yeah . So I just wanted to make sure that it was clear . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <breath> So <breath> if you were to use these , you have to be careful not to pull out these individual  
C:  Yeah , I thought that was  Yeah . 


G:  Oh ! <breath> I mean it  
G:  Right , I mean w I mean what I would  I was interested in is having  <breath> 
G:  a se having time marks for the beginnings and ends of speech 
A:  <mouth> <breath> 
G:  by each speaker . 
A:  Well , that 's definitely a problem . <breath> 
G:  <breath> Uh , because we could use that to fine tune our alignment 
B:  <mike noise> 
G:  process  to make it more accurate . <breath> 
B:  <mike noise> 
D:  Yeah .  
A:  Battery . 
B:  Battery ? <breath> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  So  
G:  uh , it  I don't care that you know , there 's actually abutting 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  segments that we have to join together . That 's fine . <breath> But what we do care about is that <breath> 
D:  OK . 
G:  the beginnings and ends um  are actually close to the speech <breath> 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  inside of that  uh  
D:  Yeah , I think Jane tightened these up by hand . 
B:  <mike noise> 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  OK , so what is the  sort of how tight are they ? <breath> 
B:  OK .  
C:  Yeah . 
F:  Uh , it looks much better . 
B:  Yeah . <breath> Looks good .  
C:  <breath> 
C:  They were , um , 
D:  <long breath> 
C:  reasonably tight , but not excruciatingly tight . That would 've taken more time . 
G:  Oh . <laugh> 
C:  I just wanted to get it so tha So that if you have like " yeah "  
G:  No , no ! I don actually I  I  I  it 's f 
A:  <mouth> <breath> Let me make a note on yours . 
B:  Yeah .  
C:  in a  swimming in a big bin , then it 's  
G:  That 's fine because we don't want to  <breath> 
G:  th that 's perfectly fine . In fact it 's good . You always want to have a little bit of pause or nonspeech around the speech , say for recognition purposes . <breath> 
G:  Uh , but just  just u 
G:  w you know get an id I just wanted to have an idea of the  <breath> 
G:  of how much extra you allowed <breath> um  
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  so that I can interpret the numbers if I compared that with a forced alignment segmentation . 
C:  <mouth> <breath> I can't answer that , but  but my main goal was  um , in these areas where you have a three - way overlap <breath> and one of the overlaps involves " yeah " , 
G:  So . 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
C:  <laugh> and it 's swimming in this huge bin , <breath> I wanted to get it so that it was clo more closely localized . 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  Right . 
G:  But are we talking about , I don't know ,  a <breath>  tenth of a second ?  a  ?  
G:  You know ? How  how much  how much extra would you allow at most  <breath> 
C:  <breath> I  I wanted to  
C:  I wanted it to be able to  l he be heard normally , 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
C:  so that if you  if you play  back that bin and have it in the mode where it stops at the boundary , 
G:  OK .  
C:  <breath> it sounds like a normal word . It doesn't sound like the person  <breath> 
C:  i it sounds normal . It 's as if the person could 've stopped there . 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  OK .  
C:  And it wouldn't have been an awkward place to stop . 
F:  <mike noise> 
C:  <breath> 
C:  Now sometimes you know , it 's  these are involved in places where there was no time . <breath> And so , <breath> 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
C:  <breath> there wouldn't be  a gap afterwards because  <breath> I mean some cases , there 're some people  um , who  
G:  OK .  
C:  who have very long  segments of discourse where , <breath> you know , they 'll  they 'll breath  and then I put a break . <laugh> <breath> 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  But other than that , it 's really pretty continuous and this includes things like going from one sentence into the  u one utterance into the next , one sentence into the next , <breath> 
C:  <breath> um , 
C:  w without really stopping . I mean  i 
C:  they , i you know in writing you have this <breath> two spaces and a big gap you know . <breath> But  but uh  <breath> i some people are planning and , you know , I mean , a lot  we always are planning  what we 're going to say next . <breath> But uh , in which case , 
G:  Mm - hmm .  <mike noise> 
G:  Right .  
G:  OK .  
C:  the gap between  these two complete syntactic units , <breath> 
C:  um , 
C:  which of course n spoken things are not always complete syntactically , but  <breath> 
C:  but it would be a shorter p shorter 
C:  break <breath> than <breath> maybe you might like . <breath> But the goal there was to  not have <breath> the text be 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
C:  so  so crudely  parsed in a time bin . I mean , because <breath> from a discourse m 
C:  purpose  it 's  <breath> 
C:  it 's more  <breath> it 's more useful to be able to see  and also you know , from a speech recognition purpose my impression is that <breath> 
C:  if you have too long a unit , it 's  it doesn't help you very much either , cuz of the memory . 
G:  Well , yeah . That 's fine .  
C:  <breath> So , that means that <breath> the 
C:  amount of time after something 
C:  is variable depending partly on context , but my general goal <breath> when there was  sufficient 
C:  space , room , pause  after it  to have it be  kind of a natural feeling  gap . 
G:  OK .  
C:  Which I c I don't know what it would be quantified as . <breath> You know , Wally Chafe says that <breath> um , <breath> in producing narratives , the spurts that people use <breath> tend to be , <breath> 
C:  uh , that the  the  what would be a pause might be something like two  two seconds .  
G:  Mmm .  
C:  And um , that would be , you know one speaker . 
C:  The discourse  <breath> the people who look at turn taking often do use  I was interested that you chose uh , <breath> 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
C:  you know um ,  
C:  the  you know that you use cuz I think that 's a unit that would be more consistent with sociolinguistics . 
G:  Well we chose um , 
C:  Yeah .  
G:  you know , half a second because <breath> 
G:  if  if you go much larger , you have a  y 
G:  you know , your  your statement about how much overlap there is becomes less , <breath> 
G:  um , 
G:  precise , because you include more of actual pause time into what you consider overlap speech . <breath> 
C:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  Um , so , 
G:  it 's sort of a compromise , and  <breath> it 's also based  I mean Liz suggested that value based on <breath> 
B:  <mouth> Yeah .  
G:  the distribution of 
G:  pause times that you see in 
G:  Switchboard and  
C:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  and other corpora . <breath> 
G:  Um  
G:  So  
B:  <mouth> <breath> 
B:  Yeah , I also used I think something around zero point five seconds for the speech - nonspeech detector  for the minimum silence length . 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  I see . Yeah . 
B:  <breath> 
B:  So .  
C:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  OK .  
C:  In any case , this  this uh , meeting  that I hand  <breath> I  I hand - adjusted two of them I mentioned before , and I sent  I sent email , so  
G:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  <mouth> OK , <breath> So  so at some point we will try to fine - tune our forced alignment maybe using those as references <breath> 
C:  And I sent the   path . 
G:  because you know , what you would do is you would play with different 
G:  parameters . And to get an object You need an objective <breath> 
G:  measure of how closely you can align the models to the actual speech . <breath> 
G:  And that 's where your 
G:  your data would be  very important to have .  So , I will  
G:  Um   
B:  Yeah and hopefully the new meetings  which will start from the channelized version will  will 
B:  have 
B:  better time boundaries  and alignments .  
G:  Mm - hmm .  
G:  Right . 
C:  <breath> But I like this idea of  uh , for our purposes for the  for the IBM preparation , <breath> uh , n 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  having these  joined together , and uh  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  It makes a lot of sense . <breath> And in terms of transcription , it would be easy to do it that way . The way that they have 
G:  Yeah .  
G:  Yeah .  
C:  with the longer units , not having to fuss with adding these units at this time .  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <breath> 
G:  Right .  
B:  Whi - which could have one drawback . If there is uh a backchannel in between those three things , 
C:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  <breath> 
B:  the  the n the backchannel will  will occur at the end of  of those three . And  
C:  <breath> Yes . 
B:  and in  in the  
B:  in the previous version where in the n 
B:  which is used now , 
B:  <breath> 
B:  there , the backchannel would  would be in - between there somewhere , so . 


C:  I see . Yeah . Well , <breath> that 's  that 's right , but you know , thi this brings me to the other f stage of this which I discussed with you earlier today , <breath> which is <breath> the second stage is <breath> um , 
B:  That would be more natural but  
G:  <clears throat> 
B:  Yeah .  
C:  w what to do  in terms of the transcribers adjustment of these data . I discussed this with you too .  
C:  <breath> Um , the tr so the idea initially was , we would get <breath> uh , for the new meetings , so the e EDU meetings , that <breath> Thilo 
C:  ha has now presegmented all of them for us , on a channel by channel basis . 
C:  <breath> And um , <breath> so , I 've assigned  I 've  I 've assigned them to our transcribers <breath> and um , <breath> 
C:  so far I 've discussed it with one , with uh  And I had a  about an hour discussion with her about this yesterday , we went through <breath> uh EDU - one , at some extent . 
C:  <breath> And it occurred to me that <breath> um  
C:  that <breath> basically what we have in this kind of a format is  you could consider it as a staggered mixed file , we had some discussion over the weekend a about  at  at this other meeting that we were all a at  
C:  <breath> um , <breath> about whether the tran the IBM transcribers should hear a single channel audio , or a mixed channel audio . 
C:  <breath> And um , <breath> in  in a way , by  by having this  this chunk and then the backchannel 
C:  <breath> after it , it 's like a stagal staggered mixed channel . 
C:  <breath> And um , <breath> it occurred  to me in my discussion with her yesterday that um , <breath> um , <breath> 
C:  the   the  the maximal gain , it 's  from the IBM  people , may be in long stretches of connected speech . <breath> So it 's basically a whole bunch of words <breath> which they can really do , because of the continuity within that person 's turn . 
C:  <breath> So , what I 'm thinking , and it may be that not all meetings will be good for this ,  but  but what I 'm thinking is that <breath> in the EDU meetings , they tend to be <breath> driven by a couple of dominant speakers . 
C:  <breath> And , if the chunked files focused on the dominant speakers , <breath> then , when  when it got s 
C:  patched together when it comes back from IBM , we can add the backchannels . <breath>  
C:  It seems to me <breath> that <breath> 
C:  um , you know , the backchannels per - se wouldn't be so hard , but then there 's this question of the time  @ @  
F:  <sniff> 
C:  uh , marking , and whether the beeps would be <breath> uh y y y  And I 'm not exactly sure how that  how that would work with the  with the backchannels . 
F:  <sniff> 
C:  <mouth> And , <breath> so um  
C:  <mouth> <breath> And certainly things that are <breath> intrusions of multiple words , <breath> taken out of context and displaced in time from where they occurred , <breath> that would be hard . 
C:  <breath> So , m my <breath> thought is  i 
C:  I 'm having this transcriber go through <breath> the EDU - one meeting , and indicate a start time <noise> 
C:  f for each dominant speaker , endpoi end time for each dominant speaker , and the idea that <breath> these units would be generated for the dominant speakers , <breath> and maybe not for the other channels . 
A:  <mouth> <breath> Yeah the only , um , disadvantage of that is , then it 's hard to use an automatic method to do that . 
A:  <mouth> <breath> The advantage is that it 's probably faster to do that than it is to use the automated method and correct it . 
F:  <sniff> 
G:  <yawn> 
D:  <mike noise> 
A:  So . 
C:  <mouth> <breath> Well , it  OK . I think  <breath> I  I think um , you know , the original plan was that the transcriber would adjust the t the boundaries , and all that for all the channels but , 
A:  We 'll just have to see . <breath> 
F:  <sniff> 
C:  <breath> you know , that is so time - consuming , and since we have a bottleneck here , we want to get IBM things that are usable s as soon as possible , then this seemed to me it 'd be a way of gett to get them a flood of data , <breath> which would be useful when it comes back to us . 
F:  <sniff> 
C:  And um  
A:  <mouth> <breath> Yeah . 
C:  <mouth> Oh also , at the same time she  when she goes through this , she 'll be <breath> uh  If there 's anything that <breath> was encoded as a pause , but really has something transcribable in it , <breath> then she 's going to <breath> uh , make a mark  
F:  <sniff> 
C:  w uh , so you know , so <breath> that  that bin would be marked as it  as double dots <breath> and she 'll just add an S . <laugh> And in the other  in the other case , if it 's marked as speech , 
C:  <breath> and really there 's nothing transcribable in it , 
C:  then she 's going to put a s dash , and I 'll go through and it  and um , you know , 
C:  with a  <breath-laugh> 
C:  <breath> with a substitution command , get it so that it 's clear that those are 
C:  the other category . I 'll just , you know , recode them .  <breath> But um , 
C:  <breath> um , the transcribable events  that um , I 'm considering in this , <breath> uh , continue to be <breath> laugh , as well as speech , and cough and things like that , so I 'm not stripping out anything , just  just you know , being very lenient in what 's considered speech . <breath> 
F:  <sniff> 
F:  <sniff> 
D:  Jane ? <breath> In terms of the  this new procedure you 're suggesting , <breath> um , 
C:  Yeah ?  
F:  <sniff> 
D:  u what is the  
A:  It 's not that different .  <breath> 
D:  So I 'm a little confused , because how do we know where to put beeps ? Is it  i d y is it  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Oh , OK . <breath> So what it  what it  what it involves is  is really a s uh , <breath> 
A:  Transcriber will do it .  
C:  uh , the original pr procedure , <breath> but <breath> 
C:  only applied to  uh , 
G:  <sound> 
C:  a certain  strategically chosen  s aspect of the data . <breath> So  
A:  <mouth> We pick the easy parts of the data basically , and transcriber marks it by hand . 
C:  You got it . 
A:  <breath> 
A:  And because  
D:  But after we 've done Thilo 's thing . 
A:  No . 
A:  <breath> 
C:  Yes ! Yes ! Oh yeah ! 
A:  Oh , after . Oh , OK , I didn't  I didn't understand that . OK . 
B:  So , 
B:  I 'm @ @  now I 'm confused . 
C:  OK . <breath> We start with your presegmented version  
B:  <laugh> 
G:  <breath> OK , and I 'm leaving . <laugh> So , um  
B:  <breath> <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh>  
E:  Yeah , I have to go as well . <breath> 
A:  <breath> <mouth> OK , leave the mikes on , and just put them on the table . 
E:  OK . 
E:  <mike noise> 
E:  Thanks .  
C:  <mouth> We start with the presegmented version  
B:  <breath> You start with the presegmentation , r <breath> yeah ? <breath> 
A:  Let me mark you as no digits . 
A:  <breath> 
E:  <mike noise> 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  <breath> And then um , <breath> the transcriber , <breath> instead of going painstakingly through all the channels and moving the boundaries around , and deciding if it 's speech or not , but not transcribing anything . 
C:  OK ? Instead of doing that , which was our original plan , 
D:  Mm - hmm .  
C:  <breath> the tra They focus on the dominant speaker  
D:  They just <breath> do that on  the main channels . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  <breath> So what they do is they identify who 's the di dominant speaker , and when the speaker starts . 
D:  OK . 
B:  Yeah ? 
B:  OK . 
C:  <breath> So I mean , you 're still gonna  So we 're  It 's based on your se presegmentation , that 's the basic  thing . 
B:  <breath> 
B:  And you just  
B:  and you just use the s 
B:  the segments of the 
B:  dominant speaker then ? For  for sending to  to IBM or  ?  <breath> 
C:  Yeah . Exactly . 
D:  <breath> So , now Jane , my question is <breath> when they 're all done adjusting the w time boundaries for the dominant speaker ,  
C:  Mm - hmm .  
D:  have they then also erased the time boundaries for the other ones ? 
C:  <breath> Uh No . No , no . 
D:  So how will we know who  
C:  Huh - uh .  S 
C:  <breath> That 's  that 's why she 's notating the start and end points of the dominant speakers . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <breath> So , on a  you know , so <breath> i in EDU - one , i as far as I listened to it , you start off with a  a s section by Jerry . So Jerry starts at minute so - and - so , and goes until minute so - and - so . And then Mark Paskin comes in . 
C:  <breath> And he starts at <breath> minute such - and - such , and goes on till minute so - and - so . 
F:  <sniff> 
C:  <breath> OK . And then <breath> meanwhile , she 's listening to <breath>  
C:  both of these guys ' channels , <breath> determining if there 're any cases of misclassification of speech as nothing , and nothing as speech , 
D:  Mm - hmm . OK . 
C:  <breath> and <breath> a and adding a tag if that happens .  
F:  <sniff> 
D:  So she does the adjustments on those guys ? <breath> 
C:  <breath> But you know , I wanted to say , his segmentation is so good , that <breath> um , the part that I listened to with her yesterday 
B:  On that meeting .  
C:  <breath> didn't need any adjustments of the bins . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  So far we haven't . 
C:  <breath> So this is not gonna be a major part of the process ,  
C:  at least  least not in  not on ones that  that really  
D:  <breath> So if you don't have to adjust the bins , 
C:  Mm - hmm ? 
D:  why not just do what it  for all the channels ? 
D:  Why not just throw all the channels to IBM ? 
F:  <sniff> 
C:  <breath> Well there 's the question o of  whether  
C:  Well , OK . <breath> She i It 's a question of how much time we want our transcriber to invest here 
C:  <breath> when she 's gonna have to invest that when it comes back from IBM anyway . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <breath> 
D:  Mm - hmm .  
C:  So if it 's only inserting " mm - hmm "s here and there , 
D:  Right . 
C:  then , wouldn't that be something that would be just as efficient to do at this end , instead of having it go through I B M , then be patched together , then be double checked here . 
B:  Yeah .  
B:  But   
B:  <breath> 
B:  But then we could just use the  the output of the detector , and do the 
B:  beeping on it , and send it to I B M . 
F:  <mike noise> <clears throat> 
F:  <breath> <sniff> 
D:  Without having her check anything . 
C:  <breath> Well , I guess  <breath> 
F:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  <mouth> I think we just  we just have to listen to it and see how good they are . 
B:  For some meetings , I 'm  I 'm sure it  i 
F:  <sniff> 
B:  n 
C:  I 'm  I 'm open to that , it was  @ @  
F:  Yeah , if it 's working well , 
F:  that sounds like a good idea since as you say you have to do stuff with the other end anyway . 
B:  <mouth> That 's  And some  on some meetings it 's good . <breath> 
B:  Yeah .  
C:  <breath> Well yea OK , good . I mean the detector , this  <breath> Now , you were saying that they  they differ in how well they work depending on channel s sys systems and stuff . 
D:  Yeah , I mean we have to fix it when it comes back anyhow . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  So we should perhaps just select meetings on which the speech - nonspeech detection works well , and just use , 
F:  <mike noise> 
C:  But EDU is great . 
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  <breath> 
B:  those meetings to  to  to send to IBM and , 
A:  Release to begin with . 
C:  How interesting . <breath> You know  
F:  What 's the problem  the l I forget . Is the problem the lapel , or  or  
B:  do the other ones . 
B:  Uh , it really depends . <laugh> Um , my  my  
B:  my impression is that it 's better for meetings with fewer speakers ,  
B:  and it 's better for  
B:  <breath> 
B:  for meetings where nobody is breathing . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> Oh ,  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh-breath> Yeah , get  
F:  the dead meetings . 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  That 's it .  <laugh> 
D:  <breath> So in fact this might suggest an alternative sort of a  a c a hybrid between these two things . So the  the one suggestion is you know we  <breath> 
A:  No , the undead meeting , yeah .  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah ? 
D:  we run Thilo 's thing and then we have somebody go and adjust all the time boundaries and we send it to IBM . The other one is <breath> 
C:  Yeah ? 
B:  Yeah .  
D:  we just run his thing and send it to IBM . <breath> 
D:  There 's a  a another possibility if we find that there are some problems , and that is <breath> 
B:  Yeah .  
F:  <sniff> 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  if we go ahead and we <breath> just run his , and we generate the beeps file , then we have somebody listen beeps file . <breath> 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  And they listen to each section and say " yes , no " whether that section is 
B:  And erase  Yeah . 
C:  Is intelligible .  
D:  i i 
D:  intelligible or not . <breath> And it just  You know , there 's a little interface which will  for all the " yes " - es it  then that will be the final <breath> 
B:  Yeah .  
A:  Blech . 
C:  <breath> That 's interesting ! Cuz that 's  that 's directly related to the e end task . <breath> 
F:  <sniff> 
D:  beep file . 
A:  <breath> <mouth> 
A:  Stress test . <breath> 
D:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  <breath> <laugh> 
C:  How interesting ! 
D:  Yeah . <breath> I mean it wouldn't be that much fun for a transcriber to sit there , hear it , beep , yes or no . <breath> But it would be quick . <breath> 
B:  Nope . 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <mouth> I  I  I don't know . 
F:  It would be  kind of quick but they 're still listening to everything . 
D:  <breath> But there 's no adjusting . And that 's what 's slow . There 's no adjusting of time boundaries . 
C:  Well , <breath> eh , listening does take time too .  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . <breath> I don't know , I  I think I 'm  I 'm really tending towards  I mean , <breath> what 's the worst that happens ? Do the transcribers  I mean as long as th on the other end they can say there 's  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  One and a half times real time .  
F:  there 's something  conventions so that they say " huh ? " <breath> 
D:  <mouth> Yeah . 
D:  Right . <breath> 
F:  and then we can flag those later . i i It  i 
D:  They  they  Yeah . 
D:  That 's true . We can just catch it at the  catch everything at this side . Well maybe that 's the best way to go , just  <breath> 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  <breath> How interesting ! <breath> Well EDU  
A:  <mouth> <breath> I mean it just depends on how  
B:  Yeah , u u u  
A:  Sorry , go ahead . 
C:  So I was gonna say , EDU - one is good enough , maybe we could include it in this  in this set of uh , this stuff we send . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah there 's  I  I think there are some meetings where it would  would  
A:  <mouth> Yeah I  
A:  I think , 
B:  It 's possible like this . 
A:  we won't know until we generate a bunch of beep files automatically , listen to them and see how bad they are . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  We won't be able to s include it with this first thing ,  
C:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  <mouth> <breath> 
C:  Hmm .  
A:  If  
C:  Oh , OK . 
D:  because there 's a part of the process of the beep file which requires knowing the normalization coefficients .  <breath> 
C:  Oh , I see . 
D:  And  <breath> So a 
A:  That 's not hard to do . 
D:  OK - 
A:  Just  it takes  you know , it just takes five minutes rather than , 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  taking a second . 
A:  <breath> 
D:  Right , except I don't think that  the c the instructions for doing that was in that directory , right ? I  I didn't see where you had gener 
A:  So . I just hand  hard - coded it . 
A:  No , but it 's easy enough to do . <breath> 
B:  What  @ @ 
F:  But I  but I have a  
B:  Doing the gain ? It 's no problem . 
F:  <mouth> <breath> 
D:  n Doing th 
B:  Adjusting the gain ? 
D:  No , getting the coefficients , 
D:  for each channel . 
C:  Know what numbers .  
B:  <breath> Yeah , that 's no problem . 
D:  OK . So we just run that one  
B:  We can do that . 
A:  There are lots of ways to do it . I have one program that 'll do it . You can find other programs . <breath> 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I  I used it , so . 
D:  We just run that J - sound - stat ? 
A:  Yep . 
F:  Yeah .  
D:  OK . OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  <breath> But  
A:  Minus D , capital D . 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  but  but I  
F:  I  I have  another suggestion on that , which is , <breath> 
F:  since , really what this is , is  is  is trying to in the large , send the right thing to them and there is gonna be this  this post - processing step , <breath> 
F:  um , <breath> 
F:  why don't we check through a bunch of things by sampling it ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right ? In other words , rather than , 
F:  um , 
F:  uh , saying we 're gonna listen to everything  
A:  <mouth> 
A:  I didn't mean listen to everything , I meant , 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  <breath> So y you do a bunch of meetings , you listen to  to a little bit here and there , <breath> if it sounds like it 's almost always right and there 's not any big problem you send it to them . 
A:  just see if they 're any good . <breath> 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Send it to them . OK . 
B:  Yeah .  
F:  And , you know , then they 'll send us back what we  w what  what they send back to us , and we 'll  we 'll fix things up and <breath> 
C:  Oh , that 'd be great .  
A:  We should  
F:  some meetings will cost more time to fix up than others . 
B:  <mouth> Yeah . 
A:  Yeah .  
A:  And we should just double - check with Brian on a few simple conventions on how they should mark things . 
D:  OK . 
B:  Sure . 
D:  When they  when there 's either no speech in there , or <breath> 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  something they don't understand , things like that . 
C:  Yeah . Mm - hmm . 
A:  <mouth> <breath> Yeah , cuz @ @ uh what I had originally said to Brian was well they 'll have to mark , 
F:  Yeah . 
A:  when they can't distinguish between the foreground and background , because I thought that was gonna be the most prevalent . 
A:  <breath> 
D:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  But if we send them without editing , then we 're also gonna hafta have m uh , notations for words that are cut off , 
B:  <mouth> Yeah .  
D:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  <breath> 
B:  Yeah .  
A:  and other sorts of , uh , acoustic problems . 
D:  <breath> And they may just guess at what those cut - off words are , but w I mean we 're gonna adjust  everything when we come back   
C:  They do already . 
C:  Yeah .  
A:  <breath> 
A:  But what  what we would like them to do is be conservative  so that they should only write down the transcript if they 're sure . And otherwise they should mark it so that we can check . 
B:  Yeah .  <breath> 
B:  Mark it .  Sure . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah .  
D:  Mm - hmm .  
C:  <breath> Well , we have the unintelligibility  convention . And actually they have one also ,  which   
A:  Mm - hmm .  
F:  <breath> 
A:  Right . 
F:  <breath> But I think none of this is stuff that really needs somebody doing these  these uh , uh , 
D:  Yeah . <clears throat> 
C:  Excellent . 
F:  explicit markings . 
C:  Oh , I 'd be delighted with that , I  I was very impressed with the  with the result .  Yeah . 
F:  <breath> Yeah , cuz the other thing that was concerning me about it was that it seemed kind of specialized to the EDU meeting , and  and that then when you get 
F:  a meeting like this or something , and  <breath> and you have a b a bunch of different dominant speakers you know , how are you gonna handle it . Whereas this sounds like a more general solution is  <breath> 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh yeah , interesting . 
C:  Oh yeah . 
C:  <breath> Oh yeah , I pr I much prefer this , I was just trying to find a way  <breath> Cuz I  I don't think the staggered mixed channel is awfully good as a way of handling overlaps . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
C:  But   
C:  <breath> but uh   
D:  Well good . That  that really simplifies thing then . And we can just , you know , get the meeting , process it , <breath> 
C:  Yeah .  
D:  put the beeps file , send it off to IBM . You know ? <breath> 
C:  Mm - hmm .  
D:  With very little  work on our side . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <breath> 
B:  Process it , <breath> hear into it . <laugh> 
C:  <mouth> <inbreath>  
B:  I would  <breath> 
D:  Do what ? 
B:  Um ,  listen to it , and then  
A:  Or at least sample it . 
D:  Well , sample it . Sample it . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  <breath> 
F:  <mouth> I  I would just use some samples , make sure you don't 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah .  
D:  Yeah . 
F:  send them three hours of " bzzz "  or something . <laugh> Yeah . <breath> 
D:  Yeah . Right .  
B:  No . 
B:  <laugh> That won't be good . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . Yeah that would be very good . 
C:  Yeah .  
B:  Yeah .  
D:  And then we can you know  <breath> That 'll oughta be a good way to get the pipeline 
C:  Oh , I 'd be delighted . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  going . 


F:  i Can I maybe have  have an order of  <breath> 
F:  it 's probably in your paper that I haven't looked at lately , but  <sniff> 
F:  Uh , an order of magnitude notion of  of how  
C:  Certainty .  
F:  on a good meeting , how often uh , do you get 
F:  segments that come in the middle of words and so forth , and uh  in a bad meeting how <breath> often ? 
B:  <breath> 
B:  Uh .  
C:  <breath> Was is it in a  in a  what  what is the t 
F:  <breath> Well he 's saying , you know , that the  the EDU meeting was a good  good meeting , right ? Uh , and so  so  so it was almost  it was almost always doing the right thing . 
C:  In a good meeting , what ?  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh I see , the characteristics . 
F:  <breath> So I wanted to get some sense of what  what almost always meant . 
F:  <breath> And then , uh in a bad meeting , 
F:  <breath> or p some meetings where he said oh he 's had some problems , what does that mean ? 
C:  Uh - huh .  
F:  So I mean does one of the does it mean one percent and ten percent ? Or does it mean <breath> five percent and fifty percent ? <breath> 
C:  OK .  
C:  OK .  
F:  Uh  
B:  So   
F:  Or  Maybe percentage isn't the right word , but you know how many  how many per minute , or  You know . <breath> 
C:  Just @ @  
B:  Yeah th 
B:  Yeah , the  the problem is that , nnn , 
B:  the numbers Ian gave in the paper is just uh , some frame error rate . So that 's  that 's not really  
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  <breath> 
B:  What will be 
F:  <sniff> 
B:  effective for  for the transcribers , is  
B:  <breath> 
B:  They have to  yeah , in in they have to insure that that 's a real s spurt or something . 
B:  <breath> 
B:  And  but , <breath> the numbers  Oops .  <breath> Um  <breath> 
C:  Hmm !  
B:  <mouth> 
B:  Let me think .  
B:  <breath> 
B:  So the  speech  the amount of speech that is missed by the  detector , 
B:  for a good meeting , 
B:  I th 
B:  is around  or under one percent , I would say . 
B:  <breath> 
B:  But there can be  
B:  Yeah . For  yeah , but there can be more  
B:  There 's  There 's more amount speech  
B:  <breath> 
B:  uh , more amount of  
B:  Yeah well , the detector says there is speech , but there is none . 
B:  <breath> 
B:  So that  that can be 
B:  a lot when  when it 's really a breathy channel . 
F:  But I think that 's less of a problem . They 'll just listen . It 's just wasted time . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  <breath> And th and that 's for a good meeting . 
F:  Now what about in a meeting that you said we 've  you 've had some more trouble with ? 
B:  <mouth> <breath> 
B:  I can't  really  hhh ,   Tsk .  I  don't have really representative numbers , I think . 
B:  <breath> 
B:  That 's really  
B:  I  I did  this on  on four meetings and only five minutes of  of every meet of  of these meetings so , 
B:  <breath> 
B:  it 's not  not that representative , but , 
B:  <breath> it 's perhaps , 
B:  Fff .  <breath> 
B:  Um  
B:  Yeah , it 's perhaps then  it 's perhaps five percent of something , which s uh the  the frames  
B:  speech frames which are  which are missed , but um , 
B:  I can't  can't really tell . 
F:  Right .  
F:  So I  <breath> So i Sometime , we might wanna go back and look at it more in terms of <breath> 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  how many times is there a spurt that 's  that 's uh , interrupted ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah .  
F:  Something like that ? 
B:  <breath> 
C:  <breath> The other problem is , that when it  when it uh d i on the breathy ones , where you get <breath> 
F:  And  <breath> 
B:  So  
C:  <breath> breathing , uh , inti indicated as speech . 
C:  <breath> And I guess we could just indicate to the transcribers not to  encode that if they  We could still do the beep file . 
F:  <mouth> <breath> Yeah again I  I think that that is probably less of a problem because if you 're  if there 's  <breath> 
C:  OK .  
F:  If  if a  if a word is  is split , then they might have to listen to it a few times to really understand that they can't quite get it . <breath> 
C:  OK .  
C:  OK .  
F:  Whereas if they listen <mike noise> to it and there 's  don't hear any speech I think they 'd probably just listen to it once . So there 'd  you 'd think there 'd be a  
B:  But   
B:  Yeah . 
F:  a factor of three or four in  in , uh , cost function , you know , between them or something . <breath> 
C:  <mouth> OK .  
B:  Yeah , so  but I think that 's  n that really 
B:  doesn't happen very often that  that  that a word is cut in the middle or something .  That 's  that 's really not  not normal . 
F:  <breath> So  so what you 're saying is that nearly always what happens when there 's a problem is that  is that uh , there 's <breath> some uh , uh nonspeech that uh  that is b interpreted as speech . <breath> 
B:  That is marked as speech . Yeah .  
B:  Yeah . 
F:  Well then , we really should just send the stuff . 
C:  That would be great .  
F:  Right ? Because that doesn't do any harm . 
B:  Yeah , it 's  
F:  You know , if they  they hear you know , a dog bark and they say what was the word , they  you know , they  <laugh> 
B:  <breath> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , I als I  
F:  Ruff ruff ! <laugh> 
B:  Yeah I also thought of  there  there are really some channels where it is almost  
B:  um , only bre breathing in it . 
B:  <breath> 
F:  Yeah ? 
B:  And to  
B:  to re - run 's 
B:  Eh , um . Yeah . I 've got a  a  P - a  method with loops into the cross - correlation with the PZM mike , 
B:  <breath> 
F:  Uh - huh . 
B:  and then to reject everything which  which seems to be breath . 
B:  <breath> 
B:  So , I could run this on those breathy channels , and perhaps throw out  
A:  That 's a good idea . 
F:  <breath> Yeah . But I think  I th Again , I think that sort of  that that would be good , <breath> and what that 'll do is just cut the time a little further . 
C:  Wow , that 's a great idea . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah .  


B:  And there 's  there 's one point which I  uh  
F:  Great . <breath> 
B:  <breath> 
B:  yeah , which  which I r 
B:  <mouth> we covered when I  when I r listened to one of the EDU meetings , and that 's <breath> 
B:  that somebody is playing sound from his laptop . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh - huh  
B:  And i 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  the speech - nonspeech detector just assigns randomly the speech to  to one of the channels , so . 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath> 
F:  <laugh>  
B:  Uh - I haven't - I didn't think of  of s of <breath> 
A:  What can you do ? 
B:  this before , but what  what shall we do about s things like this ? 
C:  <breath> Well you were suggesting  You suggested maybe just not sending that part of the meeting . But   
A:  Yep . Mmm . <breath> 
B:  But , 
B:  sometimes the  
B:  <breath> 
B:  the  the laptop is in the background and some  somebody is  is talking , and , 
B:  <breath> 
A:  <mouth> <breath> 
B:  that 's really a little bit confusing , but  
F:  <breath> That 's life . 
A:  It 's a little bit confusing . I mean ,  what 're we gonna do ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> OK . 
A:  <breath> 
F:  Yeah .  
A:  Even a hand - transcription would  
C:  Do you   
A:  a hand - transcriber would have trouble with that . So . 
B:  Yeah , that 's  that 's a second question , " what  what will different transcribers do with  with the laptop sound ? " <laugh> 
D:  <sudden breath reflex> 
C:  Would you  would  Yeah , go ahead .  
F:  What was the l what was the laptop sound ? I mean was it speech , or was it  
B:  Yeah . <laugh> It 's speech . <laugh> 
F:  Great . 
C:  <laugh> <breath> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  Well , so  I mean  So my standard approach has been if it 's not someone close - miked , 
C:  then , they don't end up on one of the close - miked channels . They end up on a different channel . And we have any number of channels available , I mean it 's an infinite number of channels .  So just put them on some other channel . 
F:  Uh - huh .  
B:  Yeah .  
B:  <breath> 
B:  But , <breath> 
B:  when thi when this is sent to  to the I M - eh , I B M transcribers , I don't know if  if they can tell that 's really  
C:  Yeah , that 's right . 
A:  Yeah cuz there will be no channel on which it is foreground . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  <breath> 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <breath> Well , they have a convention , in their own procedures , <breath> which is for a background  sound . 
A:  Uh  
A:  <mouth> <breath> Right , but , uh , in general I don't think we want them transcribing the background , cuz that would be too much work . 
B:  Yeah .  
A:  Right ? For it  because in the overlap sections , then they 'll - 
D:  Well I don't think Jane 's saying they 're gonna transcribe it , but they 'll just mark it as being  there 's some background stuff there , right ? 
A:  <breath> 
A:  But that 's gonna be all over the place . How w how will they tell the difference between that sort of background and the dormal  normal background of two people talking at once ? 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <breath> Oh , I think  I think it 'd be easy to to say " background laptop " . <laugh> 
D:  But wait a minute , why would they treat them differently ? 
A:  How would they know that ? 
B:  <breath> 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <breath> 
C:  Well because one of them  
A:  <breath> 
A:  Because otherwise it 's gonna be too much work for them to mark it . 
A:  They 'll be marking it all over the place . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <breath> Oh , I s background laptop or , background LT <laugh> <breath> wouldn't take any time . <breath> 
F:  <sneeze> 
A:  <mouth> <breath> 
A:  Sure , but how are they gonna tell bet the difference between that and two people just talking at the same time ? 
C:  And  
C:  Oh , you can tell . Acoustically , can't you tell ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <mouth> It 's really good sound , so  <laugh> <breath> 
C:  Oh is it ? Oh ! 
F:  <breath> Well , I mean , isn't there a category something like uh , " sounds for someone for whom there is no i close mike " ? 
B:  Yeah that would be very important , yeah . 
C:  <breath> Yeah . 
A:  <mouth> But how do we d how do we do that for the I B M folks ? 
A:  How can they tell that ? 
D:  Well we may just have to do it when it gets back here . 
A:  Yes , that 's my opinion as well . So we don't do anything for it  with it . 
B:  Yeah .  
C:  OK . <breath> That sounds good . 
D:  Yeah .  
A:  <breath> 
C:  That sounds good . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  And they 'll just mark it however they mark it , and we 'll correct it when it comes back . 
B:  So th 
F:  Yeah .  
B:  @ @  
C:  OK . <breath>  
B:  there was a category for 
B:  @ @  
B:  speech . OK . 
A:  Yeah , the default . 
C:  Yeah , s a 
A:  <breath> 
A:  No , not default . 
C:  Well , as it comes back , we have a uh  when we can use the channelized interface for encoding it , then it 'll be easy for us to handle . But  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <breath> but if  if out of context , they can't tell if it 's a channeled speak uh , 
C:  you know , a close - miked speaker or not , <breath> then that would be confusing to them . 
B:  OK . 
A:  Right .  
B:  OK .  
C:  <breath> I don't know , I  it doesn't  I don't  
C:  Either way would be fine with me , I don't really care .  
F:  Yeah .  
F:  <mouth> <breath> 
F:  So . Shall we uh , do digits and get out of here ? 
C:  <breath> I have o I have one question . Do you think we should send the um  that whole meeting to them and not worry about pre - processing it ? Or  Uh , what I mean is <breath> we  we should <breath> 
A:  Yep . 
F:  <breath> Yes ma ' am . 
C:  leave the <breath> part with the audio in the 
C:  uh , beep file that we send to IBM for that one , or should we <breath> start after the  that part of the meeting is over 
F:  Which part ? 
C:  in what we send . <breath> So , the part where they 're using sounds from their  from their laptops . 
B:  With   
B:  with the laptop sound , or  ?  
C:  w If we have speech from the laptop should we just uh , excise that from what we send to IBM , or should we <breath> i give it to them and let them do with it what they can ? 
B:  just  
D:  I think we should just  it  it 's gonna be too much work if we hafta <breath> 
C:  OK , that 'd be nice to have a  a uniform procedure . 
D:  worry about that I think . Yeah , I think if we just  m send it all to them . 
D:  you know . 
A:  <mouth> Worry about it when we get back . 
C:  Good . And see how well they do . 
D:  Let  Yeah , worry about it when we get back in . 
F:  Yeah .  
C:  And give them freedom to  <breath> to indicate if it 's just not workable . Yeah , OK , excellent . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . Cuz , I wouldn't  don't think we would mind  having that  transcribed , if they did it . 
A:  <mouth> I think  
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  As I say , we 'll just have to listen to it and see how horrible it is . 
D:  Yeah , e 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . Alright . 
A:  Sample it , rather . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  I think that  that will be a little bit of a problem as it really switches around between <breath> two different channels , I think . What  what I would  
C:  That 's great . 
A:  Mm - hmm , and  and they 're very  it 's very audible ? on the close - talking channels ? 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh well . 
F:  Yeah . 
A:  I mean , it 's the same problem as the lapel mike . <breath> 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  But   
C:  Oh , interesting . <laugh> 
B:  Comparable , yeah . 
F:  Yeah .  
C:  OK , alright . 
F:  <mouth> <breath> 


B:  <mouth> OK .  
F:  Let 's do digits .  <breath> 
A:  <mouth> <breath> <sigh> 
C:  Digits .  
C:  OK , so we read the transcript number first , right ?  
B:  <breath> So  <breath> 
A:  <mouth> Are we gonna do it altogether or separately ? <breath> 
B:  What time is it ? <laugh> 
F:  Uh , <breath> why don't we do it together , that 's  that 's a nice fast way to do it . 
B:  <breath> 
C:  Uh , quarter to four .  
B:  Oh , OK . <breath> 
C:  Mm - hmm .  
F:  <clears throat> <breath> 
F:  One , two , three , go !
