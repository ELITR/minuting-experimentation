{"src": "and <breath> the main thing that i was gon na ask people to help with today isto give input on what kinds of database format we shoulduse in starting to link up things like word transcripts and annotations of word transcripts , th - there are sort of two choices .", "tgt": "abstract: two main options were discussed as to the organisation of the collected data ."}
{"src": "i mean , wei sort of already have developed an xml format for this sort of stuff . so tha it has a single time - line , i think for word - level , this would be ok .", "tgt": "abstract: on the one hand , a bespoke xml structure that connects transcriptions and annotations ( down to the word-level ) to a common timeline ."}
{"src": "and i thought it was better if you 're looking at a raw file to bet for the tags to say `` it 's an utterance `` , as opposed to the tag to say `` it 's a link `` . one of them is that it 's easy to parse . can youbut you can add to those structures if you the other thingthe other way that i sort of established this was as easy translation to and from the transcriber format .", "tgt": "abstract: its advantages are that it is easier to read , parse , map onto the transcriber format and to expand with extra features ."}
{"src": "so i think itit 's debatable whether you want to do phone - level in the same thing .", "tgt": "abstract: phone-level analysis can be included in the same structure , or in a separate , linked file ."}
{"src": "oror any frame - level stuff i would use p - file . it 's ics uh , icsi has a format for frame - level representation of features . and we have a lot of tools already to deal with it . i mean , it 's something that we developed at icsi . but , i mean , it is just something we developed at icsi .", "tgt": "abstract: the respective frame-level representation can be handled by p-files , a technology developed at icsi , which also comes with a library of tools ."}
{"src": "more compact ,", "tgt": "abstract: separation of levels of analysis makes files more compact and manageable ."}
{"src": "there 's astandard again in xml , specifically for searching xml documentsstructured x - xml documents , where you can specify both the content and the structural position . it 'sit 'syou would use that to build your tool to do that sort of search . what you would do is , someone would build a tool that used that as a library .", "tgt": "abstract: xml standards offer libraries that can be used for the development of search tools ."}
{"src": "which was their file format is just nodes and links ,", "tgt": "abstract: on the other hand , the atlas ( nist ) technology offers a very similar , but more generic organisational scheme based on nodes and links ."}
{"src": "and then `` type `` would be `` utterance `` .", "tgt": "abstract: these are labeled with domain specific types , like `` utterance '' or `` speaker '' ."}
{"src": "they 're developing a big infrastructure . um , and apparently they 've also developed a lot of tools , one of the things that atlas is doing is they 're trying to define an api which is independent of the back store , so that , uh , you could define a single api and thethe storage could be flat xml files or a database .", "tgt": "abstract: this option offer well-developed infrastructure and flexibility as to the type of data storage ( flat xml files or relational database ) ."}
{"src": "but i thought it would be good to get something that we canthat other people can use or adopt for their own kinds of encoding . and so i wanted something whereall of this can be done in a elegant way and that if somebody wants to try something or compute something else , that it can be done flexibly .", "tgt": "abstract: in either case , it is important for the chosen format to allow for fast searches , flexible updates and , if possible , be reusable in future work ."}
{"src": "we should look at atlas , maybe i should . so i 'lli 'll take a closer look at it .", "tgt": "decisions: in order to confirm the suitability of the data format provided by the atlas project , its current state of development will be investigated ."}
{"src": "do they already have something that 'sthat would be useful for us in place ? well , i think i 'mi think w i had better look at it again but i 'm forgetting the exact level of nesting . i mean , i have to look at it again to see whether it can really do what we want ,", "tgt": "decisions: more specifically , the issues that have to be ascertained are , firstly , whether the external file representation offers a format that would be appropriate for speech data , and , secondly , how the linking between the different annotations ( eg , between word-level representations and prosodic-feature structures ) can be achieved ."}
{"src": "it seems to me you want to keep the frame - level stuff separate .", "tgt": "decisions: regardless of the actual format , however , there was consensus that keeping levels of analysis ( words , phones , frames , etc ) on separate , inter-linked files can make their management easier ."}
{"src": "ii think if it 's conceptually close , and they already have or will have tools that everybody else will be using , i mean , <breath> it would be crazy to do something s you know , separate that", "tgt": "problems: choosing a project-specific format for the representation of the data might not be optimal for future work ."}
{"src": "do they already have something that 'sthat would be useful for us in place ? um , th what wouldwouldwouldwhat would worry me is that maybe we might miss a little detail i mean , i have to look at it again to see whether it can really do what we want ,", "tgt": "problems: on the other hand , it is not yet clear whether a more standardised , but generic technology , like that of the atlas project , can accommodate all the requirements of speech analysis ."}
{"src": "for lower than word - level , you 're talking about so much data that i justi do n't know . these are big files .", "tgt": "problems: regardless of the particular format , including all annotations ( sentences , words , phones , frames , etc ) in one file could result in unmanageable file sizes ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: searching , updating or simply parsing a file for a simple task can become an unwieldy process ."}
{"src": "i mean these are long meetings but i think , a anything at frame - level , even p - file , is too verbose .", "tgt": "problems: even p-files , which are only for frame-level annotation , may be too verbose for the amount of data resulting from hour-long recordings ."}
{"src": "no matter what format you choose , you 're gon na have the trou you 're gon na have the difficulty of relating thethe frame - level features", "tgt": "problems: the actual mapping of word-level transcriptions to frame-level representations is expected to be problematic anyway ."}
{"src": "and sometimes the word sequences even differ slightly because they were edited s at one place but not the other . but , see , if you 'd annotate dialogue acts , you do n't necessarily want toor topicsyou do n't really want to be dealing with time - marks .", "tgt": "problems: likewise , problems will arise if , in the future , slightly different transcripts of the same data are annotated in formats that do not include time-marks ."}
{"src": "the hard part is specifying what you mean by `` merge `` .", "tgt": "problems: trying to merge such annotations later will not be easy , because of the combination of transcription discrepancies with the loss of the underlying connection offered by the time-marks ."}
{"src": "oh , this was aboutum , inferring intentions from features in context , and the words ,", "tgt": "abstract: the initial task of the edu group is to work on inferring intentions through context ."}
{"src": "so , < clears throat > what we found interesting is , first of all , intentions differ . maybe you want to enter a building . maybe you want to see it , or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building . if you do n't have the intention of entering your building , but you know that something is really close to it , and you just want to approach it , or get to that building .", "tgt": "abstract: in the navigational paradigm used for the task , these intentions are to `` see '' to `` enter '' or to `` get to the closest point of '' a building ."}
{"src": "but , um , since we are designing aaaan , compared to this , even bigger data collection effort , um , we will definitely take care to put it in there ,", "tgt": "abstract: there will be purpose-designed experiments carried out ."}
{"src": "um , we can look at some factors that may make a difference . um . sometimes i found in theuh , looking at the data , in a superficial way , i found some s sort of modifiers thatthat m may also give us a hint , and this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered . and i will try toto sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there , there 's gon na be contextual things , there 're gon na be linguistic things , there 're gon na be discourse things , the issue is , can we find a way to , basically , featurize it", "tgt": "abstract: however , the starting point is , through the use of existing data , to determine possible linguistic , discourse or situation features that define intentionality ."}
{"src": "like `` s go to see `` , or `` visit `` , or some this is of course a crucial factor , `` what type of object is it ? `` then of course thethe actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants . oh , another thing you want is some information abou i think , about the time of day . so if it turns out that , whatever it is , you want to know whether the person 's uh , a tourist or not , ok ? that becomes a feature .", "tgt": "abstract: these may include the type of building , time of day , particular phrases used or whether the user is a tourist or a native ."}
{"src": "and we 're able to , by hand , extract the features to put in the belief - net . if that goes well , then we can start worrying about how we would extract them . so we 'll be like , hand , uh , doing all the probabilities .", "tgt": "abstract: initially , these features will be hand-coded , but the goal is to find ways of extracting them automatically from the xml data ."}
{"src": "if we feed it through a belief - net oror something along those lines . we 'd get an inferred intention , wewe produce a structure that differentiates between the vista , the enter , and the , um , tango mode . and , my idea on how to combine them is with a belief - net , which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things , but the idea is to take as a first goal , see if we could actually build a belief - net that would make this three way distinction uh , in a plausible way , here 're the things which , if you get them out ofout of the language and discourse , and put them into the belief - net , it would tell you which of these three uh , intentions is most likely . `` i think that , uh , if we can get the information , a belief - net is a perfectly good way of doing the inferential combination of it . javabayes or something ?", "tgt": "abstract: consequently , they will be fed into a belief-net -implemented on a software package like javabayes- and the conditional probability of each intention calculated ."}
{"src": "so one thing you could do is build a little system that , said , `` whenever you got a question like that i 've got one of three answers . u u sort of i 'm , at the moment , curious and i 'mi 'ms w want to approach it from the end where we can s sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with , and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . from previous discourse or w any anything else you knew . and , then as soon as we have it , i think we should start trying to populate it for this problem .", "tgt": "abstract: a prototype system will be put together to test hypotheses regarding both the exact nature of the features and how intentions are derived from them ."}
{"src": "maybe for a deep understanding task , that 's a nice sort of playground or first little thing . `` so we think it 's a well - formed , uh , starter task for this , uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain .", "tgt": "decisions: inferring intentions in a navigational context is an appropriate task both in project and real-world terms ."}
{"src": "ok ? wewe have awe know what the outcomes are gon na be , it allall of a sudden it does much better .", "tgt": "decisions: its goals are clearly defined and contributre to a smarter system ."}
{"src": "thesewe have all these transcripts but , um , since we are designing aaaan , compared to this , even bigger data collection effort , um , we will definitely take care to put it in there , and start recording subjects probably within a month or something .", "tgt": "decisions: although there are some preliminary data to work on , task-specific experiments and recordings will take place ."}
{"src": "so , th they 're gon na give us some cr uhorwe can assume that y you get this crude information . so , yeah , we 're sort of < mike noise > committed to xml as the kind of , uh , interchange .", "tgt": "decisions: the xml format is going to be used has not been defined , although the smartkom data can be used as a foundation ."}
{"src": "ok ? soy so one of th one of the things we wan na do is actually , uh , pick a package , yeah bu w i 'd like that thisy yeah , this week , to ha to n to <inbreath> have y guys , uh , you know , pick <mouth> they you know , belief - net package", "tgt": "decisions: in the first instance , the group will have to decide on the software package to be used for the creation and manipulation of the belief-nets ."}
{"src": "you know , we do n't need the one that 'll solve massive , uh , belief - nets quickly . but we do want one in which it 's easy to interact with and , uh , modify . you want it stable , you want it and probably one in which it 's easy to have , um , what amounts to transcript files .", "tgt": "decisions: stability and ease-of-use -in addition to ability to handle xml- of the package are the focus at this stage , instead of the ability to handle large amounts of data ."}
{"src": "an and there 're plenty of people around , students in the department who , you know , live and breathe bayes - nets .", "tgt": "decisions: experts in bayes nets within icsi can be consulted on the matter ."}
{"src": "well , i 'd like to also , though , uh , ha have a first cut at what the belief - net looks like . is show the state and show the system and show that .", "tgt": "decisions: the decision will be presented in the next meeting along with a first schema of the belief-nets themselves ."}
{"src": "and you probably need intermediate nodes . and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . from previous discourse or w any anything else you knew .", "tgt": "decisions: possible intermediate nodes can be added to the nets after this ."}
{"src": "is , uh , one , where do you get this iinformation from , if that goes well , then we can start worrying about how we would extract them . and then we can start worrying about where to get this input , the issue is , can we find a way to , basically , featurize it and , as soon as we have one , we can start trying to , uh , make a first cut at what 's going on .", "tgt": "decisions: the hypothesis that a set of features from which intentions can be derived exists has to be assessed , before moving on to how to extract these features from the data automatically ."}
{"src": "the street network of our geographic information system . a lot of parsers , um , that 's way beyond their scope , isof interpreting that . because i we can not differentiate , at the moment , between , you know , the intention of wanting to go there or the intention of just know wanting to know wherewhere it is .", "tgt": "problems: curent navigation systems do not provide for the user 's particular intentions when asking for directions ."}
{"src": "it would always use the closest point to the object ,", "tgt": "problems: they always compute the shortest path between source and destination ."}
{"src": "what we do know , is that the parser we use in the smartkom system will never differentiate between any of these . so it 'sit 'sit 's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions . what he was saying is , the m - three - l does not have any of that . that 's way beyond their scope , isof interpreting that .", "tgt": "problems: the smartkom parser , for example , does not mark up data with features adequate for the inference of these intentions ."}
{"src": "there 's gon na be contextual things , there 're gon na be linguistic things , there 're gon na be discourse things , is , uh , one , where do you get this iinformation from , but if we ca n't do that , then we 're in trouble . the real issue is , do what are the factors involved in determining this ? the issue is , can we find a way to , basically , featurize it", "tgt": "problems: although it is understandable that language , discourse and situation features will play a role in how they are weighed , the exact nature of those features is unclear ."}
{"src": "and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ? so that we get some discrete number of features so that , uh , when we know the values to all those features , or as many as possible , we can w come up with the best estimate of which of the , in this case three little intentions , are most likely .", "tgt": "problems: also hard to evaluate at this stage , is how the assumed features will combine in a belief-net , in order to provide the conditional probabilities of the users ' intentions ."}
{"src": "if that goes well , then we can start worrying about how we would extract them . and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . from previous discourse or w any anything else you knew .", "tgt": "problems: even if these problems are solved , extracting the features from the data may prove to be a bottleneck ."}
{"src": "not from that data . butit was never th th the goal of that data collection toto serve for sat for such a purpose . so that 's why for example the tasks were not differentiated by intentionality , uh , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to english and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net .", "tgt": "problems: the existing data are appropriate only for preliminary work , as they do n't include intention-related information ."}
{"src": "so . uh , wewe have to have this discussion of th the experiment , and the data collection , and all that sorta stuff so , we that 's part of what we 'll have to figure out .", "tgt": "problems: on the other hand , the details of the experiments that will have to be designed to get more appropriate data are not clearcut and are yet to be settled ."}
{"src": "um right now it 's still kind ofin a toyversion of it ,", "tgt": "abstract: the group discussed the first version of the bayes-net used to work out a user 's intentions when asking for directions from a navigation device ."}
{"src": "the probabilitywhether the probability of a vista , tango , or enter .", "tgt": "abstract: three intentions were identified: vista ( to view ) , enter ( to visit ) and tango ( to approach ) ."}
{"src": "so then the features we decidedor we decided we weretalked about , you know . we had a list of things like `` to go `` and `` to visit `` and what not . uh thethe prosody , the discourse , verb choice . so there are certain cues that are very strongeither lexical or topic - based um , concept cues and some of them are sort of <breath> either world knowledge or situationalthings . is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee ,", "tgt": "abstract: the structure of the belief-net comprises , firstly , a feature layer , which includes linguistic , discourse and world knowledge information that can be gleaned from the data ."}
{"src": "so maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net , which has twohas it 's own middle layer . they ra may have there own hidden layerthat points to some ofthethe real hidden layer , um or the general hidden layer .", "tgt": "abstract: it is possible for these variables to form thematic clusters ( eg `` entrance '' , `` type of object '' , `` verb '' ) , each one with a separate middle layer ."}
{"src": "but the middle thing , we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out , like , the concept of whether they 're a touristorwhether they 're running an errand or something like that so then the hidden variableshair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry , but the other ones , the final destination , the whether they 're doing business , whether they 're in a hurry , and whether they 're tourists , they ra may have there own hidden layerthat points to some ofthethe real hidden layer , um or the general hidden layer . and then these should then connect somehow to the more plan - based deep space", "tgt": "abstract: these feed , in turn , into the main middle layer , that defines more general hidden variables , such as the tourist / business status of the user ."}
{"src": "so there are certain cues that are very strongeither lexical or topic - based um , concept cues so <breath> maybe whatwhatwhat happenedwhat might happen is that we do get this sort of task - based middle layer , entering or som you know like they might be more task - based .", "tgt": "abstract: the feature layer can end up being cue-based , while the middle layers task-based ."}
{"src": "so . the modebasically has three differentoutputs .", "tgt": "abstract: the latter determine the final probability of each intention in the output layer ."}
{"src": "it 's cra has a gui and it 's uh but uhit 's free . but actually it had an interface . and he 's updated it for an xml version of i guess bayes - nets .", "tgt": "abstract: this first model of the belief-net was built in javabayes , since it is a free package , has a graphical interface , and it can take xml files as input ."}
{"src": "like , we totally hand - tuned the probabilities , the probabilities and all are completely ad - hoc .", "tgt": "abstract: at this stage , all the actual probabilities are ad-hoc and hand-coded ."}
{"src": "but umin terms of specifying the scenario , <breath> umuhuhwe 've gotten a little further so we wanted just to collect data , to getthatthatthatelicits more , uh , that elicits richer language .", "tgt": "abstract: however , there has been progress in the design and organisation of experiments , that will eventually provide data more useful and appropriate for this task ."}
{"src": "so then our next idea was to add a middle layer , uhwe kept umthings from directly affecting the modebeyond the concept , but we just decided to keep all the things we extractedto point at the middle and thendown . i guess , the fact that thethere 's a complete separation between theobserved features and in the output .", "tgt": "decisions: it is necessary for the belief-net to have at least one layer of nodes between the features and the final output ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: this makes the structure more flexible in terms of coding feature-layer probabilities ."}
{"src": "is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee , so maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net , which has twohas it 's own middle layer . that would all f funnel into one node that wouldconstitute entrance requirements or something like that . they ra may have there own hidden layerthat points to some ofthethe real hidden layer , um or the general hidden layer .", "tgt": "decisions: another technique to systematise the work is the thematic clustering of the features , each cluster forming a bayes-net of each own: for example features like `` admission fee '' and `` opening hours '' can feed into an intermediate `` entrance '' node connecting to the main middle layer ."}
{"src": "so , um i suggest w toforto proceed with this inin the sense thatmaybe throughout this week the three of us willwill talk some more about maybe segmenting off different regions , identifyfour regions , maybe make up some features for each region", "tgt": "decisions: the next stage is to refine the set of feature nodes and identify possible clusters ."}
{"src": "so one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in theuse of `` admission fee discussion `` as a cue for entry , <breath> is thinking about the plans that various people might have . they 'reinin non in sort of more traditional ai kinds of plan recognition things you sort of have <breath> you know , some idea at each turn of agent doing something , i mean there are somesome of them are extremely elaborate ,", "tgt": "decisions: although , in theory , traditional ai plan recognition techniques could also be helpful for inferring intentions , the schemas involved are too elaborate for this task ."}
{"src": "yeah , another thing to do , um , is also to , umi guess to ask around people about other bayes - net packages .", "tgt": "decisions: further work also includes discussing the possible advantages of bayes-net packages , other than javabayes , with experts at icsi ."}
{"src": "we can maybe write an interface th for uh entering probability distributions easily , something likelike a little script . i think it mightit might be simpler to justhave a script that , you know", "tgt": "decisions: if they continue using javabayes , a script to help with the inputting of probabilities in the nodes is needed , as the in-built method is cumbersome ."}
{"src": "like we wannawe wan na be able to collect <breath> as much of the variables that are needed for that , so now i think we should maybe have at least one navigational task withwith sort of explicituh", "tgt": "decisions: finally , it was decided that at least some of the experiments designed for the new data collection initiative will factor in the intentions studied in the current task ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: the set of cues that form the feature nodes is not well-defined yet ."}
{"src": "that 'sthatthat needs a lot of work .", "tgt": "problems: especially with lexical cues ( verbs , modifiers etc ) , no one offered specific intuitions as to how they might contribute to the inference of intentions ."}
{"src": "because we did n't know the probabilities ofor so that 's like a huge uh clue that they 're trying to enter the place rather than uh to tango or vista , like , we totally hand - tuned the probabilities , the probabilities and all are completely ad - hoc .", "tgt": "problems: other features , like `` admission fee '' , may be intuitively linked with one of the outputs ( enter ) , however , any probabilities are coded in an ad-hoc fashion and are by no means realistic ."}
{"src": "but you could see perhaps discus the `` admission fee `` going directly to the mode pointing at `` enter `` , well for instance , the `` discourse admission fee `` node seems like it should point directly to the or increase the probability of `` enterdirectly `` versus `` going there via tourist `` .", "tgt": "problems: cases like this , where feature and output seem to be linked directly , bring the necessity of a middle layer in the belief-net to question ."}
{"src": "reasons being , you know , it 'd be a pain to set up all the probabilities for that . if we moved onto the next step and did learning of some sort , uh according bhaskara we 'd be handicapped .", "tgt": "problems: nevertheless , not having a middle layer would not allow for shifts in the discourse and would make the setting of probabilities and manipulation of the belief-net clumsy ."}
{"src": "it might be that if you add a new thing pointing to a variable , you just likeit just overwrites everything . butthey 're not very friendly .", "tgt": "problems: some issues with the use of javabayes also arose: the addition of new variables in an existing node overwrites all previous settings , and the native text file where the probability tables are set is not easy to read ; this makes adding and changing variables and nodes problematic ."}
{"src": "i did n't think it did learning .", "tgt": "problems: finally , it is unclear how much learning can be done on the created nets ."}
{"src": "so . on friday we had our wizard test data test and um <outbreath> these are some of the results .", "tgt": "abstract: a test run of the data collection design was very successful ."}
{"src": "um , we have to refine the tasks more and more , which of course we have n't done at all , so far , in order to avoid this rephrasing , and uh my suggestion is of course wewe keep the wizard , because i think she did a wonderful job , umand also if she 's willing to take on the job of organizing all those subjects and stuff that would be wonderful .", "tgt": "abstract: the group decided to hire the `` wizard '' and continue with the refinement of the design and recruitment of subjects ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: on the other hand , there was a presentation of a new version of the belief-net for the vista / enter / tango mode task ."}
{"src": "so , what i did for thisthis isuh , a pedagogical belief - net and i grouped things according to whathow i thought they would fit in to uh image schemas that would be related . well , this is not a working bayes - net . but the uhthethe nice thing is that you know , it just is ais a visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple clearly have to be specified m more carefully", "tgt": "abstract: it is not a working net yet , but identifying clusters of features that define the output mode provides a visual aid for further work ."}
{"src": "is , if we just do this , we could wind up with a huge uh , combinatoric input to the mode thing . uh , we have a d a technical problem with the belief - nets that wewe do n't want all the com too many factors if weif we allow them to just go combinatorially .", "tgt": "abstract: there are potential problems from a combinatorics perspective ."}
{"src": "which is there are technical ways of doing it , and the other trick , which is not a technical trick , it 's kind of a knowledge engineering trick , is to make the neach node sufficiently narrow that you do n't get this combinatorics .", "tgt": "abstract: these can be tackled either with technical adjustments or through careful knowledge engineering ."}
{"src": "we have to add , you know , not too much about um object types and stuff , that 's another sort of thing `` ok , here 's aanother kind of minimal uh way of tackling this `` . add extra properties , a deterministic rule for every property", "tgt": "abstract: a base solution for the task would be to simply add some extra action-mode rules in the smartkom system ."}
{"src": "and umand here is exactly where what 's gon na be replaced with our bayes - net ,", "tgt": "abstract: action modes , however , can be inferred more efficiently by feeding a collection of features -from the ontology , discourse history , parsing , etc . - into bayes-nets that would replace those rules ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: ideally , the results of this small task will give insights into the function of linguistic deep understanding ."}
{"src": "so . what you 're trying to get out of this deep co cognitive linguistics is the fact that w if you know about sourcesource , paths and goals , and nnnall this sort of stuff , that a lot of this is the same , for different tasks . and thatuh there 'sthere 's somesome important generalities that you 're getting , so that if you have sources , you have trajectors and stuff like that , but what i 'd like to be able to do is to have the way that you extract properties , that will go into different bayes - nets , be theuh general . what you 'd really like of course is the same thing you 'd always like which is that you have um a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same o over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs .", "tgt": "abstract: for instance , the final combination of features used in the current study may form a representation of the ontology , general enough to employ in any task that includes trajectors and paths ."}
{"src": "s so if you just number them `` one `` , `` two `` , `` three `` it 's and uh my suggestion is of course wewe keep the wizard , because i think she did a wonderful job ,", "tgt": "decisions: although the data collection test went well and it was decided to hire the `` wizard '' , there are minor amendments in the procedure to be carried out ( shortenting the preparatory reading , numbering tasks etc ) ."}
{"src": "my idea on that wasuh , partly we 'll talk about system stuff for the computer scientists , but partly i did want it to get the linguists involved in some of this issue about what the task is and allum you know , what the dialogue is , and what 's going on linguistically , you just uh do `` this is what we did , and here 's thething , and here 's s some of the dialogue andand so forth . ``", "tgt": "decisions: a presentation of the data collection design should be included in the forthcoming meeting with other research groups , along with some account of the system design and the use of belief-nets ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: the structure of the latter was a major issue during the meeting ."}
{"src": "so the belief - net takes as input , a vector , and then we want to look up some more stuff in the ontology but also we definitely want to look up in the dialogue history um some s some stuff . there will be rules , but they are n't rules that come to final decisions , they 're rules that gather information for a decision process . my guess is it 'll be the same basic agent that um can go off and get information , run it through aa c this belief - net that", "tgt": "decisions: their input vector is to be provided by information extracted from the various modules of the system , such as the ontology and discourse history , using standard rule-based methods ."}
{"src": "and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones , then you would have to supply the parameters . and that may actually involve getting more information .", "tgt": "decisions: the output action essentially provides additional semantic parameters for the x-schema , and , in turn , may trigger the collection of more features from the data ."}
{"src": "i think weii can come up with aa code for a module that we call the `` cognitive dispatcher `` , which does nothing , but it looks of complect object trees and decides howare there parts missing that need to be filled out , and then collect uh sub - objects and then recombine them and put them together .", "tgt": "decisions: the feature extraction could be carried out by a software tool checking object ( feature ) trees and filling them with appropriate values ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: for this concept to be put to work , further refinement of the belief-net variables is necessary , with particular attention on the combinatorics involved ."}
{"src": "five minutes is just too long . s so if you just number them `` one `` , `` two `` , `` three `` it 's", "tgt": "problems: after the trial run of the experiment , some minor issues , like the length of the preliminary reading and the need to order the tasks given to the subjects , were highlighted ."}
{"src": "she also agrees that you know if it 's all just gon na be students the data is gon na be less valuable because of that", "tgt": "problems: it is also possible that the pool of subjects ends up comprising almost entirely of students ; more variation in the sample is needed ."}
{"src": "is , if we just do this , we could wind up with a huge uh , combinatoric input to the mode thing . uh , we have a d a technical problem with the belief - nets that wewe do n't want all the com too many factors if weif we allow them to just go combinatorially .", "tgt": "problems: from a system design perspective , the progress so far has shown that the combinatorics of the bayes-net even for a simple task , like the choice of vista / enter / tango mode , could render it unmanageable ."}
{"src": "so , what i did for thisthis isuh , a pedagogical belief - net well , this is not a working bayes - net .", "tgt": "problems: the belief-net presented in the meeting is not a working bayes-net ."}
{"src": "i mean , not necessarily in th in this meeting , but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are . so the immediate problem is just deciding w which aspects of the x - schema to add .", "tgt": "problems: consequently , it is as yet unclear what the decision nodes in the net are , and what values these can take ."}
{"src": "the harder problem is we decide what we want to use , how are we gon na get it ?", "tgt": "problems: even if those were decided , how to extract the necessary information from the data , would still be an open issue ."}
{"src": "and i do n't yet see how that goes .", "tgt": "problems: looking at the bigger picture , the current task is yet to provide insights into more general ways to achieve linguistic deep understanding ."}
{"src": "and uh see if we can find a way to present this to this linguists group thatthat is helpful to them .", "tgt": "problems: with these intricacies in mind , it is not easy to put together a presentation of the project cohesive and attractive enough for the other research groups in the institute ."}
{"src": "what we think is gon na happen is that , uh , in parallel starting about now <breath> we 're gon na get fey <mouth> to , where you 're working with me and robert , draft a note that we 're gon na send out to various cogsci c and other classes saying , `` here 's an opportunity to be a subject . but what i 'd like to do , if it 's o k , <breath> is to s to , as i say , start the recruiting in parallel and possibly start running subjects next week .", "tgt": "abstract: the data collection running in parallel with the project can start shortly with recruiting subjects ."}
{"src": "and , umand now it 'swe have a complete english parser that does everything the german parser does . and it still is , now in english . that , these guys did in ain a day .", "tgt": "abstract: meanwhile , the german parser now works with english sentences ."}
{"src": "one thing i was wondering , was , those functions there , are those things that modify the m - three - l basically ? i think each of those functions act on the current xml structure , and change it in some way , for example , by adding aa l a field to it , or something . there were other actions uh , thatthat s seemed to stepstate variables somewhere , which , in german , uh , takes these t sentence templates and produces xml structures .", "tgt": "abstract: the parser 's output modifies the xml used by the system to initiate actions and generate responses ."}
{"src": "uhyouyou have a route , and everyevery element of that e r r f of thatevery segment we call a `` route element `` . where y whereyou sort of end , and some points of interest along the way .", "tgt": "abstract: the xml for map requests also comprise a route , route elements and points of interest along the way ."}
{"src": "is one , um , <breath> <mouth> also allocating , uh , some tags for our action schema enter - vista - approach ,", "tgt": "abstract: it is at this level that enter / vista / approach tags will be added as action modes ."}
{"src": "uh , at some point we 're going to have to worry about the language end .", "tgt": "abstract: as the project evolves , further enrichment of the ontology ( actions , linguistic features ) will be necessary ."}
{"src": "ehso , youyouyou may orso , then you 'd have this little vector of , um , you know , approach mode or eva mode . it 's part of what you know aboutaan object , <breath> is its eva vector .", "tgt": "abstract: similarly , object representations will include an eva vector ."}
{"src": "if you know it for a specific landmark you put it there . if you do n't , you just go up the hierarchy to the first place you find one . if it 's that type of thing , and we want its eva vector , pppt - pppt ! it 's that . ``", "tgt": "abstract: this can be incorporated in the database entry for a particular building or inherited from the ontology of the building type ."}
{"src": "the typical example is that , um , these are all a bunch of cues for something , and this is a certain effect that we 'd like to conclude .", "tgt": "abstract: these elements will constitute only a small part of the inputs of the bayes-net that determines the action mode ."}
{"src": "and , that 's a lot of probabilities to put here , which is kind of a pain .", "tgt": "abstract: the actual number of the inputs can create a combinatorial explosion when setting the probabilities ."}
{"src": "sonoisy - ors are a way to , uh , <breath> sort of deal with this . so we come up with these l little tables for each of those and the final thing is that , um <breath> <mouth> this is a deterministic function of these , th - c the full conditional probability tablewith some function .", "tgt": "abstract: noisy-or 's can help avoid this by simplifying the probability tables and applying a deterministic function to produce their complete version ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: in any case , further to fulfilling the basic requirements ( translating the parser and the generator into english ) , the project is entirely open-ended in terms of focus of research ."}
{"src": "in parallel with that , we 're gon na need to actually do the script . thisthe permission form .", "tgt": "decisions: as the data collection is about to begin , there are some minor changes to be done in the design of the experiment , the script and the permission forms ."}
{"src": "what we think is gon na happen is that , uh , in parallel starting about now <breath> we 're gon na get fey <mouth> to , where you 're working with me and robert , draft a note that we 're gon na send out to various cogsci c and other classes saying , `` here 's an opportunity to be a subject . not necessarily by any means all students but what i 'd like to do , if it 's o k , <breath> is to s to , as i say , start the recruiting in parallel and possibly start running subjects next week . which is we gon na check out our social infrastructures for possible subjects .", "tgt": "decisions: subjects can be recruited either from within the university or through other social circles ."}
{"src": "that , these guys did in ain a day . eh , but again , there 's one module in which there 's one piece <mouth> that we have to convert to english .", "tgt": "decisions: as to the system design , the next step is the translation of the generator into english ."}
{"src": "and the next thing i would like to be able to do , and it seems like this would not be too difficult either , is <breath> to say , `` ok let 's now pretend we actually wanted to not only change the <breath> the mapping ofof , uh , words to the m - three - l but we also wanted to changeadd a new sentence type so , yeah . i definitely think it 's <breath> it 's worth the exercise of trying to actually add something that is n't there .", "tgt": "decisions: moreover , it is important to test the system and its internal workings by adding new sentence types and modifying the parser ."}
{"src": "it seems to me we can get <breath> all the complexity we want in actions and in language without going outside of tourists in heidelberg . so , at leastunless somebody else wants t to suggest otherwise i think <breath> the general domain we do n't have t to uh , broaden . that is , tourists in heidelberg .", "tgt": "decisions: all further research will use the existing domain ( `` tourists in heidelberg '' ) , as this provides enough diversity for the purposes of the project ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: the german partners for the project will realise all the necessary changes in the ontology ."}
{"src": "so it seemed to me , what we ought to do is get our story together . and think about it some , internally , before asking them to make changes . ok . what are the thl class of things we think we might try to do in a year or two ? this isthis is everything thatthat , um , <breath> you know , umwe might want to do in the next couple years .", "tgt": "decisions: it is therefore preferable for the group to exercise foresight and agree on the set of new tags they will need in the long run , so that they limit the number of change requests ."}
{"src": "sonoisy - ors are a way to , uh , <breath> sort of deal with this . i think we definitelyi think it 's a great idea tha toto pursue that .", "tgt": "decisions: finally , on a more technical note , noisy-or 's were discussed and considered a sensible approach to deal with the potential problems with the setting the conditional probabilities of the bayes-nets ."}
{"src": "and , umand now it 'swe have a complete english parser that does everything the german parser does . i think each of those functions act on the current xml structure , and change it in some way , for example , by adding aa l a field to it , or something . there were other actions uh , thatthat s seemed to stepstate variables somewhere , it 's mystery functions . that , these guys did in ain a day .", "tgt": "problems: although the parser has been modified to work with english , the details of its internal workings ( calling functions , setting discourse variables , generating actions ) are not yet clear ."}
{"src": "although th the <breath> to get at them from a language may not be trivial . so , it 's a relational database with persons , events , <breath> and , um , objects .", "tgt": "problems: understanding the parsed data is helped by the database of objects , people and events accompanying the system , but the mapping of referring expressions to database objects can still be a hurdle ."}
{"src": "and , that 's a lot of probabilities to put here , which is kind of a pain .", "tgt": "problems: on a different level , the bayes-net used to generate the different action modes can easily become unmanageable as the number of features to be taken into account increases ."}
{"src": "sonoisy - ors are a way to , uh , <breath> sort of deal with this .", "tgt": "problems: this can be tackled with the use of the noisy-or technique ."}
{"src": "so , if ba - javabayes wo n't do it for you , and thenbut , the combination functions , and whether we can put those in java bayes , and all that sort of stuff , is , uhis the bigger deal .", "tgt": "problems: the deterministic functions this requires can not be introduced directly into javabayes , although some runaround ways can be implemented ."}
{"src": "there 's this whole framework problem that i 'm feeling really uncomfortable about .", "tgt": "problems: a final , high-level issue , that has not been dealt with yet , is the definition of the constructions and the construction grammar framework analysis behind the whole enterprise ."}
{"src": "so they 'll have a little bit more natural interaction ?", "tgt": "abstract: the data collection script has been slightly modified , so that it encourages more natural dialogue between the subjects and the `` wizard '' ."}
{"src": "and um we have a little description of asking peop subjects to contact fey for you know recruiting them for our thing however there is always more people in ain a facul uh in a department than are just taking his class or anybody else 's class at the moment and then we 're going to have anotherwe 're gon na have w another trial run", "tgt": "abstract: another trial run will take place , while a call to recruit subjects is being emailed to students ."}
{"src": "um , the basic requirement is fulfilled almost . you can speak into it and ask for tv and movie information", "tgt": "abstract: meanwhile , the translation of the tv and cinema information system to english is almost complete ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: this was the basic requirement of the project ."}
{"src": "then uh on to the modeling . in the future though , the content of a hypothesis will not only be an object and anan action and a domain object but an action , a domain object , and a rich action description ,", "tgt": "abstract: on the other hand , there was a presentation of the model that offers more elaborate action planning for smartkom , of which enter / view / approach ( eva ) modes are a part ."}
{"src": "inside of enter there will be roles that can be filled basically .", "tgt": "abstract: these modes will form categories of complete xml schemas with information filled in from the language understanding in a more elaborate way than the current object- '' go action '' -object model ."}
{"src": "the idea is , so , imagine we have a library of schema such as the source - path - goal well one of the types of action schemas is source - path - goal action .", "tgt": "abstract: these categories will , in turn , be linked with action schemas , one of which is source-path-goal ( spg ) ."}
{"src": "the idea is , so , imagine we have a library of schema so if you wanted to have a new type of action you 'd create a new type of category .", "tgt": "abstract: categories and action schemas can have -in theory- any number of blocks depending on the expansion of the domain ."}
{"src": "meaning we can reference . and link it to another one , and this not only within a document but also via documents ,", "tgt": "abstract: the notation provides for linking and referencing between different schemas ."}
{"src": "and then those actions can be in multiple categories at the same time if necessary . it 'sit 's crucially necessary , is that we can have multiple schemas and multiple action schemas in parallel .", "tgt": "abstract: the model also allows for multiple action schemas to be triggered in parallel ."}
{"src": "um and i agree that you know this is something we need to discuss ,", "tgt": "abstract: however , the structure of the model is open for discussion , since its use was to elicit discussion and highlight issues ."}
{"src": "um , so we 're about to collect data and um we have a little description of asking peop subjects to contact fey for you know recruiting them for our thing", "tgt": "decisions: as the data collection is about to start , a call for the recruitment of subjects is going to be sent out ."}
{"src": "however there is always more people in ain a facul uh in a department than are just taking his class or anybody else 's class at the moment", "tgt": "decisions: the main pool of subjects is going to be the student community in the institute ."}
{"src": "there the idea is now that next actually wewe need to hire one more person to actually do that job", "tgt": "decisions: along with the `` wizard '' , who is going to be an integral part of the experiments , another person needs to be hired as the instructor for the tasks involved in them ."}
{"src": "meeting time rescheduling . i n did n't you say something about friday ,", "tgt": "decisions: meetings were rescheduled and are now going to take place on fridays ."}
{"src": "so i mean clearly there 'si can talk about the um the parser changes on friday at least ,", "tgt": "decisions: for the next meeting , there is going to be a presentation of the modifications in the parser module of the basic system ."}
{"src": "andand this is onon aonon my list of things until nextnext week . yeah , wei will promise for the next time to have fleshed out nxml examples for aa run through andand see how thisthis then translates ,", "tgt": "decisions: additionally , the proposed xml model will be put to the test with concrete data ."}
{"src": "and um if you can get that binding point also maybe with a nice example that would be helpful for johno and me .", "tgt": "decisions: similarly , such examples will clarify issues relating to the binding and redundancy of features with common characteristics amongst the shcemas ( eg `` container '' for enter and `` goal '' for spg ) ."}
{"src": "um and then , secondly , we had , you may remember , um the problem with the re - phrasing , that subject always re - phrase sort of the task that uh we gave them ,", "tgt": "problems: subjects in the trial runs of the experiment were given detailed descriptions of the tasks , which led to the subsequent dialogue being a re-iteration or re-phrasing of the instructions ."}
{"src": "however , not only wasthe common census wereamong all participants of friday 's meeting was it 's gon na be very laborious toto make these drawings for each different things , so all of a sudden we 'll get descriptions of pictures in there .", "tgt": "problems: using pictures instead would be one way to deal with the problem , however , it was deemed too laborious and it would divert the focus of the experiment ."}
{"src": "and the problem is , is that the current system does not distinguish between goes of type `` going into `` , goes of type `` want to go to a place where i can take a picture of `` , et cetera . in the future though , the content of a hypothesis will not only be an object and anan action and a domain object but an action , a domain object , and a rich action description ,", "tgt": "problems: as the original action planner of the smartkom system only included a generic spg schema , a new module was presented that allows for variety in the user intentions to be included ."}
{"src": "well , i think we 're gon na hit a lot of interesting problems um and i agree that you know this is something we need to discuss ,", "tgt": "problems: this being only a model , there are several issues that will need to be clarified in the future ."}
{"src": "it 's also a question of the recursiveness andand a hier hierarchy um in there .", "tgt": "problems: how the model deals with redundancy of information among categories and action schemas , and whether a flat or a hierarchical model would be preferable are two of them ."}
{"src": "and it 's gon na get more and more complex thethe l complexer and larger our domains get .", "tgt": "problems: what is also clear is that as the domain of research broadens beyond the study of eva modes , the complexity of the model will also increase ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: a detailed diagram of the belief-net had already been disseminated ."}
{"src": "one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what", "tgt": "abstract: its structure was discussed during the meeting ."}
{"src": "the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from the uh user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse . these are all like saying ev or a ,", "tgt": "abstract: there are several endpoints ( user , ontology , discourse etc ) with separate eva ( enter / view / approach ) values ."}
{"src": "one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what", "tgt": "abstract: details of how different inputs feed into them were discussed at length ."}
{"src": "if it 's fixing things selling things , or servicing things so the idea would be that you might wan na merge those three you could have a node that 'sthat was a measure of the match between the object 's feature , you know , the match between the object the entity , i 'm sorry and the user .", "tgt": "abstract: ideas mentioned included grouping features of buildings like `` selling '' , `` fixing '' and `` exhibiting '' , as well as creating a user-compatibility node that would take different values depending on the situation and the user status ."}
{"src": "so here is thethewe had that the user 's budget may influence the outcome of decisions . well the fir see the first thing is , getting back to thing we left out of the other is the actual discourse .", "tgt": "abstract: similarly , a go-there ( towards a building ) node can be influenced by things like the user 's budget and discourse parameters amongst other things ."}
{"src": "and we do n't know what they are yet .", "tgt": "abstract: the latter are still ill-defined at this stage ."}
{"src": "because uh we 're gon na want to know you know , which constructions indicate various of these properties", "tgt": "abstract: the study of the linguistic constructions that people use in this kind of navigational domain is expected to be prove useful in that respect ."}
{"src": "so um recall the basic problem which is that um you have a belief - net and you have like a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node . so the problem is to specify the uh so the conditional property of this given all those ,", "tgt": "abstract: as each node in the tree is the decision point of the combination of its parent nodes , which rules govern this combination is an important issue ."}
{"src": "and we just take the uh we essentially take um averages , this is a hidden variable . w i was just , if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w a weighting s system though too ,", "tgt": "abstract: there are several approaches ranging from simply averaging the inputs to using a hidden variable in order to weight them differently depending on context ."}
{"src": "ok , so theythey could either be hand coded or learned or", "tgt": "abstract: if the latter architecture is used , the net could -to an extent- be trained with the data that is currently being collected ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: although this was mainly a brainstorming meeting , some minor tasks were allocated for the near future ."}
{"src": "yeah , ii mean , it might soon , if this is gon na be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for our purposes .", "tgt": "decisions: since the net architecture and possible decision algorithms were discussed , it is necessary to examine how much of this javabayes can accommodate and , if not , what modifications would be necessary ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: additionally , the german partners visiting the institute will need to see some results of the new system design ."}
{"src": "so , i mean i know we 're going for sort of a rough and ready .", "tgt": "decisions: finally , the analysis of the linguistic constructions for the current research domain can begin even with limited data , as , at this stage , they need not be very detailed ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: the is only a diagrammatic view of how the decision tree for the eva task looks like ."}
{"src": "we have the user interest is ais a vector of five hundred values , that you 'd have to do see in order to do reference and stuff like that um you 've got ta have both the current discourse and the context to say i wan na go back there ,", "tgt": "problems: a lot of the details have been glossed over: the user model can potentially comprise a huge number of factors ; a planning `` go-there '' node needs input from several other areas of the net ; there are intricate interactions between discourse and the situation model ."}
{"src": "and we do n't know what they are yet .", "tgt": "problems: similarly , what discourse properties are of importance and how they influence eva probabilities is still a mystery ."}
{"src": "but then the question is do youdo we wan na propagate beliefs every single time it 's updated or only when we need to ?", "tgt": "problems: on a more general note , there is also the question of whether the net should be updated continuously or only when it is needed ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: no final decision was taken as to the rules of computation applying in the belief-net ."}
{"src": "ok , so theythey could either be hand coded or learned or based on training data , like , are we able to get these nodes from the data ?", "tgt": "problems: the more interesting solutions would ideally require training data , and it is still debatable whether the current collection would be appropriate for this particular task ."}
{"src": "yeah , ii mean , it might soon , if this is gon na be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for our purposes .", "tgt": "problems: in any case , how different architectures can be implemented in javabayes and what modifications would be necessary for the purposes of this project also need to be investigated ."}
{"src": "umso far i 've thought of it as sort of adding it onto the modeler knowledge module . we talked about this several times thatthatthethe input end is gon na need a fair amount of feedback from the planning end . so we talked about the fact that there 're going to be a certain number of decisions that you want the knowledge modeler to make , that will be then fed to the function module , that does uh , route planning .", "tgt": "abstract: the berkeley even deeper understanding group discussed plans and concerns regarding the architecture of smartkom , its proposed modules , and the types of interactions expected to take place between modules ."}
{"src": "and then that can be sort of developed uh as needed when we getenter the tourism domain . we probably wo n't do this early on , because the current focus is more on the decision making and stuff like that .", "tgt": "abstract: the meeting was largely focused on smartkom 's decision making capacity and how to adapt this functionality to the tourist information domain ."}
{"src": "so anyt we 'll find a time later in the week to uh get together and talk aboutyour understanding of what smartkom plans are .", "tgt": "decisions: the group set a date for assessing smartkom plans ."}
{"src": "and they 're currently um agreeing oror in the process of agreeing on an x m l - ification of um something like a state - transition network of how dialogues would proceed .", "tgt": "decisions: it was decided that smartkom 's action plans should be represented in xml as a state transition network ."}
{"src": "it oughta be called aa dialogue manager .", "tgt": "decisions: it was proposed that the term 'dialogue planner ' should replace 'dialogue manager ' ."}
{"src": "no he 's completely gon na rewrite everything . in java . no , that 's gon na be phased out .", "tgt": "decisions: prolog will be phased out completely and replaced by java code ."}
{"src": "and thisone of these planning modules comes along and says `` hey , right now we need to ask a question `` . so that forces the dialogue manager to change state .", "tgt": "decisions: the dialogue manager must be capable of changing states , i.e . go from being event driven to answering a question from a planning module ."}
{"src": "andand thethe underlying idea of course is that there is something like kernel modules with kernel functionality that you can plug uh certain applications like tourist information or um the home scenario with uh controlling a vcr and so on . and keep these things like uh tourist information external . that 's an additional reason to have this well - defined interface so if you can do this , then the notion would be that across a very large range of domains , you could use this deep conceptual basis as the interface .", "tgt": "decisions: smartkom should feature a well defined core interface , with domain-specific information kept external ."}
{"src": "um it 's toto integrate and syntactic analysis . butbut uh given th the constraints , that you want it to be small and fast and so forth , my guess is you 're probably into some kind of chunk parsing .", "tgt": "decisions: a syntactic analysis component that performs chunk parsing will be added to the system ."}
{"src": "you know th the functional module thatthat interacts withwith where the tourism g stuff is goingprobably is too restrictive . um is based on slots that have to be filled and i 'm not sure ifif complex slots of that type are really um being taken into consideration .", "tgt": "problems: as a functional module , the action planner is too restrictive for the tourist domain and requires complex slots from the dialogue manager ."}
{"src": "i think thethe true key issues is how does the whatever comes out of the language input pipeline look like and then what the action planner does with it", "tgt": "problems: what form will the language input have , and what will the action planner do with it ?"}
{"src": "we talked about this several times thatthatthethe input end is gon na need a fair amount of feedback from the planning end .", "tgt": "problems: links must be in place between the input end , action planner , parser , and language feedback components for communicating the current state of plan ."}
{"src": "yeah i think just thethe spatial planner and the route planner soa printout of the communication between those two fills up i do n't know how many pages", "tgt": "problems: interactions in a deep map system between the spatial planner and the route planner are too convoluted ."}
{"src": "yeah , uh the problem is th that it has to be very fast and they also have to be very robust . cuz of um speech recognition errors butbut uh given th the constraints , that you want it to be small and fast and so forth , my guess is you 're probably into some kind of chunk parsing . some extensions uh have to be made . forfor a english version", "tgt": "problems: smartkom requires a fast and robust parser that includes language-specific extensions ."}
{"src": "but the other half of the problem is how would you get that kind of information from the parsed input ?", "tgt": "problems: which form of semantic construction grammar should be used , and how would such information be derived from the parsed input ?"}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: the translation of smartkom to english is in its final stages ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: the synthesis module will be the last one to do , after the english syntax trees are completed ."}
{"src": "right now it 's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes onononon seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything . we can even make asort of an internal demo , um . <outbreath> well it was just amazing toto see uh howhow instable the whole thing is ,", "tgt": "abstract: the system is still buggy and unstable , but it will soon be ready for a demonstration ."}
{"src": "n no , to just get the dem get the demos they need . so th the demo the demo requirements for this fall are sort of taken care of as of later this week or something .", "tgt": "abstract: this is the first of two working demos required for the project ."}
{"src": "but , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out .", "tgt": "abstract: further than that , there are no restrictions on the focus of the research or its possible applications ."}
{"src": "and so these issues about uh , reference , andspatialreference , discourse reference , uh - uh - uh - uhall this sort of stuff , uh , deixis which is part of what you were talking about , so we got ta do all this .", "tgt": "abstract: for example , issues like spatial descriptions could be investigated ."}
{"src": "on this scale , you have it either be ego or allocentric . so in addition to e ego and allocentric uh which appear all over the place , you also apparently have this proximal - distal thing which is very deeply uh embedded .", "tgt": "abstract: the variety of linguistic conventions seem to develop around an ego / allo-centric and a proximal / distal paradigm ."}
{"src": "by the way , theresomething that i did n't know until about a week ago or so , is apparently , there are separate brain areas for things within reach , and things that are out of reach .", "tgt": "abstract: the latter is also reflected in neuro-physiological data ."}
{"src": "so , i think as far as this group goes , um , it 's certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts .", "tgt": "abstract: from an engineering perspective , the belief-net for the ave task should be completed within a few weeks ."}
{"src": "and we went through this , and , i think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there .", "tgt": "abstract: the majority of the nodes are already there ."}
{"src": "ok ? what allyou know , what are the considerations and how and what are the ways in which they relate .", "tgt": "abstract: this leaves the dependencies between them and the rules of computation to be set ."}
{"src": "so `` ok , we 're not using their system . that means we need our system . `` but to do that we 're gon na need to make some decisions like ontology , i does uh either the uh smartkom project or one of the projects at eml have something that we can just p pull out , for that .", "tgt": "abstract: since the whole system is going to be re-designed , there are major decisions to be taken regarding the parser and the ontology , as well as what can be re-used from past eml projects ."}
{"src": "so the idea is there 's this uh , other subgroup that 's worrying about formalizing the nota getting a notation .", "tgt": "abstract: in parallel , another team is working on formalisation and notation ."}
{"src": "oh there 's yet another one of the incoming firstincoming first - year graduate students who 's expressed interest , and actually i talked today to a uh undergraduate who wants to do an honors thesis on this . and , while we 're at this level , uh , there 's at least one new doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project , either next week or the first of august , depending on the blandishments of microsoft .", "tgt": "abstract: finally , more ideas are expected to come from students and their research ."}
{"src": "so , c sh we could set that up as actually an institute wide thing ? well d wewe do wan na have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of pipe in extra xml messages from left and right before you 're", "tgt": "decisions: the final english smartkom demo will be presented to the whole institute once the system is de-bugged and stabilised ."}
{"src": "so i 'd like to , for the summer turn into science mode . but , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out . uh . i mean there are a lot of issues , what 's the ontology look like , you know what do the constructions look like , what 's the execution engine look like ,", "tgt": "decisions: after the demo , the focus of research can switch towards purely scientific goals , including issues on ontology , deep semantic constructions , execution engines etc ."}
{"src": "so `` ok , we 're not using their system . that means we need our system . `` and so , uh , in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right , and the formalism and stuff , we 're actually gon na build something", "tgt": "decisions: moreover , a new system will be designed for the project and at least some parts of it should be built ."}
{"src": "cuz we 'rewe 're not only goingthe plan is not only to lay out this thing , but to actually uh build some of it . it looks like we 're now in a position that the construction analyzer that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyzer that nancy needs for the child language modeling .", "tgt": "decisions: similarly , the construction analyser should be a single , general tool working for both the tourist domain and child language modelling ."}
{"src": "and one of the things we need to do is the um , and this i think is relatively tighttightly constrained , is to finish up this belief - net stuff . so , i think as far as this group goes , um , it 's certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts .", "tgt": "decisions: the focus for the next meeting will be on the belief-net , of which a working demo should be complete in the next few weeks ."}
{"src": "so uh what we 're gon na do initially isis do design , and , i if you will , guess . but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise i think we 'll just design it .", "tgt": "decisions: since there are not enough data , its connections and weights will have to be designed ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: although javabayes has been the tool of choice until now , the possibility that hugin could be a better option should be investigated ."}
{"src": "and um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal `` group - ware `` server at eml , so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing andand generating and constructions w wewe sort of uh put it in there and they put what they do in there and maybe we can even um , get some overlap , get some synergy out of that .", "tgt": "decisions: in order to promote the collaboration with eml , the group-ware server there will be updated with all progress being made in the two sites ."}
{"src": "and so anyway we c uhwe can m undoubtedly get ami uh to give a talk at uh eml or something like that . while he 's inin uh a lot of interest . actually , either place , dfki or uh", "tgt": "decisions: a talk on some of the issues will also be organised to take place at dfki ."}
{"src": "e the versionthat is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work .", "tgt": "problems: the german smartkom version available on the server does not work ."}
{"src": "right now it 's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes onononon seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything . because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition running with this s siemens virtual touch screen , which we do n't have here . but it 's working now , and i g i got the feeling that we arethe only ones right now who have a running system . um . <outbreath> well it was just amazing toto see uh howhow instable the whole thing is ,", "tgt": "problems: the english version , although still under development , does work , however , the system is still unstable as -apart from other reasons- it was initially built to work with a touch screen ."}
{"src": "well d wewe do wan na have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of pipe in extra xml messages from left and right before you 're", "tgt": "problems: de-bugging and cleaning up has to take place before any new modules are added on it ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: as regards the belief-net , no connections and dependencies have been built into it ."}
{"src": "so uh what we 're gon na do initially isis do design , and , i if you will , guess . but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise i think we 'll just design it .", "tgt": "problems: these will have to be guessed instead of learnt through data , as not enough data is available for such a task ."}
{"src": "javabayes does not support that . ii also s would suggest not to d spend two weeks ininin changing thethe javabayes code .", "tgt": "problems: finally , it has been noted that the javabayes gui does not satisfy all the presentation requirements for this belief-net and modifying the underlying code would be too time-consuming ."}
{"src": "uh one of them is to work on the semantics of the belief - net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi the system uh making decisions . and we 're also , sort of uh in the same process , going to work with fey on what there should be in the dialogues .", "tgt": "abstract: the main focus of the meeting was firstly on the structure of the belief-net , its decision nodes and the parameters that influence them , and secondly , on the design of the data collection tasks ."}
{"src": "and umand fey has some thirty subjects lined up ? so weyeah we do n't know how many we can get next door at theuh shelter for example .", "tgt": "abstract: for the latter , there are already 30 subjects lined up and more are expected to be recruited off campus ."}
{"src": "and umand then they gon na have to f um um choose from one of these tasks , which are listed here . so ifif it 's one service , one luxury item , you know , one big - ish place , and so forth and so on , umthen my guess is thatthat the data is going to be easier to handle . that w maybe one thing we should do is go through this list and sort of select things that are categories and then o offer only one member of that category ?", "tgt": "abstract: it was agreed that making subjects select from categories of tasks , such as `` big place '' , `` service '' , etc . could provide a better range of data ."}
{"src": "i b my guess is it 's gon na be ten .", "tgt": "abstract: the duration of each dialogue will probably be no more than 10 minutes ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: on the other hand , the organisation of the intermediate nodes of the belief-net and their properties is almost complete , although no conditional probabilities have been inserted yet ."}
{"src": "and decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices for calls on other modules .", "tgt": "abstract: these nodes represent decisions that will function as parameters to action calls in the system ."}
{"src": "and that we can actually infer them to a significant de degree , or we ask . oreh so , y but there 's th but definitely a back - off position to asking .", "tgt": "abstract: their values will either be inferred from the user-system interaction , or -as a last resort- requested directly from the user ."}
{"src": "ok , because uhwe do wan na get them r u perfectlybut i think we 're gon na have to do a first cut at a lot of them to see how they interact .", "tgt": "abstract: finally , as to the semantic and syntactic constructions , work will start with more general and brief descriptions , before moving to exhaustive analysis of at least a subset ."}
{"src": "we are expecting johno to build a parser , uhhe 's g he 's hoping to do this for his masters ' thesis s by a year from now . uhlimited . well , the hope is that the parser itself is , uh , pretty robust .", "tgt": "abstract: similarly , the construction parser that is to be built within a year is expected to be relatively basic , yet robust ."}
{"src": "maybei suggest we make some fine tuning of these , getsort ofrun through ten or so subjects um but anywayyeah , so i thinkit 's a good idea to start with the sort of relatively straight forward res just response system .", "tgt": "decisions: as the data collection is ready to start , it was agreed that for the first ten subjects the interaction with the system / instructor will be along the lines of a basic response system ."}
{"src": "and umand then they gon na have to f um um choose from one of these tasks , which are listed here . that w maybe one thing we should do is go through this list and sort of select things that are categories and then o offer only one member of that category ? like at you know , `` attend a theater , symphony or opera `` isis a group , and `` tour the university , castle or zoo `` ,", "tgt": "decisions: tasks will be divided in categories ( `` tour '' , `` attend '' etc ) and subjects are going to be asked to choose no more than one task out of each category ."}
{"src": "sotrying to im umimplant the intention of going to a place now , going to a place later on the same tour , and see whether we wan na make it more complex or not , depending on whatwhat sort of results we 're getting . umii would say maybe two weeks . let 's plan next monday , ok , to have a review of what we have so far . this means audio , but but it would be great if you could , um , not transcribe it all , but pick out uh , some stuff . and then if we want to uhget them to start doinguhmultiple step planning with a whole bunch of things and then organize them tell them which things are near each other and we 're gon na start thinking a aboutuhwhat constructions we want to elicit .", "tgt": "decisions: this first run will probably take a couple of weeks , but the first results ( audio files and selected highlights ) will be discussed shortly , in order to decide whether more detail ( complex spatial relationships , temporal planning etc ) should be included in the design or particular constructions be elicited ."}
{"src": "see thisthisthisuhontology node is probably something that i will try to expand . and hopefully you can sort of also try to find out , you know , sooner or later in the course of the summer what we can expect to get from the discourse that might , you knowor the", "tgt": "decisions: regarding the completion of the belief-net , the remaining details , mainly the properties of the ontology and discourse nodes , should be added ."}
{"src": "uh robert and eva and bhaskara are gon na actuallybuild a belief - net thatthat , um , has cpt 's and , you know , tries to infer this from various kinds of information .", "tgt": "decisions: after building in the conditional probability tables , a working prototype of the net will be ready ."}
{"src": "ok , because uhwe do wan na get them r u perfectlybut i think we 're gon na have to do a first cut at a lot of them to see how they interact .", "tgt": "decisions: finally , the initial work on constructions should focus on a general overview of the dialogues with brief descriptions ."}
{"src": "whatever you need in order to uh , be able to then , uh , by hand , you know , explain , some fraction of the utterances .", "tgt": "decisions: further analysis will follow from there in a top-down fashion ."}
{"src": "so there 's a lot of things where we have no analogous tasks , andthat may or may not be a problem .", "tgt": "problems: although there is an effort to include some of the key features of the belief-net in the design of the data gathering , not all of them can be built in ."}
{"src": "and these are the data tasks where w we can assume the person would like to enter , view or just approach the thing . now of course you have this i guess possible danger that somehow there 're certain constructions that people use uh when talking about a museum that they would n't talk about with a university and stuff ,", "tgt": "problems: the tasks that the subjects will have to carry out will be categorised in ways that will indicate eva intentions , however , this approach may limit the variety of possible constructions used within a single category of entities ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: on the other hand , generating more diverse dialogues may have an adverse effect from a speech recognition perspective ."}
{"src": "and um we 're still l looking for a room on the sixth floor because they stole away that conference room . umbehind our backs . david andand jane andand lila are working on that as we speak .", "tgt": "problems: a minor problem has arisen with the laboratory where recordings are supposed to take place , but this is currently being sorted out ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: as regards the completion of the belief-net , no work has been done on the cpt 's yet ."}
{"src": "and ii me it would it would be completely out of the question to really do more than , say , like , oh i do n't know , ten , over the summer ,", "tgt": "problems: finally , it was noted that although a general overview of the pertinent constructions is attainable , no more than ten of them can be analysed in detail with the summer months ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: the focus of the meeting was on a presentation of the work done already on the building of the bayes-net ."}
{"src": "that 's basicallyjust specifying thethe input for thew what 's it 's based on things like , uh , there 's gon na be a node for go - there or not , and there 's gon na be a node for enter , view , approach .", "tgt": "abstract: the input layer deriving information from things like the user and situation models , feeds into a set of decision nodes , such as the enter / view / approach ( eva ) endpoint ."}
{"src": "and somesome things will always be sort of toonot significant enough .", "tgt": "abstract: in any particular situation , most of the outputs will not be relevant to the given context ."}
{"src": "cuz , that 's whati mean , in the bayes - net you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node .", "tgt": "abstract: therefore , they will either have to be pruned a posteriori , or only a subset of the possible decision nodes will be computed in each occasion ."}
{"src": "i mean , maybe it does make a difference in terms of performance , computational time . so basically , you 'd have a decision treequery , go - there . and just basically do a binary search through the ?", "tgt": "abstract: the latter option could could follow a binary search-tree approach and it could also be better in computational terms ."}
{"src": "you won'tit 'll be hard to decide .", "tgt": "abstract: in any case , on what basis the `` winner '' output is chosen is not clear ."}
{"src": "and for the where - is construction , we know we need to l look at this node , that merges these three things together so my i so , if we were to it with a bayes - net , we 'd have to have a nodefor every question that we knew how to deal with , every construction .", "tgt": "abstract: one suggestion was discussed: the particular constructions used can determine the pertinent decision ( output ) nodes ."}
{"src": "and , um , finish up this bayes - net . and we present our results ,", "tgt": "abstract: the complete prototype of the bayes-net will be presented in the next meeting ."}
{"src": "ok . because then , once we have it sort of up and running , then we can start you know , defining the interfaces and then hook it up to some fake construction parser", "tgt": "abstract: after that , it will be possible to define interfaces and a dummy construction parser , in order to test and link modules together ."}
{"src": "every construction .", "tgt": "decisions: the suggestion that the most appropriate decision node of the belief-net in each situation could be chosen as a function of what construction was used , was deemed unsuitable at this stage ."}
{"src": "because there are interdependencies ,", "tgt": "decisions: there are many interdependencies between the output nodes that this approach could not take into account ."}
{"src": "sometimethis weekagain and finish up the , uh , values of this .", "tgt": "decisions: the rest of the values for the bayes-net nodes will be built in within the week ."}
{"src": "and , um , finish up this bayes - net . and we present our results ,", "tgt": "decisions: the finished prototype will be presented during the next meeting ."}
{"src": "as , if i understand it correctly , it always gives you all the posterior probabilities for all the values of all decision nodes . so , itn i meana all i 'm saying is , whatever our input is , we 're always gon na get the full output . whatwhatwhat i am thinking , or what we 're about to propose here is we 're always gon na get the whole list of values and their posterior probabilities . cuz , that 's whati mean , in the bayes - net you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node .", "tgt": "problems: any set of inputs will provide either the whole range of output values of the bayes-net or an a priori selection of those outputs ."}
{"src": "and the question is what to do with it , and now we need an expert system or belief - net or something that interprets that , well , eventually , you still have to pick out which ones you look at .", "tgt": "problems: in both cases , what is needed is a way to single out the appropriate outputs for any given context ."}
{"src": "so the person said , um , `` where is x ? `` we want to know , um , isdoes he want info ? or does he want to go there ?", "tgt": "problems: for example , in the case of a `` where is '' question , whether the prevalent output should be `` go-there '' or `` info-on '' or even a third option has to be computed somehow ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: in any case , there are many input values that have not been entered in the bayes-net at this stage ."}
{"src": "yeah , i can worry about the ontology interface and you cankeith can worry about the discourse .", "tgt": "problems: furthermore , no inputs for the ontology and discourse can be built in yet , as they involve research that will be carried out in the future ."}
{"src": "also , i 'm somewhat boggled by that hugin software . i ca n't figure out how to get the probabilities into it .", "tgt": "problems: finally , there has been a problem with adding probabilities in a net created with the hugin software , but this should be overcome very shortly ."}
{"src": "and the other bit of news is we hadyou know , uh , i was visited by my german project manager and he came upwe came upwith a pretty strange idea . it should be possible to make that system produce questions .", "tgt": "abstract: an idea for future work was suggested during the visit of the german project manager: the possibility to use the same system for language generation ."}
{"src": "but maybe one could do some learning .", "tgt": "abstract: having a system able to ask questions could contribute significantly to training the belief-net ."}
{"src": "the basic idea i guess would be to giveallow the system to have intentions , basically ? well you can observe some user and context stuff and ask , what 's the posterior probabilities of all of our decision nodes .", "tgt": "abstract: setting up certain inputs in the bayes-net would imply certain intentions , which would trigger dialogues ."}
{"src": "i mean we justi mean it would n't hurt to write up a paper , well , ii also think that if we sort of write about what we have done in the past six months , wewewe could sort of craft a nice little paper thatif it gets rejected , which could happen , does n't hurt and then we can say , uh well what we do is this .", "tgt": "abstract: there is potential to make a conference paper out of presenting the current work and the project aspirations within a parsing paradigm ."}
{"src": "so this will be sort of documenting what we think , and documenting what we have in terms of the bayes - net stuff . well , in the moment it 's a bayes - net . and it has sort of fifty not - yet - specified interfaces .", "tgt": "abstract: the focus should be the bayes-net , to which all other modules interface ."}
{"src": "the sudo - square < writing on whiteboard > is , < three-syllable laugh > `` situation `` , `` user `` , `` discourse `` , right ? `` ontology `` .", "tgt": "abstract: situation , user , discourse and ontology feed into the net to infer user intentions ."}
{"src": "and johno coming up with the idea that if the person discussed thediscussed the admission fee , ineh previously , that might be a good indication that , `` how do i get to the castle ? `` , actually he wants to enter .", "tgt": "abstract: someone asking where the castle is after having asked about the admission fee , indicates that -given that the castle is open to tourists- they want to go there , as opposed to knowing its whereabouts ."}
{"src": "and specify um , whatwhat we think thethe output uh , observe , outi input nodes for our bayes - nets for the sub sub - d , for the discourse bit , should be . so we want to sort of come up with what gets uh , input , and how inter in case of a `` where is `` question . so that we actually end up with um , um , nodes for the discourse and ontology so that we can put them into our bayes - net ,", "tgt": "abstract: it was suggested that they start analysing what the discourse and ontology would give as inputs to the bayes-net by working on simple utterances like `` where is x ? `` ."}
{"src": "and we can run our better javabayes , and have it produce some output .", "tgt": "abstract: with this addition , all input layers of the net would be functioning ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: although this function would be limited , it would allow for the bayes-net to be tested in its entirety and , henceforth , extended ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: the possibility of incorporating language generation into the system will have to be discussed further ."}
{"src": "look at the web page and let 's talk about it maybe tomorrow afternoon ?", "tgt": "decisions: similarly , as no one could recall some of the points of the conference call , the group will have to meet again and define the exact structure and content of the paper they are going to submit ."}
{"src": "so this will be sort of documenting what we think , and documenting what we have in terms of the bayes - net stuff .", "tgt": "decisions: the bayes-net is going to be the focus of the presentation ."}
{"src": "and specify um , whatwhat we think thethe output uh , observe , outi input nodes for our bayes - nets for the sub sub - d , for the discourse bit , should be . so we want to sort of come up with what gets uh , input , and how inter in case of a `` where is `` question . so that we actually end up with um , um , nodes for the discourse and ontology", "tgt": "decisions: in order to complete a functioning prototype of the belief-net , it was decided to start expanding the ontology and discourse nodes by working with a simple construction , like `` where is x ? `` ."}
{"src": "wait , so do , or do not take other kinds of constructions into account ? well , if youif you can , oh definitely do ,", "tgt": "decisions: a robust analysis of such a basic utterance will indicate what the limits of the information derived from the construction are , as well as ways to design the whole module and fit other constructions in ."}
{"src": "e i 'm sort ofhave the impression that getting it to say the right thing in the right circumstances is much more difficult than getting it to understand something given the circumstances and so on , it 's not the same as the understanding .", "tgt": "problems: the idea to create a language generation module for the system , along with the language understanding , was met with interest , although it was made clear that generation is not just the inverse of understanding ."}
{"src": "just the fact that we 'll getthe point is that getting it to understand one construction does n't mean that it will n always know exactly when it 's correct to use that construction . right ?", "tgt": "problems: understanding what a construction entails does not mean the system can use the construction in all appropriate circumstances ."}
{"src": "but maybe one could do some learning . yeah , it 's g anyway , the point is that given all of these different factors , it 's uh e it 'sit 's still going to be impossible to run through all of the possible situations or whatever .", "tgt": "problems: a dialogue producing system would be useful for training the system further , even though the number of input permutations could render the process computationally unwieldy ."}
{"src": "i mean , it 's obvious that we ca n't do any kind of evaluation ,", "tgt": "problems: regarding the conference paper , it was noted that at this stage they have not completed any big parts of the system and there is no evaluation ."}
{"src": "like introducing the formalism might be not really possible in detail ,", "tgt": "problems: similarly , the length of the paper would not allow for presentation of the formalism in detail ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: the focus would have to be on cognitive motivations of the research , and not on system design , anyway ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: such motivations also apply to the belief-net: there are various direct or indirect ways to link features of the ontology or discourse with specific intentions ."}
{"src": "but normal statements that seem completely unambiguous , such as `` where is the blah - blah `` , actually are terribly complex , and completely ambiguous .", "tgt": "problems: the originating observation behind the whole project is that utterances like `` where is x ? '' are seemingly unambiguous , but , in context , they can acquire much more complex interpretations ."}
{"src": "and eva is using the xalan style sheet processor to convert the xml that 's output by the java bayes for theinto the , uh , e bayes input .", "tgt": "abstract: minor technical issues , such as format conversions for xml and javabayes and the full translation of the smartkom generation module in english , are currently being resolved ."}
{"src": "yep . we ha we have to change the voice .", "tgt": "abstract: the voice synthesiser will also be replaced by better technology ."}
{"src": "uh , w which ismental spaces and uhand - or but the other part of it is the way they connect to these , uh , probabilistic relational models .", "tgt": "abstract: an important research issue to be investigated is how the concept of mental spaces and probabilistic relational models can be integrated into the belief-net ."}
{"src": "so there probably are some , uh , relatively clean rules , is that people do manage to do this", "tgt": "abstract: mental space interdependencies are based on relatively clean rules , since people seem to manage them easily ."}
{"src": "no , i know , i th i i think that is gon na be sort of the key to this wh to th the big project of the summer ofof getting the constructions right", "tgt": "abstract: a step towards this goal is the construction formalism being put together ."}
{"src": "which is the issue of , um , how do you simulate questions ? we didn'twe never did figure out how we were gon na do emphasis inin uh , the semspec . incl including the questions uh , no , all the focus stuff . and we 'll figure out exactly how to write that up and so on ,", "tgt": "abstract: this module will eventually have to include ways to simulate questions , do emphasis and focus ."}
{"src": "the question of whether the polysemy is sort of like in the construction or pragmatic . well the question is basically , is this conventional or conversational implicature ?", "tgt": "abstract: the constructions could be built assuming either conventional or conversational implicature ."}
{"src": "w we know for sure that we have to be able to do both . i mean itth <inbreath> i can thi i can think of arguments in either direction on that .", "tgt": "abstract: at this stage both routes need to be examined ."}
{"src": "right . so . <laugh> right . so thingthat 's part of why we want the formalism ,", "tgt": "abstract: the formalism will also serve as a starting point for the definition of construal mechanisms ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: similarly , issues like time plans and discourse stacks are dependent on how the ontology and discourse history are going to be structured and linked ."}
{"src": "priming a spreading activation", "tgt": "abstract: one suggestion was to use the spreading activation as a paradigm for activating nodes in the belief-net ."}
{"src": "whichuh , so far , in terms of like putting up all the constraints as , you know , pushing them into type constraints , thewhen i 've , you know , propo then proposed it to linguists who have n't yet given meyou know , we have n't yet thought of a reason that that would n't work . right ? as long as we allow our type constraints to be reasonablycomplex .", "tgt": "abstract: finally , using type constraints in the construction analysis should work , as long as they are complex enough not to generate too many parses ."}
{"src": "actually , maybe i could try , like , emailing the guy and see if he has any something already .", "tgt": "decisions: it is necessary to ask the javabayes programmer whether he already has xml conversion programs ."}
{"src": "so i just need todo the , uhwrite a new set oftree combining rules . and fey has foolheartedly agreed to rewrite uh , the german concept uh syntax - to - prosody rules", "tgt": "decisions: for the smartkom generation module , all the syntax-to-prosody rules are going to be re-written for english ."}
{"src": "ogi has , uh , crafted a couple of diphone type voices that are really nice", "tgt": "decisions: additionally , ogi can offer a range of synthesiser voices to choose from ."}
{"src": "anyway , uh , that we werethat we 're gon na try to get a uh , first cut at the revised formalism by the end of next week . so the idea is on monday at two we 'llwe 'll see an intermediate version of the formalism for the constructions ,", "tgt": "decisions: the focus of the next meeting , whose time was rescheduled , will be the discussion of the revised construction formalism ."}
{"src": "uh , just trying to write up essentially whatwhat you guys have worked out so that everybody has something to look at . yeah . well , ififi mean , i part ofof what the exercise is , t by the end of next week , is to say what are the things that we just do n't have answers for yet .", "tgt": "decisions: the presentation will unify the existing ideas and help identify the areas in need of further work , such as how it can deal with time and tense use and how they affect inferences in belief-nets ."}
{"src": "the question of whether the polysemy is sort of like in the construction or pragmatic . well the question is basically , is this conventional or conversational implicature ? w we know for sure that we have to be able to do both . i mean itth <inbreath> i can thi i can think of arguments in either direction on that .", "tgt": "decisions: the ambiguity in a `` where is x ? '' construction can be coded in the formalism as a semantic feature or pushed forward to the belief-net where pragmatic features will disambiguate it: in terms of system design , both options need to be investigated at this stage ."}
{"src": "that 's the lisp - type scheme . well , i guess if you 're not used to functional programming , scheme can be completely incomprehensible .", "tgt": "problems: as the translation of the german smartkom into english moves on , the generation rules may prove difficult to tackle for someone without experience in functional programming , as they are written in lisp ."}
{"src": "one of the things i w would like to do over the next , uh , month , it may take more , is to st understand to what extent we can not only figure out the constructions for them for multiple worlds uh sort of what the formalism will look like and where the slots and fillers will be , but also what that would translate into in terms of belief - net and the inferences . one is the linguistic part of what are the couplings andand when you have a certain , uh , construction , that implies certain couplings and other couplings , and then we have this inference problem of exactly technically how does the belief - net work", "tgt": "problems: as far as the construction analysis is concerned , the two problems that will need to be solved are to identify the couplings between constructions in different mental spaces and to define how inferences will work in the belief-net from a technical point of view ."}
{"src": "the question of whether the polysemy is sort of like in the construction or pragmatic . the question is whether the construction is semantic or like ambiguous between asking for location and asking for path . well the question is basically , is this conventional or conversational implicature ? i mean itth <inbreath> i can thi i can think of arguments in either direction on that .", "tgt": "problems: additionally , in the example `` where is x ? '' construction , the ambiguity ( location or path ) could be coded either in the semantics of the construction or as if determined by context ."}
{"src": "so i a i i th i agree with you that , um , it 's a disaster to try to make separate constructions for every uh , pragmatic reading ,", "tgt": "problems: the former could mean creating a different construction for every slight pragmatic variation ."}
{"src": "although there are some that will need to be there . so you could just as well tag the lexical construction with the fact that it 's a uh , you know , thirty percent increase in probability of entering .", "tgt": "problems: on the other hand , some of the belief-net probabilities could be instantiated in the lexicon ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: specifying which approach to take when linking the ontology and the discourse history has also proven not to be straightforward ."}
{"src": "uh , this isthis is , speaking of hard problems , this is a very good time um , to start trying to make explicit where construal comes in andyou know , where c where the construction per - se endsand where construal comes in ,", "tgt": "problems: finally , it is still undecided where construal comes in , which would help delimit the constructions as well ."}
{"src": "and so one on one side ison one side is a sort of the revised sort of updated semantic specification . and the other side is , um , sort of a revised construction formalism .", "tgt": "abstract: the discussion concerned the revised semantic specification and the construction formalism ."}
{"src": "so they could all have a type at the beginning . ok , and then again semantic constraints here are justare just bindings .", "tgt": "abstract: the different levels of the latter focus on what construction types are encountered and what bindings there are between them ."}
{"src": "but , you know , we have theproperties of dependency grammars and some properties of constituentsconstituent - based grammar .", "tgt": "abstract: the notation maintains properties of both dependency and constituent-based grammars ."}
{"src": "i think that 's still in progress . other things we did n't <breath> totally deal with , um , well , we 've had a lot of other stuff that keith and i have them working on in terms of like how you deal with like an adjective . you know , aa nominal expression .", "tgt": "abstract: the encoding of features is still incomplete: frame profiles , focus , adjectives , nominal expressions are phenomena in the process of being integrated ."}
{"src": "so there 's going to be some extrayou know , definitely other notation we 'll need for that which we skip for now .", "tgt": "abstract: similarly , ways to handle mental spaces will have to be added on top ."}
{"src": "so you see it 's `` scenario `` , `` referent `` and `` discourse segment `` . the `` scenario `` box ,", "tgt": "abstract: on the other hand , the semantic specification structures information in terms of `` scenario '' , `` referent '' and `` discourse segment '' ."}
{"src": "and actually it 's just a list of various slots from which you would drawdraw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ?", "tgt": "abstract: each category comprises a number of slots filled in by information derived from the utterance ."}
{"src": "which is made up entirely of these things and , uh , bindings among them . and bindings to ontology items . so thatthat the who that this is the tool kit under whi out of which you can make a semantic specification . so this is an that anything you have , in the party line , anything you have as the semantic side of constructions comes , from pieces of thisignoring li but it 's got to be pieces of this along with constraints among them .", "tgt": "abstract: it is , essentially , a toolkit with which to create semantic constructions , as well as the bindings between them and with the ontology ."}
{"src": "yeah , but youdo n't we ultimately want to handle that analogously to the way we handle time and place , um , we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces so that pulling something out of a discourse context is i think similar to other kinds of , uh , mental space phenomena .", "tgt": "abstract: among the issues still being defined , mental spaces and context ( eg pronoun references ) present similarities that can be echoed in the specification ."}
{"src": "um , and we 're going to have to s sort of bound the complexity . but just try to describe which ones you think we ought to have . justjust sort of , you know , define your space .", "tgt": "abstract: work on both of these formalisms will continue with circumscription of the construction space that will be studied in more detail ."}
{"src": "um , imagine youyou write a bayes - net , um , completely from scratch every time you do construal . and that fills in your cpt 's with which you can then query , um , thethe net that you just wrote and find out how thing x is construed as an utterance u . you may have some general rules as to how things can becan be construed as what , so that will allow you to craft thethethe initial notes .", "tgt": "abstract: work on construal will use bayes-nets , which will be fed information from other modules and implement general rules to infer how utterances are construed ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: the semantic specification requires some adjustments ."}
{"src": "except for `` cause `` , that i forgot . causal stuff we absolutely need .", "tgt": "decisions: amongst other things `` cause '' has to be added as another x-schema ."}
{"src": "well we were just talking about this sort of evidentiality and stuff like that , right ? confidence or something like that .", "tgt": "decisions: linguistic hedging will also be encoded as a demarcation of evidentiality or speaker confidence ."}
{"src": "um , it 's often thought of asit is also considered a mental space , same thing . yeah , but youdo n't we ultimately want to handle that analogously to the way we handle time and place , um , we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces it 's likeit 's like what 's happeningthat , yeah , what what 's happening , uh , there is that you 're moving the base space or something like that , right ?", "tgt": "decisions: mental spaces can be tackled with mechanisms that can also deal with context issues ( time , space etc . ) : creating a base space and rules of interaction with other interconnected spaces ."}
{"src": "um , and we 're going to have to s sort of bound the complexity . but just try to describe which ones you think we ought to have . justjust sort of , you know , define your space .", "tgt": "decisions: however , the complexity of these mechanisms has to be bound as well: it is necessary to define the range of constructions to be studied ."}
{"src": "wewe do n't have to care too much about the speaker attitude , right ? soso we 're gon na get the w we 're basically dealing with two domains , the tourist domain and theand the child language learning .", "tgt": "decisions: given the domains currently used ( tourist , child language learning ) , some features , like speaker attitude , are not of equal importance at this stage ."}
{"src": "is this , uhwas it intentional to leave off things like `` inherits `` i did n't want to think too much about that forfor now . can we make it more elegant ? ``", "tgt": "decisions: on the other hand , it was decided for the inheritance between constructions to be left out for now , as the notation can be rendered more elegant later on ."}
{"src": "um , imagine youyou write a bayes - net , um , completely from scratch every time you do construal . but the question is do you want to , for example , send the little group , uh , a draft of your thesis proposal we can do it th - thursday again .", "tgt": "decisions: finally , a preliminary presentation on the idea of how to use bayes-nets for construal will take place in the next meeting ."}
{"src": "and so it was an issue whether constraintsum , there were some linguists who reacted against `` constraints `` , saying , `` oh , if it 's not used for matching , then it should n't be called a constraint `` . the wholethe mental space thing is clearly not here .", "tgt": "problems: the construction formalism is not yet complete as to the semantic constraints -the terminology has also been met with objections- and does not deal with mental spaces ."}
{"src": "you know , um , basically all of these so - called space builders that are in the sentence are going to sort of assuming that at any point in discourse there 's the possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different world scenarios , whatever , and the speaker 's supposed to be keeping track of those . the , umthe construction that you actually get is just gon na sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you 've already got going , um , you 're supposed to add structure to . but it does n't tell you like exactly what itwhat the point of doing so is .", "tgt": "problems: on their own , constructions can only give limited information regarding mental spaces: forms can provide cues to create a different mental space , but the semantic nuances are defined by context ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: it is not decided at this stage whether the necessary values should be coded within the construction or as part of construal ."}
{"src": "ok , it 's likeuh , it 's notit might be that there 's a syntactic , uh , device that you use to indicate focus uh , soso i think that 's kind of nice to keep `` focus `` being an information structure term . i think that 's still in progress . but it didoneone implication it does f have for the other side , which we 'll get to in a minute is that i could n't think of a good way to say `` here are the possible things that you could focus on `` , but ii ca n't think of like the limited set of possible meanings that you wouldthat you would focu maybe you want to forget stress . canonically speaking you canif you look at aa curve over sentence , you can find out where a certain stress is and say , `` hey , that 's my focus exponent . `` it does n't tell you anything what the focus is .", "tgt": "problems: other issues concern focus and stress: focus is seen as an information structure device , but there has been no suggestion as to how to predict its effects or break it down in possible focused elements ; as to stress , it may not be useful as a form value , as it shows the focus exponent , but not what the focus is on ."}
{"src": "except for `` cause `` , that i forgot . causal stuff we absolutely need . mental space we need . andand so we 're , uh gon na have to , um , chain those as well . it 'sas far as i can tell there 's this one major thing we have to do which is the mentalthe whole s mental space thing .", "tgt": "problems: moving to the semantic specification , the analysis still needs mechanisms to deal with causality , as well as mental spaces and bindings between them ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: additionally , how referring expressions are linked to referents or even how mental spaces affect this linking are still to lay down in detail ."}
{"src": "then i 'm also going to present a little talk at eml , about what we have done here let 's talk about your thesis proposal .", "tgt": "abstract: the meeting was taken up by discussion about a thesis proposal and a talk about to take place at eml ."}

{"src": "it basically says , well `` this is construal `` , and then it continues to say that one could potentially build a probabilistic relational model that has some general , domain - general rules and then the idea is to use ontology , situation , user , and discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational modelto do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what", "tgt": "abstract: the thesis proposal , on the other hand , presents the idea of `` construal '' and makes claims as to how inferences are drawn in a probabilistic relational model by using information from the ontology , situation , user and discourse models ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: it was advised that more emphasis should be put on the role of construal in the understanding of metaphor and metonymy ."}

{"src": "e tell a little bitas much as ican about the ntl story . and then maybe talk about the big picture here , oh , maybe the fmri stuff . well , the time to mention it , if you mention it , is when you talk about mirror neurons ,", "tgt": "decisions: as the talk at eml will also refer to a theoretical framework , it was suggested that along with presenting ntl and the piece on mirror neurons , it also alludes to relevant fmri work ."}
{"src": "the b the combination of the biology and the leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys ,", "tgt": "decisions: the neural side of the research could be of interest to various groups ."}

{"src": "i sorta constructed a couple of classes . the red lines on the , um , graph are the um , relations between the different um , classes . this is more or less similar to the flat bayes - net that i have , you know , with the input nodes and all that .", "tgt": "abstract: an alternative representation of the bayes-net , it depicts context features as classes , and dependencies as relations between them ."}
{"src": "ok . so it only makes two decisions , in this model . and one is basically how desirable a site is and the other is the mode of the visit , whether th it 's the eva decision .", "tgt": "abstract: the current outputs show the desirability of a site , as well as its eva mode ."}
{"src": "i mean , the notion of instantiating your el elements from the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and does n't fit very well into the extended belief - net .", "tgt": "abstract: the fact that this model allows for instantiations of classes fits the research purposes much better than the extended belief-net ."}
{"src": "we have a visitor from bruchsal from the international university . good . then , we can move on and see what andreas has got out his sleeve .", "tgt": "abstract: following this , a visiting researcher presented an overview of a parallel project at the international university ."}

{"src": "the other person i thought of is dan gildea ?", "tgt": "abstract: there were also further suggestions for meetings with icsi researchers ."}
{"src": "uh in ain a smaller group we had uh , talked and decided about continuation of the data collection . here we 're gon na make it a little bit more complicated for the subjects , uh this round .", "tgt": "decisions: as the data collection is going into its second phase , more complex scenarios will be used to generate more intricate dialogues ."}
{"src": "she 's actually suggested to look um , at the psychology department students , because they have to partake in two experiments in order to fulfill some requirements .", "tgt": "decisions: subjects can be recruited from within the psychology department students , since such participation in experiments is compulsory in their syllabus ."}
{"src": "uh , so one of the things that eva 's gon na do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down .", "tgt": "decisions: as the work on creating a prm for the system has progressed , it is now necessary to find an implementation that can work as a prm interpreter ."}
{"src": "uh , we are n't gon na build our own interpreter , the people at stanford write papers as if they had one ,", "tgt": "decisions: there are no plans to build one from scratch , but it seems that other research groups at stanford may already have one ."}
{"src": "and supposedly , um , we 'll actually get s deepseriously connected toto their work somebody 'lluh , you knowif it 's a group meeting once a week probably someone 'll go down and , whatever .", "tgt": "decisions: moreover , closer collaboration with the local prm group will be pursued with additional participation in their meetings ."}
{"src": "and it turns out , you know , the cpt 's are really big , if i do that ,", "tgt": "problems: an early version of the prm of the system presented the same problem as a flat bayes-net: the cpt 's become too large ."}
{"src": "but i do n't remember reading how you specify i remember them learning when , you know , you do n't know the structure for sure ,", "tgt": "problems: another prm issue that arose and remained unclear was how the probabilities are specified ( instead of learnt ) on the actual relations between the classes ."}
{"src": "theyouyou did n't look at all yet to see if there 's anybody has a implementation . so w anyway . so that 's aa major open issue .", "tgt": "problems: furthermore , the lack of a prm interpreter is an open issue ."}
{"src": "uh , we are n't gon na build our own interpreter , uh , so one of the things that eva 's gon na do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down .", "tgt": "problems: it is not within the remit of the project to build one from scratch , therefore , an existing implementation has to be found ."}
{"src": "now , what i plan to do is i want to uh sort of do a uhuhtry to improve the quality of the search results ,", "tgt": "problems: on the other hand , the discussion about the smart tutoring system being built at the international university showed the importance of finding outwhich context parameters are influential in a given domain ."}
{"src": "now , the big problem that i 'm facing right now is um , it 's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly , thatthat works in the small domain , but the problem is obviously the scalability . cuz it 'sit 's very easy to whip up something quickly ,", "tgt": "problems: it is easy to hack up a system for a small domain , but making it scalable is much more difficult ."}
{"src": "as for smartkom , i 'mthe last smartkom meeting i mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis ,", "tgt": "problems: finally , there was a passing mention of problems encountered with the speech synthesis module of smartkom ."}
{"src": "topic of this meeting is i wan na talk a little bit about transcription . so , well w shall we move on and talk a little bit about transcription then ? isand so one of the things was to get an estimate of how long it would take , and then also what tools we would use . and so the next decision which has to be made actually pretty soon is how are we gon na do it ? i mean , i looked at cyber transcriber", "tgt": "abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed the aims , methods , timing , and outsourcing issues concerning transcription of the meeting recorder corpus ."}
{"src": "what we 're using right now is a tool , um , from this french group , called `` transcriber `` so as far as i 'm concerned those transcription conventions are fixed right now . andbut so in terms of the con the conventions , then , <breath> uh , basically , <breath> uh , it 's strictly orthographic so i havei have a convention of putting like a dash <breath> arrow just to indicate that this person 's utterance continues .", "tgt": "abstract: the transcriber software tool was introduced , along with a set of transcription conventions for coding different speech events ."}
{"src": "these are linguistics grad students . but we can pay a graduate student seven dollars an hour .", "tgt": "abstract: the prospect of sending the data to an external transcription service was weighed against that of hiring a graduate student transcriber pool ."}
{"src": "so that means that even if it takes them thirty times real time it 's cheaper toto do graduate students . i mean , that 's why i said originally , that i could n't imagine sending it out 's gon na be cheaper .", "tgt": "abstract: it was tentatively decided that the latter option would be less costly and allow bmr to maintain greater control over the transcription process ."}
{"src": "maybe we should s consider also , um , starting to build up a web site around all of these things .", "tgt": "abstract: methods for distributing the data were briefly discussed , along with an initiative for creating a bmr project website ."}
{"src": "and then get an update on the electronics , um , let 's move on to electronics .", "tgt": "abstract: the group received an update on the meeting room recording setup and electronics ."}
{"src": "cuz they 're distributing it through the ldc . maybe we shouldmaybe we should get a copy of it just to see what they did soso that we canwe can compare . csae . corpus of spoken american english .", "tgt": "decisions: the group will obtain a copy of the corpus of spoken american english ( csae ) from the ldc to compare the methods and conventions used by uc santa barbara with those being considered for the meeting recorder project ."}
{"src": "so i mean , i 've been sort of playing with , uh , different ways of mar cuz i 'm thinking , you know , i mean , if you could get optimal instructions you could cut back on the number of hours it would take . so i think though it 's a good proposal to be used on a newa new batch of text that i have n't yet done yet in the same meeting . could use it on the next segment of the text . i could generate the segmentation andand you could do the words , and time yourself on it .", "tgt": "decisions: speakers fe008 and me011 will experiment with pre-segmentation procedures in hopes of facilitating the transcription process ."}
{"src": "so what we wanted to do was have jane do basically one meeting 's worth , you know , forty minutes to an hour ,", "tgt": "decisions: speaker fe008 will perform the transcription for one meeting ( 40-60 minutes of data ) as a pilot project ."}
{"src": "i hope it 's jane . yeah , no , thatii would be interested in thatin becoming involved in the project in some aspect like that", "tgt": "decisions: a tentative decision was made to put speaker fe008 in charge of the in-house transcription effort ."}
{"src": "we could program that pretty easily , areare those d delays adjustable ? could you get it so that withso it wouldit would detect volume on a channel and insert a marker ? sure . so if we wantif we didif we did something like programmed in a delay , which actually i think is a great idea , um , i 'm sure they would want that incorporated back in . and i said , well , maybe . and they havethey 've actually asked if we are willing to do any development well , so anyway , are we interested then in writing tools to try to generate any of this stuff automatically ?", "tgt": "decisions: modifications to the transcriber source code , e.g . adjusting the delay between the audio play function and the inputting of time boundaries , may be undertaken by the bmr group ."}
{"src": "maybe we should s consider also , um , starting to build up a web site around all of these things . i think mostly internal . we could do an ht access which would accommodate those things .", "tgt": "decisions: an initiative for creating an internal bmr project website was discussed , along with ideas for providing web access to external organizations , such as the university of washington ."}
{"src": "well i can build a cabinet .", "tgt": "decisions: a cabinet will be built to house wires and other electronic equipment used in the recording setup ."}
{"src": "which is to say just laptop with a wireless . so we certainly could use that asas a constant reminder of what the vu meters are doing .", "tgt": "decisions: a laptop and wireless modem will be avaiable to participants for monitoring the recording progress ."}
{"src": "andand so how we do we distribute the transcripts , how do we distribute the audio files , butbut so should we do it in the same format as ldc", "tgt": "problems: how should transcripts and corresponding audio files be formatted and distributed ?"}
{"src": "they 're never gon na be able to do a meeting like this . and soso what i 'm saying is that if we hire an external service i think we can expect three hundred dollars an hour . who knows if they 're gon na be able to m manage multal multiple channel data ? they wo n't . i mean , that 's why i said originally , that i could n't imagine sending it out 's gon na be cheaper .", "tgt": "problems: external transcription services are expensive , difficult to monitor , and are unlikely to be able to handle multi-channel data ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: it is unclear which levels of transcription should be encoded ."}
{"src": "there 's some interesting human factors problems like , <breath> yeah , what span ofof time is it useful to segment the thing into in order to uh , transcribe it the most quickly .", "tgt": "problems: what size of segment is most useful for doing transcriptions ?"}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: which level of segmentation is most suitable for the aims of the project ?"}
{"src": "um , the user interface only allows two . and so ifif you 're using their interface to specify overlapping speakers you can only do two . it 's just there 's no user interface for specifying multipleany more than two .", "tgt": "problems: transcriber 's interface only allows the user to view two overlapping speakers ."}

{"src": "uh , well one thing i was gon na say was that , um , i we could get more , uh , of the head mounted microphones so why do n't we just go out andand get an order ofof but have them all be the same mike . so we might as well get it as uniform as we can .", "tgt": "decisions: to achieve greater uniformity in across-speaker recording conditions , the group decided to purchase three additional head-mounted microphones ."}
{"src": "i guess i wanted to , um , sort of make a pitch for trying to collect more meetings . because i think it 'd be good ifif we can get a few different sort of non - internal types of meetings", "tgt": "decisions: future work will include recording more varied meeting data from non-icsi discussion groups ."}
{"src": "but that , um , it would be helpful if i can stay in the loop somehow with , um , people who are doing any kind of post - processing ,", "tgt": "decisions: it was proposed by speaker fe016 that better communication be established between researchers involved in post-processing of the waveform and asr ."}
{"src": "it adds this extra , you know , vari variable for each speaker toto deal with when the microphones are n't similar .", "tgt": "problems: use of dissimilar microphones adds an extra , unwanted variable to individual speaker recordings ."}
{"src": "but if we could actually standardize , you know , thethe microphones , uh , as much as possible that would be really helpful . it 's the equipment and also how it 's worn . it 's really < mike noise > it makes a big difference from the transcribers ' point of view", "tgt": "problems: similarly , differences in the type of recording equipment used and the manner in which microphones are worn by speakers causes problems for the transcription effort ."}
{"src": "but if you 're d i the kind of person who 's doing array processing you actually care about funny little times . andand so you actually wou would want to have a completely different set up than we have , is there an interest in getting video recordings for these meetings ? yes , absolutely . but it 's exactly the same problem , that you have an infrastructure problem , they were interested in ours . and , uh , it is related to ours .", "tgt": "problems: setting up a microphone array and performing video recordings ( in a possible collaboration with nist ) are problematic due to the types of changes in infrastructure they require ."}
{"src": "but there could be problems , right ? with that . then for forced alignment we actually do n't know whereyou know , in the signal the transcriber heard that word . th - but there 's going to be a real problem , uh , even if we chop up based on speech silence these , uh , the transcripts from i b m , we do n't actually know where the words were , which segment they belonged to .", "tgt": "problems: ibm 's single-channel approach to transcriptions may pose problems for the post-processing of waveforms and forced alignments , as the group foresees difficulties in referencing chopped segments back to the original times / locations from which they were extracted ."}
{"src": "so the problem is like , uh , on the microphone of somebody who 's not talking they 're picking up signals from other peopleand that 's <breath> causing problems ?", "tgt": "problems: another post-processing problem involves cross-talk , and , in particular , situations in which a speaker whose contributions to the discussion are relatively sparse but whose microphone picks up signals from the other speakers ."}

{"src": "yeah just by way of uh , uh , a uh , order of magnitude , uh , um , we 've been working with this aurora , uh data set . and , uh , the best score , on the , nicest part of the data , that is , where you 've got training and test set that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth , uh , is about , i think the best score was something like five percent , uh , error , per digit .", "tgt": "abstract: anticipated results were discussed in reference to results obtained for other digits corpora , i.e . aurora and ti-digits ."}
{"src": "one question i have thatthat i mean , we would n't know the answer to now but might , do some guessing , but i was talking before about doing some model modeling of arti uh , uh , marking of articulatory , features , with overlap and so on . one thought might be to do this uh , onon the digits , or some piece of the digits . so , i mean another way to look at this is to , is to , uh , do some stuff on switchboard which has all this other , stuff to it . and then , um , as we get , further down the road and we can do more things ahead of time , we can , do some of the same things to the meeting data .", "tgt": "abstract: the group also considered the prospect of performing fine-grained acoustic-phonetic analyses on a subset of meeting recorder digits or switchboard data ."}

{"src": "also we discussed some adaptational things , uhyou know i had n't , uh , incorporated , a convention explicitly to handle acronyms , for example , and then , a similar conv uh , convention for numbers . so if they hear a breath and they do n't know who breath it is it 's better to put it in that channel than to put it in the speaker 's channel", "tgt": "abstract: finally , speaker fe008 and fe016 reported on new efforts to adapt transcriptions to the needs of the sri recognizer , including conventions for encoding acronyms , numbers , ambient noise , and unidentified inbreaths ."}
{"src": "and so thethe question is , should we have the transcribers do that or should we just do it ? and i think it 's ait 's a fine idea partly because , um , it 's not un unrelated to their present skill set , and then , hand off to jane , and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits .", "tgt": "decisions: the group decided to delegate the extraction of digits to the transcriber pool ."}
{"src": "well , you know , umi mean if we 're talking about , having the , annotators annotate these kinds of features , it seems like , so i mean i we 'll see wha how much we can , uh , get the people to do , and how much money we 'll have and all this sort of thing , so , i mean another way to look at this is to , is to , uh , do some stuff on switchboard which has all this other , stuff to it .", "tgt": "decisions: a tentative decision was also made to delegate transcribers with the task of labelling a subset of digits or switchboard data for fine-grained acoustic-phonetic features ."}
{"src": "it seems to me that it would be good to have , a few minutes fromfrom different meetings , so , as a first pass through , a first chance without having to do a lot of hand - editing , what we 're gon na do , is , i 'll run it through channelize , give them those data after i 've done the editing process and be sure it 's clean . and then we 'll see if the units that we 're getting , uh , with theat that level , are sufficient .", "tgt": "decisions: speaker fe008 will run selected meeting recorder data through channelize and determine whether the resulting units are of a sufficient length ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: with respect to encoding more fine-grained acoustic information in transcriptions , the question was posed: which features should be marked ?"}
{"src": "there are some problems with the lapel mike . but , there are somesomeas i said some problems with the lapel mike ,", "tgt": "problems: speaker mn014 reported problems pre-segmenting speech recorded via the lapel microphones ."}

{"src": "and , the thing is ii , then the evaluation ofof the system is a little bit hard , as i do n't have any references .", "tgt": "problems: the evaluation of pre-segmented data is difficult without tightly transcribed time references to the individual channels from which the speech was derived ."}
{"src": "it drifted into the afternoon , <inbreath> uh , concerning this issue of , um , the , well there 's basically the issue of the interplay between the transcript format and the processing that , they need to do for , the sri recognizer . and , um , < mike noise > their recognizer would prefer that the units not be overly long .", "tgt": "problems: the sri recognizer requires that multi-channel format units not be too large , indicating that some additional pre-processing of unit lengths may be necessary ."}
{"src": "the other topic i was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that . um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in . so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . and so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes . no , we 're just replacing the wiredthe two wired that are still working , along with a couple of the wired that are n't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless .", "tgt": "abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed recording equipment issues , including the purchase of two additional headsets and the prospect of getting a new base station and a set of wireless microphones to replace those wired microphones currently in use ."}
{"src": "but ithink it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now . the next step is tothat i 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , liz requested in terms of um , umin terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which i had n't been specific about . that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout ,", "tgt": "abstract: speaker fe008 presented the current status on transcriptions , and explained procedures for cleaning up transcripts and ensuring they conform with set conventions ."}

{"src": "i wan na talk a little bit about gettinghow we 're gon na to get people to edit bleeps , parts of the meeting that they do n't want to include . the transcription part ? so i guess the next thing is this uhbleep editing . we need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they do n't want . '' if you agree to participate you 'll have the opportunity to have anything ex anything excised , which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . `` there again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you 'd prefer to have excised from the database , and they will m be removed both from the transcript and the recording . ``", "tgt": "abstract: finally , the group discussed legal and procedural issues concerning the provision of transcripts to meeting participants for 'bleeping out ' any sections of speech they want excluded from the meeting recorder database ."}

{"src": "in listening tosome of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things ,", "tgt": "problems: some of the meeting recordings contain spikes ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: it was surmised that such disturbances are probably due to the connectors attached to a set of wired microphones in use ."}
{"src": "areare people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they were n't speaking ? so that means other people are editing what you say ?", "tgt": "problems: with respect to editing bleeps , should participants be allowed to edit out others ' speech ?"}
{"src": "but i really think we wan na make it the rare incidence . andand uh , i am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do ,", "tgt": "problems: it was suggested that making transcripts available to all of the subjects involved might make it too easy for them to edit out sections of meetings , whereas the bias should be to ensure that editing bleeps occur only rarely in the database ."}
{"src": "i have a short thing about digits and then uh i wan na talk a little bit about naming conventions , so the only thing i wan na say about digits is , we are pretty much done with the first test set . uh , the last one wasthat you had there , was about naming ? we want some way of specifying , more than looking in the `` key `` file , what channel and what mike . what channel , what mike , and what broadcaster .", "tgt": "abstract: topics discussed by the berkeley meeting recorder group included the status of the first test set of digits data , naming conventions for files , speaker identification tags , and encoding files with details about the recording ."}
{"src": "uh , right , soso ii was just gon na talk briefly about the nsf itr . ok , so uh e l i guess , let me , uh , get mymy short thing out about the nsf . so this was , uh , a , uh , proposal that we put in so is i forit was a <mouth> proposal for the itr program , um , < clears throat > since we have such a short agenda list i guess i wi i will ask howhow are the transcriptions going ? andand i 'm tried toto , uh , adjust thetoto improve , eh , an harmonicity , eh , detector that , eh , ii implement . eh , and now i 'mi 'mi 'm trying toto find , eh , some kind of a , um <breath> of h of help , eh , using the energy toto distinguish between possible harmonics , andand other fre frequency peaks , that , eh , corres not harmonics . you 're trying distinguish between the case where there is , uhwherewhere there are more thanuh , where there 's more than one speaker and the case where there 's only one speaker .", "tgt": "abstract: the group also discussed a proposal for a grant from the nsf 's itr ( information technology research ) program , transcriptions , and efforts by speaker mn005 to detect speaker overlap using harmonicity-related features ."}

{"src": "seems like we should just change the transcripts", "tgt": "decisions: a small percentage of transcripts will be changed to reflect mis-read , uncorrected digits ."}
{"src": "that also brings up the point that we have to start assembling a speaker database so that we get those links back and forth and keep it consistent .", "tgt": "decisions: a speaker database will be compiled to establish consistent links between speakers and their corresponding identification tags ."}
{"src": "well so thenthen , maybe the answer is to , uh , listen especially densely in places of overlap ,", "tgt": "decisions: sections of densely overlapping speech will require hand-checking so that overlooked backchannels may be manually segmented and labelled ."}
{"src": "so i would say do n't tell them to transcribe anything that 's outside of a grouping of words .", "tgt": "decisions: the transcribers should only code audible breaths within a grouping of words , and not outside regions of continuous speech ."}
{"src": "i do n't knowthink it 'd be ideal . and breaths are part of real speech .", "tgt": "decisions: it was further determined that audible breaths are an important facet of recorded speech , and that removing them from the corpus would be contrary to the aims of the project ."}
{"src": "i will prepare for the next week eh , all my results about the harmonicity", "tgt": "decisions: speaker mn005 will prepare his results for detecting speaker overlap and present them in the next meeting ."}
{"src": "but , um , the other problem we were thinking about is if you just put the numerals , they might say forty - three instead of four three .", "tgt": "problems: during digits readings , subjects tend to chunk numbers together rather than reading each number separately ."}
{"src": "but , um , with the mixed , when you have an overlap , you only have aa choice of one start and end time for that entire overlap ,", "tgt": "problems: when working from the mixed channel , transcribers may select only one start and end time for overlapping speech , resulting in points of overlap that are less tightly tuned ."}
{"src": "once in a while a backchannel will be overlooked by the transcriber .", "tgt": "problems: transcribers are likely to overlook backchannels in densely populated sections of speaker overlap ."}
{"src": "yeah , but those backchannels will always be a problem i think . uh especially if they 're really short and they 're not very loud and so itit canitit will always happen that also the automatic s detection system will miss some of them ,", "tgt": "problems: speaker mn014 reported that this is also problematic for the automatic detection of speech and non-speech , as backchannels that are very short and not loud enough will inevitably be overlooked ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: speaker mn005 reported problems distinguishing between possible harmonics and other frequency peaks , and creating an algorithm for obtaining the instantaneous frequency ."}
{"src": "um , aside from the fact that they 're obviously very time - consuming to encode ,", "tgt": "problems: the encoding of all audible breaths is too time-consuming ."}
{"src": "so the other topic with digits is uh , we have asr results from liz , transcript status from jane , and disk space and storage formats from don . don , you had disk space and storage formats .", "tgt": "abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed digits data , recent asr results , the status of transcriptions , and disk space and storage format issues ."}
{"src": "we have about two hours worth . so what that means is we have about an hour of transcribed digits that we can play with . and you 're saying two hours , uh , is digits ,", "tgt": "abstract: approximately two hours of digits have been recorded , half of which have been extracted ."}
{"src": "um , leads us to believe that doing a better segmentation , like your channel - based segmentation , or some kind of uh , echo cancellation to get basically back down to the individual speaker utterances would be probably all that we would need to be able to do good recognition on theon the close - talking mikes .", "tgt": "abstract: researchers doing asr are looking into methods for generating a better channel-based segmentation to improve recognition results for close-talking microphone data ."}
{"src": "alright so , first of all , um , there was aan interest in the transcribe transcription , uh , checking procedures", "tgt": "abstract: transcription checking procedures were reviewed , and efforts to coordinate the channelization and presegmention of data with the tightening of time bins were discussed ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: the group also talked about downsampling and strategies for coping with low disk space ."}
{"src": "ok soso i can just add to the instructions to read it as digits", "tgt": "decisions: digits forms will instruct speakers to read digits separately and not as connected numbers ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: a tentative decision was made to collect overlapping digits from speakers ."}
{"src": "give itgive one tr transcriber thethe channelized version ofof my speech - nonspeech detection and look ifif that 's helpful for them ,", "tgt": "decisions: transcribers will be given channelized data that has been segmented for speech / non-speech boundaries to determine whether such pre-processing facilitates the transcription process ."}
{"src": "and they 're slowly s trickling in . and so we tried last week with them written out in english . and it just did n't work at all because no one grouped them together .", "tgt": "problems: participants have been slow in returning the relevant forms necessary for matching digits data with speaker ids . forms containing digits that were written out in english were unsuccessful for obtaining desired prosodic groupings ."}
{"src": "especially for speakers that do n't talk a lot . so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation ,", "tgt": "problems: acoustic adaptation is problematic for speakers who seldom talk during meetings ."}
{"src": "it 's the fact that there 's overlap that causes recognition errors . so with a one - word utterance and ten insertions you know you got huge error rate .", "tgt": "problems: speaker overlap causes recognition errors ."}
{"src": "i guess the other neat thing is it shows for sure w that the lapel , you know within speaker is bad . and it 's bad because it picks up the overlapping speech .", "tgt": "problems: the lapel microphone is problematic as it picks up overlapping background speech ."}
{"src": "thatthat 's why we need more disk space", "tgt": "problems: more disk space is needed ."}
{"src": "you ca n't load an hour of speech into x waves .", "tgt": "problems: loading long waveforms in x waves is very time consuming ."}
{"src": "but if there 's things that um , we change later , then we always have to keep ourthe dictionary up to date .", "tgt": "problems: the dictionary must be updated with forms introduced as part of speaker fe008 's set of transcription conventions ."}
{"src": "well , you know the problemthe problem is that somesome of the adjustments that they 're making are to bringare to combine bins that weretime bins which were previously separate . but thei guess the ef the effect for you guys , because you 're pulling out the little wave forms into separate ones , that would mean these boundaries are constantly changing but if you split inside something , you do n't where the wordwhich words moved .", "tgt": "problems: the ongoing tightening of boundaries on time bins causes segment boundaries to change , indicating potential problems for other ongoing processing tasks ."}
{"src": "and then we go in and adjust the boundaries . how quickly can the transcribers scan over and fix the boundaries , and then it 'sthen it 'sthen it 's the transcribers tightening stuff up , so you 're talking about tightening up time boundaries ? well , soso that 's something that the transcribers will have tohave to do . so , if i excluded the pathological ones , <laugh> by definition , those that had like over ninety - five percent error rate , <inbreath> and the non - natives , then the average error rate was like one point four or something ,", "tgt": "abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed the preparation of a data sample for ibm , the manual adjustment of time bins by transcribers , recognition results for a test set of digits data , and forced alignments ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: participants also talked about eurospeech 2001 submissions , and exchanged comments on the proceedings of the recently attended human language technologies conference ( hlt'01 ) ."}

{"src": "so we need some way to push these first chunk of meetings into a state where we get good alignments .", "tgt": "abstract: efforts to deal with cross-talk and improve forced alignments for non-digits data were also discussed ."}
{"src": "and then we go in and adjust the boundaries . and then it 'sthen it 'sthen it 's the transcribers tightening stuff up , well , soso that 's something that the transcribers will have tohave to do .", "tgt": "decisions: subsequent manual adjustment of speech and non-speech boundaries will be delegated to the transcriber pool ."}
{"src": "he generated , um , a channel - wise presegmented version of a meeting , and then it 's ibm .", "tgt": "decisions: a subset of meeting recorder data will be prepared ( i.e . pre-segmented and manually adjusted ) for delivery to ibm ."}
{"src": "i think that if we decide that we needthat they need to see the visuals , we need to change the interface so that they can do that .", "tgt": "decisions: the transcriber interface may require modifications if it becomes necessary for transcribers to quickly switch among waveform displays ."}
{"src": "and there really was , then , if it did n't show up in a mixed signal to verify , then it might be overlooked , yeah , but presumably , most of those they should be able to hear from the mixed signal unless they 're embedded in the heavil heavy overlap section i do n't know that you can locate them very well from the mixed signal ,", "tgt": "problems: transcribers risk overlooking speech that is deeply embedded in the mixed signal ."}
{"src": "so , i mean , the question is `` shouldshould a transcriber listen to the entire thing or can it g can it be based on the mixed signal ? ``", "tgt": "problems: should transcriptions be derived from each of the close-talking channels or from the mixed signal alone ?"}
{"src": "except for < clears throat > it does n't do well on short things , remember .", "tgt": "problems: the pre-segmentation tool does not perform well on short utterances , e.g . backchannels ."}

{"src": "oh , well , yeah , so i 've been struggling with the forced alignments . but it might well be that we ca n't get clean alignments out of thisout of those , uh , <inbreath> channels , so he thought well if we can do something quick and dirty because dan said the cross - cancellation , it 's not straight - forward .", "tgt": "problems: forced alignments were problematic for non-digits data due to cross-talk ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: this problem was reported to be particularly bad for cross-talk featuring more than one word ."}
{"src": "unless maybe we do this , uh , um , cancellation business . but it 's clear from dan that this is not something you can do in a short amount of time . um , but then if you add the dynamic aspect of adapting distances , then it was n't", "tgt": "problems: echo cancellation was considered as a means of improving forced alignments , but was ultimately deemed to be too time-consuming given the dynamic aspect of adapting distances between speakers ."}
{"src": "it 's very tedious to check these .", "tgt": "problems: comparing error rates in terms of the recording device used , i.e . lapel versus wireless microphones , is tedious ."}

{"src": "but if they 're not comfortable , we have the same problems we have with these stupid things .", "tgt": "problems: participants have complained that the head-mounted microphone is uncomfortable ."}
{"src": "and the interesting thing is that even though , <inbreath> yes , it 's a digits task and that 's a relatively small number of words and there 's a bunch of digits that you train on , <inbreath> it 's just not as good as having aa l very large amount of data and training up aaa nice good big <inbreath> hmm .", "tgt": "abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed efforts to train and test the aurora group 's htk-based recognition system on icsi 's digits corpus ."}

{"src": "uh , but the other is that , um , the digits <inbreath> recorded here in this room with these close mikes , i uh , are actually a lot harder than thestudio - recording ti - digits . if you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating thethe warping , uh , factor . well , i know there were some speaker labelling problems , um , after interruptions . but you 're actually saying that certain , uh , speakers were mis mis - identified .", "tgt": "abstract: performance in both tasks was adversely affected by the manner of recording conditions implemented and difficulties attributing utterances to the appropriate speakers ."}

{"src": "yeah . ii know what i was thinking was that maybe , uh , i i we could actually t t try at least looking at , uh , some of thethe large vocabulary speech from a far microphone , but i 'm saying if you do the same kind of limited thing <inbreath> as people have done in switchboard evaluations or asa could we do exactly the same thing that we 're doing now , but do it with a far - field mike ? but you use the acoustics from the far - field mike .", "tgt": "decisions: subsequent recognition experiments will look at large vocabulary speech from a far-field microphone ( as performed in switchboard evaluations ) ."}
{"src": "so , <inbreath> we would need a hand - marked , um , <mouth> word - level alignments or at least sort of the boundaries of the speech betw you know , between the speakers . and tune the parameters of theof the model , uh , to op to get the bestperformance .", "tgt": "decisions: hand-marked , word-level alignments are needed to reveal speaker boundaries and tune the parameters of the model ."}
{"src": "you know , interface - wise if you 're looking at speech , you wan na be able to know really where the words are . um , and see if you can in maybe incorporate it into the transcriber tool some way , yeah , it wou the advantage would just be that when you brought up a bin you would be ableif you were zoomed in enough in transcriber to see all the words , you would be able to , like , have the words sort of located in time ,", "tgt": "decisions: modifications to the transcriber tool are required for allowing transcribers to simultaneously view the signal in xwaves and see where words are located in time ."}

{"src": "uh , but the other is that , um , the digits <inbreath> recorded here in this room with these close mikes , i uh , are actually a lot harder than thestudio - recording ti - digits . i suspect that to get sort of the last bit out of these higher - quality recordings you would have to in fact , uh , use models that , uh , were trained on wider - band data . that 's where the most m acoustic mismatch is between the currently used models and thethe r the set up here . the near versus far .", "tgt": "problems: a mismatch between the manner in which data were collected and the models used for doing recognition -- -e . g . bandwidth parameterization and the use of near- versus far-field microphones -- -was identified ."}
{"src": "if you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating thethe warping , uh , factor .", "tgt": "problems: too little data per speaker can have a negative effect on vtl estimation ."}

{"src": "you know , as liz said thewe f enforce the fact that , uh , the foreground speech has to be continuous . things like words that do occur just by themselvesa alone , like backchannels or something that we did allow to have background speech around it those would be able to do that , but the rest would be constrained .", "tgt": "problems: current speech alignment techniques assume that foreground speech must be continuous and , barring some isolated words and backchannels , can not cope with overlapping background speech ."}
{"src": "we probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker . but , i guess andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker , and that 's actually a little bit of a f funky model . like , it gives you some weird alignments , just because often the background speakers match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker .", "tgt": "problems: performing adaptations on both the foreground and background speaker produced a new variety of misalignments , a problem resulting , in part , from the fact that background speakers often match better to foreground conditionss ."}

{"src": "so the only agenda items were janewas jane wanted to talk about some of the ibm transcription process . uh , and you just sent off a eurospeech paper , so , we should probably talk about the ibm transcription process stuff that", "tgt": "abstract: the main topics of the agenda were a paper submitted to eurospeech and the organising of the recording transcriptions to be done by ibm ."}
{"src": "uh , the one was that thejust thethe amount of overlap but , even if you take out all the backchannels you still have significant overlap .", "tgt": "abstract: the results presented in the former show a significant percentage of overlapping speech even without counting in backchanneling ."}
{"src": "and we rescored things um , a little bit more carefully . and then the second one was just basically the <breath> the stuff we had in thein the hlt paper on how overlaps effect therecognition performance . but basically what we found is after we take out these regionsso we only score the regions that were certified as foreground speech , <breath> the recognition error went down to almost <breath> uh , thelevel of the non - overlappedspeech .", "tgt": "abstract: additionally , the high error rate in the recognition of such overlapping speech by the sri recogniser was minimised simply by changing the scoring method used ."}
{"src": "so at the end after a discourse marker or after backchannel or after filled pause , you 're much more likely to be interrupted <breath> than before .", "tgt": "abstract: finally , a strong correlation between pauses and interruptions was confirmed ."}
{"src": "no . well , according to the transcripts .", "tgt": "abstract: all these measurements were based on the sample of available transcripts ."}
{"src": "although that 'sii take it that 's something that uh don willwill look at", "tgt": "abstract: other features , like prosody , will be studied in the near future ."}
{"src": "and also , um , the other person that wants itthere is one person at sri who wants to look at the <breath> um , you know , the uhthe data we have so far , and so i figured that ftp is the bestapproach . so what i did is i um <mouth> <breath> @ @ i made a n new directory", "tgt": "abstract: an ftp directory containing such experimental data is being set up for the benefit of other researchers ."}
{"src": "so the only agenda items were janewas jane wanted to talk about some of the ibm transcription process . so , we should probably talk about the ibm transcription process stuff that", "tgt": "abstract: regarding the transcriptions to be carried out by ibm , the discussion mainly concerned the format of the recordings that should be sent to them ."}
{"src": "and , if the chunked files focused on the dominant speakers , <breath> then , whenwhen it got s patched together when it comes back from ibm , we can add the backchannels . and you just use the s the segments of the dominant speaker then ? forfor sending toto ibm but then we could just use thethe output of the detector , and do the beeping on it , and send it to i b without having her check anything . butbut iii haveanother suggestion on that , which is , <breath> since , really what this is , isisis trying to in the large , send the right thing to them and there is gon na be thisthis post - processing step , and we 'llwe 'll fix things up", "tgt": "abstract: suggestions included sending only the channels with the dominant speakers for transcription , but it was finally agreed on sending the original files with minimal modifications , as there will be extensive in-house post-processing ."}
{"src": "so that if youif you playback that bin and have it in the mode where it stops at the boundary , <breath> it sounds like a normal word . but my general goal <breath> when there wassufficient space , room , pauseafter itto have it bekind of a natural feelinggap .", "tgt": "abstract: within this discussion , the rationale behind the coding of the time bins according to the flow of discourse was also explained ."}
{"src": "we should probablyuhgive them the non - downsampled versions . but , umthey probably w want the originals .", "tgt": "decisions: the files made available in the ftp directory will be the original ones ( before down-sampling ) , as these seem to be wanted by other parties ."}
{"src": "yeah , in fact after our meeting uh , this morning thilo came in and said that <breath> um , there could beother differences between <breath> the uhalready transcribed meeting with the beeps in it and one that hasjust r been run through his process . so tomorrow , <breath> when we go to make the umuh , chunked file <breath> for ibm , we 're going to actually compare the two . and then we 're gon na do the beep - ify on both , and listen to them and see if we notice any real differences .", "tgt": "decisions: moreover , as files may have been modified through different processing , tests will be carried out in order to ensure the generation of beep files in a consistent way ."}
{"src": "so whatwhat we 're probably gon na do is just write a script , that if two , chunks are very close to each other on the same channel we 'll just merge them . but i like this idea ofuh , for our purposes for thefor the ibm preparation , <breath> uh , n having thesejoined together ,", "tgt": "decisions: also towards this goal , some of the time bins will need to be merged ."}
{"src": "uh , because we could use that to fine tune our alignment process i mean w i mean what i wouldi was interested in is having <breath> a se having time marks for the beginnings and ends of speech ii hand - adjusted two of them soso at some point we will try to fine - tune our forced alignment", "tgt": "decisions: on the other hand , the two meetings where time bins have been hand-coded in detail will be used to fine-tune the forced alignments ."}
{"src": "we need to give brian the beeps file , and we send it to ibm . the other one is <breath> we just run his thing and send it to ibm . send it off to ibm .", "tgt": "decisions: recordings will be sent to ibm for transcription ."}
{"src": "but then we could just use thethe output of the detector , and do the beeping on it , and send it to i b so thethe one suggestion is you know we <breath> we run thilo 's thing the other one is <breath> we just run his thing and send it to ibm . and that is <breath> if we go ahead and we <breath> just run his , and we generate the beeps file , then we have somebody listen beeps file . put the beeps file ,", "tgt": "decisions: before that , the files will be automatically pre-segmented into speech / non-speech bins and the beeps will be inserted ."}
{"src": "the other problem is , that when itwhen it uh d i on the breathy ones , where you get <breath> <breath> breathing , uh , inti indicated as speech . so , i could run this on those breathy channels , and what that 'll do is just cut the time a little further .", "tgt": "decisions: in order to make things easier for the transcribers , breathy channels , which are erroneously marked as speech , will be re-classified correctly with other methods ."}
{"src": "why do n't we check through a bunch of things by sampling it ?", "tgt": "decisions: all this pre-processing will have to be evaluated first by checking a sample of the output files ."}
{"src": "what can you do ? and we 'll correct it when it comes back .", "tgt": "decisions: other issues , like whether and how synthesised speech off a laptop needs be transcribed , will be resolved during the in-house post-processing of the transcriptions ."}
{"src": "we actually exceeded the delayed deadline by o another day , i hope they accept it .", "tgt": "problems: there is a slight worry about the acceptance of the paper submitted to eurospeech as the deadline was exceeded ."}
{"src": "well , we did n't get to look at that , yeah , i just wonder if you have to normalize by the numbers of speakers or something . i bet there 's a weak dependence .", "tgt": "problems: as to the content of the paper , the overlap statistics have not been normalised against the number of participants in the conversation , although the dependency is probably going to be a weak one ."}
{"src": "there 's no statement about cause and effect .", "tgt": "problems: additionally , the correlation between pauses in speech and interruptions does not provide a cause-and-effect link for these phenomena ."}
{"src": "yeah , in fact after our meeting uh , this morning thilo came in and said that <breath> um , there could beother differences between <breath> the uhalready transcribed meeting with the beeps in it and one that hasjust r been run through his process . that 's because of channel overlap .", "tgt": "problems: the preparation of files for transcription by ibm is facing some minor difficulties , as some features ( hand-coded time boundaries , multiplicity of channels etc ) may complicate the generation of beep files ."}
{"src": "but you know , i wanted to say , his segmentation is so good , that <breath> um , the part that i listened to with her yesterday <breath> did n't need any adjustments of the bins . i can'treallyhhh , tsk . ido n't have really representative numbers , i think .", "tgt": "problems: besides this , the automatic pre-segmentation has been deemed to be good , but there are still no specific measurements to verify this ."}
{"src": "and i <laugh> the speech - nonspeech detector just assigns randomly the speech toto one of the channels ,", "tgt": "problems: the pre-segmentation tool also classifies synthesised speech used in a recording as `` normal speech '' and assigns a random channel to it ."}

{"src": "n i 'm successfully , uh , increasing the error rate . we 've always viewed it , anyway , as the major difference between the two , is actually in the smoothing , that thethat the , um , <inbreath> plp , andand the reason plp has been advantageous in , uh , slightly noisy situations is because , <inbreath> plp does the smoothing at the end by an auto - regressive model ,", "tgt": "abstract: other discussion focuses on the re-evaluation of recognition without cheating on segmentation , and also how sri recognition can be improved , especially for the female group ."}
{"src": "and the , uhporzeland the , uh , smartkom group are collecting some dialogues . i mean , i do n't care what directory tree you have it under . well , butbut , <mouth> i put it under the same directory tree . and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction , rather than another type of interaction . we 're aboutwe 're about halfhalfway through our disk right now . well , but you can have it nw archive toyou can have , <inbreath> uh , a non - backed - up disk nw archived ,", "tgt": "abstract: a number of issues regarding the management of data are addressed by the group:"}

{"src": "butbut , uh , probably , if we had to pick somethingthat we would talk on for ten minutes or so while they 're coming here . or i guess it would be , you think , reorganization status , i mean , i think , chuck was the one who added out the agenda item . i do n't really have anything to say other than that we still have n't done it . so , naming conventions and things like that , that i 've been trying to keep actually up to date . and i 've been sharing them with u - d uw folks also .", "tgt": "abstract: progress has been made in naming conventions , with file reorganisation to be done at a later date , however this was not discussed fully due to chuck 's absence ."}
{"src": "so , is there something quick about absinthethat you ? and got <mouth> <inbreath> a speedup roughly proportional to the number of processors times the clock cycle . but thewhat it means is that it 's likely that for net training and forward passes , we 'llabsinthe will be a good machine . especially if we get a few more processors and upgrade the processors .", "tgt": "abstract: finally , absinthe is now up and running with improved performance ."}
{"src": "so i guess the other thing that we were gon na talk about isis , uh , demo . and , um , so , these are the demos for theuh , july , uh , meetingand , umdarpa mee but maybe , uhmaybe we 'll just put that off for now , given that but i think maybe we should have aa sub - meeting , i think , uh , probably , uh , adam andand , uh , chuck and me should talk aboutshould get together and talk about that sometime soon .", "tgt": "abstract: discussion of demos for the july darpa meeting were left to the individuals concerned ."}

{"src": "and the , uhporzeland the , uh , smartkom group are collecting some dialogues . basically they have one person sitting in here , looking at a picture , and a wizard sitting in another room somewhere . and , uh , they 're doing a travel task . but it starts where the wizard is pretending to be a computer and it goes through a , uh , <breath> speech generation system . should this be part of the corpus or not ? and my attitude was yes , because there might be people who are using this corpus foracoustics , as opposed to just for language . we simulate a computer breakdown halfway through the session , and so then after that , the person 's told that they 're now talking to a , uhto a human . but of course they do n't know that it 's the same person both times . and i said , `` well that 's silly , ifif we 're gon na try to do it for a corpus , there might be people who are interested in acoustics . `` ii would not say it was part of the meetings corpus . so it 'sititi guess itthebegs the question of what is the meeting corpus . i think it 'sii thinki th think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key . well , this has two or more people conversing with each other . we give everyone who 's involved as their own user id , give it session i ds , <inbreath> let all the tools that handle meeting recorder handle it , or do we wan na special case it ? well , itit makes sense to handle it with the same infrastructure , since we do n't want to duplicate things unnecessarily . but as far as distributing it , we should n't label it as part of this meeting corpus . because we have , like , meetings that have a reason . andand thoseand this sounds like it 's more of an experimental setup . it 's scenario - based , it 'sit 's human - computer interface <inbreath> it 's really pretty different . it 's just that it 's , you know , different directory , it 's called something different , it 's and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction , rather than another type of interaction . well , i don i would n't call reading digits `` meetings `` . well , butbut , <mouth> i put it under the same directory tree . i mean , i do n't care what directory tree you have it under .", "tgt": "decisions: after discussing the human-computer interaction smartkom data , the group decide that different types of data can be included in the meeting corpus , but that it should be structured into different directories according to data type ."}

{"src": "um , or we could try some automated methods . and mymy tendency right now is , well , if ibm comes back with this meeting and the transcript is good , just let them do it . yeah , i mean , i guess theso the difference ifif , um , if the ibm stuff works out , the difference in the job would be that they p primarily would be checking through things that were already done by someone else ? we could let ibm transcribe it .", "tgt": "decisions: the group decide to use ibm transcription of the digits , in addition to automatic methods ."}

{"src": "we 're aboutwe 're about halfhalfway through our disk right now . so , once everything gets converted over to the disks we 're supposed to be using we 'll be probably , uh , seventy - five percent . i 'm much more concerned about the backed - up . what about putting the stuff on , like , c - cd - rom or dvd or something ? i mean , when i say two or three years what i 'm saying is that i have had disks which are gone in a year . but , uhiiyou do n't want to per p have your only copy on a media that fails . soso how about putting them on that plus , like on aonon dat or some other medium that is n't risky ? icsi already has a perfectly good tape system and it 's more reliable . so for archiving , we 'll just use tape . but even without that , the back - up system is becoming saturated . butbut this back - up system is smart enough to figure out that something has n't changed and does n't need to bebacked - up again . well , but you can have it nw archive toyou can have , <inbreath> uh , a non - backed - up disk nw archived ,", "tgt": "problems: disk space is an issue for the group , especially in terms of back-up , which is 75 % full: dvds or cds are unreliable and can not be used , and although tape is reliable , this creates access issues ."}

{"src": "uh part of the reasoni think part of the reason that adam was so interested in uh the speechcorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes butuh by ii would suggest you return one . because wewe you know , wewe have n't used it at all . one would probably be fine . maybe we could do like a student project , you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool . i mean if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more", "tgt": "decisions: after evaluating the use of the crosspads , the group decide to return one , and also keep one which will be left out in meetings to encourage its use ."}
{"src": "wewe get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a pda with a wireless card . andand that way you can synchronize very easily with thethethe meeting i mean for whatwhat you 've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else , maybe we could do like a student project , you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool . i mean if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more", "tgt": "decisions: use of pdas and buttons for note-taking will be investigated , along with using the data for a student research project ."}

{"src": "but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either but it does mean you need to be running a web server . and so itit 's pretty big and complex . uh and it would be difficult to port to windows uh the other option is dan did the tcl - tk thisl gui front - end for broadcast news", "tgt": "problems: improving the thisl front-end user interface may be difficult if it is to run on windows as a web server tcl-tk may need to be used instead ."}
{"src": "so yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in xml", "tgt": "problems: more information on xml transcription formats is required for the creation of the tools ."}
{"src": "oh , quick question on that . isdo we have the < clears throat > the seat information ? the seat information is on the key files for the ones which but i just had n't ever been putting it in the key files . i never knew we were supposed to put it in the key file . i mean this is why i wan na use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text because with the plain text it 's very easy to skip those things . yeah and then the other thing also that thilo noticed is , on the microphone , on channel zero it says hand - held mike or crown mike , you actually have to say which one . and then uh also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under `` participants `` they were filled in under `` description `` . thethe one that shows up here , that will flash yellow if the mike is n't connected .", "tgt": "problems: information for key files , such as microphone type , seating , and participant information , is not being properly recorded , and in some cases the microphones are n't working properly ."}

{"src": "wewe used them a couple times , and i haveuh so mymy feeling on it is that i think in principle it 's a really nice idea , and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . on the other hand , ithe down side for me was that i think the pen is really noisy . so that you canyou have a record of whatever it is you 've written . so i if you take notes it 's a great little device . and one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because uh we were interested inin higher - level things , not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth so that it 's synchronized with the time on that and then you have to download to an application , and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you wan na do anything with this information . and you do n't wan na take notes well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wan na make an x", "tgt": "problems: the crosspads have not been used to their full potential , which is because of a number of problems regarding their use:"}

{"src": "so i 've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected that 's the thing that i sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages so jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but i do n't really think there 's much to talk about . i 'm gon na send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them tosuggest edits . so but it 's just transcripts , not thenot the audio ? nope , they 'll have access to the audio also . because the transcripts might not be right . so , um the audio that they 're gon na have access to , will that be the uncompressed version ? or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and yeah , it 'sit 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , uh , uh , it takes too long to do random access decompression .", "tgt": "abstract: web pages have been set up to show transcription status and to allow participants to approve transcripts ."}
{"src": "um , darpa demo status , not much to say . the back - end stuff is working out fine . and , also um , i was just showing andreas , i got um an x waves kind of display , and i do n't know how much more we can do with it with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom", "tgt": "abstract: darpa demos are progressing well with the back-end indexed to allow front-end filtering , and a potential demo ideas investigated which would use x waves ."}
{"src": "i 've been putting together uh transcriber things for windows butbut it would be cool if the transcriber interface had like another window for theyou know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that isthat is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform . and see the pitch contours also . just record the audio clip and show an image and i think that 's and , < clear throat > the more live , the better , but uh , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent . so i thinkfor a lot of reasons , i think it would be very nice to have this transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it", "tgt": "abstract: transcriber is now working for windows , however live pitch contours may not work in the time available ."}
{"src": "and the last i item on the agenda is disk issues yet again . we 'rewe 're only about thirty percent on the second disk . but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings .", "tgt": "abstract: backed-up disk space is now fine , however temporary space is running out fast ."}
{"src": "uh , you know dave johnson is gone for , like , ten days , i mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , so this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to dave , but at any rate i think that there 's athere 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need", "tgt": "abstract: interim measures are discussed while sysadmin are away ."}
{"src": "um yot i tested the uhthe sort of final version of the plp configuration um on development test data forfor this year 's hub - five test set . and the recognition performance was exactly , and i mean exactly up to theyou know , the first decimal , same as with the uh mel cepstra front - end . theythey werethe males i think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really . and then the really nice thing was that ifif we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement .", "tgt": "abstract: improvement has been made in the final version of the plp , which shows better female performance , and combined with mel ceptra offers 1.5 % improvement ."}
{"src": "and then we had some results ondigits , uh , with um and the reason is basically there 's a whole bunch of read speech data in the hub - five training set .", "tgt": "abstract: digit performance also improved thanks to training using scripted speech data ."}
{"src": "and then i th guess chuck and i had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system", "tgt": "abstract: progress has also been made in sri alignment for tandem system ."}
{"src": "so something that we wan na do next meeting isis uh to put together um , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it , um , that we 've done . i mean just sort of bulletize i mean o e do do i cani can dream up text butthis is basically gon na lead to the annual report . so just a week from tomorrow ? umuhone thingi meanwe <inbreath> < clear throat > in past meetings we had um also a you know variousvariously talked about the um work that w uh was happening sort of on theon the recognition side well , it 's thatit 's just gon na be ver very boring for people who are not you know , sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system . well , ok , so how manyhow many people here would not be interested in uhin a meeting about recognition ? liz and jane probably . why do n't we alternate this meeting every other week ? but i do i don'ti mean a lot of times lately it seems like we do n't really have enough for a full meeting on meeting recorder . and then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting . uh . so uh . um . let 's chat about it with liz and janewhen we get a chance , see what they think and", "tgt": "abstract: the group note that the annual report needs to be worked on for next week , and it is also suggested to hold recognition meetings separately , however these issues will be discussed in more detail at the next meeting ."}

{"src": "uh . the problem is that it 's very big and <breath> <mouth> we still have to think how towhere to put it uh either some delay and weif we put it on the server side , it does n't work , because on the server side features you already have lda applied <breath> from the f from the terminal side and <breath> so you accumulate the delay", "tgt": "problems: the new vad is quite a large network , and adds a delay to the process ."}
{"src": "so wha where did this good vad come from ? it 's um from ogi . this is the one they had originally ? yeah , but they had toget rid of it because of the space , but the abso assumption is that we will be able to make a vad that 's small and that works fine .", "tgt": "problems: this caused ogi to drop it , though speaker mn007 is assuming that a smaller and equally effective system can be developed ."}
{"src": "but the other thing is uh to use a different vad entirely . ii do n't know what the thinking was amongst thethethe <breath> the etsi folk but um if everybody agreed sure let 's use this vad and take that out of there they just want , apparentlythey do n't want to fix the vad because they think there is some interaction between feature extraction andand vad or frame dropping but they still <mouth> want tojust to give some um <breath> requirement for this vad because it 'sit will not be part ofthey do n't want it to be part of the standard . so there just will be some requirements that are still notuh not yet uh ready i think . but i do n't think we need to be stuck on using our or ogi 'svad . we could use somebody else 's if it 's smaller you know , as long as it did the job .", "tgt": "problems: the alternative is to get yet another vad form somewhere else , though it 's not clear if they will even be required in the final system ."}
{"src": "yeah , it 'sit 's another problem . if you look at this um spectrum , is it <breath> the mel - filters ? and what we clearly see is that in some cases , and thethe harmonics are resolved by the f well , there are still appear after mel - filtering , and it happens <breath> for high pitched voice because the width of the lower frequency mel - filters <breath> is sometimes even smaller than the pitch . so we were thinking to modify the mel - spectrum to have something thatthat 's smoother on low frequencies .", "tgt": "problems: there are some problems with the voiced / unvoiced feature detection , because some pitches are slipping through the filtering ."}

{"src": "and then there 's um , another thing i wan na start looking at , um , <breath> wi is , um , the choice of the analysis window length . with thewith the htk set - up i should be able to do some experiments , on just varying that length , say between one and three seconds , in a few different reverberation conditions , i guess one thing that might also be an issue , uh , cuz part of what you 're doing is you 're getting aa spectrum over a bunch of different kinds of speech sounds . and so it might matter how fast someone was talking for instance . you know , if youififif there 's a lot of phones in one second maybe you 'll get aa really good sampling of all these different things , and <breath> and , uh , on the other hand if someone 's talking slowly maybe you 'd need more . a actually i was just thinking about what i was asking about earlier , wi which is about having <breath> less than say twelve seconds in the smartkom system to do the mean subtraction . you said in <breath> systems where you use cepstral mean subtraction , they concatenate utterances and , <breath> do you know how they address this issue of , um , testing versus training ? i think what they do is they do it always on - line , i mean , that you just take what you have from the past , that you calculate the mean of this and subtract the mean . and , um , soso in tha in that case , wh what do they do when they 're t um , performing the cepstral mean subtraction on the training data ? sobecause you 'd have hours and hours of training data . so do they cut it off and start over ? and so if you 're splitting things up into utterances so , for instance , in a dialogue system , where you 're gon na be asking , uh , you know , th for some information , there 's some initial th something . and i think the heuristics of exactly how people handle that and how they handle their training i 'm sure vary from place to place . so you 'dyouand so in training you would start over atat every new phone call or at every <breath> new speaker . itit seems to be the best whatwh wh whatwhat we can do in this moment is multi - condition training . and every when we now start introducing somesome noise reduction technique wewe introduce also somehow artificial distortions . and these artificial distortionsuh , i have the feeling that they are the reason whywhy we have the problems in this multi - condition training . that means the h m ms we trained , they arethey are based on gaussians , and if we introduce now thisthis u spectral subtraction , or wiener filtering stuff i mean , this is your noise estimate and you somehow subtract it or do whatever . and then i think what you do is you introduce somesome artificial distribution in this inin the models . soso , basically ourour position is <breath> that , um , we should n't be unduly constraining the latency at this point because we 're all still experimenting with trying to make the performance better in the presence of noise . uh , there is a minority in that group who is a arguingwho are arguing for <breath> um , uh , having a further constraining of the latency . so we 're s just continuing to keep aware of what the trade - offs are and , you know , whatwhat do we gain from having longer or shorter latencies ? well , france telecom waswaswas very short latency it was in the order of thirty milliseconds", "tgt": "abstract: while on these topics , related areas discussed included recognition window length , training versus test set sizes , artificial distortion and latency concerns ."}

{"src": "so the other thing is thei 'm just looking at a little bit on the delay issue where the delay of the system is like a hundred and eighty millisecond . so <breath> i justjust tried another sk systemi mean , another filter which i 've like shown at the end . which is very similar to the existing uh , filter . onlyuh , only thing is that the phase isis like a totally nonlinear phase so it 's just likeit 's like a three percent relative degradation , butbut is thereis there a problem with the one hundred eighty milliseconds ?", "tgt": "problems: new filters introduced to reduce latency by mn052 , performed slightly worse than those they replaced ."}
