{"src": "and the main thing that i was gon na ask people to help with today is to give input on what kinds of database format we should use in starting to link up things like word transcripts and annotations of word transcripts , th - there are sort of two choices .", "tgt": "abstract: two main options were discussed as to the organisation of the collected data ."}
{"src": "i mean , we i sort of already have developed an xml format for this sort of stuff . so tha it has a single time - line , i think for word - level , this would be ok .", "tgt": "abstract: on the one hand , a bespoke xml structure that connects transcriptions and annotations ( down to the word-level ) to a common timeline ."}
{"src": "and i thought it was better if you 're looking at a raw file to be t for the tags to say `` it 's an utterance `` , as opposed to the tag to say `` it 's a link `` . one of them is that it 's easy to parse . can you but you can add to those structures if you the other thing the other way that i sort of established this was as easy translation to and from the transcriber format .", "tgt": "abstract: its advantages are that it is easier to read , parse , map onto the transcriber format and to expand with extra features ."}
{"src": "so i think it it 's debatable whether you want to do phone - level in the same thing .", "tgt": "abstract: phone-level analysis can be included in the same structure , or in a separate , linked file ."}
{"src": "or or any frame - level stuff i would use p - file . it 's ics uh , icsi has a format for frame - level representation of features . and we have a lot of tools already to deal with it . i mean , it 's something that we developed at icsi . but , i mean , it is just something we developed at icsi .", "tgt": "abstract: the respective frame-level representation can be handled by p-files , a technology developed at icsi , which also comes with a library of tools ."}
{"src": "more compact ,", "tgt": "abstract: separation of levels of analysis makes files more compact and manageable ."}
{"src": "there 's a standard again in xml , specifically for searching xml documents structured x - xml documents , where you can specify both the content and the structural position . it 's it 's you would use that to build your tool to do that sort of search . what you would do is , someone would build a tool that used that as a library .", "tgt": "abstract: xml standards offer libraries that can be used for the development of search tools ."}
{"src": "which was their file format is just nodes and links ,", "tgt": "abstract: on the other hand , the atlas ( nist ) technology offers a very similar , but more generic organisational scheme based on nodes and links ."}
{"src": "and then `` type `` would be `` utterance `` .", "tgt": "abstract: these are labeled with domain specific types , like `` utterance '' or `` speaker '' ."}
{"src": "they 're developing a big infrastructure . um , and apparently they 've also developed a lot of tools , one of the things that atlas is doing is they 're trying to define an api which is independent of the back store , so that , uh , you could define a single api and the the storage could be flat xml files or a database .", "tgt": "abstract: this option offer well-developed infrastructure and flexibility as to the type of data storage ( flat xml files or relational database ) ."}
{"src": "but i thought it would be good to get something that we can that other people can use or adopt for their own kinds of encoding . and so i wanted something where all of this can be done in a elegant way and that if somebody wants to try something or compute something else , that it can be done flexibly .", "tgt": "abstract: in either case , it is important for the chosen format to allow for fast searches , flexible updates and , if possible , be reusable in future work ."}
{"src": "we should look at atlas , maybe i should . so i 'll i 'll take a closer look at it .", "tgt": "decisions: in order to confirm the suitability of the data format provided by the atlas project , its current state of development will be investigated ."}
{"src": "do they already have something that 's that would be useful for us in place ? well , i think i 'm i think w i had better look at it again but i 'm forgetting the exact level of nesting . i mean , i have to look at it again to see whether it can really do what we want ,", "tgt": "decisions: more specifically , the issues that have to be ascertained are , firstly , whether the external file representation offers a format that would be appropriate for speech data , and , secondly , how the linking between the different annotations ( eg , between word-level representations and prosodic-feature structures ) can be achieved ."}
{"src": "it seems to me you want to keep the frame - level stuff separate .", "tgt": "decisions: regardless of the actual format , however , there was consensus that keeping levels of analysis ( words , phones , frames , etc ) on separate , inter-linked files can make their management easier ."}
{"src": "i i think if it 's conceptually close , and they already have or will have tools that everybody else will be using , i mean , it would be crazy to do something s you know , separate that", "tgt": "problems: choosing a project-specific format for the representation of the data might not be optimal for future work ."}
{"src": "do they already have something that 's that would be useful for us in place ? um , th what would would would what would worry me is that maybe we might miss a little detail i mean , i have to look at it again to see whether it can really do what we want ,", "tgt": "problems: on the other hand , it is not yet clear whether a more standardised , but generic technology , like that of the atlas project , can accommodate all the requirements of speech analysis ."}
{"src": "for lower than word - level , you 're talking about so much data that i just i do n't know . these are big files .", "tgt": "problems: regardless of the particular format , including all annotations ( sentences , words , phones , frames , etc ) in one file could result in unmanageable file sizes ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: searching , updating or simply parsing a file for a simple task can become an unwieldy process ."}
{"src": "i mean these are long meetings but i think , a anything at frame - level , even p - file , is too verbose .", "tgt": "problems: even p-files , which are only for frame-level annotation , may be too verbose for the amount of data resulting from hour-long recordings ."}
{"src": "no matter what format you choose , you 're gon na have the trou you 're gon na have the difficulty of relating the the frame - level features", "tgt": "problems: the actual mapping of word-level transcriptions to frame-level representations is expected to be problematic anyway ."}
{"src": "and sometimes the word sequences even differ slightly because they were edited s at one place but not the other . but , see , if you 'd annotate dialogue acts , you do n't necessarily want to or topics you do n't really want to be dealing with time - marks .", "tgt": "problems: likewise , problems will arise if , in the future , slightly different transcripts of the same data are annotated in formats that do not include time-marks ."}
{"src": "the hard part is specifying what you mean by `` merge `` .", "tgt": "problems: trying to merge such annotations later will not be easy , because of the combination of transcription discrepancies with the loss of the underlying connection offered by the time-marks ."}
{"src": "oh , this was about um , inferring intentions from features in context , and the words ,", "tgt": "abstract: the initial task of the edu group is to work on inferring intentions through context ."}
{"src": "so , what we found interesting is , first of all , intentions differ . maybe you want to enter a building . maybe you want to see it , or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building . if you do n't have the intention of entering your building , but you know that something is really close to it , and you just want to approach it , or get to that building .", "tgt": "abstract: in the navigational paradigm used for the task , these intentions are to `` see '' to `` enter '' or to `` get to the closest point of '' a building ."}
{"src": "but , um , since we are designing a a a an , compared to this , even bigger data collection effort , um , we will definitely take care to put it in there ,", "tgt": "abstract: there will be purpose-designed experiments carried out ."}
{"src": "um , we can look at some factors that may make a difference . um . sometimes i found in the uh , looking at the data , in a superficial way , i found some s sort of modifiers that that m may also give us a hint , and this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered . and i will try to to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there , there 's gon na be contextual things , there 're gon na be linguistic things , there 're gon na be discourse things , the issue is , can we find a way to , basically , featurize it", "tgt": "abstract: however , the starting point is , through the use of existing data , to determine possible linguistic , discourse or situation features that define intentionality ."}
{"src": "like `` s go to see `` , or `` visit `` , or some this is of course a crucial factor , `` what type of object is it ? `` then of course the the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants . oh , another thing you want is some information abou i think , about the time of day . so if it turns out that , whatever it is , you want to know whether the person 's uh , a tourist or not , ok ? that becomes a feature .", "tgt": "abstract: these may include the type of building , time of day , particular phrases used or whether the user is a tourist or a native ."}
{"src": "and we 're able to , by hand , extract the features to put in the belief - net . if that goes well , then we can start worrying about how we would extract them . so we 'll be like , hand , uh , doing all the probabilities .", "tgt": "abstract: initially , these features will be hand-coded , but the goal is to find ways of extracting them automatically from the xml data ."}
{"src": "if we feed it through a belief - net or or something along those lines . we 'd get an inferred intention , we we produce a structure that differentiates between the vista , the enter , and the , um , tango mode . and , my idea on how to combine them is with a belief - net , which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things , but the idea is to take as a first goal , see if we could actually build a belief - net that would make this three way distinction uh , in a plausible way , here 're the things which , if you get them out of out of the language and discourse , and put them into the belief - net , it would tell you which of these three uh , intentions is most likely . `` i think that , uh , if we can get the information , a belief - net is a perfectly good way of doing the inferential combination of it . javabayes or something ?", "tgt": "abstract: consequently , they will be fed into a belief-net -implemented on a software package like javabayes- and the conditional probability of each intention calculated ."}
{"src": "so one thing you could do is build a little system that , said , `` whenever you got a question like that i 've got one of three answers . u u sort of i 'm , at the moment , curious and i 'm i 'm s w want to approach it from the end where we can s sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with , and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . from previous discourse or w any anything else you knew . and , then as soon as we have it , i think we should start trying to populate it for this problem .", "tgt": "abstract: a prototype system will be put together to test hypotheses regarding both the exact nature of the features and how intentions are derived from them ."}
{"src": "maybe for a deep understanding task , that 's a nice sort of playground or first little thing . `` so we think it 's a well - formed , uh , starter task for this , uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain .", "tgt": "decisions: inferring intentions in a navigational context is an appropriate task both in project and real-world terms ."}
{"src": "ok ? we we have a we know what the outcomes are gon na be , it all all of a sudden it does much better .", "tgt": "decisions: its goals are clearly defined and contributre to a smarter system ."}
{"src": "these we have all these transcripts but , um , since we are designing a a a an , compared to this , even bigger data collection effort , um , we will definitely take care to put it in there , and start recording subjects probably within a month or something .", "tgt": "decisions: although there are some preliminary data to work on , task-specific experiments and recordings will take place ."}
{"src": "so , th they 're gon na give us some cr uh or we can assume that y you get this crude information . so , yeah , we 're sort of committed to xml as the kind of , uh , interchange .", "tgt": "decisions: the xml format is going to be used has not been defined , although the smartkom data can be used as a foundation ."}
{"src": "ok ? so y so one of th one of the things we wan na do is actually , uh , pick a package , yeah bu w i 'd like that this y yeah , this week , to ha to n to have y guys , uh , you know , pick the y you know , belief - net package", "tgt": "decisions: in the first instance , the group will have to decide on the software package to be used for the creation and manipulation of the belief-nets ."}
{"src": "you know , we do n't need the one that 'll solve massive , uh , belief - nets quickly . but we do want one in which it 's easy to interact with and , uh , modify . you want it stable , you want it and probably one in which it 's easy to have , um , what amounts to transcript files .", "tgt": "decisions: stability and ease-of-use -in addition to ability to handle xml- of the package are the focus at this stage , instead of the ability to handle large amounts of data ."}
{"src": "an and there 're plenty of people around , students in the department who , you know , live and breathe bayes - nets .", "tgt": "decisions: experts in bayes nets within icsi can be consulted on the matter ."}
{"src": "well , i 'd like to also , though , uh , ha have a first cut at what the belief - net looks like . is show the state and show the system and show that .", "tgt": "decisions: the decision will be presented in the next meeting along with a first schema of the belief-nets themselves ."}
{"src": "and you probably need intermediate nodes . and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . from previous discourse or w any anything else you knew .", "tgt": "decisions: possible intermediate nodes can be added to the nets after this ."}
{"src": "is , uh , one , where do you get this i information from , if that goes well , then we can start worrying about how we would extract them . and then we can start worrying about where to get this input , the issue is , can we find a way to , basically , featurize it and , as soon as we have one , we can start trying to , uh , make a first cut at what 's going on .", "tgt": "decisions: the hypothesis that a set of features from which intentions can be derived exists has to be assessed , before moving on to how to extract these features from the data automatically ."}
{"src": "the street network of our geographic information system . a lot of parsers , um , that 's way beyond their scope , is of interpreting that . because i we can not differentiate , at the moment , between , you know , the intention of wanting to go there or the intention of just know wanting to know where where it is .", "tgt": "problems: curent navigation systems do not provide for the user 's particular intentions when asking for directions ."}
{"src": "it would always use the closest point to the object ,", "tgt": "problems: they always compute the shortest path between source and destination ."}
{"src": "what we do know , is that the parser we use in the smartkom system will never differentiate between any of these . so it 's it 's it 's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions . what he was saying is , the m - three - l does not have any of that . that 's way beyond their scope , is of interpreting that .", "tgt": "problems: the smartkom parser , for example , does not mark up data with features adequate for the inference of these intentions ."}
{"src": "there 's gon na be contextual things , there 're gon na be linguistic things , there 're gon na be discourse things , is , uh , one , where do you get this i information from , but if we ca n't do that , then we 're in trouble . the real issue is , do what are the factors involved in determining this ? the issue is , can we find a way to , basically , featurize it", "tgt": "problems: although it is understandable that language , discourse and situation features will play a role in how they are weighed , the exact nature of those features is unclear ."}
{"src": "and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ? so that we get some discrete number of features so that , uh , when we know the values to all those features , or as many as possible , we can w come up with the best estimate of which of the , in this case three little intentions , are most likely .", "tgt": "problems: also hard to evaluate at this stage , is how the assumed features will combine in a belief-net , in order to provide the conditional probabilities of the users ' intentions ."}
{"src": "if that goes well , then we can start worrying about how we would extract them . and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . from previous discourse or w any anything else you knew .", "tgt": "problems: even if these problems are solved , extracting the features from the data may prove to be a bottleneck ."}
{"src": "not from that data . but it was never th th the goal of that data collection to to serve for sat for such a purpose . so that 's why for example the tasks were not differentiated by intentionality , uh , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to english and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net .", "tgt": "problems: the existing data are appropriate only for preliminary work , as they do n't include intention-related information ."}
{"src": "so . uh , we we have to have this discussion of th the experiment , and the data collection , and all that sorta stuff so , we that 's part of what we 'll have to figure out .", "tgt": "problems: on the other hand , the details of the experiments that will have to be designed to get more appropriate data are not clearcut and are yet to be settled ."}
{"src": "um right now it 's still kind of in a toy version of it ,", "tgt": "abstract: the group discussed the first version of the bayes-net used to work out a user 's intentions when asking for directions from a navigation device ."}
{"src": "the probability whether the probability of a vista , tango , or enter .", "tgt": "abstract: three intentions were identified: vista ( to view ) , enter ( to visit ) and tango ( to approach ) ."}
{"src": "so then the features we decided or we decided we were talked about , you know . we had a list of things like `` to go `` and `` to visit `` and what not . uh the the prosody , the discourse , verb choice . so there are certain cues that are very strong either lexical or topic - based um , concept cues and some of them are sort of either world knowledge or situational things . is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee ,", "tgt": "abstract: the structure of the belief-net comprises , firstly , a feature layer , which includes linguistic , discourse and world knowledge information that can be gleaned from the data ."}
{"src": "so maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net , which has two has it 's own middle layer . they ra may have there own hidden layer that points to some of the the real hidden layer , um or the general hidden layer .", "tgt": "abstract: it is possible for these variables to form thematic clusters ( eg `` entrance '' , `` type of object '' , `` verb '' ) , each one with a separate middle layer ."}
{"src": "but the middle thing , we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out , like , the concept of whether they 're a tourist or whether they 're running an errand or something like that so then the hidden variables hair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry , but the other ones , the final destination , the whether they 're doing business , whether they 're in a hurry , and whether they 're tourists , they ra may have there own hidden layer that points to some of the the real hidden layer , um or the general hidden layer . and then these should then connect somehow to the more plan - based deep space", "tgt": "abstract: these feed , in turn , into the main middle layer , that defines more general hidden variables , such as the tourist / business status of the user ."}
{"src": "so there are certain cues that are very strong either lexical or topic - based um , concept cues so maybe what what what happened what might happen is that we do get this sort of task - based middle layer , entering or som you know like they might be more task - based .", "tgt": "abstract: the feature layer can end up being cue-based , while the middle layers task-based ."}
{"src": "so . the mode basically has three different outputs .", "tgt": "abstract: the latter determine the final probability of each intention in the output layer ."}
{"src": "it 's cra has a gui and it 's uh but uh it 's free . but actually it had an interface . and he 's updated it for an xml version of i guess bayes - nets .", "tgt": "abstract: this first model of the belief-net was built in javabayes , since it is a free package , has a graphical interface , and it can take xml files as input ."}
{"src": "like , we totally hand - tuned the probabilities , the probabilities and all are completely ad - hoc .", "tgt": "abstract: at this stage , all the actual probabilities are ad-hoc and hand-coded ."}
{"src": "but um in terms of specifying the scenario , um uh uh we 've gotten a little further so we wanted just to collect data , to get that that that elicits more , uh , that elicits richer language .", "tgt": "abstract: however , there has been progress in the design and organisation of experiments , that will eventually provide data more useful and appropriate for this task ."}
{"src": "so then our next idea was to add a middle layer , uh we kept um things from directly affecting the mode beyond the concept , but we just decided to keep all the things we extracted to point at the middle and then down . i guess , the fact that the there 's a complete separation between the observed features and in the output .", "tgt": "decisions: it is necessary for the belief-net to have at least one layer of nodes between the features and the final output ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: this makes the structure more flexible in terms of coding feature-layer probabilities ."}
{"src": "is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee , so maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net , which has two has it 's own middle layer . that would all f funnel into one node that would constitute entrance requirements or something like that . they ra may have there own hidden layer that points to some of the the real hidden layer , um or the general hidden layer .", "tgt": "decisions: another technique to systematise the work is the thematic clustering of the features , each cluster forming a bayes-net of each own: for example features like `` admission fee '' and `` opening hours '' can feed into an intermediate `` entrance '' node connecting to the main middle layer ."}
{"src": "so , um i suggest w to for to proceed with this in in the sense that maybe throughout this week the three of us will will talk some more about maybe segmenting off different regions , identify four regions , maybe make up some features for each region", "tgt": "decisions: the next stage is to refine the set of feature nodes and identify possible clusters ."}
{"src": "so one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the use of `` admission fee discussion `` as a cue for entry , is thinking about the plans that various people might have . they 're in in non in sort of more traditional ai kinds of plan recognition things you sort of have you know , some idea at each turn of agent doing something , i mean there are some some of them are extremely elaborate ,", "tgt": "decisions: although , in theory , traditional ai plan recognition techniques could also be helpful for inferring intentions , the schemas involved are too elaborate for this task ."}
{"src": "yeah , another thing to do , um , is also to , um i guess to ask around people about other bayes - net packages .", "tgt": "decisions: further work also includes discussing the possible advantages of bayes-net packages , other than javabayes , with experts at icsi ."}
{"src": "we can maybe write an interface th for uh entering probability distributions easily , something like like a little script . i think it might it might be simpler to just have a script that , you know", "tgt": "decisions: if they continue using javabayes , a script to help with the inputting of probabilities in the nodes is needed , as the in-built method is cumbersome ."}
{"src": "like we wan na we wan na be able to collect as much of the variables that are needed for that , so now i think we should maybe have at least one navigational task with with sort of explicit uh", "tgt": "decisions: finally , it was decided that at least some of the experiments designed for the new data collection initiative will factor in the intentions studied in the current task ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: the set of cues that form the feature nodes is not well-defined yet ."}
{"src": "that 's that that needs a lot of work .", "tgt": "problems: especially with lexical cues ( verbs , modifiers etc ) , no one offered specific intuitions as to how they might contribute to the inference of intentions ."}
{"src": "because we did n't know the probabilities of or so that 's like a huge uh clue that they 're trying to enter the place rather than uh to tango or vista , like , we totally hand - tuned the probabilities , the probabilities and all are completely ad - hoc .", "tgt": "problems: other features , like `` admission fee '' , may be intuitively linked with one of the outputs ( enter ) , however , any probabilities are coded in an ad-hoc fashion and are by no means realistic ."}
{"src": "but you could see perhaps discus the `` admission fee `` going directly to the mode pointing at `` enter `` , well for instance , the `` discourse admission fee `` node seems like it should point directly to the or increase the probability of `` enter directly `` versus `` going there via tourist `` .", "tgt": "problems: cases like this , where feature and output seem to be linked directly , bring the necessity of a middle layer in the belief-net to question ."}
{"src": "reasons being , you know , it 'd be a pain to set up all the probabilities for that . if we moved onto the next step and did learning of some sort , uh according bhaskara we 'd be handicapped .", "tgt": "problems: nevertheless , not having a middle layer would not allow for shifts in the discourse and would make the setting of probabilities and manipulation of the belief-net clumsy ."}
{"src": "it might be that if you add a new thing pointing to a variable , you just like it just overwrites everything . but they 're not very friendly .", "tgt": "problems: some issues with the use of javabayes also arose: the addition of new variables in an existing node overwrites all previous settings , and the native text file where the probability tables are set is not easy to read ; this makes adding and changing variables and nodes problematic ."}
{"src": "i did n't think it did learning .", "tgt": "problems: finally , it is unclear how much learning can be done on the created nets ."}
{"src": "so . on friday we had our wizard test data test and um these are some of the results .", "tgt": "abstract: a test run of the data collection design was very successful ."}
{"src": "um , we have to refine the tasks more and more , which of course we have n't done at all , so far , in order to avoid this rephrasing , and uh my suggestion is of course we we keep the wizard , because i think she did a wonderful job , um and also if she 's willing to take on the job of organizing all those subjects and stuff that would be wonderful .", "tgt": "abstract: the group decided to hire the `` wizard '' and continue with the refinement of the design and recruitment of subjects ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: on the other hand , there was a presentation of a new version of the belief-net for the vista / enter / tango mode task ."}
{"src": "so , what i did for this this is uh , a pedagogical belief - net and i grouped things according to what how i thought they would fit in to uh image schemas that would be related . well , this is not a working bayes - net . but the uh the the nice thing is that you know , it just is a is a visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple clearly have to be specified m more carefully", "tgt": "abstract: it is not a working net yet , but identifying clusters of features that define the output mode provides a visual aid for further work ."}
{"src": "is , if we just do this , we could wind up with a huge uh , combinatoric input to the mode thing . uh , we have a d a technical problem with the belief - nets that we we do n't want all the com too many factors if we if we allow them to just go combinatorially .", "tgt": "abstract: there are potential problems from a combinatorics perspective ."}
{"src": "which is there are technical ways of doing it , and the other trick , which is not a technical trick , it 's kind of a knowledge engineering trick , is to make the n each node sufficiently narrow that you do n't get this combinatorics .", "tgt": "abstract: these can be tackled either with technical adjustments or through careful knowledge engineering ."}
{"src": "we have to add , you know , not too much about um object types and stuff , that 's another sort of thing `` ok , here 's a another kind of minimal uh way of tackling this `` . add extra properties , a deterministic rule for every property", "tgt": "abstract: a base solution for the task would be to simply add some extra action-mode rules in the smartkom system ."}
{"src": "and um and here is exactly where what 's gon na be replaced with our bayes - net ,", "tgt": "abstract: action modes , however , can be inferred more efficiently by feeding a collection of features -from the ontology , discourse history , parsing , etc . - into bayes-nets that would replace those rules ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: ideally , the results of this small task will give insights into the function of linguistic deep understanding ."}
{"src": "so . what you 're trying to get out of this deep co cognitive linguistics is the fact that w if you know about source source , paths and goals , and nnn all this sort of stuff , that a lot of this is the same , for different tasks . and that uh there 's there 's some some important generalities that you 're getting , so that if you have sources , you have trajectors and stuff like that , but what i 'd like to be able to do is to have the way that you extract properties , that will go into different bayes - nets , be the uh general . what you 'd really like of course is the same thing you 'd always like which is that you have um a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same o over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs .", "tgt": "abstract: for instance , the final combination of features used in the current study may form a representation of the ontology , general enough to employ in any task that includes trajectors and paths ."}
{"src": "s so if you just number them `` one `` , `` two `` , `` three `` it 's and uh my suggestion is of course we we keep the wizard , because i think she did a wonderful job ,", "tgt": "decisions: although the data collection test went well and it was decided to hire the `` wizard '' , there are minor amendments in the procedure to be carried out ( shortenting the preparatory reading , numbering tasks etc ) ."}
{"src": "my idea on that was uh , partly we 'll talk about system stuff for the computer scientists , but partly i did want it to get the linguists involved in some of this issue about what the task is and all um you know , what the dialogue is , and what 's going on linguistically , you just uh do `` this is what we did , and here 's the thing , and here 's s some of the dialogue and and so forth . ``", "tgt": "decisions: a presentation of the data collection design should be included in the forthcoming meeting with other research groups , along with some account of the system design and the use of belief-nets ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: the structure of the latter was a major issue during the meeting ."}
{"src": "so the belief - net takes as input , a vector , and then we want to look up some more stuff in the ontology but also we definitely want to look up in the dialogue history um some s some stuff . there will be rules , but they are n't rules that come to final decisions , they 're rules that gather information for a decision process . my guess is it 'll be the same basic agent that um can go off and get information , run it through a a c this belief - net that", "tgt": "decisions: their input vector is to be provided by information extracted from the various modules of the system , such as the ontology and discourse history , using standard rule-based methods ."}
{"src": "and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones , then you would have to supply the parameters . and that may actually involve getting more information .", "tgt": "decisions: the output action essentially provides additional semantic parameters for the x-schema , and , in turn , may trigger the collection of more features from the data ."}
{"src": "i think we i i can come up with a a code for a module that we call the `` cognitive dispatcher `` , which does nothing , but it looks of complect object trees and decides how are there parts missing that need to be filled out , and then collect uh sub - objects and then recombine them and put them together .", "tgt": "decisions: the feature extraction could be carried out by a software tool checking object ( feature ) trees and filling them with appropriate values ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: for this concept to be put to work , further refinement of the belief-net variables is necessary , with particular attention on the combinatorics involved ."}
{"src": "five minutes is just too long . s so if you just number them `` one `` , `` two `` , `` three `` it 's", "tgt": "problems: after the trial run of the experiment , some minor issues , like the length of the preliminary reading and the need to order the tasks given to the subjects , were highlighted ."}
{"src": "she also agrees that you know if it 's all just gon na be students the data is gon na be less valuable because of that", "tgt": "problems: it is also possible that the pool of subjects ends up comprising almost entirely of students ; more variation in the sample is needed ."}
{"src": "is , if we just do this , we could wind up with a huge uh , combinatoric input to the mode thing . uh , we have a d a technical problem with the belief - nets that we we do n't want all the com too many factors if we if we allow them to just go combinatorially .", "tgt": "problems: from a system design perspective , the progress so far has shown that the combinatorics of the bayes-net even for a simple task , like the choice of vista / enter / tango mode , could render it unmanageable ."}
{"src": "so , what i did for this this is uh , a pedagogical belief - net well , this is not a working bayes - net .", "tgt": "problems: the belief-net presented in the meeting is not a working bayes-net ."}
{"src": "i mean , not necessarily in th in this meeting , but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are . so the immediate problem is just deciding w which aspects of the x - schema to add .", "tgt": "problems: consequently , it is as yet unclear what the decision nodes in the net are , and what values these can take ."}
{"src": "the harder problem is we decide what we want to use , how are we gon na get it ?", "tgt": "problems: even if those were decided , how to extract the necessary information from the data , would still be an open issue ."}
{"src": "and i do n't yet see how that goes .", "tgt": "problems: looking at the bigger picture , the current task is yet to provide insights into more general ways to achieve linguistic deep understanding ."}
{"src": "and uh see if we can find a way to present this to this linguists group that that is helpful to them .", "tgt": "problems: with these intricacies in mind , it is not easy to put together a presentation of the project cohesive and attractive enough for the other research groups in the institute ."}
{"src": "what we think is gon na happen is that , uh , in parallel starting about now we 're gon na get fey to , where you 're working with me and robert , draft a note that we 're gon na send out to various cogsci c and other classes saying , `` here 's an opportunity to be a subject . but what i 'd like to do , if it 's o k , is to s to , as i say , start the recruiting in parallel and possibly start running subjects next week .", "tgt": "abstract: the data collection running in parallel with the project can start shortly with recruiting subjects ."}
{"src": "and , um and now it 's we have a complete english parser that does everything the german parser does . and it still is , now in english . that , these guys did in a in a day .", "tgt": "abstract: meanwhile , the german parser now works with english sentences ."}
{"src": "one thing i was wondering , was , those functions there , are those things that modify the m - three - l basically ? i think each of those functions act on the current xml structure , and change it in some way , for example , by adding a a l a field to it , or something . there were other actions uh , that that s seemed to step state variables somewhere , which , in german , uh , takes these t sentence templates and produces xml structures .", "tgt": "abstract: the parser 's output modifies the xml used by the system to initiate actions and generate responses ."}
{"src": "uh you you have a route , and every every element of that e r r f of that every segment we call a `` route element `` . where y where you sort of end , and some points of interest along the way .", "tgt": "abstract: the xml for map requests also comprise a route , route elements and points of interest along the way ."}
{"src": "is one , um , also allocating , uh , some tags for our action schema enter - vista - approach ,", "tgt": "abstract: it is at this level that enter / vista / approach tags will be added as action modes ."}
{"src": "uh , at some point we 're going to have to worry about the language end .", "tgt": "abstract: as the project evolves , further enrichment of the ontology ( actions , linguistic features ) will be necessary ."}
{"src": "eh so , you you you may or so , then you 'd have this little vector of , um , you know , approach mode or eva mode . it 's part of what you know about a an object , is its eva vector .", "tgt": "abstract: similarly , object representations will include an eva vector ."}
{"src": "if you know it for a specific landmark you put it there . if you do n't , you just go up the hierarchy to the first place you find one . if it 's that type of thing , and we want its eva vector , pppt - pppt ! it 's that . ``", "tgt": "abstract: this can be incorporated in the database entry for a particular building or inherited from the ontology of the building type ."}
{"src": "the typical example is that , um , these are all a bunch of cues for something , and this is a certain effect that we 'd like to conclude .", "tgt": "abstract: these elements will constitute only a small part of the inputs of the bayes-net that determines the action mode ."}
{"src": "and , that 's a lot of probabilities to put here , which is kind of a pain .", "tgt": "abstract: the actual number of the inputs can create a combinatorial explosion when setting the probabilities ."}
{"src": "so noisy - ors are a way to , uh , sort of deal with this . so we come up with these l little tables for each of those and the final thing is that , um this is a deterministic function of these , th - c the full conditional probability table with some function .", "tgt": "abstract: noisy-or 's can help avoid this by simplifying the probability tables and applying a deterministic function to produce their complete version ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: in any case , further to fulfilling the basic requirements ( translating the parser and the generator into english ) , the project is entirely open-ended in terms of focus of research ."}
{"src": "in parallel with that , we 're gon na need to actually do the script . this the permission form .", "tgt": "decisions: as the data collection is about to begin , there are some minor changes to be done in the design of the experiment , the script and the permission forms ."}
{"src": "what we think is gon na happen is that , uh , in parallel starting about now we 're gon na get fey to , where you 're working with me and robert , draft a note that we 're gon na send out to various cogsci c and other classes saying , `` here 's an opportunity to be a subject . not necessarily by any means all students but what i 'd like to do , if it 's o k , is to s to , as i say , start the recruiting in parallel and possibly start running subjects next week . which is we gon na check out our social infrastructures for possible subjects .", "tgt": "decisions: subjects can be recruited either from within the university or through other social circles ."}
{"src": "that , these guys did in a in a day . eh , but again , there 's one module in which there 's one piece that we have to convert to english .", "tgt": "decisions: as to the system design , the next step is the translation of the generator into english ."}
{"src": "and the next thing i would like to be able to do , and it seems like this would not be too difficult either , is to say , `` ok let 's now pretend we actually wanted to not only change the the mapping of of , uh , words to the m - three - l but we also wanted to change add a new sentence type so , yeah . i definitely think it 's it 's worth the exercise of trying to actually add something that is n't there .", "tgt": "decisions: moreover , it is important to test the system and its internal workings by adding new sentence types and modifying the parser ."}
{"src": "it seems to me we can get all the complexity we want in actions and in language without going outside of tourists in heidelberg . so , at least unless somebody else wants t to suggest otherwise i think the general domain we do n't have t to uh , broaden . that is , tourists in heidelberg .", "tgt": "decisions: all further research will use the existing domain ( `` tourists in heidelberg '' ) , as this provides enough diversity for the purposes of the project ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: the german partners for the project will realise all the necessary changes in the ontology ."}
{"src": "so it seemed to me , what we ought to do is get our story together . and think about it some , internally , before asking them to make changes . ok . what are the thl class of things we think we might try to do in a year or two ? this is this is everything that that , um , you know , um we might want to do in the next couple years .", "tgt": "decisions: it is therefore preferable for the group to exercise foresight and agree on the set of new tags they will need in the long run , so that they limit the number of change requests ."}
{"src": "so noisy - ors are a way to , uh , sort of deal with this . i think we definitely i think it 's a great idea tha to to pursue that .", "tgt": "decisions: finally , on a more technical note , noisy-or 's were discussed and considered a sensible approach to deal with the potential problems with the setting the conditional probabilities of the bayes-nets ."}
{"src": "and , um and now it 's we have a complete english parser that does everything the german parser does . i think each of those functions act on the current xml structure , and change it in some way , for example , by adding a a l a field to it , or something . there were other actions uh , that that s seemed to step state variables somewhere , it 's mystery functions . that , these guys did in a in a day .", "tgt": "problems: although the parser has been modified to work with english , the details of its internal workings ( calling functions , setting discourse variables , generating actions ) are not yet clear ."}
{"src": "although th the to get at them from a language may not be trivial . so , it 's a relational database with persons , events , and , um , objects .", "tgt": "problems: understanding the parsed data is helped by the database of objects , people and events accompanying the system , but the mapping of referring expressions to database objects can still be a hurdle ."}
{"src": "and , that 's a lot of probabilities to put here , which is kind of a pain .", "tgt": "problems: on a different level , the bayes-net used to generate the different action modes can easily become unmanageable as the number of features to be taken into account increases ."}
{"src": "so noisy - ors are a way to , uh , sort of deal with this .", "tgt": "problems: this can be tackled with the use of the noisy-or technique ."}
{"src": "so , if ba - javabayes wo n't do it for you , and then but , the combination functions , and whether we can put those in java bayes , and all that sort of stuff , is , uh is the bigger deal .", "tgt": "problems: the deterministic functions this requires can not be introduced directly into javabayes , although some runaround ways can be implemented ."}
{"src": "there 's this whole framework problem that i 'm feeling really uncomfortable about .", "tgt": "problems: a final , high-level issue , that has not been dealt with yet , is the definition of the constructions and the construction grammar framework analysis behind the whole enterprise ."}
{"src": "so they 'll have a little bit more natural interaction ?", "tgt": "abstract: the data collection script has been slightly modified , so that it encourages more natural dialogue between the subjects and the `` wizard '' ."}
{"src": "and um we have a little description of asking peop subjects to contact fey for you know recruiting them for our thing however there is always more people in a in a facul uh in a department than are just taking his class or anybody else 's class at the moment and then we 're going to have another we 're gon na have w another trial run", "tgt": "abstract: another trial run will take place , while a call to recruit subjects is being emailed to students ."}

{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: this was the basic requirement of the project ."}
{"src": "then uh on to the modeling . in the future though , the content of a hypothesis will not only be an object and an an action and a domain object but an action , a domain object , and a rich action description ,", "tgt": "abstract: on the other hand , there was a presentation of the model that offers more elaborate action planning for smartkom , of which enter / view / approach ( eva ) modes are a part ."}
{"src": "inside of enter there will be roles that can be filled basically .", "tgt": "abstract: these modes will form categories of complete xml schemas with information filled in from the language understanding in a more elaborate way than the current object- '' go action '' -object model ."}
{"src": "the idea is , so , imagine we have a library of schema such as the source - path - goal well one of the types of action schemas is source - path - goal action .", "tgt": "abstract: these categories will , in turn , be linked with action schemas , one of which is source-path-goal ( spg ) ."}
{"src": "the idea is , so , imagine we have a library of schema so if you wanted to have a new type of action you 'd create a new type of category .", "tgt": "abstract: categories and action schemas can have -in theory- any number of blocks depending on the expansion of the domain ."}
{"src": "meaning we can reference . and link it to another one , and this not only within a document but also via documents ,", "tgt": "abstract: the notation provides for linking and referencing between different schemas ."}
{"src": "and then those actions can be in multiple categories at the same time if necessary . it 's it 's crucially necessary , is that we can have multiple schemas and multiple action schemas in parallel .", "tgt": "abstract: the model also allows for multiple action schemas to be triggered in parallel ."}
{"src": "um and i agree that you know this is something we need to discuss ,", "tgt": "abstract: however , the structure of the model is open for discussion , since its use was to elicit discussion and highlight issues ."}
{"src": "um , so we 're about to collect data and um we have a little description of asking peop subjects to contact fey for you know recruiting them for our thing", "tgt": "decisions: as the data collection is about to start , a call for the recruitment of subjects is going to be sent out ."}
{"src": "however there is always more people in a in a facul uh in a department than are just taking his class or anybody else 's class at the moment", "tgt": "decisions: the main pool of subjects is going to be the student community in the institute ."}
{"src": "there the idea is now that next actually we we need to hire one more person to actually do that job", "tgt": "decisions: along with the `` wizard '' , who is going to be an integral part of the experiments , another person needs to be hired as the instructor for the tasks involved in them ."}
{"src": "meeting time rescheduling . i n did n't you say something about friday ,", "tgt": "decisions: meetings were rescheduled and are now going to take place on fridays ."}
{"src": "so i mean clearly there 's i can talk about the um the parser changes on friday at least ,", "tgt": "decisions: for the next meeting , there is going to be a presentation of the modifications in the parser module of the basic system ."}
{"src": "and and this is on on a on on my list of things until next next week . yeah , we i will promise for the next time to have fleshed out n xml examples for a a run through and and see how this this then translates ,", "tgt": "decisions: additionally , the proposed xml model will be put to the test with concrete data ."}
{"src": "and um if you can get that binding point also maybe with a nice example that would be helpful for johno and me .", "tgt": "decisions: similarly , such examples will clarify issues relating to the binding and redundancy of features with common characteristics amongst the shcemas ( eg `` container '' for enter and `` goal '' for spg ) ."}
{"src": "um and then , secondly , we had , you may remember , um the problem with the re - phrasing , that subject always re - phrase sort of the task that uh we gave them ,", "tgt": "problems: subjects in the trial runs of the experiment were given detailed descriptions of the tasks , which led to the subsequent dialogue being a re-iteration or re-phrasing of the instructions ."}
{"src": "however , not only was the common census were among all participants of friday 's meeting was it 's gon na be very laborious to to make these drawings for each different things , so all of a sudden we 'll get descriptions of pictures in there .", "tgt": "problems: using pictures instead would be one way to deal with the problem , however , it was deemed too laborious and it would divert the focus of the experiment ."}
{"src": "and the problem is , is that the current system does not distinguish between goes of type `` going into `` , goes of type `` want to go to a place where i can take a picture of `` , et cetera . in the future though , the content of a hypothesis will not only be an object and an an action and a domain object but an action , a domain object , and a rich action description ,", "tgt": "problems: as the original action planner of the smartkom system only included a generic spg schema , a new module was presented that allows for variety in the user intentions to be included ."}
{"src": "well , i think we 're gon na hit a lot of interesting problems um and i agree that you know this is something we need to discuss ,", "tgt": "problems: this being only a model , there are several issues that will need to be clarified in the future ."}
{"src": "it 's also a question of the recursiveness and and a hier hierarchy um in there .", "tgt": "problems: how the model deals with redundancy of information among categories and action schemas , and whether a flat or a hierarchical model would be preferable are two of them ."}
{"src": "and it 's gon na get more and more complex the the l complexer and larger our domains get .", "tgt": "problems: what is also clear is that as the domain of research broadens beyond the study of eva modes , the complexity of the model will also increase ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: a detailed diagram of the belief-net had already been disseminated ."}
{"src": "one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what", "tgt": "abstract: its structure was discussed during the meeting ."}
{"src": "the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from the uh user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse . these are all like saying ev or a ,", "tgt": "abstract: there are several endpoints ( user , ontology , discourse etc ) with separate eva ( enter / view / approach ) values ."}
{"src": "one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what", "tgt": "abstract: details of how different inputs feed into them were discussed at length ."}
{"src": "if it 's fixing things selling things , or servicing things so the idea would be that you might wan na merge those three you could have a node that 's that was a measure of the match between the object 's feature , you know , the match between the object the entity , i 'm sorry and the user .", "tgt": "abstract: ideas mentioned included grouping features of buildings like `` selling '' , `` fixing '' and `` exhibiting '' , as well as creating a user-compatibility node that would take different values depending on the situation and the user status ."}
{"src": "so here is the the we had that the user 's budget may influence the outcome of decisions . well the fir see the first thing is , getting back to thing we left out of the other is the actual discourse .", "tgt": "abstract: similarly , a go-there ( towards a building ) node can be influenced by things like the user 's budget and discourse parameters amongst other things ."}
{"src": "and we do n't know what they are yet .", "tgt": "abstract: the latter are still ill-defined at this stage ."}
{"src": "because uh we 're gon na want to know you know , which constructions indicate various of these properties", "tgt": "abstract: the study of the linguistic constructions that people use in this kind of navigational domain is expected to be prove useful in that respect ."}
{"src": "so um recall the basic problem which is that um you have a belief - net and you have like a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node . so the problem is to specify the uh so the conditional property of this given all those ,", "tgt": "abstract: as each node in the tree is the decision point of the combination of its parent nodes , which rules govern this combination is an important issue ."}
{"src": "and we just take the uh we essentially take um averages , this is a hidden variable . w i was just , if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w a weighting s system though too ,", "tgt": "abstract: there are several approaches ranging from simply averaging the inputs to using a hidden variable in order to weight them differently depending on context ."}
{"src": "ok , so they they could either be hand coded or learned or", "tgt": "abstract: if the latter architecture is used , the net could -to an extent- be trained with the data that is currently being collected ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: although this was mainly a brainstorming meeting , some minor tasks were allocated for the near future ."}
{"src": "yeah , i i mean , it might soon , if this is gon na be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for our purposes .", "tgt": "decisions: since the net architecture and possible decision algorithms were discussed , it is necessary to examine how much of this javabayes can accommodate and , if not , what modifications would be necessary ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: additionally , the german partners visiting the institute will need to see some results of the new system design ."}
{"src": "so , i mean i know we 're going for sort of a rough and ready .", "tgt": "decisions: finally , the analysis of the linguistic constructions for the current research domain can begin even with limited data , as , at this stage , they need not be very detailed ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: the is only a diagrammatic view of how the decision tree for the eva task looks like ."}
{"src": "we have the user interest is a is a vector of five hundred values , that you 'd have to do see in order to do reference and stuff like that um you 've got ta have both the current discourse and the context to say i wan na go back there ,", "tgt": "problems: a lot of the details have been glossed over: the user model can potentially comprise a huge number of factors ; a planning `` go-there '' node needs input from several other areas of the net ; there are intricate interactions between discourse and the situation model ."}
{"src": "and we do n't know what they are yet .", "tgt": "problems: similarly , what discourse properties are of importance and how they influence eva probabilities is still a mystery ."}
{"src": "but then the question is do you do we wan na propagate beliefs every single time it 's updated or only when we need to ?", "tgt": "problems: on a more general note , there is also the question of whether the net should be updated continuously or only when it is needed ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: no final decision was taken as to the rules of computation applying in the belief-net ."}
{"src": "ok , so they they could either be hand coded or learned or based on training data , like , are we able to get these nodes from the data ?", "tgt": "problems: the more interesting solutions would ideally require training data , and it is still debatable whether the current collection would be appropriate for this particular task ."}
{"src": "yeah , i i mean , it might soon , if this is gon na be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for our purposes .", "tgt": "problems: in any case , how different architectures can be implemented in javabayes and what modifications would be necessary for the purposes of this project also need to be investigated ."}
{"src": "um so far i 've thought of it as sort of adding it onto the modeler knowledge module . we talked about this several times that that the the input end is gon na need a fair amount of feedback from the planning end . so we talked about the fact that there 're going to be a certain number of decisions that you want the knowledge modeler to make , that will be then fed to the function module , that does uh , route planning .", "tgt": "abstract: the berkeley even deeper understanding group discussed plans and concerns regarding the architecture of smartkom , its proposed modules , and the types of interactions expected to take place between modules ."}
{"src": "and then that can be sort of developed uh as needed when we get enter the tourism domain . we probably wo n't do this early on , because the current focus is more on the decision making and stuff like that .", "tgt": "abstract: the meeting was largely focused on smartkom 's decision making capacity and how to adapt this functionality to the tourist information domain ."}
{"src": "so anyt we 'll find a time later in the week to uh get together and talk about your understanding of what smartkom plans are .", "tgt": "decisions: the group set a date for assessing smartkom plans ."}
{"src": "and they 're currently um agreeing or or in the process of agreeing on an x m l - ification of um something like a state - transition network of how dialogues would proceed .", "tgt": "decisions: it was decided that smartkom 's action plans should be represented in xml as a state transition network ."}
{"src": "it oughta be called a a dialogue manager .", "tgt": "decisions: it was proposed that the term 'dialogue planner ' should replace 'dialogue manager ' ."}
{"src": "no he 's completely gon na rewrite everything . in java . no , that 's gon na be phased out .", "tgt": "decisions: prolog will be phased out completely and replaced by java code ."}
{"src": "and this one of these planning modules comes along and says `` hey , right now we need to ask a question `` . so that forces the dialogue manager to change state .", "tgt": "decisions: the dialogue manager must be capable of changing states , i.e . go from being event driven to answering a question from a planning module ."}
{"src": "and and the the underlying idea of course is that there is something like kernel modules with kernel functionality that you can plug uh certain applications like tourist information or um the home scenario with uh controlling a vcr and so on . and keep these things like uh tourist information external . that 's an additional reason to have this well - defined interface so if you can do this , then the notion would be that across a very large range of domains , you could use this deep conceptual basis as the interface .", "tgt": "decisions: smartkom should feature a well defined core interface , with domain-specific information kept external ."}
{"src": "um it 's to to integrate and syntactic analysis . but but uh given th the constraints , that you want it to be small and fast and so forth , my guess is you 're probably into some kind of chunk parsing .", "tgt": "decisions: a syntactic analysis component that performs chunk parsing will be added to the system ."}
{"src": "you know th the functional module that that interacts with with where the tourism g stuff is going probably is too restrictive . um is based on slots that have to be filled and i 'm not sure if if complex slots of that type are really um being taken into consideration .", "tgt": "problems: as a functional module , the action planner is too restrictive for the tourist domain and requires complex slots from the dialogue manager ."}
{"src": "i think the the true key issues is how does the whatever comes out of the language input pipeline look like and then what the action planner does with it", "tgt": "problems: what form will the language input have , and what will the action planner do with it ?"}
{"src": "we talked about this several times that that the the input end is gon na need a fair amount of feedback from the planning end .", "tgt": "problems: links must be in place between the input end , action planner , parser , and language feedback components for communicating the current state of plan ."}
{"src": "yeah i think just the the spatial planner and the route planner so a printout of the communication between those two fills up i do n't know how many pages", "tgt": "problems: interactions in a deep map system between the spatial planner and the route planner are too convoluted ."}
{"src": "yeah , uh the problem is th that it has to be very fast and they also have to be very robust . cuz of um speech recognition errors but but uh given th the constraints , that you want it to be small and fast and so forth , my guess is you 're probably into some kind of chunk parsing . some extensions uh have to be made . for for a english version", "tgt": "problems: smartkom requires a fast and robust parser that includes language-specific extensions ."}
{"src": "but the other half of the problem is how would you get that kind of information from the parsed input ?", "tgt": "problems: which form of semantic construction grammar should be used , and how would such information be derived from the parsed input ?"}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: the translation of smartkom to english is in its final stages ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: the synthesis module will be the last one to do , after the english syntax trees are completed ."}
{"src": "right now it 's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes on on on on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything . we can even make a sort of an internal demo , um . well it was just amazing to to see uh how how instable the whole thing is ,", "tgt": "abstract: the system is still buggy and unstable , but it will soon be ready for a demonstration ."}
{"src": "n no , to just get the dem get the demos they need . so th the demo the demo requirements for this fall are sort of taken care of as of later this week or something .", "tgt": "abstract: this is the first of two working demos required for the project ."}
{"src": "but , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out .", "tgt": "abstract: further than that , there are no restrictions on the focus of the research or its possible applications ."}
{"src": "and so these issues about uh , reference , and spatial reference , discourse reference , uh - uh - uh - uh all this sort of stuff , uh , deixis which is part of what you were talking about , so we got ta do all this .", "tgt": "abstract: for example , issues like spatial descriptions could be investigated ."}
{"src": "on this scale , you have it either be ego or allocentric . so in addition to e ego and allocentric uh which appear all over the place , you also apparently have this proximal - distal thing which is very deeply uh embedded .", "tgt": "abstract: the variety of linguistic conventions seem to develop around an ego / allo-centric and a proximal / distal paradigm ."}
{"src": "by the way , there something that i did n't know until about a week ago or so , is apparently , there are separate brain areas for things within reach , and things that are out of reach .", "tgt": "abstract: the latter is also reflected in neuro-physiological data ."}
{"src": "so , i think as far as this group goes , um , it 's certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts .", "tgt": "abstract: from an engineering perspective , the belief-net for the ave task should be completed within a few weeks ."}
{"src": "and we went through this , and , i think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there .", "tgt": "abstract: the majority of the nodes are already there ."}
{"src": "ok ? what all you know , what are the considerations and how and what are the ways in which they relate .", "tgt": "abstract: this leaves the dependencies between them and the rules of computation to be set ."}
{"src": "so `` ok , we 're not using their system . that means we need our system . `` but to do that we 're gon na need to make some decisions like ontology , i does uh either the uh smartkom project or one of the projects at eml have something that we can just p pull out , for that .", "tgt": "abstract: since the whole system is going to be re-designed , there are major decisions to be taken regarding the parser and the ontology , as well as what can be re-used from past eml projects ."}
{"src": "so the idea is there 's this uh , other subgroup that 's worrying about formalizing the nota getting a notation .", "tgt": "abstract: in parallel , another team is working on formalisation and notation ."}
{"src": "oh there 's yet another one of the incoming first incoming first - year graduate students who 's expressed interest , and actually i talked today to a uh undergraduate who wants to do an honors thesis on this . and , while we 're at this level , uh , there 's at least one new doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project , either next week or the first of august , depending on the blandishments of microsoft .", "tgt": "abstract: finally , more ideas are expected to come from students and their research ."}
{"src": "so , c sh we could set that up as actually an institute wide thing ? well d we we do wan na have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of pipe in extra xml messages from left and right before you 're", "tgt": "decisions: the final english smartkom demo will be presented to the whole institute once the system is de-bugged and stabilised ."}
{"src": "so i 'd like to , for the summer turn into science mode . but , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out . uh . i mean there are a lot of issues , what 's the ontology look like , you know what do the constructions look like , what 's the execution engine look like ,", "tgt": "decisions: after the demo , the focus of research can switch towards purely scientific goals , including issues on ontology , deep semantic constructions , execution engines etc ."}
{"src": "so `` ok , we 're not using their system . that means we need our system . `` and so , uh , in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right , and the formalism and stuff , we 're actually gon na build something", "tgt": "decisions: moreover , a new system will be designed for the project and at least some parts of it should be built ."}
{"src": "cuz we 're we 're not only going the plan is not only to lay out this thing , but to actually uh build some of it . it looks like we 're now in a position that the construction analyzer that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyzer that nancy needs for the child language modeling .", "tgt": "decisions: similarly , the construction analyser should be a single , general tool working for both the tourist domain and child language modelling ."}
{"src": "and one of the things we need to do is the um , and this i think is relatively tight tightly constrained , is to finish up this belief - net stuff . so , i think as far as this group goes , um , it 's certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts .", "tgt": "decisions: the focus for the next meeting will be on the belief-net , of which a working demo should be complete in the next few weeks ."}
{"src": "so uh what we 're gon na do initially is is do design , and , i if you will , guess . but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise i think we 'll just design it .", "tgt": "decisions: since there are not enough data , its connections and weights will have to be designed ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: although javabayes has been the tool of choice until now , the possibility that hugin could be a better option should be investigated ."}
{"src": "and um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal `` group - ware `` server at eml , so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and and generating and constructions w we we sort of uh put it in there and they put what they do in there and maybe we can even um , get some overlap , get some synergy out of that .", "tgt": "decisions: in order to promote the collaboration with eml , the group-ware server there will be updated with all progress being made in the two sites ."}
{"src": "and so anyway we c uh we can m undoubtedly get ami uh to give a talk at uh eml or something like that . while he 's in in uh a lot of interest . actually , either place , dfki or uh", "tgt": "decisions: a talk on some of the issues will also be organised to take place at dfki ."}
{"src": "e the version that is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work .", "tgt": "problems: the german smartkom version available on the server does not work ."}
{"src": "right now it 's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes on on on on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything . because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition running with this s siemens virtual touch screen , which we do n't have here . but it 's working now , and i g i got the feeling that we are the only ones right now who have a running system . um . well it was just amazing to to see uh how how instable the whole thing is ,", "tgt": "problems: the english version , although still under development , does work , however , the system is still unstable as -apart from other reasons- it was initially built to work with a touch screen ."}
{"src": "well d we we do wan na have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of pipe in extra xml messages from left and right before you 're", "tgt": "problems: de-bugging and cleaning up has to take place before any new modules are added on it ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: as regards the belief-net , no connections and dependencies have been built into it ."}
{"src": "so uh what we 're gon na do initially is is do design , and , i if you will , guess . but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise i think we 'll just design it .", "tgt": "problems: these will have to be guessed instead of learnt through data , as not enough data is available for such a task ."}
{"src": "javabayes does not support that . i i also s would suggest not to d spend two weeks in in in changing the the javabayes code .", "tgt": "problems: finally , it has been noted that the javabayes gui does not satisfy all the presentation requirements for this belief-net and modifying the underlying code would be too time-consuming ."}
{"src": "uh one of them is to work on the semantics of the belief - net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi the system uh making decisions . and we 're also , sort of uh in the same process , going to work with fey on what there should be in the dialogues .", "tgt": "abstract: the main focus of the meeting was firstly on the structure of the belief-net , its decision nodes and the parameters that influence them , and secondly , on the design of the data collection tasks ."}
{"src": "and um and fey has some thirty subjects lined up ? so we yeah we do n't know how many we can get next door at the uh shelter for example .", "tgt": "abstract: for the latter , there are already 30 subjects lined up and more are expected to be recruited off campus ."}
{"src": "and um and then they gon na have to f um um choose from one of these tasks , which are listed here . so if if it 's one service , one luxury item , you know , one big - ish place , and so forth and so on , um then my guess is that that the data is going to be easier to handle . that w maybe one thing we should do is go through this list and sort of select things that are categories and then o offer only one member of that category ?", "tgt": "abstract: it was agreed that making subjects select from categories of tasks , such as `` big place '' , `` service '' , etc . could provide a better range of data ."}
{"src": "i b my guess is it 's gon na be ten .", "tgt": "abstract: the duration of each dialogue will probably be no more than 10 minutes ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: on the other hand , the organisation of the intermediate nodes of the belief-net and their properties is almost complete , although no conditional probabilities have been inserted yet ."}
{"src": "and decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices for calls on other modules .", "tgt": "abstract: these nodes represent decisions that will function as parameters to action calls in the system ."}
{"src": "and that we can actually infer them to a significant de degree , or we ask . or eh so , y but there 's th but definitely a back - off position to asking .", "tgt": "abstract: their values will either be inferred from the user-system interaction , or -as a last resort- requested directly from the user ."}
{"src": "ok , because uh we do wan na get them r u perfectly but i think we 're gon na have to do a first cut at a lot of them to see how they interact .", "tgt": "abstract: finally , as to the semantic and syntactic constructions , work will start with more general and brief descriptions , before moving to exhaustive analysis of at least a subset ."}
{"src": "we are expecting johno to build a parser , uh he 's g he 's hoping to do this for his masters ' thesis s by a year from now . uh limited . well , the hope is that the parser itself is , uh , pretty robust .", "tgt": "abstract: similarly , the construction parser that is to be built within a year is expected to be relatively basic , yet robust ."}
{"src": "maybe i suggest we make some fine tuning of these , get sort of run through ten or so subjects um but anyway yeah , so i think it 's a good idea to start with the sort of relatively straight forward res just response system .", "tgt": "decisions: as the data collection is ready to start , it was agreed that for the first ten subjects the interaction with the system / instructor will be along the lines of a basic response system ."}
{"src": "and um and then they gon na have to f um um choose from one of these tasks , which are listed here . that w maybe one thing we should do is go through this list and sort of select things that are categories and then o offer only one member of that category ? like at you know , `` attend a theater , symphony or opera `` is is a group , and `` tour the university , castle or zoo `` ,", "tgt": "decisions: tasks will be divided in categories ( `` tour '' , `` attend '' etc ) and subjects are going to be asked to choose no more than one task out of each category ."}
{"src": "so trying to im um implant the intention of going to a place now , going to a place later on the same tour , and see whether we wan na make it more complex or not , depending on what what sort of results we 're getting . um i i would say maybe two weeks . let 's plan next monday , ok , to have a review of what we have so far . this means audio , but but it would be great if you could , um , not transcribe it all , but pick out uh , some stuff . and then if we want to uh get them to start doing uh multiple step planning with a whole bunch of things and then organize them tell them which things are near each other and we 're gon na start thinking a about uh what constructions we want to elicit .", "tgt": "decisions: this first run will probably take a couple of weeks , but the first results ( audio files and selected highlights ) will be discussed shortly , in order to decide whether more detail ( complex spatial relationships , temporal planning etc ) should be included in the design or particular constructions be elicited ."}
{"src": "see this this this uh ontology node is probably something that i will try to expand . and hopefully you can sort of also try to find out , you know , sooner or later in the course of the summer what we can expect to get from the discourse that might , you know or the", "tgt": "decisions: regarding the completion of the belief-net , the remaining details , mainly the properties of the ontology and discourse nodes , should be added ."}
{"src": "uh robert and eva and bhaskara are gon na actually build a belief - net that that , um , has cpt 's and , you know , tries to infer this from various kinds of information .", "tgt": "decisions: after building in the conditional probability tables , a working prototype of the net will be ready ."}
{"src": "ok , because uh we do wan na get them r u perfectly but i think we 're gon na have to do a first cut at a lot of them to see how they interact .", "tgt": "decisions: finally , the initial work on constructions should focus on a general overview of the dialogues with brief descriptions ."}
{"src": "whatever you need in order to uh , be able to then , uh , by hand , you know , explain , some fraction of the utterances .", "tgt": "decisions: further analysis will follow from there in a top-down fashion ."}
{"src": "so there 's a lot of things where we have no analogous tasks , and that may or may not be a problem .", "tgt": "problems: although there is an effort to include some of the key features of the belief-net in the design of the data gathering , not all of them can be built in ."}
{"src": "and these are the data tasks where w we can assume the person would like to enter , view or just approach the thing . now of course you have this i guess possible danger that somehow there 're certain constructions that people use uh when talking about a museum that they would n't talk about with a university and stuff ,", "tgt": "problems: the tasks that the subjects will have to carry out will be categorised in ways that will indicate eva intentions , however , this approach may limit the variety of possible constructions used within a single category of entities ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: on the other hand , generating more diverse dialogues may have an adverse effect from a speech recognition perspective ."}
{"src": "and um we 're still l looking for a room on the sixth floor because they stole away that conference room . um behind our backs . david and and jane and and lila are working on that as we speak .", "tgt": "problems: a minor problem has arisen with the laboratory where recordings are supposed to take place , but this is currently being sorted out ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: as regards the completion of the belief-net , no work has been done on the cpt 's yet ."}
{"src": "and i i me it would it would be completely out of the question to really do more than , say , like , oh i do n't know , ten , over the summer ,", "tgt": "problems: finally , it was noted that although a general overview of the pertinent constructions is attainable , no more than ten of them can be analysed in detail with the summer months ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: the focus of the meeting was on a presentation of the work done already on the building of the bayes-net ."}
{"src": "that 's basically just specifying the the input for the w what 's it 's based on things like , uh , there 's gon na be a node for go - there or not , and there 's gon na be a node for enter , view , approach .", "tgt": "abstract: the input layer deriving information from things like the user and situation models , feeds into a set of decision nodes , such as the enter / view / approach ( eva ) endpoint ."}
{"src": "and some some things will always be sort of too not significant enough .", "tgt": "abstract: in any particular situation , most of the outputs will not be relevant to the given context ."}
{"src": "cuz , that 's what i mean , in the bayes - net you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node .", "tgt": "abstract: therefore , they will either have to be pruned a posteriori , or only a subset of the possible decision nodes will be computed in each occasion ."}
{"src": "i mean , maybe it does make a difference in terms of performance , computational time . so basically , you 'd have a decision tree query , go - there . and just basically do a binary search through the ?", "tgt": "abstract: the latter option could could follow a binary search-tree approach and it could also be better in computational terms ."}
{"src": "you wo n't it 'll be hard to decide .", "tgt": "abstract: in any case , on what basis the `` winner '' output is chosen is not clear ."}
{"src": "and for the where - is construction , we know we need to l look at this node , that merges these three things together so my i so , if we were to it with a bayes - net , we 'd have to have a node for every question that we knew how to deal with , every construction .", "tgt": "abstract: one suggestion was discussed: the particular constructions used can determine the pertinent decision ( output ) nodes ."}
{"src": "and , um , finish up this bayes - net . and we present our results ,", "tgt": "abstract: the complete prototype of the bayes-net will be presented in the next meeting ."}
{"src": "ok . because then , once we have it sort of up and running , then we can start you know , defining the interfaces and then hook it up to some fake construction parser", "tgt": "abstract: after that , it will be possible to define interfaces and a dummy construction parser , in order to test and link modules together ."}
{"src": "every construction .", "tgt": "decisions: the suggestion that the most appropriate decision node of the belief-net in each situation could be chosen as a function of what construction was used , was deemed unsuitable at this stage ."}
{"src": "because there are interdependencies ,", "tgt": "decisions: there are many interdependencies between the output nodes that this approach could not take into account ."}
{"src": "sometime this week again and finish up the , uh , values of this .", "tgt": "decisions: the rest of the values for the bayes-net nodes will be built in within the week ."}
{"src": "and , um , finish up this bayes - net . and we present our results ,", "tgt": "decisions: the finished prototype will be presented during the next meeting ."}
{"src": "as , if i understand it correctly , it always gives you all the posterior probabilities for all the values of all decision nodes . so , it n i mean a all i 'm saying is , whatever our input is , we 're always gon na get the full output . what what what i am thinking , or what we 're about to propose here is we 're always gon na get the whole list of values and their posterior probabilities . cuz , that 's what i mean , in the bayes - net you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node .", "tgt": "problems: any set of inputs will provide either the whole range of output values of the bayes-net or an a priori selection of those outputs ."}
{"src": "and the question is what to do with it , and now we need an expert system or belief - net or something that interprets that , well , eventually , you still have to pick out which ones you look at .", "tgt": "problems: in both cases , what is needed is a way to single out the appropriate outputs for any given context ."}
{"src": "so the person said , um , `` where is x ? `` we want to know , um , is does he want info ? or does he want to go there ?", "tgt": "problems: for example , in the case of a `` where is '' question , whether the prevalent output should be `` go-there '' or `` info-on '' or even a third option has to be computed somehow ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: in any case , there are many input values that have not been entered in the bayes-net at this stage ."}
{"src": "yeah , i can worry about the ontology interface and you can keith can worry about the discourse .", "tgt": "problems: furthermore , no inputs for the ontology and discourse can be built in yet , as they involve research that will be carried out in the future ."}
{"src": "also , i 'm somewhat boggled by that hugin software . i ca n't figure out how to get the probabilities into it .", "tgt": "problems: finally , there has been a problem with adding probabilities in a net created with the hugin software , but this should be overcome very shortly ."}
{"src": "and the other bit of news is we had you know , uh , i was visited by my german project manager and he came up we came up with a pretty strange idea . it should be possible to make that system produce questions .", "tgt": "abstract: an idea for future work was suggested during the visit of the german project manager: the possibility to use the same system for language generation ."}
{"src": "but maybe one could do some learning .", "tgt": "abstract: having a system able to ask questions could contribute significantly to training the belief-net ."}
{"src": "the basic idea i guess would be to give allow the system to have intentions , basically ? well you can observe some user and context stuff and ask , what 's the posterior probabilities of all of our decision nodes .", "tgt": "abstract: setting up certain inputs in the bayes-net would imply certain intentions , which would trigger dialogues ."}
{"src": "i mean we just i mean it would n't hurt to write up a paper , well , i i also think that if we sort of write about what we have done in the past six months , we we we could sort of craft a nice little paper that if it gets rejected , which could happen , does n't hurt and then we can say , uh well what we do is this .", "tgt": "abstract: there is potential to make a conference paper out of presenting the current work and the project aspirations within a parsing paradigm ."}
{"src": "so this will be sort of documenting what we think , and documenting what we have in terms of the bayes - net stuff . well , in the moment it 's a bayes - net . and it has sort of fifty not - yet - specified interfaces .", "tgt": "abstract: the focus should be the bayes-net , to which all other modules interface ."}
{"src": "the sudo - square is , `` situation `` , `` user `` , `` discourse `` , right ? `` ontology `` .", "tgt": "abstract: situation , user , discourse and ontology feed into the net to infer user intentions ."}
{"src": "and johno coming up with the idea that if the person discussed the discussed the admission fee , in eh previously , that might be a good indication that , `` how do i get to the castle ? `` , actually he wants to enter .", "tgt": "abstract: someone asking where the castle is after having asked about the admission fee , indicates that -given that the castle is open to tourists- they want to go there , as opposed to knowing its whereabouts ."}
{"src": "and specify um , what what we think the the output uh , observe , out i input nodes for our bayes - nets for the sub sub - d , for the discourse bit , should be . so we want to sort of come up with what gets uh , input , and how inter in case of a `` where is `` question . so that we actually end up with um , um , nodes for the discourse and ontology so that we can put them into our bayes - net ,", "tgt": "abstract: it was suggested that they start analysing what the discourse and ontology would give as inputs to the bayes-net by working on simple utterances like `` where is x ? `` ."}
{"src": "and we can run our better javabayes , and have it produce some output .", "tgt": "abstract: with this addition , all input layers of the net would be functioning ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: although this function would be limited , it would allow for the bayes-net to be tested in its entirety and , henceforth , extended ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: the possibility of incorporating language generation into the system will have to be discussed further ."}
{"src": "look at the web page and let 's talk about it maybe tomorrow afternoon ?", "tgt": "decisions: similarly , as no one could recall some of the points of the conference call , the group will have to meet again and define the exact structure and content of the paper they are going to submit ."}
{"src": "so this will be sort of documenting what we think , and documenting what we have in terms of the bayes - net stuff .", "tgt": "decisions: the bayes-net is going to be the focus of the presentation ."}
{"src": "and specify um , what what we think the the output uh , observe , out i input nodes for our bayes - nets for the sub sub - d , for the discourse bit , should be . so we want to sort of come up with what gets uh , input , and how inter in case of a `` where is `` question . so that we actually end up with um , um , nodes for the discourse and ontology", "tgt": "decisions: in order to complete a functioning prototype of the belief-net , it was decided to start expanding the ontology and discourse nodes by working with a simple construction , like `` where is x ? `` ."}
{"src": "wait , so do , or do not take other kinds of constructions into account ? well , if you if you can , oh definitely do ,", "tgt": "decisions: a robust analysis of such a basic utterance will indicate what the limits of the information derived from the construction are , as well as ways to design the whole module and fit other constructions in ."}
{"src": "e i 'm sort of have the impression that getting it to say the right thing in the right circumstances is much more difficult than getting it to understand something given the circumstances and so on , it 's not the same as the understanding .", "tgt": "problems: the idea to create a language generation module for the system , along with the language understanding , was met with interest , although it was made clear that generation is not just the inverse of understanding ."}
{"src": "just the fact that we 'll get the point is that getting it to understand one construction does n't mean that it will n always know exactly when it 's correct to use that construction . right ?", "tgt": "problems: understanding what a construction entails does not mean the system can use the construction in all appropriate circumstances ."}
{"src": "but maybe one could do some learning . yeah , it 's g anyway , the point is that given all of these different factors , it 's uh e it 's it 's still going to be impossible to run through all of the possible situations or whatever .", "tgt": "problems: a dialogue producing system would be useful for training the system further , even though the number of input permutations could render the process computationally unwieldy ."}
{"src": "i mean , it 's obvious that we ca n't do any kind of evaluation ,", "tgt": "problems: regarding the conference paper , it was noted that at this stage they have not completed any big parts of the system and there is no evaluation ."}
{"src": "like introducing the formalism might be not really possible in detail ,", "tgt": "problems: similarly , the length of the paper would not allow for presentation of the formalism in detail ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: the focus would have to be on cognitive motivations of the research , and not on system design , anyway ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: such motivations also apply to the belief-net: there are various direct or indirect ways to link features of the ontology or discourse with specific intentions ."}
{"src": "but normal statements that seem completely unambiguous , such as `` where is the blah - blah `` , actually are terribly complex , and completely ambiguous .", "tgt": "problems: the originating observation behind the whole project is that utterances like `` where is x ? '' are seemingly unambiguous , but , in context , they can acquire much more complex interpretations ."}
{"src": "and eva is using the xalan style sheet processor to convert the xml that 's output by the java bayes for the into the , uh , e bayes input .", "tgt": "abstract: minor technical issues , such as format conversions for xml and javabayes and the full translation of the smartkom generation module in english , are currently being resolved ."}
{"src": "yep . we ha we have to change the voice .", "tgt": "abstract: the voice synthesiser will also be replaced by better technology ."}
{"src": "uh , w which is mental spaces and uh and - or but the other part of it is the way they connect to these , uh , probabilistic relational models .", "tgt": "abstract: an important research issue to be investigated is how the concept of mental spaces and probabilistic relational models can be integrated into the belief-net ."}
{"src": "so there probably are some , uh , relatively clean rules , is that people do manage to do this", "tgt": "abstract: mental space interdependencies are based on relatively clean rules , since people seem to manage them easily ."}
{"src": "no , i know , i th i i think that is gon na be sort of the key to this wh to th the big project of the summer of of getting the constructions right", "tgt": "abstract: a step towards this goal is the construction formalism being put together ."}
{"src": "which is the issue of , um , how do you simulate questions ? we did n't we never did figure out how we were gon na do emphasis in in uh , the semspec . incl including the questions uh , no , all the focus stuff . and we 'll figure out exactly how to write that up and so on ,", "tgt": "abstract: this module will eventually have to include ways to simulate questions , do emphasis and focus ."}
{"src": "the question of whether the polysemy is sort of like in the construction or pragmatic . well the question is basically , is this conventional or conversational implicature ?", "tgt": "abstract: the constructions could be built assuming either conventional or conversational implicature ."}
{"src": "w we know for sure that we have to be able to do both . i mean it th i can thi i can think of arguments in either direction on that .", "tgt": "abstract: at this stage both routes need to be examined ."}
{"src": "right . so . right . so thing that 's part of why we want the formalism ,", "tgt": "abstract: the formalism will also serve as a starting point for the definition of construal mechanisms ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: similarly , issues like time plans and discourse stacks are dependent on how the ontology and discourse history are going to be structured and linked ."}
{"src": "priming a spreading activation", "tgt": "abstract: one suggestion was to use the spreading activation as a paradigm for activating nodes in the belief-net ."}
{"src": "which uh , so far , in terms of like putting up all the constraints as , you know , pushing them into type constraints , the when i 've , you know , propo then proposed it to linguists who have n't yet given me you know , we have n't yet thought of a reason that that would n't work . right ? as long as we allow our type constraints to be reasonably complex .", "tgt": "abstract: finally , using type constraints in the construction analysis should work , as long as they are complex enough not to generate too many parses ."}
{"src": "actually , maybe i could try , like , emailing the guy and see if he has any something already .", "tgt": "decisions: it is necessary to ask the javabayes programmer whether he already has xml conversion programs ."}
{"src": "so i just need to do the , uh write a new set of tree combining rules . and fey has foolheartedly agreed to rewrite uh , the german concept uh syntax - to - prosody rules", "tgt": "decisions: for the smartkom generation module , all the syntax-to-prosody rules are going to be re-written for english ."}
{"src": "ogi has , uh , crafted a couple of diphone type voices that are really nice", "tgt": "decisions: additionally , ogi can offer a range of synthesiser voices to choose from ."}
{"src": "anyway , uh , that we were that we 're gon na try to get a uh , first cut at the revised formalism by the end of next week . so the idea is on monday at two we 'll we 'll see an intermediate version of the formalism for the constructions ,", "tgt": "decisions: the focus of the next meeting , whose time was rescheduled , will be the discussion of the revised construction formalism ."}
{"src": "uh , just trying to write up essentially what what you guys have worked out so that everybody has something to look at . yeah . well , if if i mean , i part of of what the exercise is , t by the end of next week , is to say what are the things that we just do n't have answers for yet .", "tgt": "decisions: the presentation will unify the existing ideas and help identify the areas in need of further work , such as how it can deal with time and tense use and how they affect inferences in belief-nets ."}
{"src": "the question of whether the polysemy is sort of like in the construction or pragmatic . well the question is basically , is this conventional or conversational implicature ? w we know for sure that we have to be able to do both . i mean it th i can thi i can think of arguments in either direction on that .", "tgt": "decisions: the ambiguity in a `` where is x ? '' construction can be coded in the formalism as a semantic feature or pushed forward to the belief-net where pragmatic features will disambiguate it: in terms of system design , both options need to be investigated at this stage ."}
{"src": "that 's the lisp - type scheme . well , i guess if you 're not used to functional programming , scheme can be completely incomprehensible .", "tgt": "problems: as the translation of the german smartkom into english moves on , the generation rules may prove difficult to tackle for someone without experience in functional programming , as they are written in lisp ."}
{"src": "one of the things i w would like to do over the next , uh , month , it may take more , is to st understand to what extent we can not only figure out the constructions for them for multiple worlds uh sort of what the formalism will look like and where the slots and fillers will be , but also what that would translate into in terms of belief - net and the inferences . one is the linguistic part of what are the couplings and and when you have a certain , uh , construction , that implies certain couplings and other couplings , and then we have this inference problem of exactly technically how does the belief - net work", "tgt": "problems: as far as the construction analysis is concerned , the two problems that will need to be solved are to identify the couplings between constructions in different mental spaces and to define how inferences will work in the belief-net from a technical point of view ."}
{"src": "the question of whether the polysemy is sort of like in the construction or pragmatic . the question is whether the construction is semantic or like ambiguous between asking for location and asking for path . well the question is basically , is this conventional or conversational implicature ? i mean it th i can thi i can think of arguments in either direction on that .", "tgt": "problems: additionally , in the example `` where is x ? '' construction , the ambiguity ( location or path ) could be coded either in the semantics of the construction or as if determined by context ."}
{"src": "so i a i i th i agree with you that , um , it 's a disaster to try to make separate constructions for every uh , pragmatic reading ,", "tgt": "problems: the former could mean creating a different construction for every slight pragmatic variation ."}
{"src": "although there are some that will need to be there . so you could just as well tag the lexical construction with the fact that it 's a uh , you know , thirty percent increase in probability of entering .", "tgt": "problems: on the other hand , some of the belief-net probabilities could be instantiated in the lexicon ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: specifying which approach to take when linking the ontology and the discourse history has also proven not to be straightforward ."}
{"src": "uh , this is this is , speaking of hard problems , this is a very good time um , to start trying to make explicit where construal comes in and you know , where c where the construction per - se ends and where construal comes in ,", "tgt": "problems: finally , it is still undecided where construal comes in , which would help delimit the constructions as well ."}
{"src": "and so one on one side is on one side is a sort of the revised sort of updated semantic specification . and the other side is , um , sort of a revised construction formalism .", "tgt": "abstract: the discussion concerned the revised semantic specification and the construction formalism ."}
{"src": "so they could all have a type at the beginning . ok , and then again semantic constraints here are just are just bindings .", "tgt": "abstract: the different levels of the latter focus on what construction types are encountered and what bindings there are between them ."}
{"src": "but , you know , we have the properties of dependency grammars and some properties of constituents constituent - based grammar .", "tgt": "abstract: the notation maintains properties of both dependency and constituent-based grammars ."}
{"src": "i think that 's still in progress . other things we did n't totally deal with , um , well , we 've had a lot of other stuff that keith and i have them working on in terms of like how you deal with like an adjective . you know , a a nominal expression .", "tgt": "abstract: the encoding of features is still incomplete: frame profiles , focus , adjectives , nominal expressions are phenomena in the process of being integrated ."}
{"src": "so there 's going to be some extra you know , definitely other notation we 'll need for that which we skip for now .", "tgt": "abstract: similarly , ways to handle mental spaces will have to be added on top ."}
{"src": "so you see it 's `` scenario `` , `` referent `` and `` discourse segment `` . the `` scenario `` box ,", "tgt": "abstract: on the other hand , the semantic specification structures information in terms of `` scenario '' , `` referent '' and `` discourse segment '' ."}
{"src": "and actually it 's just a list of various slots from which you would draw draw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ?", "tgt": "abstract: each category comprises a number of slots filled in by information derived from the utterance ."}
{"src": "which is made up entirely of these things and , uh , bindings among them . and bindings to ontology items . so that that the who that this is the tool kit under whi out of which you can make a semantic specification . so this is an that anything you have , in the party line , anything you have as the semantic side of constructions comes , from pieces of this ignoring li but it 's got to be pieces of this along with constraints among them .", "tgt": "abstract: it is , essentially , a toolkit with which to create semantic constructions , as well as the bindings between them and with the ontology ."}
{"src": "yeah , but you do n't we ultimately want to handle that analogously to the way we handle time and place , um , we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces so that pulling something out of a discourse context is i think similar to other kinds of , uh , mental space phenomena .", "tgt": "abstract: among the issues still being defined , mental spaces and context ( eg pronoun references ) present similarities that can be echoed in the specification ."}

{"src": "is this , uh was it intentional to leave off things like `` inherits `` i did n't want to think too much about that for for now . can we make it more elegant ? ``", "tgt": "decisions: on the other hand , it was decided for the inheritance between constructions to be left out for now , as the notation can be rendered more elegant later on ."}
{"src": "um , imagine you you write a bayes - net , um , completely from scratch every time you do construal . but the question is do you want to , for example , send the little group , uh , a draft of your thesis proposal we can do it th - thursday again .", "tgt": "decisions: finally , a preliminary presentation on the idea of how to use bayes-nets for construal will take place in the next meeting ."}
{"src": "and so it was an issue whether constraints um , there were some linguists who reacted against `` constraints `` , saying , `` oh , if it 's not used for matching , then it should n't be called a constraint `` . the whole the mental space thing is clearly not here .", "tgt": "problems: the construction formalism is not yet complete as to the semantic constraints -the terminology has also been met with objections- and does not deal with mental spaces ."}
{"src": "you know , um , basically all of these so - called space builders that are in the sentence are going to sort of assuming that at any point in discourse there 's the possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different world scenarios , whatever , and the speaker 's supposed to be keeping track of those . the , um the construction that you actually get is just gon na sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you 've already got going , um , you 're supposed to add structure to . but it does n't tell you like exactly what it what the point of doing so is .", "tgt": "problems: on their own , constructions can only give limited information regarding mental spaces: forms can provide cues to create a different mental space , but the semantic nuances are defined by context ."}

{"src": "ok , it 's like uh , it 's not it might be that there 's a syntactic , uh , device that you use to indicate focus uh , so so i think that 's kind of nice to keep `` focus `` being an information structure term . i think that 's still in progress . but it did one one implication it does f have for the other side , which we 'll get to in a minute is that i could n't think of a good way to say `` here are the possible things that you could focus on `` , but i i ca n't think of like the limited set of possible meanings that you would that you would focu maybe you want to forget stress . canonically speaking you can if you look at a a curve over sentence , you can find out where a certain stress is and say , `` hey , that 's my focus exponent . `` it does n't tell you anything what the focus is .", "tgt": "problems: other issues concern focus and stress: focus is seen as an information structure device , but there has been no suggestion as to how to predict its effects or break it down in possible focused elements ; as to stress , it may not be useful as a form value , as it shows the focus exponent , but not what the focus is on ."}
{"src": "except for `` cause `` , that i forgot . causal stuff we absolutely need . mental space we need . and and so we 're , uh gon na have to , um , chain those as well . it 's as far as i can tell there 's this one major thing we have to do which is the mental the whole s mental space thing .", "tgt": "problems: moving to the semantic specification , the analysis still needs mechanisms to deal with causality , as well as mental spaces and bindings between them ."}

{"src": "i sorta constructed a couple of classes . the red lines on the , um , graph are the um , relations between the different um , classes . this is more or less similar to the flat bayes - net that i have , you know , with the input nodes and all that .", "tgt": "abstract: an alternative representation of the bayes-net , it depicts context features as classes , and dependencies as relations between them ."}
{"src": "ok . so it only makes two decisions , in this model . and one is basically how desirable a site is and the other is the mode of the visit , whether th it 's the eva decision .", "tgt": "abstract: the current outputs show the desirability of a site , as well as its eva mode ."}

{"src": "she 's actually suggested to look um , at the psychology department students , because they have to partake in two experiments in order to fulfill some requirements .", "tgt": "decisions: subjects can be recruited from within the psychology department students , since such participation in experiments is compulsory in their syllabus ."}
{"src": "uh , so one of the things that eva 's gon na do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down .", "tgt": "decisions: as the work on creating a prm for the system has progressed , it is now necessary to find an implementation that can work as a prm interpreter ."}
{"src": "uh , we are n't gon na build our own interpreter , the people at stanford write papers as if they had one ,", "tgt": "decisions: there are no plans to build one from scratch , but it seems that other research groups at stanford may already have one ."}
{"src": "and supposedly , um , we 'll actually get s deep seriously connected to to their work somebody 'll uh , you know if it 's a group meeting once a week probably someone 'll go down and , whatever .", "tgt": "decisions: moreover , closer collaboration with the local prm group will be pursued with additional participation in their meetings ."}
{"src": "and it turns out , you know , the cpt 's are really big , if i do that ,", "tgt": "problems: an early version of the prm of the system presented the same problem as a flat bayes-net: the cpt 's become too large ."}
{"src": "but i do n't remember reading how you specify i remember them learning when , you know , you do n't know the structure for sure ,", "tgt": "problems: another prm issue that arose and remained unclear was how the probabilities are specified ( instead of learnt ) on the actual relations between the classes ."}
{"src": "the you you did n't look at all yet to see if there 's anybody has a implementation . so w anyway . so that 's a a major open issue .", "tgt": "problems: furthermore , the lack of a prm interpreter is an open issue ."}
{"src": "uh , we are n't gon na build our own interpreter , uh , so one of the things that eva 's gon na do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down .", "tgt": "problems: it is not within the remit of the project to build one from scratch , therefore , an existing implementation has to be found ."}
{"src": "now , what i plan to do is i want to uh sort of do a uh uh try to improve the quality of the search results ,", "tgt": "problems: on the other hand , the discussion about the smart tutoring system being built at the international university showed the importance of finding out which context parameters are influential in a given domain ."}
{"src": "now , the big problem that i 'm facing right now is um , it 's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly , that that works in the small domain , but the problem is obviously the scalability . cuz it 's it 's very easy to whip up something quickly ,", "tgt": "problems: it is easy to hack up a system for a small domain , but making it scalable is much more difficult ."}
{"src": "as for smartkom , i 'm the last smartkom meeting i mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis ,", "tgt": "problems: finally , there was a passing mention of problems encountered with the speech synthesis module of smartkom ."}
{"src": "topic of this meeting is i wan na talk a little bit about transcription . so , well w shall we move on and talk a little bit about transcription then ? is and so one of the things was to get an estimate of how long it would take , and then also what tools we would use . and so the next decision which has to be made actually pretty soon is how are we gon na do it ? i mean , i looked at cyber transcriber", "tgt": "abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed the aims , methods , timing , and outsourcing issues concerning transcription of the meeting recorder corpus ."}
{"src": "what we 're using right now is a tool , um , from this french group , called `` transcriber `` so as far as i 'm concerned those transcription conventions are fixed right now . and but so in terms of the con the conventions , then , uh , basically , uh , it 's strictly orthographic so i have i have a convention of putting like a dash arrow just to indicate that this person 's utterance continues .", "tgt": "abstract: the transcriber software tool was introduced , along with a set of transcription conventions for coding different speech events ."}
{"src": "these are linguistics grad students . but we can pay a graduate student seven dollars an hour .", "tgt": "abstract: the prospect of sending the data to an external transcription service was weighed against that of hiring a graduate student transcriber pool ."}
{"src": "so that means that even if it takes them thirty times real time it 's cheaper to to do graduate students . i mean , that 's why i said originally , that i could n't imagine sending it out 's gon na be cheaper .", "tgt": "abstract: it was tentatively decided that the latter option would be less costly and allow bmr to maintain greater control over the transcription process ."}
{"src": "maybe we should s consider also , um , starting to build up a web site around all of these things .", "tgt": "abstract: methods for distributing the data were briefly discussed , along with an initiative for creating a bmr project website ."}
{"src": "and then get an update on the electronics , um , let 's move on to electronics .", "tgt": "abstract: the group received an update on the meeting room recording setup and electronics ."}
{"src": "cuz they 're distributing it through the ldc . maybe we should maybe we should get a copy of it just to see what they did so so that we can we can compare . csae . corpus of spoken american english .", "tgt": "decisions: the group will obtain a copy of the corpus of spoken american english ( csae ) from the ldc to compare the methods and conventions used by uc santa barbara with those being considered for the meeting recorder project ."}
{"src": "so i mean , i 've been sort of playing with , uh , different ways of mar cuz i 'm thinking , you know , i mean , if you could get optimal instructions you could cut back on the number of hours it would take . so i think though it 's a good proposal to be used on a new a new batch of text that i have n't yet done yet in the same meeting . could use it on the next segment of the text . i could generate the segmentation and and you could do the words , and time yourself on it .", "tgt": "decisions: speakers fe008 and me011 will experiment with pre-segmentation procedures in hopes of facilitating the transcription process ."}
{"src": "so what we wanted to do was have jane do basically one meeting 's worth , you know , forty minutes to an hour ,", "tgt": "decisions: speaker fe008 will perform the transcription for one meeting ( 40-60 minutes of data ) as a pilot project ."}
{"src": "i hope it 's jane . yeah , no , that i i would be interested in that in becoming involved in the project in some aspect like that", "tgt": "decisions: a tentative decision was made to put speaker fe008 in charge of the in-house transcription effort ."}
{"src": "we could program that pretty easily , are are those d delays adjustable ? could you get it so that with so it would it would detect volume on a channel and insert a marker ? sure . so if we want if we did if we did something like programmed in a delay , which actually i think is a great idea , um , i 'm sure they would want that incorporated back in . and i said , well , maybe . and they have they 've actually asked if we are willing to do any development well , so anyway , are we interested then in writing tools to try to generate any of this stuff automatically ?", "tgt": "decisions: modifications to the transcriber source code , e.g . adjusting the delay between the audio play function and the inputting of time boundaries , may be undertaken by the bmr group ."}
{"src": "maybe we should s consider also , um , starting to build up a web site around all of these things . i think mostly internal . we could do an ht access which would accommodate those things .", "tgt": "decisions: an initiative for creating an internal bmr project website was discussed , along with ideas for providing web access to external organizations , such as the university of washington ."}
{"src": "well i can build a cabinet .", "tgt": "decisions: a cabinet will be built to house wires and other electronic equipment used in the recording setup ."}
{"src": "which is to say just laptop with a wireless . so we certainly could use that as as a constant reminder of what the vu meters are doing .", "tgt": "decisions: a laptop and wireless modem will be avaiable to participants for monitoring the recording progress ."}
{"src": "and and so how we do we distribute the transcripts , how do we distribute the audio files , but but so should we do it in the same format as ldc", "tgt": "problems: how should transcripts and corresponding audio files be formatted and distributed ?"}
{"src": "they 're never gon na be able to do a meeting like this . and so so what i 'm saying is that if we hire an external service i think we can expect three hundred dollars an hour . who knows if they 're gon na be able to m manage multal multiple channel data ? they wo n't . i mean , that 's why i said originally , that i could n't imagine sending it out 's gon na be cheaper .", "tgt": "problems: external transcription services are expensive , difficult to monitor , and are unlikely to be able to handle multi-channel data ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: it is unclear which levels of transcription should be encoded ."}
{"src": "there 's some interesting human factors problems like , yeah , what span of of time is it useful to segment the thing into in order to uh , transcribe it the most quickly .", "tgt": "problems: what size of segment is most useful for doing transcriptions ?"}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: which level of segmentation is most suitable for the aims of the project ?"}
{"src": "um , the user interface only allows two . and so if if you 're using their interface to specify overlapping speakers you can only do two . it 's just there 's no user interface for specifying multiple any more than two .", "tgt": "problems: transcriber 's interface only allows the user to view two overlapping speakers ."}

{"src": "um , so um the one th one thing i know that we have on that is uh we had talked a a couple weeks before um uh about the uh the stuff you were doing with with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events , but anyway some some potential collaboration there about about the about the working with these data . um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of you know , relating to his to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures , so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours he 's interested in these these knowledge structures , inferences that you draw i from to to find a a good solution to detect eh , the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded . but you have you have time uh , uh marked twelve minute the the the um overlaps in twelve minutes of it . like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data ,", "tgt": "abstract: topics discussed by the berkeley meeting recorder group included a potential collaboration with another icsi member regarding the analysis of inference structures , efforts by speaker mn005 to detect speaker overlap , the current status on recordings and transcriptions , and future efforts to collect meeting data ."}
{"src": "but there 's at least one meeting recorded of uh the uh uh natural language guys . uh , we 've started having a morning meeting , today uh i starting a w a week or two ago , on the uh front - end issues , and we 're recording those , uh there 's a network services and applications group here who 's agreed to have their meetings recorded , if anyone knows of one more m or two more wee meetings per week that happen at icsi , um that we could record , i think it would be worth it .", "tgt": "abstract: in addition to weekly meetings by the bmr group , efforts are in progress to record meetings by other icsi research groups , as well as routine discussions by non-icsi members ."}
{"src": "so , we need to talk about this later .", "tgt": "decisions: the group will resume its discussion of speaker anonymization in a subsequent meeting ."}
{"src": "on - only to mark only to mark overlapping zone , but then i think it 's a good idea . but i mean we if uh if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it , say , for forty - five minutes , then at least we 'd have three hundred examples of it .", "tgt": "decisions: to save time , speaker mn005 will only mark the sample of transcribed data for regions of overlapping speech , as opposed to marking all acoustic events ."}
{"src": "yeah , whoever we have working on the acoustics for the meeting recorder are gon na start with that .", "tgt": "decisions: the digits extraction task will be delegated to whomever is working on acoustics for the meeting recorder project ."}
{"src": "if anyone knows of one more m or two more wee meetings per week that happen at icsi , um that we could record , i think it would be worth it .", "tgt": "decisions: the group will inquire with other icsi researchers and colleagues at the university of washington about collecting additional meeting data ."}
{"src": "i mean , one of the things i wanted to do , uh , that i i talked to to don about , is one of the possible things he could do or m also , we could have someone else do it , is to do block echo cancellation , so that 's something i 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close uh mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation . somebody look and and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with .", "tgt": "decisions: echo cancellation experiments will be performed on meeting recorder digits data ."}
{"src": "so this is this is this is gon na be a big , big problem if you want to later do uh , you know , indexing , or speech understanding of any sort .", "tgt": "problems: use of pronouns ( e.g . he , she , you ) during meetings is potentially problematic for indexing referents and analysing speech understanding ."}
{"src": "and in fact , it is it is it is sensitive . you know , i asked her very specifically about this clause of how , um , you know , it says `` no individuals will be identified", "tgt": "problems: sensitivity issues involved in mentioning individuals by name were also discussed ."}
{"src": "i mean , if i 'm tapping on the table , you it 's not gon na show up on any of the mikes , but it 's gon na show up rather loudly in the pzm . the the the far - field , because i i found a difference .", "tgt": "problems: data obtained via the close-talking microphone channels do n't match meeting content yielded via the far-field microphones ."}
{"src": "one of the things that i think is a little a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work , we probably ca n't do it every week . so , i think it 's gon na be a problem to get people regularly .", "tgt": "problems: the collection of meeting data from non-meeting recorder participants is likely to be more infrequent ."}

{"src": "and in that uh , regard , i thought we definitely w will need it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains , or a few different kinds of meetings . um , but i 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one one - time but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar , uh , for other kinds of research , particularly the acoustic oriented research , i actually feel the opposite need . i 'd like to have many different speakers . so , um i think i would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and and uh , i 'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers , cuz these are both weird", "tgt": "abstract: it was agreed that a substantial amount of meeting data is required from different domains , and comprising several speakers , to perform the types of discourse and acoustic analyses desired ."}
{"src": "i have , eh , the result of my work during the last days . it 's a real problem , a frequently problem uh , because you have overlapping zones eh , eh , eh , all the time . but , eh , my idea is , eh , is very interesting to to work in in the line of , eh , automatic segmenter . no , i i plan to do that . now , eh , i need ehm , to detect eh all the overlapping zones exactly . so the first thing is for you to to build up something that will detect the overlaps .", "tgt": "abstract: ongoing efforts by speaker mn005 to automatically detect regions of speaker overlap were considered ."}
{"src": "i would take just a few features . instead of taking all the mfcc 's , or all the plp 's or whatever , i would just take a couple . uh , and uh on the other hand , the lpc residual , the energy in the lpc residual , will say how well , uh the low - order lpc model 's fitting it , which should be pretty poorly for two two or more people speaking at the same time , and it should be pretty well , for w for for one . well , that that that 's another reason why very simple features , things like energy , and things things like harmonicity , and residual energy are uh , yeah are are better to use than very complex ones because they 'll be more reliable .", "tgt": "abstract: it was suggested that speaker mn005 focus on a small set of acoustic parameters , e.g . energy and harmonics-related features , to distinguish regions of overlap from those containing the speech of just one speaker ."}
{"src": "and then um , i guess another topic would be where are we in the whole disk resources question", "tgt": "abstract: disk space issues were discussed ."}
{"src": "um and then also anonymity , how we want to anonymize the data . the question becomes what symbol are you gon na put in there for everybody 's name , and whether you 're gon na put it in the text where he says `` hey roger `` or are we gon na put that person 's anonymized name in instead ? because if we made the the transcript be the tag that we 're using for roger , someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between the anonymized name and the real name , and we wan na avoid that . um , how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name ? however , taking one step further back , they 'd be identifiable anyway , even if we changed all the names . on the other hand , this is a small this is a small pool , and people who say things about topic x e who are researchers and well - known in the field , they 'll be identifiable and simply from the from the first name . now , it would be very possible for me to take those data put them in a in a study , and just change everybody 's name for the purpose of the publication . and within that , it may be that it 's sufficient to not uh change the to not incorporate anonymization yet , but always , always in the publications we have to .", "tgt": "abstract: and , finally , the problem of speaker anonymization was explored ."}
{"src": "well , i think that , um i think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in english .", "tgt": "decisions: recordings must be of existing meetings that are conducted in english ."}
{"src": "so i was i was thinking more in terms of talking to professors uh , and and and uh , senior uh , uh , d and uh , doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their hold their meeting down here . i mean , it it i think that if we 're aiming at at uh , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together , and it 's from the berkeley campus , probably most of it will be ok , and my point in m in my note to liz was i think that undergrads are an iff iffy population .", "tgt": "decisions: participants should ideally consist of professors and doctoral students , but no undergraduate students , who are willing to record their meetings at icsi ."}

{"src": "the o the o the other the other thing is , uh , that we we talked about is give to them uh , burn an extra cd - rom . we could burn it after it 's been cleared with the transcript stage . so , after the transcript screening phase .", "tgt": "decisions: a tentative decision was made to offer participants a recorded version of their meeting on a cd rom once the transcript screening phase is complete for that meeting ."}

{"src": "then , uh , it seems to me that well , maybe i uh it seems to me that if you change the name , the transcript 's gon na disagree with the audio , and you wo n't be able to use that . ok , well , but then there 's this issue of if we 're gon na use this for a discourse type of thing , then and , you know , liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who 's who 's the addressee and all , then to have `` roger `` be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was `` roger `` be `` frank `` , that 's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis .", "tgt": "problems: speaker anonymization poses problems for the transcription proccess , and also discourse analysis , as it makes it more difficult to track who is speaking and to whom a particular utterance is being addressed ."}

{"src": "and what we 're doing now is , aside from the many other differences in the task , we are considering overlap", "tgt": "abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group focussed its discussion on overlapping speech segments ."}
{"src": "raw counts . so . of the times a person spoke and furthermore was involved in a two two - person overlap , what percentage of the time were they the overlapper and what percent of the time were they th the overlappee ? but , of course , uh i e this is just one meeting , uh there 's no statistical testing involved , and that would be required for a for a finding of any kind of scientific reliability . well , of course th the biggest , um result here , which is one we 've we 've talked about many times and is n't new to us , but which i think would be interesting to show someone who is n't familiar with this is just the sheer number of overlaps . it 's a forty forty plus minute meeting , what we 've learned about is overlaps in this situation , is that the first the first - order thing i would say is that there 's a lot of them . in fact and it 's not just an overlap bunch of overlaps second - order thing is it 's not just a bunch of overlaps in one particular point , but that there 's overlaps , uh throughout the thing . um preliminary analysis of overlaps in the pilot data we have transcribed ,", "tgt": "abstract: speaker fe008 presented raw counts and percentages for one transcribed meeting , revealing a large number of overlaps throughout the 40-plus-minute transcript ."}
{"src": "um , that some people tend to be overlapped with more often than they 're overlapped , and it would be , you know of course , there 's also the question of what type of overlap was this , and w what were they , so , um then it beco though so just just superficially to give um a couple ideas of the types of overlaps involved , i have at the bottom several that i noticed . so , uh , the point is that , um overlap 's not necessarily a bad thing and that it would be im i useful to subdivide these further and see if there are individual differences in styles with respect to the types involved . so , the question is , you know , how many more overlaps do you have of , say the two - person type , by adding more people . to a meeting , so it may be that having three people is very different from having two people or it may not be . but we should still be able to somehow say what what is the added contra contribution to sort of overlap time of each additional person , or something like that . these were these were benevolent types , as people finishing each other 's sentences , and stuff . and that it would be interesting to look at whether there are these kinds of constraints that jane mentioned , that what maybe the additional people add to this competition that happens right after a turn ,", "tgt": "abstract: efforts by speakers fe008 and fe016 are in progress to categorize and subcategorize types of overlapping speech and evaluate the contribution of multiple speakers in an interaction to the amount and types of overlap observed ."}
{"src": "yeah , i 've been playing with , um uh , using the close - talking mike to do to try to figure out who 's speaking . so my first attempt was just using thresholding and filtering , that we talked about about two weeks ago , ok and then the other thing i did , was i took javier 's speaker - change detector acoustic - change detector , and i implemented that with the close - talking mikes , um so , at any rate , my next attempt , which i 'm in the midst of and have n't quite finished yet was actually using the uh , thresholding as the way of generating the candidates . but all of this is close - talking mike , what i 'm doing is trying to use the close - talking mike and just use can - and just generate candidate and just try to get a first pass at something that sort of works .", "tgt": "abstract: speaker me011 described his attempts to automatically identify speakers via the close-talking microphone channels using thresholding and filtering methods and an existing speaker-change detection algorithm ."}
{"src": "or , this is getting a little extravagant , we could put up some kind of blinds or something to to remove , uh visual contact . so this is the things that i think we did in the last three months", "tgt": "abstract: the group also tentatively discussed the erection of visual barriers during meeting recordings , and speaker me013 presented a list of work performed by bmr over the previous three months to be included in a forthcoming report to ibm ."}
{"src": "i 'll do that on the next set of forms . so i 'm gon na put little labels on all the chairs with the seat number .", "tgt": "decisions: for future meetings , speaker me011 will generate a system for mapping speakers and their positions in the recording room ."}
{"src": "i think what i what this has , uh , caused me so this discussion caused me to wan na subdivide these further . i 'm gon na take a look at the , uh backchannels , how much we have anal i hope to have that for next time .", "tgt": "decisions: speaker fe008 will analyze backchannels for a subset of meeting data and givee a report in the next meeting ."}
{"src": "so , from the point of view of studying dialogue , i mean , which dan jurafsky and andreas and i had some projects on , you want to know the sequence of turns . so , for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling it 's we know that that 's wrong in real time .", "tgt": "problems: for language and dialogue modelling , current methods of marking and segmenting overlap are abstracted from real time , as individual speaker turns are indicated sequentially ."}
{"src": "but , of course , uh i e this is just one meeting , uh there 's no statistical testing involved , and that would be required for a for a finding of any kind of scientific reliability . you know , the other thing i was thinking was that , um these all these interesting questions are , of course , pretty hard to answer with , uh u you know , a small amount of data .", "tgt": "problems: a large amount of data must be collected to address research questions concerning overlapping speech ."}
{"src": "and that works o k , if you fil if you tune the filter parameters , if you tune how long your median filter is and how high you 're looking for your thresholds .", "tgt": "problems: for automatic speaker identification , thresholding and filtering methods are sensitive regarding the particular filter width and threshold selected ."}
{"src": "so if you fiddle around with it a little bit and you get good numbers you can actually do a pretty good job of segmenting when someone 's talking and when they 're not . but if you try to use the same paramenters on another speaker , it does n't work anymore , it does work for the one speaker throughout the whole meeting .", "tgt": "problems: while such parameters can be finely tuned for one speaker to achieve good results , extending the same parameters to another speaker is problematic ."}
{"src": "and unfortunately that 's not working real well , and it looks like it 's and what looks like it 's happening is that the even on the close - talking mike the broad phone class classifier 's doing a really bad job .", "tgt": "problems: the broad phone classifier of the speaker-change detector is peforming poorly ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: the prospect of erecting visual barriers during meetings would require partitioning off each of the participants ."}
{"src": "so we need a barrier that does n't disturb the sound ,", "tgt": "problems: also , barriers that do not affect the overall room acoustics would be required ."}
{"src": "but um uh jose and i were just talking about the uh uh , speech e energy thing , he was he he was taking everything over two hundred milliseconds and so i i his his he 's making the constraint it has to be at least two hundred milliseconds .", "tgt": "abstract: the berkely meeting recorder group discussed efforts by speaker mn005 to measure energy levels in cases of speaker overlap in which the time window analyzed was 200 milliseconds or greater ."}
{"src": "right now , that he 's not really showing any kind of uh distinction , but uh um . and uh one is that uh this is all in log energy um and but one thing he was pointing out is when he he looked at a bunch of examples in log domain , it is actually pretty hard to see the change . and when he 's looking in the log domain he 's not really seeing it .", "tgt": "abstract: preliminary results were presented showing that log domain analyses did not reveal a significant difference in mean energy levels for windows of overlapping versus non-overlapping speech ."}
{"src": "and when he 's looking in straight energy he is , um but since uh your intuition from looking at some of the data , is that when you looked at the regular energy , that it did in fact usually go up , when two people were talking , that 's eh you know , you should be able to come up with a measure which will match your intuition .", "tgt": "abstract: in contrast , raw energy analyses were successful in showing the two groups to be distinct ."}

{"src": "yeah this was the problem with these categories ,", "tgt": "abstract: participants also reviewed the latest iteration of speaker forms , and discussed recent changes to the transcriber tool ."}
{"src": "um another is that he needs to play with the the different uh uh temporal sizes . uh , and uh he 's going to vary that number and also look at moving windows , as we discussed before . um and uh and the other thing is that the yeah doing the subtracting off the mean and the variance in the uh and dividing it by the standard deviation in the log domain , may not be the right thing to do . so yeah there there there there 's a good chance then given that different people do talk different amounts that there is there there is still a lot more to be gained from gain norm normalization with some sort uh . but we were agreed that in addition to that uh there should be s stuff related to pitch and harmonics and so forth . um and then we w i think we 're agreed that pitch - related things are are are going to be a a really likely candidate to help . and then you can move on to the uh uh more pitch related stuff . and then that should give us some indication between those , should give us some indication of whether there 's anything to be achieved f from energy at all . not consider the log energy . i think i would just sort of look at the energy and then get into the harmonicity as as a suggestion .", "tgt": "decisions: continuing efforts by speaker mn005 to measure energy levels in cases of speaker overlap will not include additional log energy analyses , but rather an analysis of raw energy for normalized speaker dataacross windows of varying duration , followed by an examination of pitch- and harmonicity-related features ."}

{"src": "but it is definitely true that we need to have the time marks , and i was assuming that will be inherited because , if you have the words and they 're roughly aligned in time via forced alignment or whatever we end up using , then you know , this student and i would be looking at the time marks well , we we would n't be able to do any work without a forced alignment anyway ,", "tgt": "problems: time marks for transcribed or force-aligned data are needed to analyze types of speaker overlap ."}
{"src": "so i 'm not sure what to do about the region field for english variety . but i do n't know how to i do n't know how to i do n't know how to categorize them . yeah this was the problem with these categories ,", "tgt": "problems: with respect to speaker forms , the group discussed problems associated with categorizing regional dialects of american english ."}
{"src": "but the problem with it is the drawing of those waveforms is so slow that every time you do anything it just crawls . just about anything , and it it was so slow it was not usable .", "tgt": "problems: the new version of transcriber does not feature the waveform , as re-drawing of this window is too slow using snack ."}
{"src": "well , um , i can give you an update on the transcription effort . because at present , um , because of the limitations of th the interface we 're using , overlaps are , uh , not being encoded by the transcribers in as complete and , uh , detailed a way as it might be , what our decision was is that we 'll go ahead with what we have with a not very fine time scale on the overlaps .", "tgt": "abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group talked about the ongoing transcription effort and issues related to the transcriber tool , which despite its limitations for capturing tight time markings for overlapping speech , will continue to remain in use ."}

{"src": "uh , maybe raise the issue of microphone , uh , um procedures well , let 's why do n't we talk about microphone issues ? but i i think that it it does n't hurt , uh , the naturalness of the situation to try to have people wear the microphones properly , if possible , so , anything to reduce breathing is is is a good thing . so you want it enough to the side so that when you exhale through your nose , it does n't the wind does n't hit the mike .", "tgt": "abstract: recording equipment and procedures were discussed , with a focus on audible breathing and the need for standards in microphone wear and use ."}
{"src": "but , i mean , the other things that we talked about is , uh , pitch - related things and harmonicity - related things , you know , have a have a couple markov models which is to say , do n't worry so much about the , uh , features . and , uh , try to indi try to determine , you know , w when is th when are you in an overlap , when are you not in an overlap . and let the , uh , uh , statistical system determine what 's the right way to look at the data . and i hope the the next week i will have , eh , some results and we we will show we will see , eh , the the parameter the pitch , eh , tracking in with the program . uh , the has has , uh , been exploring , uh , e largely the energy issue so far , um , uh , jose has has been but it may be given that you have a limited time here , it it just may not be the best thing to to to focus on for the remaining of it . th - they were suggesting going to markov models ,", "tgt": "abstract: and , finally , it was determined that speaker mn005 's efforts to detect speaker overlap using energy should instead be focussed on pitch- and harmonicity-related features or be guided by a non-featural , statistical approach , i.e . via the use of markov models ."}
{"src": "what our decision was is that we 'll go ahead with what we have with a not very fine time scale on the overlaps . then when they 're encoding the overlaps it would be nice for them to be able to specify when you know , the start points and end points of overlaps . and i hope that if we do a forced alignment with the close - talking mike , that will be enough to recover at least some of the time the time information of when the overlap occurred .", "tgt": "decisions: in the interest of time , it was decided that the group should continue using the existing transcriber tool and perform a forced alignment on the close-talking microphones that will , it is hoped , help to recover some of the time information indicating where different speaker overlaps occurred in the signal ."}

{"src": "and the other one is , um , uh , is there some good use that we can make of the transcribers to do other things ? one one was uh , we had s had some discussion in the past about some very high level labelings , um , the other thing is that there was a number of things at the transcription side that , um , transcribers can do , like dialogue act tagging ,", "tgt": "abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed recording equipment and setup issues , recent developments in the transcription effort , other potential types of tagging to be assigned to transcribers , and the post-processing of waveforms ."}
{"src": "and actually in addition to that , that the the close talking mikes are worn in such a way as to best capture the signal . so it 's towards the corner of your mouth so that breath sounds do n't get on it . but if we could actually standardize , you know , the the microphones , uh , as much as possible that would be really helpful . but have them all be the same mike . it 's the equipment and also how it 's worn . it 's really it makes a big difference from the transcribers ' point of view so we might as well get it as uniform as we can . and , uh , also dan ellis 's innovation of the , uh the multi - channel to here really helped a r a lot in terms of clearing clearing up h hearings that involve overlaps .", "tgt": "abstract: the discussion was largely focused on efforts to facilitate transcriptions , including the improvement of strategies for transcribing overlapping speech , and achieving greater uniformity in the type of equipment used during recordings and the manner in which recording devices are worn by speakers ."}

{"src": "but that , um , it would be helpful if i can stay in the loop somehow with , um , people who are doing any kind of post - processing ,", "tgt": "decisions: it was proposed by speaker fe016 that better communication be established between researchers involved in post-processing of the waveform and asr ."}
{"src": "it adds this extra , you know , vari variable for each speaker to to deal with when the microphones are n't similar .", "tgt": "problems: use of dissimilar microphones adds an extra , unwanted variable to individual speaker recordings ."}
{"src": "but if we could actually standardize , you know , the the microphones , uh , as much as possible that would be really helpful . it 's the equipment and also how it 's worn . it 's really it makes a big difference from the transcribers ' point of view", "tgt": "problems: similarly , differences in the type of recording equipment used and the manner in which microphones are worn by speakers causes problems for the transcription effort ."}
{"src": "but if you 're d i the kind of person who 's doing array processing you actually care about funny little times . and and so you actually wou would want to have a completely different set up than we have , is there an interest in getting video recordings for these meetings ? yes , absolutely . but it 's exactly the same problem , that you have an infrastructure problem , they were interested in ours . and , uh , it is related to ours .", "tgt": "problems: setting up a microphone array and performing video recordings ( in a possible collaboration with nist ) are problematic due to the types of changes in infrastructure they require ."}
{"src": "but there could be problems , right ? with that . then for forced alignment we actually do n't know where you know , in the signal the transcriber heard that word . th - but there 's going to be a real problem , uh , even if we chop up based on speech silence these , uh , the transcripts from i b m , we do n't actually know where the words were , which segment they belonged to .", "tgt": "problems: ibm 's single-channel approach to transcriptions may pose problems for the post-processing of waveforms and forced alignments , as the group foresees difficulties in referencing chopped segments back to the original times / locations from which they were extracted ."}
{"src": "so the problem is like , uh , on the microphone of somebody who 's not talking they 're picking up signals from other people and that 's causing problems ?", "tgt": "problems: another post-processing problem involves cross-talk , and , in particular , situations in which a speaker whose contributions to the discussion are relatively sparse but whose microphone picks up signals from the other speakers ."}
{"src": "ok well , the , w uh as you can see from the numbers on the digits we 're almost done . and so , once we 're it 's done it would be very nice to train up a recognizer and actually start working with this data .", "tgt": "abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed the collection status for a set of connected digits recordings that are nearly complete and ready to be trained on a recognizer ."}
{"src": "yeah just by way of uh , uh , a uh , order of magnitude , uh , um , we 've been working with this aurora , uh data set . and , uh , the best score , on the , nicest part of the data , that is , where you 've got training and test set that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth , uh , is about , i think the best score was something like five percent , uh , error , per digit .", "tgt": "abstract: anticipated results were discussed in reference to results obtained for other digits corpora , i.e . aurora and ti-digits ."}
{"src": "one question i have that that i mean , we would n't know the answer to now but might , do some guessing , but i was talking before about doing some model modeling of arti uh , uh , marking of articulatory , features , with overlap and so on . one thought might be to do this uh , on on the digits , or some piece of the digits . so , i mean another way to look at this is to , is to , uh , do some stuff on switchboard which has all this other , stuff to it . and then , um , as we get , further down the road and we can do more things ahead of time , we can , do some of the same things to the meeting data .", "tgt": "abstract: the group also considered the prospect of performing fine-grained acoustic-phonetic analyses on a subset of meeting recorder digits or switchboard data ."}
{"src": "uh , oh yeah , um , i worked a little bit on the on the presegmentation to to get another version which does channel - specific , uh , speech - nonspeech detection .", "tgt": "abstract: pre-segmentation manipulations that allow for the segmentation of channel-specific speech / non-speech portions of the signal and the distinction of foreground versus background speech were discussed ."}
{"src": "also we discussed some adaptational things , uh you know i had n't , uh , incorporated , a convention explicitly to handle acronyms , for example , and then , a similar conv uh , convention for numbers . so if they hear a breath and they do n't know who breath it is it 's better to put it in that channel than to put it in the speaker 's channel", "tgt": "abstract: finally , speaker fe008 and fe016 reported on new efforts to adapt transcriptions to the needs of the sri recognizer , including conventions for encoding acronyms , numbers , ambient noise , and unidentified inbreaths ."}
{"src": "and so the the question is , should we have the transcribers do that or should we just do it ? and i think it 's a it 's a fine idea partly because , um , it 's not un unrelated to their present skill set , and then , hand off to jane , and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits .", "tgt": "decisions: the group decided to delegate the extraction of digits to the transcriber pool ."}
{"src": "well , you know , um i mean if we 're talking about , having the , annotators annotate these kinds of features , it seems like , so i mean i we 'll see wha how much we can , uh , get the people to do , and how much money we 'll have and all this sort of thing , so , i mean another way to look at this is to , is to , uh , do some stuff on switchboard which has all this other , stuff to it .", "tgt": "decisions: a tentative decision was also made to delegate transcribers with the task of labelling a subset of digits or switchboard data for fine-grained acoustic-phonetic features ."}
{"src": "it seems to me that it would be good to have , a few minutes from from different meetings , so , as a first pass through , a first chance without having to do a lot of hand - editing , what we 're gon na do , is , i 'll run it through channelize , give them those data after i 've done the editing process and be sure it 's clean . and then we 'll see if the units that we 're getting , uh , with the at that level , are sufficient .", "tgt": "decisions: speaker fe008 will run selected meeting recorder data through channelize and determine whether the resulting units are of a sufficient length ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: with respect to encoding more fine-grained acoustic information in transcriptions , the question was posed: which features should be marked ?"}
{"src": "there are some problems with the lapel mike . but , there are some some as i said some problems with the lapel mike ,", "tgt": "problems: speaker mn014 reported problems pre-segmenting speech recorded via the lapel microphones ."}
{"src": "then , the , yeah , there are there are some problems with with with n with normalization , and , then , uh , there the system does n't work at all .", "tgt": "problems: normalization of the energy measured across and within channels is problematic when performed for speakers who say little or nothing during meetings ."}
{"src": "and , the thing is i i , then the evaluation of of the system is a little bit hard , as i do n't have any references .", "tgt": "problems: the evaluation of pre-segmented data is difficult without tightly transcribed time references to the individual channels from which the speech was derived ."}
{"src": "it drifted into the afternoon , uh , concerning this issue of , um , the , well there 's basically the issue of the interplay between the transcript format and the processing that , they need to do for , the sri recognizer . and , um , their recognizer would prefer that the units not be overly long .", "tgt": "problems: the sri recognizer requires that multi-channel format units not be too large , indicating that some additional pre-processing of unit lengths may be necessary ."}
{"src": "the other topic i was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that . um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in . so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . and so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes . no , we 're just replacing the wired the two wired that are still working , along with a couple of the wired that are n't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless .", "tgt": "abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed recording equipment issues , including the purchase of two additional headsets and the prospect of getting a new base station and a set of wireless microphones to replace those wired microphones currently in use ."}
{"src": "but i think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now . the next step is to that i 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , liz requested in terms of um , um in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which i had n't been specific about . that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout ,", "tgt": "abstract: speaker fe008 presented the current status on transcriptions , and explained procedures for cleaning up transcripts and ensuring they conform with set conventions ."}
{"src": "yeah , and i and i tried t to normalize uh uh the features , there 's loudness and modified loudness , um , within one channel , because they 're , yeah to to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech .", "tgt": "abstract: speaker mn014 briefly described his efforts to normalize loudness levels across speech channels to distinguish between foreground and background speech ."}
{"src": "i wan na talk a little bit about getting how we 're gon na to get people to edit bleeps , parts of the meeting that they do n't want to include . the transcription part ? so i guess the next thing is this uh bleep editing . we need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they do n't want . `` if you agree to participate you 'll have the opportunity to have anything ex anything excised , which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . `` there again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you 'd prefer to have excised from the database , and they will m be removed both from the transcript and the recording . ``", "tgt": "abstract: finally , the group discussed legal and procedural issues concerning the provision of transcripts to meeting participants for 'bleeping out ' any sections of speech they want excluded from the meeting recorder database ."}

{"src": "so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . and so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes . no , we 're just replacing the wired the two wired that are still working , along with a couple of the wired that are n't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless .", "tgt": "decisions: the group decided to replace wired microphones with a wireless setup , i.e . a new base station and set of wireless microphones ."}
{"src": "well we should talk to them about it because i know that sri is also in the process of looking at stuff , and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone on the same page with that .", "tgt": "decisions: efforts will be made to ensure that recording conventions are consistent across icsi , the university of washington , and sri ."}
{"src": "in listening to some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things ,", "tgt": "problems: some of the meeting recordings contain spikes ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: it was surmised that such disturbances are probably due to the connectors attached to a set of wired microphones in use ."}
{"src": "are are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they were n't speaking ? so that means other people are editing what you say ?", "tgt": "problems: with respect to editing bleeps , should participants be allowed to edit out others ' speech ?"}
{"src": "but i really think we wan na make it the rare incidence . and and uh , i am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do ,", "tgt": "problems: it was suggested that making transcripts available to all of the subjects involved might make it too easy for them to edit out sections of meetings , whereas the bias should be to ensure that editing bleeps occur only rarely in the database ."}
{"src": "i have a short thing about digits and then uh i wan na talk a little bit about naming conventions , so the only thing i wan na say about digits is , we are pretty much done with the first test set . uh , the last one was that you had there , was about naming ? we want some way of specifying , more than looking in the `` key `` file , what channel and what mike . what channel , what mike , and what broadcaster .", "tgt": "abstract: topics discussed by the berkeley meeting recorder group included the status of the first test set of digits data , naming conventions for files , speaker identification tags , and encoding files with details about the recording ."}
{"src": "uh , right , so so i i was just gon na talk briefly about the nsf itr . ok , so uh e l i guess , let me , uh , get my my short thing out about the nsf . so this was , uh , a , uh , proposal that we put in so is i for it was a proposal for the itr program , um , since we have such a short agenda list i guess i wi i will ask how how are the transcriptions going ? and and i 'm tried to to , uh , adjust the to to improve , eh , an harmonicity , eh , detector that , eh , i i implement . eh , and now i 'm i 'm i 'm trying to to find , eh , some kind of a , um of h of help , eh , using the energy to to distinguish between possible harmonics , and and other fre frequency peaks , that , eh , corres not harmonics . you 're trying distinguish between the case where there is , uh where where there are more than uh , where there 's more than one speaker and the case where there 's only one speaker .", "tgt": "abstract: the group also discussed a proposal for a grant from the nsf 's itr ( information technology research ) program , transcriptions , and efforts by speaker mn005 to detect speaker overlap using harmonicity-related features ."}
{"src": "that there 's one third thing i wanted to to ex raise as a to as an issue which is , um , how to handle breaths .", "tgt": "abstract: particular focus was paid to questions about transcription procedures , i.e . how to deal with overlooked backchannels , and audible breaths ."}
{"src": "seems like we should just change the transcripts", "tgt": "decisions: a small percentage of transcripts will be changed to reflect mis-read , uncorrected digits ."}
{"src": "that also brings up the point that we have to start assembling a speaker database so that we get those links back and forth and keep it consistent .", "tgt": "decisions: a speaker database will be compiled to establish consistent links between speakers and their corresponding identification tags ."}
{"src": "well so then then , maybe the answer is to , uh , listen especially densely in places of overlap ,", "tgt": "decisions: sections of densely overlapping speech will require hand-checking so that overlooked backchannels may be manually segmented and labelled ."}
{"src": "so i would say do n't tell them to transcribe anything that 's outside of a grouping of words .", "tgt": "decisions: the transcribers should only code audible breaths within a grouping of words , and not outside regions of continuous speech ."}
{"src": "i do n't know think it 'd be ideal . and breaths are part of real speech .", "tgt": "decisions: it was further determined that audible breaths are an important facet of recorded speech , and that removing them from the corpus would be contrary to the aims of the project ."}
{"src": "i will prepare for the next week eh , all my results about the harmonicity", "tgt": "decisions: speaker mn005 will prepare his results for detecting speaker overlap and present them in the next meeting ."}
{"src": "but , um , the other problem we were thinking about is if you just put the numerals , they might say forty - three instead of four three .", "tgt": "problems: during digits readings , subjects tend to chunk numbers together rather than reading each number separately ."}
{"src": "but , um , with the mixed , when you have an overlap , you only have a a choice of one start and end time for that entire overlap ,", "tgt": "problems: when working from the mixed channel , transcribers may select only one start and end time for overlapping speech , resulting in points of overlap that are less tightly tuned ."}
{"src": "once in a while a backchannel will be overlooked by the transcriber .", "tgt": "problems: transcribers are likely to overlook backchannels in densely populated sections of speaker overlap ."}
{"src": "yeah , but those backchannels will always be a problem i think . uh especially if they 're really short and they 're not very loud and so it it can it it will always happen that also the automatic s detection system will miss some of them ,", "tgt": "problems: speaker mn014 reported that this is also problematic for the automatic detection of speech and non-speech , as backchannels that are very short and not loud enough will inevitably be overlooked ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: speaker mn005 reported problems distinguishing between possible harmonics and other frequency peaks , and creating an algorithm for obtaining the instantaneous frequency ."}
{"src": "um , aside from the fact that they 're obviously very time - consuming to encode ,", "tgt": "problems: the encoding of all audible breaths is too time-consuming ."}
{"src": "so the other topic with digits is uh , we have asr results from liz , transcript status from jane , and disk space and storage formats from don . don , you had disk space and storage formats .", "tgt": "abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed digits data , recent asr results , the status of transcriptions , and disk space and storage format issues ."}
{"src": "we have about two hours worth . so what that means is we have about an hour of transcribed digits that we can play with . and you 're saying two hours , uh , is digits ,", "tgt": "abstract: approximately two hours of digits have been recorded , half of which have been extracted ."}
{"src": "um , leads us to believe that doing a better segmentation , like your channel - based segmentation , or some kind of uh , echo cancellation to get basically back down to the individual speaker utterances would be probably all that we would need to be able to do good recognition on the on the close - talking mikes .", "tgt": "abstract: researchers doing asr are looking into methods for generating a better channel-based segmentation to improve recognition results for close-talking microphone data ."}
{"src": "alright so , first of all , um , there was a an interest in the transcribe transcription , uh , checking procedures", "tgt": "abstract: transcription checking procedures were reviewed , and efforts to coordinate the channelization and presegmention of data with the tightening of time bins were discussed ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: the group also talked about downsampling and strategies for coping with low disk space ."}
{"src": "ok so so i can just add to the instructions to read it as digits", "tgt": "decisions: digits forms will instruct speakers to read digits separately and not as connected numbers ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: a tentative decision was made to collect overlapping digits from speakers ."}
{"src": "give it give one tr transcriber the the channelized version of of my speech - nonspeech detection and look if if that 's helpful for them ,", "tgt": "decisions: transcribers will be given channelized data that has been segmented for speech / non-speech boundaries to determine whether such pre-processing facilitates the transcription process ."}
{"src": "and they 're slowly s trickling in . and so we tried last week with them written out in english . and it just did n't work at all because no one grouped them together .", "tgt": "problems: participants have been slow in returning the relevant forms necessary for matching digits data with speaker ids . forms containing digits that were written out in english were unsuccessful for obtaining desired prosodic groupings ."}
{"src": "especially for speakers that do n't talk a lot . so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation ,", "tgt": "problems: acoustic adaptation is problematic for speakers who seldom talk during meetings ."}
{"src": "it 's the fact that there 's overlap that causes recognition errors . so with a one - word utterance and ten insertions you know you got huge error rate .", "tgt": "problems: speaker overlap causes recognition errors ."}
{"src": "i guess the other neat thing is it shows for sure w that the lapel , you know within speaker is bad . and it 's bad because it picks up the overlapping speech .", "tgt": "problems: the lapel microphone is problematic as it picks up overlapping background speech ."}
{"src": "that that 's why we need more disk space", "tgt": "problems: more disk space is needed ."}
{"src": "you ca n't load an hour of speech into x waves .", "tgt": "problems: loading long waveforms in x waves is very time consuming ."}
{"src": "but if there 's things that um , we change later , then we always have to keep our the dictionary up to date .", "tgt": "problems: the dictionary must be updated with forms introduced as part of speaker fe008 's set of transcription conventions ."}
{"src": "well , you know the problem the problem is that some some of the adjustments that they 're making are to bring are to combine bins that were time bins which were previously separate . but the i guess the ef the effect for you guys , because you 're pulling out the little wave forms into separate ones , that would mean these boundaries are constantly changing but if you split inside something , you do n't where the word which words moved .", "tgt": "problems: the ongoing tightening of boundaries on time bins causes segment boundaries to change , indicating potential problems for other ongoing processing tasks ."}
{"src": "and then we go in and adjust the boundaries . how quickly can the transcribers scan over and fix the boundaries , and then it 's then it 's then it 's the transcribers tightening stuff up , so you 're talking about tightening up time boundaries ? well , so so that 's something that the transcribers will have to have to do . so , if i excluded the pathological ones , by definition , those that had like over ninety - five percent error rate , and the non - natives , then the average error rate was like one point four or something ,", "tgt": "abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed the preparation of a data sample for ibm , the manual adjustment of time bins by transcribers , recognition results for a test set of digits data , and forced alignments ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "abstract: participants also talked about eurospeech 2001 submissions , and exchanged comments on the proceedings of the recently attended human language technologies conference ( hlt'01 ) ."}
{"src": "so , if i excluded the pathological ones , by definition , those that had like over ninety - five percent error rate , and the non - natives , then the average error rate was like one point four or something ,", "tgt": "abstract: preliminary recognition results were presented for a subset of digits data ."}
{"src": "so we need some way to push these first chunk of meetings into a state where we get good alignments .", "tgt": "abstract: efforts to deal with cross-talk and improve forced alignments for non-digits data were also discussed ."}
{"src": "and then we go in and adjust the boundaries . and then it 's then it 's then it 's the transcribers tightening stuff up , well , so so that 's something that the transcribers will have to have to do .", "tgt": "decisions: subsequent manual adjustment of speech and non-speech boundaries will be delegated to the transcriber pool ."}
{"src": "he generated , um , a channel - wise presegmented version of a meeting , and then it 's ibm .", "tgt": "decisions: a subset of meeting recorder data will be prepared ( i.e . pre-segmented and manually adjusted ) for delivery to ibm ."}
{"src": "i think that if we decide that we need that they need to see the visuals , we need to change the interface so that they can do that .", "tgt": "decisions: the transcriber interface may require modifications if it becomes necessary for transcribers to quickly switch among waveform displays ."}
{"src": "and there really was , then , if it did n't show up in a mixed signal to verify , then it might be overlooked , yeah , but presumably , most of those they should be able to hear from the mixed signal unless they 're embedded in the heavil heavy overlap section i do n't know that you can locate them very well from the mixed signal ,", "tgt": "problems: transcribers risk overlooking speech that is deeply embedded in the mixed signal ."}
{"src": "so , i mean , the question is `` should should a transcriber listen to the entire thing or can it g can it be based on the mixed signal ? ``", "tgt": "problems: should transcriptions be derived from each of the close-talking channels or from the mixed signal alone ?"}
{"src": "except for it does n't do well on short things , remember .", "tgt": "problems: the pre-segmentation tool does not perform well on short utterances , e.g . backchannels ."}
{"src": "the problem is that that the tcl - tk interface with the visuals , it 's very slow to load waveforms . but you just ca n't get the visual display to show quickly .", "tgt": "problems: the transcriber interface does not allow the user to quickly switch among visual displays , i.e . multi-channel waveforms ."}
{"src": "oh , well , yeah , so i 've been struggling with the forced alignments . but it might well be that we ca n't get clean alignments out of this out of those , uh , channels , so he thought well if we can do something quick and dirty because dan said the cross - cancellation , it 's not straight - forward .", "tgt": "problems: forced alignments were problematic for non-digits data due to cross-talk ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: this problem was reported to be particularly bad for cross-talk featuring more than one word ."}
{"src": "unless maybe we do this , uh , um , cancellation business . but it 's clear from dan that this is not something you can do in a short amount of time . um , but then if you add the dynamic aspect of adapting distances , then it was n't", "tgt": "problems: echo cancellation was considered as a means of improving forced alignments , but was ultimately deemed to be too time-consuming given the dynamic aspect of adapting distances between speakers ."}
{"src": "it 's very tedious to check these .", "tgt": "problems: comparing error rates in terms of the recording device used , i.e . lapel versus wireless microphones , is tedious ."}
{"src": "and i really find it a pain in the neck to delete things", "tgt": "problems: deleting segments of the recordings is expected to be very time-consuming for transcribers ."}
{"src": "yeah , for eurospeech we want some results", "tgt": "problems: more results are needed for generating adequate submissions for eurospeech'01 ."}
{"src": "but if they 're not comfortable , we have the same problems we have with these stupid things .", "tgt": "problems: participants have complained that the head-mounted microphone is uncomfortable ."}
{"src": "and the interesting thing is that even though , yes , it 's a digits task and that 's a relatively small number of words and there 's a bunch of digits that you train on , it 's just not as good as having a a l very large amount of data and training up a a a nice good big hmm .", "tgt": "abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed efforts to train and test the aurora group 's htk-based recognition system on icsi 's digits corpus ."}
{"src": "two items , which was , uh , digits and possibly stuff on on , uh , forced alignment , so we we only r hav i only looked at actually alignments from one meeting that we chose ,", "tgt": "abstract: members also discussed efforts to produce forced alignments from a selection of meeting recorder data ."}
{"src": "uh , but the other is that , um , the digits recorded here in this room with these close mikes , i uh , are actually a lot harder than the studio - recording ti - digits . if you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating the the warping , uh , factor . well , i know there were some speaker labelling problems , um , after interruptions . but you 're actually saying that certain , uh , speakers were mis mis - identified .", "tgt": "abstract: performance in both tasks was adversely affected by the manner of recording conditions implemented and difficulties attributing utterances to the appropriate speakers ."}
{"src": "and and w we we were able to get some definite improvement on the forced alignments by looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors that were occurring so just sort of working through a bunch of debugging kinds of issues .", "tgt": "abstract: while debugging efforts resulted in improved forced alignments , dealing with mixed channel speech and speaker overlap remains a key objective for future work ."}
{"src": "so so the key thing that 's missing here is basically the ability to feed , you know , other features i into the recognizer and also then to train the system . we want to have the ability to feed it different features .", "tgt": "abstract: the group is additionally focused on a continued ability to feed different features into the recognizer and then train the system accordingly ."}
{"src": "yeah , bu although i 'd be i think it 'd be interesting to just take this exact actual system and try it out on ti - digits .", "tgt": "decisions: for comparing meeting recorder digits results , it was decided that the aurora htk-based system should be tested on data from the ti digits corpus ."}
{"src": "so , we might have to modify that script to recognize the , um , speakers , um , in the in the , uh , um , ti - digits database . because we may have to do an extract to get the amount of data per speaker about right .", "tgt": "decisions: the script for extracting speaker id information will require modifications to obtain a more accurate estimation of the amount of data recorded per speaker ."}
{"src": "yeah . i i know what i was thinking was that maybe , uh , i i we could actually t t try at least looking at , uh , some of the the large vocabulary speech from a far microphone , but i 'm saying if you do the same kind of limited thing as people have done in switchboard evaluations or as a could we do exactly the same thing that we 're doing now , but do it with a far - field mike ? but you use the acoustics from the far - field mike .", "tgt": "decisions: subsequent recognition experiments will look at large vocabulary speech from a far-field microphone ( as performed in switchboard evaluations ) ."}
{"src": "so , we would need a hand - marked , um , word - level alignments or at least sort of the boundaries of the speech betw you know , between the speakers . and tune the parameters of the of the model , uh , to op to get the best performance .", "tgt": "decisions: hand-marked , word-level alignments are needed to reveal speaker boundaries and tune the parameters of the model ."}
{"src": "you know , interface - wise if you 're looking at speech , you wan na be able to know really where the words are . um , and see if you can in maybe incorporate it into the transcriber tool some way , yeah , it wou the advantage would just be that when you brought up a bin you would be able if you were zoomed in enough in transcriber to see all the words , you would be able to , like , have the words sort of located in time ,", "tgt": "decisions: modifications to the transcriber tool are required for allowing transcribers to simultaneously view the signal in xwaves and see where words are located in time ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: digits training needs to be performed on a larger data set ."}

{"src": "uh , but the other is that , um , the digits recorded here in this room with these close mikes , i uh , are actually a lot harder than the studio - recording ti - digits .", "tgt": "problems: recognition performance was worse for digits recorded in closed microphone conditions versus those recorded in a studio ( e.g . ti-digits ) ."}
{"src": "uh , but the other is that , um , the digits recorded here in this room with these close mikes , i uh , are actually a lot harder than the studio - recording ti - digits . i suspect that to get sort of the last bit out of these higher - quality recordings you would have to in fact , uh , use models that , uh , were trained on wider - band data . that 's where the most m acoustic mismatch is between the currently used models and the the r the set up here . the near versus far .", "tgt": "problems: a mismatch between the manner in which data were collected and the models used for doing recognition -- -e . g . bandwidth parameterization and the use of near- versus far-field microphones -- -was identified ."}
{"src": "if you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating the the warping , uh , factor .", "tgt": "problems: too little data per speaker can have a negative effect on vtl estimation ."}
{"src": "because it 's further away from most of the people reading digits .", "tgt": "problems: the pzm channel selected for obtaining digits data was too far away from most of the speakers ."}
{"src": "you know , as liz said the we f enforce the fact that , uh , the foreground speech has to be continuous . things like words that do occur just by themselves a alone , like backchannels or something that we did allow to have background speech around it those would be able to do that , but the rest would be constrained .", "tgt": "problems: current speech alignment techniques assume that foreground speech must be continuous and , barring some isolated words and backchannels , can not cope with overlapping background speech ."}
{"src": "we probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker . but , i guess andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker , and that 's actually a little bit of a f funky model . like , it gives you some weird alignments , just because often the background speakers match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker .", "tgt": "problems: performing adaptations on both the foreground and background speaker produced a new variety of misalignments , a problem resulting , in part , from the fact that background speakers often match better to foreground conditionss ."}
{"src": "tha - there are some cases like where the the wrong speaker uh , these ca not a lot , but where the the wrong person the the speech is addre attached to the wrong speaker", "tgt": "problems: transcribers occasionally misidentified speakers and omitted backchannels that were more hidden in the mixed signal ."}
{"src": "so the only agenda items were jane was jane wanted to talk about some of the ibm transcription process . uh , and you just sent off a eurospeech paper , so , we should probably talk about the ibm transcription process stuff that", "tgt": "abstract: the main topics of the agenda were a paper submitted to eurospeech and the organising of the recording transcriptions to be done by ibm ."}
{"src": "uh , the one was that the just the the amount of overlap but , even if you take out all the backchannels you still have significant overlap .", "tgt": "abstract: the results presented in the former show a significant percentage of overlapping speech even without counting in backchanneling ."}
{"src": "and we rescored things um , a little bit more carefully . and then the second one was just basically the the stuff we had in the in the hlt paper on how overlaps effect the recognition performance . but basically what we found is after we take out these regions so we only score the regions that were certified as foreground speech , the recognition error went down to almost uh , the level of the non - overlapped speech .", "tgt": "abstract: additionally , the high error rate in the recognition of such overlapping speech by the sri recogniser was minimised simply by changing the scoring method used ."}
{"src": "so at the end after a discourse marker or after backchannel or after filled pause , you 're much more likely to be interrupted than before .", "tgt": "abstract: finally , a strong correlation between pauses and interruptions was confirmed ."}
{"src": "no . well , according to the transcripts .", "tgt": "abstract: all these measurements were based on the sample of available transcripts ."}
{"src": "although that 's i i take it that 's something that uh don will will look at", "tgt": "abstract: other features , like prosody , will be studied in the near future ."}
{"src": "and also , um , the other person that wants it there is one person at sri who wants to look at the um , you know , the uh the data we have so far , and so i figured that ftp is the best approach . so what i did is i um @ @ i made a n new directory", "tgt": "abstract: an ftp directory containing such experimental data is being set up for the benefit of other researchers ."}
{"src": "so the only agenda items were jane was jane wanted to talk about some of the ibm transcription process . so , we should probably talk about the ibm transcription process stuff that", "tgt": "abstract: regarding the transcriptions to be carried out by ibm , the discussion mainly concerned the format of the recordings that should be sent to them ."}
{"src": "and , if the chunked files focused on the dominant speakers , then , when when it got s patched together when it comes back from ibm , we can add the backchannels . and you just use the s the segments of the dominant speaker then ? for for sending to to ibm but then we could just use the the output of the detector , and do the beeping on it , and send it to i b without having her check anything . but but i i i have another suggestion on that , which is , since , really what this is , is is is trying to in the large , send the right thing to them and there is gon na be this this post - processing step , and we 'll we 'll fix things up", "tgt": "abstract: suggestions included sending only the channels with the dominant speakers for transcription , but it was finally agreed on sending the original files with minimal modifications , as there will be extensive in-house post-processing ."}
{"src": "so that if you if you play back that bin and have it in the mode where it stops at the boundary , it sounds like a normal word . but my general goal when there was sufficient space , room , pause after it to have it be kind of a natural feeling gap .", "tgt": "abstract: within this discussion , the rationale behind the coding of the time bins according to the flow of discourse was also explained ."}
{"src": "we should probably uh give them the non - downsampled versions . but , um they probably w want the originals .", "tgt": "decisions: the files made available in the ftp directory will be the original ones ( before down-sampling ) , as these seem to be wanted by other parties ."}
{"src": "yeah , in fact after our meeting uh , this morning thilo came in and said that um , there could be other differences between the uh already transcribed meeting with the beeps in it and one that has just r been run through his process . so tomorrow , when we go to make the um uh , chunked file for ibm , we 're going to actually compare the two . and then we 're gon na do the beep - ify on both , and listen to them and see if we notice any real differences .", "tgt": "decisions: moreover , as files may have been modified through different processing , tests will be carried out in order to ensure the generation of beep files in a consistent way ."}
{"src": "so what what we 're probably gon na do is just write a script , that if two , chunks are very close to each other on the same channel we 'll just merge them . but i like this idea of uh , for our purposes for the for the ibm preparation , uh , n having these joined together ,", "tgt": "decisions: also towards this goal , some of the time bins will need to be merged ."}
{"src": "uh , because we could use that to fine tune our alignment process i mean w i mean what i would i was interested in is having a se having time marks for the beginnings and ends of speech i i hand - adjusted two of them so so at some point we will try to fine - tune our forced alignment", "tgt": "decisions: on the other hand , the two meetings where time bins have been hand-coded in detail will be used to fine-tune the forced alignments ."}
{"src": "we need to give brian the beeps file , and we send it to ibm . the other one is we just run his thing and send it to ibm . send it off to ibm .", "tgt": "decisions: recordings will be sent to ibm for transcription ."}
{"src": "but then we could just use the the output of the detector , and do the beeping on it , and send it to i b so the the one suggestion is you know we we run thilo 's thing the other one is we just run his thing and send it to ibm . and that is if we go ahead and we just run his , and we generate the beeps file , then we have somebody listen beeps file . put the beeps file ,", "tgt": "decisions: before that , the files will be automatically pre-segmented into speech / non-speech bins and the beeps will be inserted ."}
{"src": "the other problem is , that when it when it uh d i on the breathy ones , where you get breathing , uh , inti indicated as speech . so , i could run this on those breathy channels , and what that 'll do is just cut the time a little further .", "tgt": "decisions: in order to make things easier for the transcribers , breathy channels , which are erroneously marked as speech , will be re-classified correctly with other methods ."}
{"src": "why do n't we check through a bunch of things by sampling it ?", "tgt": "decisions: all this pre-processing will have to be evaluated first by checking a sample of the output files ."}
{"src": "what can you do ? and we 'll correct it when it comes back .", "tgt": "decisions: other issues , like whether and how synthesised speech off a laptop needs be transcribed , will be resolved during the in-house post-processing of the transcriptions ."}
{"src": "we actually exceeded the delayed deadline by o another day , i hope they accept it .", "tgt": "problems: there is a slight worry about the acceptance of the paper submitted to eurospeech as the deadline was exceeded ."}
{"src": "well , we did n't get to look at that , yeah , i just wonder if you have to normalize by the numbers of speakers or something . i bet there 's a weak dependence .", "tgt": "problems: as to the content of the paper , the overlap statistics have not been normalised against the number of participants in the conversation , although the dependency is probably going to be a weak one ."}
{"src": "there 's no statement about cause and effect .", "tgt": "problems: additionally , the correlation between pauses in speech and interruptions does not provide a cause-and-effect link for these phenomena ."}
{"src": "yeah , in fact after our meeting uh , this morning thilo came in and said that um , there could be other differences between the uh already transcribed meeting with the beeps in it and one that has just r been run through his process . that 's because of channel overlap .", "tgt": "problems: the preparation of files for transcription by ibm is facing some minor difficulties , as some features ( hand-coded time boundaries , multiplicity of channels etc ) may complicate the generation of beep files ."}
{"src": "but you know , i wanted to say , his segmentation is so good , that um , the part that i listened to with her yesterday did n't need any adjustments of the bins . i ca n't really hhh , tsk . i do n't have really representative numbers , i think .", "tgt": "problems: besides this , the automatic pre-segmentation has been deemed to be good , but there are still no specific measurements to verify this ."}
{"src": "and i the speech - nonspeech detector just assigns randomly the speech to to one of the channels ,", "tgt": "problems: the pre-segmentation tool also classifies synthesised speech used in a recording as `` normal speech '' and assigns a random channel to it ."}

{"src": "is there stuff that 's happened about , um , uh , the sri recognizer et cetera , y y you guys were doing a bunch of experiments with different front - ends and then with now the the you saw the note that the plp now is getting basically the same as the mfcc . um , it looks like the vocal tract length normalization is working beautifully , actually , because in all our previous experiments , we had the uh , you know , we were essentially cheating by having the , um , you know , the h the hand - segmentations as the basis of the recognition . and so now with thilo 's segmenter working so well , i think we should consider doing a and even the good thing is that since you , um , have high recall , even if you have low precision cuz you 're over - generating , that 's good has has , uh ? we just i think , just talked about this the other day , but h has has anybody had a chance to try changing , uh , insertion penalty sort of things with the with the , uh uh , using the tandem system input for the ? but the plp features work um , uh , you know , continue to improve the ,", "tgt": "abstract: plp results for the front-end look good , with the group also reporting progress in segmentation: thilo 's segmenter will now be used and ways of improving performance investigated ;"}
{"src": "but we did find that some of the features that , i gue jane would know about , that are expressing sort of the distance of , um , boundaries from peaks in the utterance and some local , um , range pitch range effects , like how close people are to their floor , are showing up in these classifiers , um , so we 're starting to see some patterns because the prosodic features are very noisy and so you you need a lot of data in order to model them .", "tgt": "abstract: the classifier segmentation is progressing well , especially in the use of prosody for identifying interruption ."}
{"src": "has has , uh ? we just i think , just talked about this the other day , but h has has anybody had a chance to try changing , uh , insertion penalty sort of things with the with the , uh uh , using the tandem system input for the ? as i said before , the uh using dan 's , uh , uh , vocal tract normalization option works very well . but the plp features work um , uh , you know , continue to improve the , well , but if you add them all up you have , uh , almost five percent difference now . and i think i agree with you that if we fixed lots of different things and they would all add up , we would probably have a a a competitive system . but i think not that much of it is due to the front - end per se . i think maybe a couple percent of it is , as far as i can see from this . eh at this point i 'm as i mean , you know e i 'm wondering is it can we expect , uh , a tandem system to do better than a properly trained you know , a gaussian system trained directly on the features with , you know , the right ch choice of parameters ?", "tgt": "abstract: work on the front end continues , with improvements of 3-5 % being made ."}

{"src": "and the , uh porzel and the , uh , smartkom group are collecting some dialogues . basically they have one person sitting in here , looking at a picture , and a wizard sitting in another room somewhere . and , uh , they 're doing a travel task . but it starts where the wizard is pretending to be a computer and it goes through a , uh , speech generation system . should this be part of the corpus or not ? and my attitude was yes , because there might be people who are using this corpus for acoustics , as opposed to just for language . we simulate a computer breakdown halfway through the session , and so then after that , the person 's told that they 're now talking to a , uh to a human . but of course they do n't know that it 's the same person both times . and i said , `` well that 's silly , if if we 're gon na try to do it for a corpus , there might be people who are interested in acoustics . `` i i would not say it was part of the meetings corpus . so it 's it it i guess it the begs the question of what is the meeting corpus . i think it 's i i think i th think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key . well , this has two or more people conversing with each other . we give everyone who 's involved as their own user id , give it session i ds , let all the tools that handle meeting recorder handle it , or do we wan na special case it ? well , it it makes sense to handle it with the same infrastructure , since we do n't want to duplicate things unnecessarily . but as far as distributing it , we should n't label it as part of this meeting corpus . because we have , like , meetings that have a reason . and and those and this sounds like it 's more of an experimental setup . it 's scenario - based , it 's it 's human - computer interface it 's really pretty different . it 's just that it 's , you know , different directory , it 's called something different , it 's and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction , rather than another type of interaction . well , i don i would n't call reading digits `` meetings `` . well , but but , i put it under the same directory tree . i mean , i do n't care what directory tree you have it under .", "tgt": "decisions: after discussing the human-computer interaction smartkom data , the group decide that different types of data can be included in the meeting corpus , but that it should be structured into different directories according to data type ."}

{"src": "um , or we could try some automated methods . and my my tendency right now is , well , if ibm comes back with this meeting and the transcript is good , just let them do it . yeah , i mean , i guess the so the difference if if , um , if the ibm stuff works out , the difference in the job would be that they p primarily would be checking through things that were already done by someone else ? we could let ibm transcribe it .", "tgt": "decisions: the group decide to use ibm transcription of the digits , in addition to automatic methods ."}

{"src": "we 're about we 're about half halfway through our disk right now . so , once everything gets converted over to the disks we 're supposed to be using we 'll be probably , uh , seventy - five percent . i 'm much more concerned about the backed - up . what about putting the stuff on , like , c - cd - rom or dvd or something ? i mean , when i say two or three years what i 'm saying is that i have had disks which are gone in a year . but , uh i i you do n't want to per p have your only copy on a media that fails . so so how about putting them on that plus , like on a on on dat or some other medium that is n't risky ? icsi already has a perfectly good tape system and it 's more reliable . so for archiving , we 'll just use tape . but even without that , the back - up system is becoming saturated . but but this back - up system is smart enough to figure out that something has n't changed and does n't need to be backed - up again . well , but you can have it nw archive to you can have , uh , a non - backed - up disk nw archived ,", "tgt": "problems: disk space is an issue for the group , especially in terms of back-up , which is 75 % full: dvds or cds are unreliable and can not be used , and although tape is reliable , this creates access issues ."}

{"src": "uh part of the reason i think part of the reason that adam was so interested in uh the speechcorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes but uh by i i would suggest you return one . because we we you know , we we have n't used it at all . one would probably be fine . maybe we could do like a student project , you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool . i mean if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more", "tgt": "decisions: after evaluating the use of the crosspads , the group decide to return one , and also keep one which will be left out in meetings to encourage its use ."}
{"src": "we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a pda with a wireless card . and and that way you can synchronize very easily with the the the meeting i mean for what what you 've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else , maybe we could do like a student project , you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool . i mean if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more", "tgt": "decisions: use of pdas and buttons for note-taking will be investigated , along with using the data for a student research project ."}

{"src": "but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either but it does mean you need to be running a web server . and so it it 's pretty big and complex . uh and it would be difficult to port to windows uh the other option is dan did the tcl - tk thisl gui front - end for broadcast news", "tgt": "problems: improving the thisl front-end user interface may be difficult if it is to run on windows as a web server tcl-tk may need to be used instead ."}
{"src": "so yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in xml", "tgt": "problems: more information on xml transcription formats is required for the creation of the tools ."}
{"src": "oh , quick question on that . is do we have the the seat information ? the seat information is on the key files for the ones which but i just had n't ever been putting it in the key files . i never knew we were supposed to put it in the key file . i mean this is why i wan na use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text because with the plain text it 's very easy to skip those things . yeah and then the other thing also that thilo noticed is , on the microphone , on channel zero it says hand - held mike or crown mike , you actually have to say which one . and then uh also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under `` participants `` they were filled in under `` description `` . the the one that shows up here , that will flash yellow if the mike is n't connected .", "tgt": "problems: information for key files , such as microphone type , seating , and participant information , is not being properly recorded , and in some cases the microphones are n't working properly ."}

{"src": "we we used them a couple times , and i have uh so my my feeling on it is that i think in principle it 's a really nice idea , and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . on the other hand , i the down side for me was that i think the pen is really noisy . so that you can you have a record of whatever it is you 've written . so i if you take notes it 's a great little device . and one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because uh we were interested in in higher - level things , not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth so that it 's synchronized with the time on that and then you have to download to an application , and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you wan na do anything with this information . and you do n't wan na take notes well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wan na make an x", "tgt": "problems: the crosspads have not been used to their full potential , which is because of a number of problems regarding their use:"}

{"src": "so i 've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected that 's the thing that i sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages so jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but i do n't really think there 's much to talk about . i 'm gon na send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to suggest edits . so but it 's just transcripts , not the not the audio ? nope , they 'll have access to the audio also . because the transcripts might not be right . so , um the audio that they 're gon na have access to , will that be the uncompressed version ? or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and yeah , it 's it 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , uh , uh , it takes too long to do random access decompression .", "tgt": "abstract: web pages have been set up to show transcription status and to allow participants to approve transcripts ."}
{"src": "um , darpa demo status , not much to say . the back - end stuff is working out fine . and , also um , i was just showing andreas , i got um an x waves kind of display , and i do n't know how much more we can do with it with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom", "tgt": "abstract: darpa demos are progressing well with the back-end indexed to allow front-end filtering , and a potential demo ideas investigated which would use x waves ."}
{"src": "i 've been putting together uh transcriber things for windows but but it would be cool if the transcriber interface had like another window for the you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform . and see the pitch contours also . just record the audio clip and show an image and i think that 's and , the more live , the better , but uh , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent . so i think for a lot of reasons , i think it would be very nice to have this transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it", "tgt": "abstract: transcriber is now working for windows , however live pitch contours may not work in the time available ."}
{"src": "and the last i item on the agenda is disk issues yet again . we 're we 're only about thirty percent on the second disk . but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings .", "tgt": "abstract: backed-up disk space is now fine , however temporary space is running out fast ."}
{"src": "uh , you know dave johnson is gone for , like , ten days , i mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , so this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to dave , but at any rate i think that there 's a there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need", "tgt": "abstract: interim measures are discussed while sysadmin are away ."}
{"src": "um yot i tested the uh the sort of final version of the plp configuration um on development test data for for this year 's hub - five test set . and the recognition performance was exactly , and i mean exactly up to the you know , the first decimal , same as with the uh mel cepstra front - end . they they were the males i think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really . and then the really nice thing was that if if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement .", "tgt": "abstract: improvement has been made in the final version of the plp , which shows better female performance , and combined with mel ceptra offers 1.5 % improvement ."}
{"src": "and then we had some results on digits , uh , with um and the reason is basically there 's a whole bunch of read speech data in the hub - five training set .", "tgt": "abstract: digit performance also improved thanks to training using scripted speech data ."}
{"src": "and then i th guess chuck and i had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system", "tgt": "abstract: progress has also been made in sri alignment for tandem system ."}
{"src": "so something that we wan na do next meeting is is uh to put together um , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it , um , that we 've done . i mean just sort of bulletize i mean o e do do i can i can dream up text but this is basically gon na lead to the annual report . so just a week from tomorrow ? um uh one thing i mean we in past meetings we had um also a you know various variously talked about the um work that w uh was happening sort of on the on the recognition side well , it 's that it 's just gon na be ver very boring for people who are not you know , sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system . well , ok , so how many how many people here would not be interested in uh in a meeting about recognition ? liz and jane probably . why do n't we alternate this meeting every other week ? but i do i do n't i mean a lot of times lately it seems like we do n't really have enough for a full meeting on meeting recorder . and then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting . uh . so uh . um . let 's chat about it with liz and jane when we get a chance , see what they think and", "tgt": "abstract: the group note that the annual report needs to be worked on for next week , and it is also suggested to hold recognition meetings separately , however these issues will be discussed in more detail at the next meeting ."}
{"src": "because i i need to ask jane whether it 's it would be ok for her um , s some of her people to transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the smartkom data collection , which is these short like five or seven minute sessions . but to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started . and so um i wanted to ask jane if if uh , you know , maybe one of their transcribers could could do i mean since these are very short , that should really be uh ,", "tgt": "decisions: jane will be contacted to see whether transcribers could work on a small amount of smartkom data , in order to get the project moving ."}

{"src": "but but it would be cool if the transcriber interface had like another window for the you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform . and see the pitch contours also . just record the audio clip and show an image and i think that 's and , the more live , the better , but uh , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent . so i think for a lot of reasons , i think it would be very nice to have this transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it", "tgt": "decisions: displaying pitch contours live in transcriber would be desirable for the demo , however , if the group run out of time , the group note that they could generate this statically using powerpoint ."}

{"src": "well , maybe it should get another rack . uh , you know dave johnson is gone for , like , ten days , i have um i have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer . i mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , well i sent that message out to , i guess , you and dave asking for if we could get some disk . the sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine . so they do n't want to stack up external drives . so this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to dave , i think part of the reason why dave ca n't get the the new machines up is because he does n't have room in the machine room right now . but at any rate i think that there 's a there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need", "tgt": "problems: various options are suggested about adding extra drives , externally to their machines , or to the server , but these can not be resolved until after the relevant sysadmin person returns from a break in 10 days time ."}

{"src": "and uh and the other the the last topic i had here was , um , uh d dave 's fine offer to to , uh , do something on this . i mean he 's doing he 's working on other things , but to to do something on this project . so the question is , `` where where could we , uh , uh , most use dave 's help ? `` and , um , trying to have a closer look at the perhaps the , um , speech , uh , noise detection or , uh , voiced - sound - unvoiced - sound detection let 's fall back to that . but i think the first responsibility is sort of to figure out if there 's something that , uh , an an additional what an additional clever person could help with when we 're really in a crunch for time . but if we could think of some some piece that 's that 's well defined , that he could help with , he 's expressing a will willingness to do that . so wh that so the the other suggestion that just came up was , well what about having him work on the , uh , multilingual super f superset kind of thing . uh , coming up with that and then , you know , training it training a net on that , say , um , from from , uh from timit or something .", "tgt": "decisions: people are to consider what me034 could do on the project to speed things up , though creating the phoneme superset is a possibility ."}
{"src": "stephane , where you 're doing your computations . it 's nutmeg and mustard , i think , well , you 're the you 're the disk czar now . well , i 'll check on that .", "tgt": "decisions: speaker me018 is to look into the machines that mn007 has been running data on to find out what they are ."}
{"src": "an another question occurred to me is is what were you folks planning to do about normalization ? well , we were thinking about using this systematically for all the experiments . but we think perhaps we can use the the best , uh , um , uh , normalization scheme as ogi is using , so , with parameters that they use there , i mean it 's i i we we seem to have enough dimensions as it is .", "tgt": "decisions: rather than consider level of normalization as a further dimension to the project , whatever ogi finds the best will be used systematically ."}

{"src": "so they 're they 're doing the the vad i guess they mean voice activity detection so again , it 's the silence so um their uh the results look pretty good . so um i think that it 's it 's nice to do that in this because in fact , it 's gon na give a better word error result and therefore will help within an evaluation . um . uh , as you know , part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the word models are pretty bad and nobody wants has has approached improving them . so um the question we 're gon na wan na go through next week when hynek shows up i guess is given that we 've been we 're uh looking at uh , by then i guess , combinations of features and multi - band uh , and we 've been looking at cross - language , cross task issues . but they 've been looking at uh at these issues . at the on - line normalization and the uh voice activity detection . and i guess when he comes here we 're gon na have to start deciding about um what do we choose from what we 've looked at to um blend with some group of things in what they 've looked at and once we choose that , how do we split up the effort ?", "tgt": "abstract: there was also discussion of some of the work being conducted by research partners ogi , including how the two groups should best work together ."}
{"src": "we have the little tiny ibm machine that might someday grow up to be a big ibm machine . it 's got s slots for eight , i think we only got two so far , yeah , i mean you can check with uh dave johnson . and somebody could do you know , uh , check out uh the multi - threading libraries . i mean , i guess the prudent thing to do would be for somebody to do the work on on getting our code running on that machine with two processors even though there are n't five or eight .", "tgt": "abstract: the group also briefly touched upon resource issues ."}
{"src": "uh so , act actually we have discussed uh @ @ um , these and and we were thinking perhaps that uh the way we use the tandem is not if we trained the networks on the on a language and a t or a specific task , um , what we ask is to the network is to put the bound the decision boundaries somewhere in the space . and uh mmm and ask the network to put one , at one side of the for for a particular phoneme at one side of the boundary decision boundary and so there is kind of reduction of the information there that 's not correct because if we change task and if the phonemes are not in the same context in the new task , obviously the decision boundaries are not should not be at the same place . but the way the feature gives the the way the network gives the features is that it reduce completely the it removes completely the information a lot of information from the the features by uh uh placing the decision boundaries at optimal places for one kind of data the way we we do it now is that we have a neural network and basically the net network is trained almost to give binary decisions .", "tgt": "decisions: speaker mn007 would like to investigate increasing the context of the phonemes ."}
{"src": "and once you the other thing is that once you represent start representing more and more context it is uh much more um specific to a particular task in language . for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will never occur in one language and will occur frequently in the other , the issue of getting enough training for a particular kind of context becomes harder . we already actually do n't have a huge amount of training data the way we we do it now is that we have a neural network and basically the net network is trained almost to give binary decisions . but it would still be even more of a binary decision . that would be even even more distinct of a binary decision . i mean we we could disagree about it at length but the the real thing is if you 're interested in it you 'll probably try it and and we 'll see .", "tgt": "decisions: speaker mn013 does agree with mn007s assessment of the outcome , and points out the lack of data , but acknowledges that if mn007 is interested he will go ahead with it ."}

{"src": "uh , probably the neural net", "tgt": "decisions: it is agreed that he should start with the neural net training , then work on htk ."}
{"src": "but actually there is something important , is that um we made a lot of assumption concerning the on - line normalization and we just noticed uh recently that uh the approach that we were using was not uh leading to very good results when we used the straight features to htk . so what we see that is there is that um uh the way we were doing this was not correct , when we use the networks our number are better that uh pratibha results . and basically , the first thing is the mmm , alpha uh value . um , i used point five percent , which was the default value in the in the programs here . and pratibha used five percent . i assume that this was not important because uh previous results from from dan and show that basically the both both values g give the same same uh results . it was true on uh ti - digits but it 's not true on italian . uh , second thing is the initialization of the stuff . actually , uh what we were doing is to start the recursion from the beginning of the utterance . and using initial values that are the global mean and variances measured across the whole database . and pratibha did something different is that he uh she initialed the um values of the mean and variance by computing this on the twenty - five first frames of each utterance . mmm . there were other minor differences , so . uh , i changed the code uh and now we have a baseline that 's similar to the ogi baseline . well , the the the networks are retaining with these new features .", "tgt": "problems: incorrect assumptions were made when considering the on-line normalization for the main task . members used different values to a previous study , and whilst it was believed not to make a difference , it does , so networks are being retrained ."}
{"src": "there there is another difference , is that the noise the noises are different . well , for for the italian part i mean the uh the um networks are trained with noise from aurora ti - digits , and perhaps the noise are quite different from the noises in the speech that italian . uh um now , what 's the noise condition um of the training data the noise condition is the same so there 's not a statistical sta a strong st statistically different noise characteristic between uh the training and test no these are the s s s same noises , at least at least for the first for the well - matched ,", "tgt": "problems: currently working with noise conditions being the same in training and test data , but there is nothing which matches the noise on the italian test data ."}
{"src": "none", "tgt": "problems: in fact no other language matches the noise from aurora data ."}
{"src": "yeah , so for the italian the results are uh stranger so what appears is that perhaps spanish is not very close to italian because uh , well , when using the the network trained only on spanish it 's the error rate is almost uh twice the baseline error rate .", "tgt": "problems: spanish was being used to train for italian as it was assumed they were the most similar , but that may not be as close a match as thought ."}
{"src": "so they 're they 're doing the the vad i guess they mean voice activity detection so again , it 's the silence so um their uh the results look pretty good . so um i think that it 's it 's nice to do that in this because in fact , it 's gon na give a better word error result and therefore will help within an evaluation . um . uh , as you know , part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the word models are pretty bad and nobody wants has has approached improving them .", "tgt": "problems: ogi have an interesting approach to voice activation detection for removing blocks of silence , that shows good results , but currently the word model being used is too poor to make good use of this and no one is working on improving it ."}

{"src": "yeah , that seems like a good thing to do , probably , not uh again a short - term sort of thing . the two of the main issues perhaps are still the language dependency and the noise dependency . and perhaps to try to reduce the language dependency , we should focus on finding some other kind of training targets . for moment you use we use phonetic targets but we could also use articulatory targets , soft targets , and perhaps even , um use networks that does n't do classification but just regression and well , basically com com compute features and noit not , nnn , features without noise . i mean uh , transform the fea noisy features in other features that are not noisy .", "tgt": "decisions: same goes for anything else that comes up and looks interesting , leave it for just now ."}

{"src": "uh today we 're looking at a number of uh things we 're trying it 's only one small experiment to know what happened . to apply also to in include also the the silence of the mlp we have the fifty - six form and the silence to pick up the silence and we include those . the silence plus the klt output ? no they 're i think there is this silence in addition to the um klt outputs it is because we we we just keep uh we do n't keep all the dimensions after the klt and we not s we are not sure if we pick we have the silence . so we try to add the silence also in addition to the these twenty - eight dimensions . do you e um they mentioned made some uh when i was on the phone with sunil they they mentioned some weighting scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers . um well it 's uh forty percent for ti - digit , sixty for all the speechdat - cars , um and we do n't have the ti - digits part yet ? generally what you observe with ti - digits is that the result are very close whatever the the system . so it looks to me i guess the same given that we have to take the filt ones out of the the running because of this delay problem so it looks to me like the ones you said i agree are are the ones to look at but i just would add the the the second row one so if we can know what how many words are in each and then um dave uh dave promised to get us something tomorrow which will be there as far as they 've gotten friday and then we 'll operate with that do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on tuesday ? i think we fixed on tuesday , yeah . i yeah , ok except that we do have to write it up . so maybe what we do is we we we uh as soon as we get the data from them we start the training and so forth but we start the write - up right away because as you say there there 's only minor differences between these . i think you we could we could start soon , yeah . write up something . well anyway , sounds like there 'll be a lot to do just to work with our partners to fill out the tables over the next uh next few days yes , so i mean i think we have to actually get it done tuesday um so then next thursday we can sort of have a little aftermath but my assumption is that we basically have to be done tuesday .", "tgt": "abstract: they discussed most recent results , finalized plans to continue and discussed the work required and timing needed for completion of this stage of the project ."}

{"src": "so you know how many words are in uh one of these test sets ? um it 's it depends well the well matched is generally larger than the other sets see the i mean the reason i 'm asking is is is we have all these small differences and i do n't know how seriously to take them , right ? so uh i if if you had uh just you know to give an example , if you had uh um if you had a thousand words then uh a a tenth of a percent would just be one word , so so it would n't mean anything . um so um yeah it be kind of i 'd kind of like to know what the sizes of these test sets were actually . well also just to know the numbers , so anyway if you could just mail out what those numbers are and then then that that be great .", "tgt": "decisions: they were also asked to mail round numbers detailing the size of their test-sets , so that group members can assess the seriousness of figures such as word error rates ."}
{"src": "so it looks to me i guess the same given that we have to take the filt ones out of the the running because of this delay problem so it looks to me like the ones you said i agree are are the ones to look at but i just would add the the the second row one so basically we will i think we 'll try to to focus on these three architectures and and perhaps i was thinking also a fourth one with just just a single klt yeah , i mean that would be pretty low maintenance to try it .", "tgt": "decisions: there are now just 4 architectures that will be carried forward for testing ."}

{"src": "yeah , actually the way the final score is computed is quite funny . it 's not a mean of word error rate . it 's not a weighted mean of word error rate , it 's a weighted mean of improvements . which means that actually the weight on the well - matched is well i well what what what happened is that if you have a small improvement or a small if on the well - matched case it will have uh huge influence on the improvement compared to the reference because the reference system is is is quite good for for the well - ma well - matched case also . so they do improvement in terms of uh accuracy ? rather than word error rate ? no , it 's compared to the word er it 's improvement on the word error rate , so if you have uh ten percent error and you get five percent absolute uh improvement then that 's fifty percent . ok . so what you 're saying then is that if it 's something that has a small word error rate , then uh a even a relatively small improvement on it , in absolute terms , will show up as quite quite large in this . but yeah that 's that 's it 's the notion of relative improvement . that 's why i 've been saying we should be looking at word error rate uh and and not not at at accuracies . i mean uh we probably should have standardized on that all the way through . but you 're but when you look at the numbers , your sense of the relative size of things is quite different .", "tgt": "problems: there is some confusion over what the results produced mean , since it appears they are weighted , which biases improvements in some cases quite heavily ."}

{"src": "uh i 'll try to write up in my next stat status report a nice description of what he 's doing ,", "tgt": "decisions: in his next status report , me026 will summarise the work he has been researching ."}
{"src": "but to me it just it just meant a practical point that um if we want to publish results on digits that that people pay attention to we probably should uh cuz we 've had the problem before that you get show some nice improvement on something that 's that 's uh , uh it seems like too large a number , and uh uh people do n't necessarily take it so seriously .", "tgt": "problems: the digit recognition system is still not working well enough , they must get better results if they want to publish and be noticed ."}
{"src": "our back - end is is fairly simple but until now , well , the attempts to improve it or have fail i mean so to so there 's there 's there 's two things being affected . i mean . one is that that , you know , there 's something simple that 's wrong with the back - end . we 've been playing a number of states uh i i do n't know if he got to the point of playing with the uh number of gaussians yet but , yeah , so far he had n't gotten any big improvement , but that 's all with the same amount of data which is pretty small . perhaps it 's not related , the amount of data but the um recording conditions . i uh but i 'm i 'm almost certain that it it i mean , that it has to do with the um amount of training data . it it 's it 's orders of magnitude off . let 's see , in the in these multi - train things did we include noisy data in the training ? i mean , that could be hurting us actually , for the clean case . you know , i do n't think there 's anything magical here . it 's , you know , we used a simple htk system with a modest amount of data . and this is a a , you know , modern uh system uh has has a lot of nice points to it . so . i mean , the htk is an older htk , even . i mean , there 's even though it 's close - miked there 's still there really is background noise . um . and uh i suspect when the ti - digits were recorded if somebody fumbled or said something wrong or something that they probably made them take it over . it was not i mean there was no attempt to have it be realistic in any in any sense at all . ti - digit is it 's very , very clean and it 's like studio recording whereas these meeting recorder digits sometimes you have breath noise", "tgt": "problems: they have not really made many improvements , which may be due to their comparatively small training set , or the conditions the data is recorded under ."}
{"src": "uh . the problem is that it 's very big and we still have to think how to where to put it uh either some delay and we if we put it on the server side , it does n't work , because on the server side features you already have lda applied from the f from the terminal side and so you accumulate the delay", "tgt": "problems: the new vad is quite a large network , and adds a delay to the process ."}
{"src": "so wha where did this good vad come from ? it 's um from ogi . this is the one they had originally ? yeah , but they had to get rid of it because of the space , but the abso assumption is that we will be able to make a vad that 's small and that works fine .", "tgt": "problems: this caused ogi to drop it , though speaker mn007 is assuming that a smaller and equally effective system can be developed ."}
{"src": "but the other thing is uh to use a different vad entirely . i i do n't know what the thinking was amongst the the the the etsi folk but um if everybody agreed sure let 's use this vad and take that out of there they just want , apparently they do n't want to fix the vad because they think there is some interaction between feature extraction and and vad or frame dropping but they still want to just to give some um requirement for this vad because it 's it will not be part of they do n't want it to be part of the standard . so there just will be some requirements that are still not uh not yet uh ready i think . but i do n't think we need to be stuck on using our or ogi 's vad . we could use somebody else 's if it 's smaller you know , as long as it did the job .", "tgt": "problems: the alternative is to get yet another vad form somewhere else , though it 's not clear if they will even be required in the final system ."}
{"src": "yeah , it 's it 's another problem . if you look at this um spectrum , is it the mel - filters ? and what we clearly see is that in some cases , and the the harmonics are resolved by the f well , there are still appear after mel - filtering , and it happens for high pitched voice because the width of the lower frequency mel - filters is sometimes even smaller than the pitch . so we were thinking to modify the mel - spectrum to have something that that 's smoother on low frequencies .", "tgt": "problems: there are some problems with the voiced / unvoiced feature detection , because some pitches are slipping through the filtering ."}

{"src": "i have something just fairly brief to report on . and but it runs much much faster . i i think m it only took something like , uh , three or four hours to do the full training , as opposed to wh what , sixteen hours or something like that ? oh , the other thing that i did was , um , i compiled the htk stuff for the linux boxes . there was a conference call this tuesday . i do n't know yet the what happened tuesday , but the points that they were supposed to discuss is still , uh , things like the weights , so what happened since , um , last week is there was a start of some effort on something related to voicing or something . so basically we try to , uh , find good features that could be used for voicing detection ,", "tgt": "abstract: they discussed a conference call with project partners , there have been some developments that should help speed up experiments , along with some progress made in the current area they are looking , voiced / unvoiced detection ."}

{"src": "there was a conference call this tuesday . i do n't know yet the what happened tuesday , but the points that they were supposed to discuss is still , uh , things like the weights ,", "tgt": "problems: there was a conference call for the aurora project , but no one from icsi was involved ."}
{"src": "do you know who was who was since we were n't in on it , uh , do you know who was in from ogi ? but the points that they were supposed to discuss is still , uh , things like the weights , i have no idea . so the points were the the weights how to weight the different error rates that are obtained from different language and and conditions . it 's not clear that they will keep the same kind of weighting . some people are arguing that it would be better to have weights on well , to to combine error rates before computing improvement . and so , perhaps they will change the weights to well , i mean , the fact that it 's inconsistent is an obvious mistake . but the question is , do you average the relative improvements or do you average the error rates and take the relative improvement maybe of that ? and the thing is it 's not just a pure average because there are these weightings . it 's just when you when you get all done , i think that they pro but i think they started off this process with the notion that you should be significantly better than the previous standard . so they said `` how much is significantly better ? and and so they said `` well , you know , you should have half the errors , `` or something , `` that you had before `` . but it does seem like i i it does seem like it 's more logical to combine them first but there is this this is this still this problem of weights . when when you combine error rate it tends to give more importance to the difficult cases , some people think that it 's more important to look at to have ten percent imp relative improvement on well - matched case than to have fifty percent on the m mismatched , and other people think that it 's more important to improve a lot on the mismatch it sounds like they do n't really have a good idea about what the final application is gon na be . i mean , they don they they do n't they do n't really know , i think . so the argument for that being the the the more important thing , is that you 're gon na try and do that , but you wan na see how badly it deviates from that when when when the , uh it 's a little different . the opposite argument is you 're never really gon na have a good sample of all these different things . i gather that in these meetings it 's it 's really tricky to make anything ac make any policy change because everybody has has , uh , their own opinion but there is probably a a big change that will be made is that the the baseline th they want to have a new baseline , perhaps , and apparently , uh , some people are pushing to still keep this fifty percent number . so they want to have at least fifty percent improvement on the baseline , so whose vad uh , they did n't decide yet .", "tgt": "problems: not only are the group unsure what if anything was decided , but project changes are being considered including changing the baseline and improvement weighting , though everyone has their own opinion on these matters ."}

{"src": "uh , so the next question to ask , which is i think the one that that that andreas was dre addressing himself to in the lunch meeting , is , um , we 're not supposed to adjust the back - end , but anybody using the system would . if you were just adjusting the back - end , how much better would you do , uh , in noise ? uh , because the language scaling and insertion penalties and so forth are probably set to be about right for mel cepstrum . but , um , they 're probably not at all set right for these things , as for these other things , it may turn out that , uh , it 's kind of reasonable . i mean , andreas gave a very reasonable response , and he 's probably not gon na be the only one who 's gon na say this in the future people people within this tight - knit community who are doing this evaluation are accepting , uh , more or less , that these are the rules . but , people outside of it who look in at the broader picture are certainly gon na say `` well , wait a minute . you 're doing all this standing on your head , uh , on the front - end , when all you could do is just adjust this in the back - end with one s one knob . `` so we have to at least , i think , determine that that 's not true , and as you say as you point out finding ways to then compensate for that in the front - end also then becomes a priority for this particular test , that 's permitted ? well , ogi does did that . at some point they did that for for the voice activity detector . the rules as i understand it , is that in principle the italian and the spanish and the english italian and the finnish and the english ? were development data and spanish , yeah . on which you could adjust things . and the and the german and danish were the evaluation data . and then when they finally actually evaluated things they used everything . it it does n't appear that there 's strong evidence that even though things were somewhat tuned on those three or four languages , that that going to a different language really hurt you . and the noises were not exactly the same . i mean they were different drives . different cars . it 's tuned more than , you know , a a a a you 'd really like to have something that needed no particular noise at all , but that 's not really what this contest is . that 's something i 'd like to understand before we actually use something from it , it 's probably something that , mmm , the you know , the , uh , experiment designers did n't really think about , because i think most people are n't doing trained systems , or , you know , uh , systems that are like ours , where you actually use the data to build models . i mean , they just doing signal - processing . except that , uh , that 's what we used in aurora one , and then they designed the things for aurora - two knowing that we were doing that . and they did n't forbid us to build models on the data ? no . but , i think i think that it it it probably would be the case that if , say , we trained on italian , uh , data and then , uh , we tested on danish data and it did terribly , uh , that that it would look bad . and i think someone would notice maybe that 's maybe a topic especially if you talk with him when i 'm not here , that 's a topic you should discuss with hynek to , you know , double check it 's ok .", "tgt": "problems: the main project the group is working on , aurora , has a number of rules attaches as to what developers can and can not play with , but this needs to be clarified ."}

{"src": "there is a plenty of there 're plenty of issues . like the voice activity detector , well and what happened was that they realized that if two leading proposals , which was french telecom alcatel , and us both had uh voice activity detector . and i said `` well big surprise , i mean we could have told you that n n n four months ago , except we did n't because nobody else was bringing it up `` . obviously french telecom did n't volunteer this information either , cuz we were working on mainly on voice activity detector for past uh several months and everybody said `` well but this is not fair . we did n't know that . `` and of course uh the it 's not working on features really . and so then ev ev everybody else says `` well we should we need to do a new eval evaluation without voice activity detector , or we have to do something about it `` . and in principle i uh i we agreed . but in that case , uh we would like to change the uh the algorithm because uh if we are working on different data , we probably will use a different set of tricks . but unfortunately nobody ever officially can somehow acknowledge that this can be done , because french telecom was saying `` no , no , no , now everybody has access to our code , so everybody is going to copy what we did . `` well our argument was everybody ha has access to our code , and everybody always had access to our code . we never uh uh denied that . we thought that people are honest , that if you copy something and if it is protected protected by patent then you negotiate , or something , but and french telecom was saying `` no , no , no , there is a lot of little tricks which uh sort of uh can not be protected and you guys will take them , `` which probably is also true . and i think they have to be honest in the long run , because winning proposal again uh what will be available th is will be a code . so the uh the people can go to code and say `` well listen this is what you stole from me `` the biggest problem of course is that f that alcatel french telecom cl claims `` well we fulfilled the conditions . we are the best . and e and other people do n't feel that , because they so they now decided that that is the whole thing will be done on well - endpointed data , still not clear if we are going to run the if we are allowed to run uh uh new algorithms , because uh we would fight for that , really . at least our experience is that only endpointing a a mel cepstrum gets uh gets you twenty - one percent improvement overall and twenty - seven improvement on speechdat - car", "tgt": "problems: there was disagreement at the project meeting over two group development of voice activity detectors , particularly since one group makes their code available to all and the others do not ."}

{"src": "none", "tgt": "decisions: * na *"}
{"src": "o o one thing , um , i noticed is that , um , the mean subtraction seems to make the pzm signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized . so i was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the aurora baseline system is just as a kind of gain control ? cuz some of the pzm signals sound pretty quiet if you do n't amplify them . i do n't see why why your signal is louder after processing , i do n't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect . i mean , i think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have better signal - to - noise ratio . i think , maybe i did n't look , but one thing that makes a difference is this dc offset compensation . uh , eh do y did you have a look at at the meet uh , meeting digits , if they have a dc component , no . the dc component could be negligible . i mean , any all of the mikes have the dc removal some capacitor sitting right in that bias it . yeah . the microphone is n't gon na pass any dc . actually , there are instrumentation mikes that that do pass go down to dc . no , it 's the electronics . then there 's amplification afterwards . you can have dc offset in the data .", "tgt": "problems: a couple of issues have arisen that need to be looked into further such as dc-offset and effects of pzm signals ."}
{"src": "well , we s decide to m to to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . but i 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful . it 's quite a lot it 's a lot of work . and i want to know if if we have some feeling that the result i do n't have any feeling if this will work better than apply vts aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel in filter bank domain . i do n't i do n't know absolutely nothing . yeah . well , you 're i think you 're the first one here to work with vts , uh , maybe we could call someone else up who has , i do n't i do n't have a good feeling for it .", "tgt": "problems: speaker fn002 is worried about running vts in the cepstral domain , because it requires a lot of work , and it is not clear that it will be much better than running it in the mel domain ."}

{"src": "and then there 's um , another thing i wan na start looking at , um , wi is , um , the choice of the analysis window length . with the with the htk set - up i should be able to do some experiments , on just varying that length , say between one and three seconds , in a few different reverberation conditions , i guess one thing that might also be an issue , uh , cuz part of what you 're doing is you 're getting a a spectrum over a bunch of different kinds of speech sounds . and so it might matter how fast someone was talking for instance . you know , if you if if if there 's a lot of phones in one second maybe you 'll get a a really good sampling of all these different things , and and , uh , on the other hand if someone 's talking slowly maybe you 'd need more . a actually i was just thinking about what i was asking about earlier , wi which is about having less than say twelve seconds in the smartkom system to do the mean subtraction . you said in systems where you use cepstral mean subtraction , they concatenate utterances and , do you know how they address this issue of , um , testing versus training ? i think what they do is they do it always on - line , i mean , that you just take what you have from the past , that you calculate the mean of this and subtract the mean . and , um , so so in tha in that case , wh what do they do when they 're t um , performing the cepstral mean subtraction on the training data ? so because you 'd have hours and hours of training data . so do they cut it off and start over ? and so if you 're splitting things up into utterances so , for instance , in a dialogue system , where you 're gon na be asking , uh , you know , th for some information , there 's some initial th something . and i think the heuristics of exactly how people handle that and how they handle their training i 'm sure vary from place to place . so you 'd you and so in training you would start over at at every new phone call or at every new speaker . it it seems to be the best what wh wh what what we can do in this moment is multi - condition training . and every when we now start introducing some some noise reduction technique we we introduce also somehow artificial distortions . and these artificial distortions uh , i have the feeling that they are the reason why why we have the problems in this multi - condition training . that means the h m ms we trained , they are they are based on gaussians , and if we introduce now this this u spectral subtraction , or wiener filtering stuff i mean , this is your noise estimate and you somehow subtract it or do whatever . and then i think what you do is you introduce some some artificial distribution in this in in the models . so so , basically our our position is that , um , we should n't be unduly constraining the latency at this point because we 're all still experimenting with trying to make the performance better in the presence of noise . uh , there is a minority in that group who is a arguing who are arguing for um , uh , having a further constraining of the latency . so we 're s just continuing to keep aware of what the trade - offs are and , you know , what what do we gain from having longer or shorter latencies ? well , france telecom was was was very short latency it was in the order of thirty milliseconds", "tgt": "abstract: while on these topics , related areas discussed included recognition window length , training versus test set sizes , artificial distortion and latency concerns ."}

{"src": "so instead they went to yosemite and bonded , and and they came out with a single single piece of software . so it 's another another victory for international collaboration . so so you guys have combined or you 're going to be combining the software ? well , the piece of software has , like , plenty of options , so depending on that , it it becomes either spectral subtraction or wiener filtering . but the thing is the important thing is that there is a piece of software that you that we all will be using now .", "tgt": "abstract: they have developed a piece of software which allows them to implement their two main approaches to dealing with noise ."}

{"src": "i mean , i gather you have it sounds like you have a few more days of of nailing things down with the software and so on . but and then but , um , arguably what we should do is , even though the software can do many things , we should for now pick a set of things , and not change that . and then focus on everything that 's left . so there 's the neural net issue . there 's the vad issue . and , uh , there 's the second stream thing . what was the issue with the vad ? i guess they still allow two hundred milliseconds on either side or some ? and all the speech pauses , which is sometimes on the speechdat - car you have pauses that are more than one or two seconds . we cou we can do better , i think , so , our current vad is is more than twenty percent , while their is fourteen . that 's that 's a good set of work that that , uh just one more thing . like , should we do something f more for the noise estimation , yeah . i was wondering about that .", "tgt": "abstract: with this in mind , they have decided to set most things , and concentrate on studying only a few key aspects , the neural network , the voice activity detector , and the noise estimation ."}
