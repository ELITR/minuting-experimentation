{"dialogue": "uh the buttons of course rubber , uh i uh suggest uh the basic battery . but solar energy is not very practical inside a house , and uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , i think , for uh for a simple remote , um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . no uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip ,", "summary": "abstract: the industrial designer suggested they use rubber push buttons ( and no scroll wheel ) , simple battery ( instead of solar cells or kinetic dynamo ) , and advanced chip ."}

{"dialogue": "well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . yeah , that 's great .", "summary": "decisions: making changeable fascias can allow for the integration of this or future fashion trends in the device ."}
{"dialogue": "well , as i said uh earlier i think the uh l _ c _ d _ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? and then below is the l _ c _ d _ screen ? and oh i think as you can see so , the l _ c _ d _ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . yeah , fine . <laugh>", "summary": "decisions: the team agreed to place the lcd at the bottom of the device , below the buttons ."}
