{"dialogue": "the first kick-off meeting . first the opening , then the rest . we m have to make a new remote control . it has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . so we will get back th on that . first we have to make a functional design . after that we have to make a conceptual design , and then after that a detailed design . so we 'll discuss that later .", "summary": "abstract: for the first meeting , the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings ."}
{"dialogue": "so first towe have to make a small painting . first you can save the documents . we have to do that every time we make something . and we have to use <other> the pen and the eraser . we all have to use this one . so i 'll make an example . um you can change some things . um format , line , and change it . <laugh> and you can change the colour . so and after it you have to save it . an elephant . <laugh> <laugh> so you 're next . uh a bird . now save ? okay .", "summary": "abstract: the group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform ."}
{"dialogue": "first i wan na hear from you . uh what are your experiences with remote controls . big one , they are uh not easy to use . and uh g big buttons , <other> m uh that 's easier to use than uhi think . big buttons , positive . uh well i think the the the goal of a remote control is that it 's it it has an influence on the t _ v _ set . and that it controls the channels and the the volume . and uh i i i think it 's positive if there 's a a led uh uh a led on the corner of the of the remote . and that if you push the button the led uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it 's working . but imy my experience is that it it it 's convenient to have that . uh at home we have a t _ v _ , a video uh recorder , a d _ v _ d _ player , and a satellite receiver . we have uh four distinctive remote controls for that . that 's not really ea easy . so it would be nice if we have one for all .", "summary": "abstract: they discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls , including ease of use , multiple systems and power indicators ."}
{"dialogue": "for our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . so what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? the weight . not not too heavy . not much buttons . that when you drop it , it wo n't break . like uh some kind of rubber on it . or hard uh hard plastic . uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . uh it between the couch and you ca n't find it . when you push a but a button on the t _ v _ , then you hear someuh some sort of bleep . yeah well that'sthat are good ideas . uh and looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . so probably plastic or something . uh yeah i think it uhfrom a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . on our website we can see what products we already have . and it should work with as many uh as possible of them . uh it it wo n't take a lot of batteries . so you don'two n't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks .", "summary": "abstract: they then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote ."}
