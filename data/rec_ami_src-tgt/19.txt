{"dialogue": "okay , project finance , selling price twenty five euros , profit aim fifty million euros . market range internationally sold . it 's got ta beca n't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . right , who 's got experiences with remote controls then ? is this a t _ v _ one we are supposed to make ? yeah . yeah it 's a t _ v _ remote control . are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that 's that 's big and i mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of t _ v _ and if you have whatever associated with t _ v _ the d _ v _ d _ player , or something like that , but like at the same time you do n't wan na really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . 'cause i i i mean i was thinking something that 's got different like maybe a a an l _ c _ d _ display on it that 's got different pages for different devices , but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . and then after we after we 've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if theseany of these ideas are feasible or not . so would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . could n't we have like one that comes out ? you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically . umhave uh one very complicated one on one side with <other> all the d _ v _ d _ and v _ c _ r _ access and stuff , and then on the other side o <other> one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and <other> minus , and the just the mute button , for example . i 'm not sure if it 's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . no , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . <other> d _ v _ d _ players , things like that . but also devices connected to the to the t _ v _ , i mean , be able to operate i think we should also have a back-up plan ofi 'cause i i i just think that it might be expensive to make something that but the the functions that we 're sure that we want are that it can control the t _ v _ , we should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that justthat is just for a t _ v _ , but it 's just a really good , nice one . but what 'll make it what 'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? have it be like ergonomic so it 's comfortable to use , or maybe even so something that 's for disabled people orbig buttons fortouchy buttons for <laugh> i think a flip up thing , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones ,", "summary": "abstract: the project manager discussed the project finances and the team engaged in a brainstorming session about various features to consider in designing a remote ."}
