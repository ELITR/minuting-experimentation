{"dialogue": "any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ? one thing i 'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there 's there 's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen l _ c _ d _ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . and therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket . with the price range we 're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our absolutely prohibitive , but you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion . i mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for <other> um running macros . would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the t _ v _ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the d _ v _ d _ player and it turns the t _ v _ on and onto the right channel as well , um um i 've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , i 've seen the bar-code design before , instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , and <other> the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games . i think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot . uh , you wan na be able to change angles in interactive television , so <other> we 'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , that 'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ? like uh control pads , you know of games , and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well . mm-hmm . the other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , something that just fits <other> fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . but of course , uh al al also allows forthe possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall , <other> . small , stylish , and something that 's just a little different . something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form ,", "summary": "abstract: the team then discussed various features to consider in producing the remote such as gaming options , an lcd screen , and combining functionality so as to control multiple devices ."}
