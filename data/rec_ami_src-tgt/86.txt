{"dialogue": "because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an l _ c _ d _ or not because it 's too expensive . and you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . you can uh choose the direction you have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the <laugh> for the speech recognition system here . and here the the switch that control if you want the the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? well so it 's a microphone array . oh it 's very costly , microphone array <laugh> . it 's just a single microphone , i i think uh we we put it here because i think when you when you are browsing your l _ c _ d _ you will be close to well it 's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . and here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . and uh so this remote control comes up with its charger . how many b battery is there ? is it n the two a _ a _ s batteries in it . a _ a _ rechargeable batteries . is that two or one ? <laugh> actually uh it 's a flexible thing . so and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone , it 's alright . i forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , this button is like the mouseis like a joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction and itthe additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button <laugh> . you can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . here i present another version without the l _ c _ d _ . so we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . the second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh i have to put the microphone also <laugh> . uh-huh and also the switch . basically it 's the same uh things uh uh as uh i presented before . but here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . press one button uh acting as a a enter button . so um yeah according to what you said it 's more robust to the user . and uh it 's also cheaper to produce . and i think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , and if you disable speech recognition system then ? w w i 'll i 'll come to that point later on . in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah . it 's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types . i think we have to investigate more on that , but <other> again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is a _ a _ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . lithium-ion may be a good one , again you pay for what you get , and it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so when you finish watching your t _ v _ <cough> and you the you t you turn off the t _ v _ , uh and then there 's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . so we did n't define the vocabulary so it 's up to the user to define and then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a aof t _ v _ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children .", "summary": "abstract: they demonstrated how to navigate through the menus and presented the voice recognition and energy source components and the charging stand ."}

{"dialogue": "i think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu so the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh in the market the people are not really interested with l _ c _ d _ , without l _ c _ d _ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested isfirst thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold . and the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative . of course in that we could put l _ c _ d _ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . and the third one is easy to use . since we have n't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the t _ v _ screen uh uh with just four buttons . well i think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself here you can findthese are the latest fashion updates , and so thisin paris and milanthey have detected this trends that the this year it 's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . so i think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes . and the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy <laugh> . yeah so uh <laugh> so finally we have these three criterias . one is fancy look , second is innovative , and third is easy to use .", "summary": "abstract: the marketing expert presented three important user requirements , and also the fruit and vegetable and spongy material trends in fashion ."}
{"dialogue": "soand we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this . so now you have with l _ c _ d _ and without l _ c _ d _ , so on this scale , if it is true , if it isif it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn'tit looks uhit does n't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . but who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ? according to you designers , on on this scale the l _ c _ d _ remote control . how do you lookhow does it look ? d is it very fancy or does n't look much fancy ? i 'll i 'll say three or four . <other> i think we can improve on the design . som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh <laugh> design . um we have been focused all all this <other> time on the <cough> on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . so i take three onwith l _ c _ d _ ? so without l _ c _ d _ how would you rate it ? uh four . i think it 's it 's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it 's not complicated so removing the l _ c _ d _ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . and in the sense of innovativeness , with l _ c _ d _ . well it 's it 's the same for both so <other> i will give a five , six . <laugh> from the innovation aspect i feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um <cough> the retrieval of t _ v _ programmes by content , and for nowand another innovation we have is simplicity andsimplicity , few buttons , we 've uh <other> a lot of functionalities . so without l _ c _ d _ ? mm for both it 's the the same innovations . so maybe i can put six to seven . actually uh to make it with l _ c _ d _ you make more efforts . then when it is without l _ c _ d _ there is not much innovativeness . so without l _ c _ d _ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? well i think both are really easy to use and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so so i will give a six for the easy to use . no it 's just if i i see the the f the rate i think it 's better to do it without l _ c _ d _ . because that 's with l _ c _ d _ just will increase the price , so i mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without l _ c _ d _ and without speech recognition . i have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . i think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people . for the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . for kids they want simply thes similarit for the old people they want simplicity , but but uh what i 'm trying to say here is that the umwe have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . so without l _ c _ d _ i just take it five ? um six . and it 's going to be much simpler to use .", "summary": "abstract: he then led an evaluation of the prototypes according to these requirements ."}
