{"dialogue": "um so according to the brief um we 're gon na be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , and uh we do n't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . but selling price isis that wholesale or retail ? i imagine it probably is our sale actually because it 's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . um . i mean do you think the fact that it 's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? like how much does , you know , a remote control cost . well twenty five euro , i mean that 's um that 's about like eighteen pounds or something , thi is this gon na to be like the premium product kinda thing or so i do n't know how how good a remote control that would get you . um .", "summary": "abstract: the project manager talked about the project finances and selling prices ."}
{"dialogue": "um as well as uh characters , um different uh keypad styles and s symbols . well right away i 'm wondering if there 's um th th uh , like with d _ v _ d _ players , if there are zones . 'cause you have more complicated characters like european languages , then you need more buttons . i 'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it 'll be different , so thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic , but yeah , i suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky . so extra functionalities . so , like , i wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know , do your your satellite and your regular telly and your v _ c _ r _ and everything ? maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . w you get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . s maybe like a touch screen or something ? or whatever would be technologically reasonable . i mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it , i think one factor would be production cost .", "summary": "abstract: the team then discussed various features to consider in making the remote ."}
