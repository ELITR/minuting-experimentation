{"dialogue": "a a and the voice recognition as well , it 's it 's it 's another approach ,", "summary": "abstract: it can be used as a normal remote , but the speech recognition also provides a more advanced alternative interface ."}
{"dialogue": "but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .", "summary": "abstract: the speech recognition works as a finding mechanism as well ."}
{"dialogue": "and and the case is is rubber ? and the buttons ? <other> plastic or rubber . uh yellow with uh grey or black or something like that . whatever cost uh cost uh the least . <laugh>", "summary": "abstract: the rubber case is yellow with grey or black , with buttons either made of plastic or rubber ."}
{"dialogue": "m m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . okay . okay , yeah , that 's right . or something li like that .", "summary": "abstract: an extra button could activate / deactivate the voice recognition ."}
{"dialogue": "the production costs . twenty two . th this design is not um within our price model .", "summary": "abstract: the prototype proved extremely over budget ."}
{"dialogue": "and what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . um by not using the voice recognition feature ,", "summary": "abstract: the main contributing factors were the solar cell and speech recognition ."}
{"dialogue": "uh by giving it another colour already . although i think weyeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people", "summary": "abstract: one way to compensate for the loss of features , but still attract their target group , would be to add more colour to the design ."}
{"dialogue": "we are evaluating this this uh design now . this prototype .", "summary": "abstract: after the costing , the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1 ( excellent ) -7 ( very bad ) ."}
{"dialogue": "is it ? is it fancy ? just <other> give it a two . was it innovative ? i think uh it 's a two . is it easy to use ? so it will be a two point five . <laugh> is it easy to find ? <laugh> but i personally give it a one . the feel of the remote control is spongy . and make this a one point five . the remote control offers enough features . i 'll give it uh a one . for for thefor this t uh type of market , i think it 's a one .", "summary": "abstract: the criteria used were fancifulness ( 2 ) , technological innovation ( 2 ) , ease of use ( 2.5 ) , whether it is easy to find ( 1 ) , sponginess ( 1.5 ) , number of features ( 1 ) ."}
{"dialogue": "we 'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . about the project itself , not about the product . looking at room for creativity , there was w way toothe the choice of components was way too narrow . uh leadership . fantastic . <laugh> i think we 're a good team . i missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey roo uh . <laugh> um the means , the smartboard , the digital pen . did you like 'em ? <other> uh . the digital pen was okay , but smartboard was really bad . the drawing cap capabilities are very limited .", "summary": "abstract: finally , the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity ( choices too narrow ) , leadership and teamwork ( happy with it , but they missed communicating in between meetings ) , and means ( smartboard was not satisfactory , but the digital pens were alright , but not too useful ) ."}
{"dialogue": "but w um we were n't aware of the prices of the costs .", "summary": "abstract: the delay in providing costs of components was criticised ."}
{"dialogue": "we need to redesign uh the product .", "summary": "action: the prototype will have to be redesigned , so that it is compatible with the budget constraints . . "}
{"dialogue": "um then i did the following changes . twelve euro forty cents i came up with by leaving out the solar cells ,", "summary": "decisions: the idea to include a solar cell as a power source had to be abandoned , due to the escalated costs ."}
{"dialogue": "um by not using the voice recognition feature ,", "summary": "decisions: the same happened with the speech recognition ."}
{"dialogue": "", "summary": ""}
{"dialogue": "", "summary": "decisions: in order for the cost to come down to the original budget of 12 . 50 , they also had to replace the rubber of the buttons with plastic and not use a curved design ."}
{"dialogue": "the production costs . twenty two . th this design is not um within our price model .", "summary": "problems: the prototype proved extremely over budget ."}
{"dialogue": "the production costs . twenty two .", "summary": "problems: it would cost 22 euros ."}
{"dialogue": "<other> it becomes a very dull remote control , i know . i think we we we all know what the redesign should be . a simple , dull , uh one-coloured box .", "summary": "problems: the team thought all the changes to accommodate the budget requirements made a very dull device ."}
{"dialogue": "uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic but that 's not what uh has been asked .", "summary": "problems: it was suggested that they go for a completely simple design so as to maximise the profit , although this was not what was asked in the project requirements ."}
{"dialogue": "um but uh i agree it 's it 's not a fancy high-tech uh device . definitely not , no .", "summary": "problems: the device can not be a hi-tech , innovative one any more ."}
