{"dialogue": "well then uh the serious uh stuff . we 're we want to sell it at twenty five euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars , but uh twenty five euros . our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million euros . so i did n't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell . <laugh> we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half euros so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research . now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls , firstabout design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera ? well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls ? well i i did n't have to prepare anything about uh it 's not , it 's it 's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls , well uh just w we 're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then", "summary": "abstract: the project manager informed the group of the budget , before beginning the discussion of current remotes and initial ideas ."}

{"dialogue": "it has to be different and familiar at the same time . we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things . i thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing you can make it uh triangle shaped , but that 's not uh very recognisable . well we we could make more more oval or something , and and n we can use uh it as a as a game pad . so <laugh> one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh <laugh> but young people want something different yeah but it 's quite important that it fits . one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have towe can imagine uh so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful for me personally i have a <other> a lot of remotes uh at home but <other> those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle <other> i do n't like to use them . when it falls over it and i just haveand then the button that i use most has to be here . it should n't be boxy . i do n't agree with the long box uh shape <other> but it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , no if y if you look at new phillips uh d _ v _ d _ with their uh remotes <laugh> pl players <laugh> they they are the new remotes are n't box shaped . no that 's ol old fashioned . well <other> most ofof them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end . uh but then with some uh round uh <other> round forms in it to fit your hand , a it h it has it it has a that 's tha th th shape that it fits your hand . it should n't be too boxy , you know . butno no i do n't mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course , but in in in at the end it 's still this long <other> box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh <other> to fit . a big recognisable button on top or something . the buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course , and uh n uh uh not too close uh together . but it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions . and maybe we should use colours .", "summary": "abstract: the considered options for the shape of the remote control , imagining how it would fit in the hand ."}
