{"dialogue": "matthew is uh late again . it is important for him to be here uh . but still i think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer . i think we can put on thehere . we will just we just have to continue . just for record i i will take uh notes again . first thing uh i was uh uh i got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve euro and fifty cents . when you stay in it 's good , when you do n't stay in you have to redesign . maybe anna , you can have your presentation . we ca n't do evaluation 'til we have a design . matthew . nice uh you are here . we we designed the two uh items .", "summary": "abstract: as the meeting opens the project manager tells the group that they must stay within the budget of twelve euro and fifty cents or will have to redesign ."}
{"dialogue": "ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs . i will start by the the basic one that uh fits into uh eight euros actually , right , seven eight euros , first for both they have um a special shape , but uh it 's like a surf board . and also it 's not too far from um a mobile . so people are used to that kind of shape , do n't take care too much about the colour now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now .", "summary": "abstract: after matthew arrives the designers begin presenting the two prototypes , beginning with the basic conventional one which is shaped like a surfboard and costs 7 or 8 euros to produce ."}
{"dialogue": "the on-off button , in red . here would be the volume . on the on the left , so you can go up and down the channels , uh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back . how can you change from v _ c _ r _ to uh t _ v _ , by the way ? this is a standard t _ v _ one , and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . the extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel . and the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . actually . it 's a very basic minimal thing exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh .", "summary": "abstract: it contains an on-off button , volume switch , up / down channel function , 10 digits , and two extra buttons for teletext and an additional function ."}
{"dialogue": "uh i i i it is a very futuristic , it 's like uh it 's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future , it can come . yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone . then the this is the <other> a more a little uh smooth and it gives a lot of functionality , uh in this way , uh th you see there are only six keys , they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here . and so they have more space actually and uh it 's easy to uh use this", "summary": "abstract: the next control is futuristic because feels like a mobile phone , has 6 keys , and is smooth ."}
{"dialogue": "and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have , and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo play , pause . yeah s pause or stop , you have a l _ c _ d _ display , here and uh y this is a functional thing which can change it 's a toggle switch which could change the function from d _ v _ d _ player to television or something . and and and then you get feedback via the l _ c _ d _ you can have a integrated microphone over here , this is the orange button , the <other> microphone . you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display . and here is a small l _ e _ d _ which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as i was talking earlier then we have a cover <other> when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed , will it also uh cover up the l _ c _ d _ screen ? yeah . actually when you are watching the t _ v _ , <other> when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , and this gives a protection to the l _ c _ d _ actually , giving a cover to that actually . gives a protection it 's low weight . you have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight . if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys we should <other> stick with uh a number of keys it it should not be cluttering up everything . i like the shape of them , i do like the the size and the the shape .", "summary": "abstract: it also has a power button , channel up / down , slow pause / slow stop , lcd screen , toggle switch that changes it from audio to video , and microphone ."}
{"dialogue": "so the the cost is actually a bit more , sixteen euros . so it 's well outside the budget then . but the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer . and they say basically that the s _ r _ system would be uh something like three francs per item three euros . that 's on top of the sixteen , or is it part of that ? part of that , yeah . so that takes it down to thirteen euros without the speech recognition .", "summary": "abstract: it would cost 16 euros to produce , which is out of the budget ."}
{"dialogue": "be before ta talking about the money and what 's possible and what is not possible , maybe anna you can uh give our uh give us your um and maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two . and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at . it 's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we 've identified as being important to selling the product . um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we 'll make an evaluation based on that , <other> these are the things we identified as being important . umthe three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . and then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well . do you wan na go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wan na discuss them further and then evaluate them ? why not why not discuss uh discuss it now , just go through onto the whiteboard i guess . look and feel , innovation and now iteasy to use . you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these ? w w we can still discuss that . and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas um i 've received uh a framework which we can do this . this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components , so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve euro uh fifty cents uh . th th this is the first design . um w <other> one 's bad and seven 's the best . one 's true and seven 's false . look and feel . in i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , so i i i would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel . we should also consider look , and then i it looks quite conventional . on the scale u it 's between functional and fancy basically we 're looking at , ma ma ma ma maybe say say five but uh still i will give four in that case the way we have designed it 's like the surf as you say <laugh> and the other one ? i think it 's slightly better , um , which which 'll be covering in a curve actually this is this is not going to protrude actually , the other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ? 'cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , maybe it wo n't work so well . i 'd say two or three for that one , personally . so so <laugh> i would also say this is four . because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it 's embedded one . so i will say two . it 's d it 's definitely more fancier than that one . basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , no but except for the design of the surf <laugh> . are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ? i think it 's more of the feel . but th is there any there 's no actual innovation in that at all , and theand the second one is really uh state of the art , uh in terms of innovation . so i 'd be up for seven for innovation . and um with many more functionalities , and can open and close the the bottom part . and all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this . a and the l _ c _ d _ screen is that 's that 's that 's well it 's quite innovative . uh could put it at one or two i would say . personally . th th there were different options we discussed then , we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget . and then we will will try to get it in the budget . we just diske discuss it as you designed it innovation for this one is two ? one ? the speech recognition is a very good innovation i believe it , <laugh> then it 's i think one . ease of use ? the first one is really standard , so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it , so that 's maybe a a two for ease of use . um , the other one is quite easy , tho though . uh , though it has more functionality so maybe a three or a four . maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons . because it 's n uh it 's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so , actually the user has to put some effort to douse that actually , so so i think th three is good . yeah . uh how well it goes to the target demographic . we 're d we 're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ? i would i would give this model to the old people actually . so sh completely changed our demographic there , exce except for the surfing shape . i mean that 's that 's something which which has an appeal on this group i think , if it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then i can imagine it beingapplying to the the demographic mm w w w weafter this we can can consider uh for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic 'cause we have got room , we 've got some budget there to add a few things to it , but as it is now , i w would say mm , six , something . because it 's so importantit 's i it was written that it really so important , the um the the look and uh taking care of itsit targets , the right range of people , but but if you sell it in the market it 's going to be cheap , actually . <other> we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five euros . there 's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few euros on that one rather than another one . so in that case well it 's fine then . and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ? it 's got the got the the toys in it , it 's got the l _ c _ d _ screen if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , i think for this audience we need absolutely the l _ c _ d _ screen . i think especially if we 're gon na n have an l _ c _ d _ screen on a low range product then that 's good . i 'd probably go with three again for that one . or eveneven one and two . or two . yeah two yeah . because you can add <other> lot of sophistication on that . and especially i guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well , and that makes it more appealing , the final point , trends . the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel . as it is , not really doing either of them . spongy , uh , that means that it goes in in the water . <laugh> the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well , have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons that feels kinda spongy . but i 'm thinking one of the nokias that 's got like you ca it has n't got individual buttons yeah . we we we we we yeah , it 's the way they are going to be , actually . the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie . but that 's if you 're using the covers . uh uh is it possible do you think , to to make a cover for s such a phone ? they make it for mobiles , it ca n't be that much more complicated . just with the with the flexible plastic uh so you got the option of having different colours or different textures . yeah i think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , yeah . we can put the the <other> the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers i think theif we do the cover that 's really going with the company 's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics , even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you 'll still be able to put a new cover on it look at this computer , th this laptop , it 's all black , and uh it 's quite conventional , and sometimes people do n't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here . so maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things . and then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers . although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um on the other one . 'cause that 's the that 's the feature that could be included in either of them . say , say one and two . one and two . the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so fivemm nine by five , one point s eight ? one point eight yeah . four pointuh four point two . very good . but we still got a very different price for those two so they 're not really comparable yet anyway .", "summary": "abstract: the marketing expert gives the product evaluation and they rate them on look and feel , innovation , ease of use , appeal to the correct demographic , and adherence to the company motto and fashion trends ."}
{"dialogue": "it 's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out . because , when we choose for this one we have to <other> we have to make it more attractive or we just have to choose . and adapt . that 'll basically take us down to the budget . uh unfortunately we did n't see this chip , uh matthew , so maybe we have to recap with this one . and w when weto d for this one we have to make it more cheap . let 's let 's try to to model this this phone in this sheet , maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this , yeah . uh what kind of energy source uh it 's ait 's a normal battery , or maybe you might use a a _ a _ battery actually . given speech recognition i think w you should go for the less fancy chip . uh sample speaker , yeah . double curve . uh , plastic would be the material . are you talking about this or that ? but they have the same shape , uh special colour , now we leave it to the covers . now we 're either going button or l _ c _ d _ s , l _ c _ d _ display . it 's okay . just say l _ c _ d _ . so it would need twelve buttons . we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ? but for this one it 's twelve euro . so this comes to eighteen . and that 's without any special button supplements . we 'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . it 's not it 's not double curved , it 's single curved , it 's like it 's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well , that 's what i thought . we 've got thosethe scroll wheel on the side i 'm i 'm no i 'm no i 'm not sh sure . the bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you sure ? we 've got a scroll wheel for the volume this is even more than the um than the cost you gave , the sixteen euros . that is the sample sensor and sample speaker . we just need that actually . we need one . wewe could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip , but then we ca n't have the the speech recognition , this would this would be cutting the speech recognition . but if you have thenear the l _ c _ d _ you can um <other> chooseselect between um you know like uni universal between audio , t _ v _ and v _ c _ r _ , and this needs a needs a advanced chip . i think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip . and we still on fifteen , and what about the number of buttons buttons uh <other> my matthew ? when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty . <other> but that 's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material . the l _ c _ d _ display is is three francs , sorry three euros , by itself . we we really want a l _ c _ d _ other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market . so we 're gon na have to scale this down to get within budget , so wha what what each of us think about thebecause it 's measure point the l _ c _ d _ , um or we could even replace them by buttons actually . because sometimes whe when you watch the t _ v _ in fact , you have a big display a actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it , for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , orand you 'll have l _ c _ d _ display which isthat is going to bring the cost by two two euros at least . i think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the l _ c _ d _ display . okay so we can get rid of it and then add a couple of buttons . and it 's looking like we ca n't afford the l _ c _ d _ display , there 's no way we can get it in there . <laugh> s so who thinks the the l _ c _ d _ disply display should be i should be in it ? i th i 'd like t it to be in but i ca n't see it happening . i ca n't see it fitting in . having an l _ c _ d _ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons . so hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve . uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here . here one , at the middle , and at the bottom . i i think we should we should cut the l _ c _ d _ screen . that that 's that 's my opinion . the speech recognition is out . because of the budget , yeah . are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ?", "summary": "abstract: they discuss the energy source , shape , chip type , lcd and speech recognition , and additional buttons ."}
