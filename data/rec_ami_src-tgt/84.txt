{"dialogue": "uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one . andtake the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . and we havethink i got a new project requirement . so i think uh teletext becomes outdated . and i think we do n't need lighting adaptive , so the popularity of thesince the popularity of the internet , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . and of course we should have our imagein the in the design . so , let 's start with the the industrial designer .", "summary": "abstract: the project manager presented the goals of the meeting and new product requirements ."}
{"dialogue": "<laugh> right , so um i will talk about the the w working design and and um well i i will present my my first idea on how to build theour new remote control for television . so i think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do . i think uh i i 'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible <laugh> things we hav we can use . then uh i will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that . and when we are ready with this first prototype i i think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . so , wha what i think <laugh> for now <laugh> is <other> we do n't want to have a remote control w which is wired so uh i think we u we can use a battery for the . then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . and the communication with the t _ v _ set is uh made through uh infrared communication so uh this is the <laugh> the schema of the <laugh> o of the future uh remote controls so uh you can you can see the components , uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the t _ v _ set . the one on top is for the umwell the functionali the functionalities one is a communication . and the the th red umsorry the green one is is towell , putting things together , um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to touh to communicate with the t _ v _ set .", "summary": "abstract: the industrial designer presented the internal components of a remote control and showed a diagram of how they operate together ."}
{"dialogue": "i think we should use a f _ p _ g _ a _ for <laugh> for the functionalities which is easy to to t what is f _ p _ g _ a _ ? it 's a field programmable gateway arrays . so why 's ithow is it different from the bluetooth ? well , uh a f _ p _ g _ a _ is just a chip you can uh you canpr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want . and uh well the bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices . so this are thethey have to work together ? or ? do they have to work together or two separate choice well , th the f _ p _ g _ a _ will produce the the data to send . or it 's something likeis n't hardware the first one ? and the second one is for the software . okay , and how about the battery power ? uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? i think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the and uh i i do n't think it will need um <other> very uh much power to make it run , so mm . you can put it on the charger when uh you when you do n't need to use it . it 's a good idea . having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . people do n't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . we just make a small charger because you are using because you are using bluetooth , if some people have p _ d _ a _ they can use their p _ d _ a _ to control the t _ v _ if they want to , right ? we do not want to make it p _ d _ a _ . <laugh> also , but but <laugh> i i i think uh the the goal is to sell our remote <laugh> control .", "summary": "abstract: he suggested that field programmable gateway arrays be used for the chip controlling software functionalities , and it was suggested that the remote be used with a recharging stand ."}
{"dialogue": "so i 'm working on the technical functions design . so the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . so <laugh> so i found on a webs on the internet and uh and i found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . <laugh> for example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . so i found two very good prototypes for <laugh> for this interface from our competitors this are usual functionality . ours is a bit uh different . so these are two example . one is from <other> the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah . this is the most competing prototypes i 've found <laugh> .", "summary": "abstract: the user interface designer gave a presentation on the technical functions of the remote , and displayed the interfaces of two existing products for comparison ."}
{"dialogue": "but then uh loo but then i found if you look atyou see on the left one there are too many buttons and they are small . o on the right i tried to play with <other> the problem is that uh if i have hundred channels i have uh i have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and i have to compose the number so it 's very lousy . <laugh> so you <laugh> so you move to the next the next one . and then i i look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we do n't want that .", "summary": "abstract: he showed that the competitors ' remotes were too complicated ."}
{"dialogue": "<laugh> so i propose the easy to use uh prototype . you can navigate on t _ v _ screen and we need to have the t _ v _ connected to internet so we endin order to access the t _ v _ programmes by x _ m _ l _ and we need someto do some preprocessing . from the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the t _ v _ set than on the <laugh> on the remote controller , right ? <laugh> and then wethe speech recognition as uh harry says we may just put inwe may k _ i _ v _ . what do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the t _ v _ yeah , all the processing is donethe t _ v _ is a compu has some processing power the <laugh> so we should have specific t _ v _ ? we have to sell a t _ v _ with the remote control too . <laugh> <laugh> yeah because <laugh> are you just wondering what controllerokay . i think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the t _ v _ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because", "summary": "abstract: he suggested that the televisions that the remotes are used with connect to the internet to access downloadable programs ."}
{"dialogue": "so i come up with a simple design , just keep the v navigation buttons . <laugh> yes , that 's a good idea , i think . we d we do n't we we do n't need really much buttons toi if we have a screen to navigate on on the t _ v _ so uh <other> well , f four five buttons , it 's sufficient . it 's easy to build , it does not consume much power . <laugh> oh , but you have a catch there , um assume that um if you want to go toif you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then < imitates zapping > . well , then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel no , because you choose by channel , so you do n't have hundred channels to choose from . but uh i i think i iif you if you want to to make uhwell a a big jump <laugh> but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that . uh it 's gon na be small . so it 'll beep if you wan na find it too small that it goes under the sofa and we ca n't find it . <laugh> you just uh shouty h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . justgive it a name and we call him . <laugh> andresponds to you , and <laugh>", "summary": "abstract: he suggested a simple design with few buttons , small size , and a locator function ."}
{"dialogue": "okay , after having the inputs from <other> industrial design and user interface , i think most of the points which i want to are already covered here . and to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on thatthese are the findings which we got andyeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a t _ v _ remote and next one was the size of the remote control . it has to be of course a very slim and small one . and of course most of the people are interested in if it 's less expensive , i mean we have to look for a trade-off . the features and the cost . <other> i noi i think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost . maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , little bit more if it 's with extra features . yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature i think but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . i mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . and the fourth one was the teletext in various languages . it 's going to be very slim . it 's not going to take much space also . and this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . i if you just recognise uh numbers is a limitedyou have limited vocabulary but i think if youto recognise numbers it 's a well-studied problem . well i i think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh wellyes a microphone into the the remote control , so what about lighting adaptive options ? yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but <other> i think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it 's not really required .", "summary": "abstract: the marketing expert presented several characteristics important to users ."}

{"dialogue": "yeah , but well what about the the new project 's requirement ? i i i think we should give up with teletext , no ? well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh <other> about a way to to access the internet via the television . yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be t _ v _ set that can access the internet . so it 's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in aw which will c which will come in a few years . so you have to anticipate the the future ? well , not not to implement it , but towell , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in ayeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible . <laugh> yeah . because all the t _ v _ sets will be digital , right .", "summary": "abstract: the group discussed the new requirement that required them to omit teletext from their design , and discussed the possibility of using the remote to access the internet through the television ."}
