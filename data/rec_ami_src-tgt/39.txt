{"dialogue": "um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do . the the remote control needs to be original , there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls do n't have um and that goes along with being trendy , uh uh you know the i want it uh scenario . user-friendly as as we all know , remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly and last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money ,", "summary": "abstract: the project manager states that the remote needs to be original , trendy , and user-friendly ."}

{"dialogue": "uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and uh uh <other> let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here , um in fact i suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires , that we do n't do that , um everybody knows what whiteboard is so we 'll um uh we 'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal , but le let 's go round the table , um , badger . <other> <laugh> um probably a duck uh 's horses , i think homo sapien", "summary": "abstract: since they all know what a whiteboard is , they do a virtual drawing by each stating their favorite animal ."}

{"dialogue": "would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls . i thinki find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and uh it 's handiest when you have one that works both the d _ v _ d _ player or whatever and the t _ v _ as well . um , but thatit 's easy toif you can switch back and forth instead of having to <other> press a bunch of different buttons so i think it 's is best when they 're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you 're supposed to use , or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ? um <laugh> i think it 's important that you should be able towhen you when you press the buttons it 'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you should n't have to like contort yourself think a lot of the time , remotes that come with t _ v _ players andt _ v _ s and d _ v _ players , like they are n't they 're very boring , making a a stylish remote control would be a very like easily put us one step ahead of the current competition . <other> um . something that looks looksdoes n't look like remote control . i mean do you think there 's a risk if it does n't look like remote control , <laugh> people wo n't see it as a remote control i think something that 's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things so something that 's more comfortable that fits in a person 's hand better . that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see , like a mouse button . remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it whereas if you want could all be flat i mean <other> the only thing is if if you 're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh fi find the button buttons easily . but maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have thembe kind of down must admit i do n't think i 've ever seen one with concave buttons , i ca n't think of any re remote controls that i know of that actually light up at all . andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you 've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable it 's it 's like uh it 's one that rather than ra i wan i want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device , i think it'sthis is gon na have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room they they just need to be very very dependable because people sort of take them for granted it needs to be very effective , veryalways dependable . uh but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um , it 's just gon na end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah . mosti think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey , i was just thinking of um <other> what they 're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different umwhat are they called ? like the face-plates i do n't know if it would be feasible to do something with that , so people can get different different things . again i do n't think that 's ever been done before , but uh <other> maybe thinking of that , it'sconsidering the nature of the device , maybe a second thinglike a second campaign to market new facials for yourto yourmight go a bit astray since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one you could come up with like novelty ones ,", "summary": "abstract: they proceed to discuss problems with current remotes as well as preferable styles and looks , such as using face-plates so the look is changable ."}
{"dialogue": "i think we 've got um a good idea now . needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly . we 've got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail . um then we 'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised .", "summary": "abstract: the project manager closes the meeting ."}
