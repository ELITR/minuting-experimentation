{"dialogue": "ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important .", "summary": "abstract: for the conceptual design , the marketing expert talked about the public 's preference for looks over technological innovation ; however , they both seem to be more important than ease of use ."}
{"dialogue": "and uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture , and that they want spongy material . or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers . you could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover .", "summary": "abstract: the current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes and spongy materials: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote , and could also provide themes for other target groups ."}
{"dialogue": "maybe it rubber and what i 'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip", "summary": "abstract: they could also add some rubber to provide easy grip of the device ."}
{"dialogue": "we have the uncurved or flat case . uh that 's the most common uh remote con control form uh <other> we have uh a curved one . which is curved in three dimension .", "summary": "abstract: cases can be flat , single- or double-curved ."}
{"dialogue": "we can use plastic , we can use wood and titanium . uh which is the same for rubber ,", "summary": "abstract: they can be made of plastic , rubber , wood or titanium ."}
{"dialogue": "we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh <laugh> remote controls . uh there 's there 's also a kinetic energy supply . and we of course have the traditional uh solar power ,", "summary": "abstract: hand or kinetic dynamos , batteries , and solar cells can be used as energy sources ."}
{"dialogue": "um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . um <other> uh in the indicators we have the l _ c _ d _ displays , this is my volume button . and i can either on this side or this side um and click it to muten the device .", "summary": "abstract: possible interfaces are push buttons , scroll wheels , and lcds . a way to make this device different would be to use a scroll-wheel on the side with integrated button for volume control and mute ."}
{"dialogue": "and there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker ,", "summary": "abstract: speech recognition can be implemented by adding a sample sensor and speaker on the remote ."}
{"dialogue": "traditional batteries uh and solar .", "summary": "abstract: the final decisions also included combined battery with solar cells ."}
{"dialogue": "but but do we want the curved uh uh design , so i think this is the best of two worlds . um i suggest we use the the sensor sample . uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . um with a with a regular chip . and and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow . the casing is curved , single-curved . and i think we should use the company colours . something like black and red . uh black and yellow . the scroll-heel . yes , the voice recognition we already decided .", "summary": "abstract: the team will design a single-curved device with a scroll wheel and speech recognition , in black and yellow , the company colours ."}
{"dialogue": "um and uh the i _ d _ and the u _ i _ d _ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard .", "summary": "action: the industrial designer and the user interface designer will work on a drawing of a prototype ."}
{"dialogue": "", "summary": ""}
{"dialogue": "", "summary": "action: they will think about ways to make their product different from the others in the market ."}
{"dialogue": "um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . i guess that is something for roo and sebastian .", "summary": "action: they will also try to find a way to promote the corporate identity in the design of the look and feel and interface ."}
{"dialogue": "um i guess you two have to figure that out .", "summary": "action: the id and ui will also have to figure out whether to use rubber just for the buttons and side finish , or for the whole front of the remote ."}
{"dialogue": "and for you , the product evaluation .", "summary": "action: the marketing expert will carry out a product evaluation ."}
{"dialogue": "you could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover . or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .", "summary": "decisions: changeable covers for the remote control can link the product to current fashion trends , but also trends followed by other age groups ."}
{"dialogue": "and and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . the scroll-heel . yes ,", "summary": "decisions: a scroll wheel will be included in the design ."}
{"dialogue": "", "summary": ""}
{"dialogue": "", "summary": "decisions: a regular chip will be needed for this ."}
{"dialogue": "so it it needs to be rubber . but but do we want the curved uh uh design , so i think this is the best of two worlds . the casing is curved , single-curved . yeah , with colourful rubber .", "summary": "decisions: a single-curved rubber casing can also be used ."}
{"dialogue": "d did we already decide on the display ? no . i do n't think you need it . and uh skipand skip the l _ c _ d _ part .", "summary": "decisions: lcd is not going to be implemented ."}
{"dialogue": "traditional batteries uh and solar .", "summary": "decisions: the preferred energy source was a combination of batteries and solar cells ."}
{"dialogue": "but if you 're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and but uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy .", "summary": "problems: it is not clear whether a kinetic dynamo can be used , because it is unlikely that a user shakes the remote enough , as one would do with similarly powered watches ."}
{"dialogue": "i ca n't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it . there 's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel .", "summary": "problems: the use of a scroll wheel with integrated button was debated , as not everyone was convinced of its use for this project ."}
{"dialogue": "what about um <other> the issue i um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . it 's it'suh i uh i can imagine it 's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device .", "summary": "problems: using the speech recognition on the device may not be convenient , since the remote will have to pointing towards the tv at the same time for the infrared to work ."}
{"dialogue": "according to ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology , uh i think our customers will go insane .", "summary": "problems: lcd screens may add an extra hi-tech touch , but given all the other features , it might be too much ."}
{"dialogue": "yeah , although i do n't think that 's very colourful . except for the yellow of course ,", "summary": "problems: the company colours ( grey and yellow and black ) did not seem sufficiently bright and trendy to everyone ."}
{"dialogue": "it should be a full colour cover with such an image but uh i 'm afraid it 's not possible to print a picture on uh the device .", "summary": "problems: printing an image on the remote to make it more colourful is doable , but can not be done by the manufacturing department ."}
{"dialogue": "what about uh the finishing of the case ? yeah , with colourful rubber . because they 're they 're rubber too . we should have it the other way around , i guess . a plastic cover with rubber finishing . what about um making this rubber and making this plastic ? i 'm i 'm not so sure ,", "summary": "problems: the front could have a rubber finish , or the buttons will be made of rubber ."}
{"dialogue": "so if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber .", "summary": "problems: it was debated that customers may prefer a total spongy texture , not just in the buttons and the sides of the remote ."}
