{"dialogue": "this is a <other> brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote . the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because i <other> had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices i 've looked at <other> looked at a num <other> uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles . um <other> um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set . um and there 's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice . on the one handand this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it um giving you every possible function that the that the device has , the remote control controls . it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . and on the other hand there 's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what <other> what is most likely to get used . um <other> and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously , and so you go for something that 's fairly intuitive to use , my own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design . um but uh the pro <other> i think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user 's going to uh want mo want to do from <other> want it to do most . something that 's uh <other> something that is more programmable , that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you 're most likely to want . um i liked ebenezer 's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you 're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it 'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh of the um joystick 's <other> going to do or wha or what each function button 's going to do .", "summary": "abstract: the user interface designer described the technical functions of a remote and stressed the need for a user focused design ."}
