{"dialogue": "let 's uh talk about the interface uh concept . uh , first i 'll uh i 'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . and uh my personal preferences . <other> well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . the channels buttons , one to nine , zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . and the menu menu button to man manipulate the l _ c _ d _ uh display . um , i found some uh interesting uh uh samples . examples . um , well uh what 's pretty standard is uh that it'sthat they 're all pretty uh uh high uh large . a lota lot of buttons buttons . large and and and pretty thin and uh and long . um , power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right . yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . and what 's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we do n't use that . but uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . uh this is the v _ for volume , but they 're both uh a v _ . so it 's it 's not really very uh clear what 's the function of that . for the uh menu , what do we use for that ? we do n't have buttons for the menu . or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel . i thought that was our uh idea . and that the menu button is okay . yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows . the icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .", "summary": "abstract: the industrial designer gave a presentation on the interface concept , discussing which buttons will be needed and then looking at some examples of existing remote controls ."}
{"dialogue": "um , well i do n't i do n't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . but uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , i would uh recommend a yellow case . uh , round edges . the logo at the bottom . and uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . uh , recognisable . <laugh> not too much colours . uh , no . not too much . but this has to be has to be trendy uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion .", "summary": "abstract: he suggested using a yellow case with rounded edges and the logo at the bottom , and large , clearly marked buttons ."}
{"dialogue": "uh , at first we will uh i will f uh say something about what younger people want , our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . and then , i 'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . first uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . like , totally yellow , totally red . uh , the shapes are curved and round , maybe it 's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . but to give him the shape of your hand , so youit 's easier to use or something like that . the battery , there are few options . uh , i think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . uh , the the form of the remote control , i think it 's also nicehave it curved . and maybe like it 's hand-shaped . uh material , you use plastic . hard plastic and also rubber and maybe it 's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for thefor remote control , that we then use the primary colours .", "summary": "abstract: the interface expert informed the group that young people like curved shapes , soft materials and primary colours , and suggested making a hand-shaped remote in plastic and rubber ."}
{"dialogue": "uh the push-buttons . we have one new thing uh discovered . it 's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . maybe it 's uh easy to use uh for the channels . when you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wan na see the next , uh if you wan na see that channel . you can do it with your thumb . and with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons the electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . there are also uh simple chips . they are uh cheaper . um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and you have also advanced um chips . but that 's with the l _ c _ d _ uh screen . and i think our budget is too low to use and an l _ c _ d _ , note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . a scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . the display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip .", "summary": "abstract: he talked about the possibility of using a scroll button , and the different chips which could be used ."}

{"dialogue": "well , we have to decide on the concept . maybe one of you can paint it on the board . can make several uh concepts . we have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand . this is the remote control . and then you have something like th this under it . so , it has to be soft ? and it has to be soft , yeah . buttons on top of it . the scrolling . you can do it with your thumb . but now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . if we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ? with the menu uh button . and then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . but if we do n't have a l _ c _ d _ we do n't have a menu . uh , then we have it on the t _ v _ , the menu . yeah , but <laugh> again maybe th how do we know the t _ v _ can handle it ? and if we put an l _ c _ d _ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher . we make two concepts . one with l _ c _ d _ . one without l _ c _ d _ . and and this one has to be soft . and this has to be harder , and you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . it 's not good to use . or some kind of rubber around it . one with two scroll buttons and one with without . uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu . and the one with with a menu has an l _ c _ d _ . yes , but you do n't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose . then it depends on the cost . m uh yeah , maybe it 's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um more separate , yeah . like , you have the menu button in between uh i also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for . when you uhthe menu , you have to go there there there there . we have two buttons missing . the mute button . mute . and the other . personally , i think two scroll buttons uh are n't easy to handle . with the switch button . but how do you wan na solve it ? yeah but on the menu that 's not uh easy . uh , then you can also have like uh th um yeah , and joystick , i think . or a small one just like in a laptop . does that break , a joystick ? but how expensive it is ? <laugh> for the young peoples i think scroll button 's good . that 's not expensive than uhjoystick is better . i mean the the shape of the remote control . just like a playstation thing . maybe , if it 's possible , <other> it 's not too expensive , i think a joystick is better . then for the components , we use a normal battery . then it'sch cheapest way , i think . kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . now we put uh rubber around it . hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber .", "summary": "abstract: the group had a discussion and decided to create two designs , one with an lcd screen and one without , and the interface designer drew them on the board ."}
