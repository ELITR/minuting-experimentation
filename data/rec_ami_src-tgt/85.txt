{"dialogue": "okay so i think i will do my presentation on the components concept the first thing uh i have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control . so for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique <laugh> to to store the energy . we also um <other> we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . we did n't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote . so uh it 's a point to discuss . concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so . <other> and uh this is the last point , the choice of chips . what is this single curved well uh uh i i it 's uh it 's the the shape of the um of the remote . you you will have thewell um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the it 's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it 's completely flat . and the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it does n't matter ? yeah the um that 's the point . the kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um and bywell by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy .", "summary": "abstract: the industrial designer presented options for each component ."}
{"dialogue": "so what i have f found is that i think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because i think solar energy wi wo n't work <laugh> in a cluttered uh <laugh> uh environment . for the case uh well uh i think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it 's trendy for the interface uh i think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons , simple buttons", "summary": "abstract: he suggested kinetic energy , a titanium case , and rubber push buttons ."}
{"dialogue": "but i d i do n't know it'sif it is feasible because i do n't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy . we we might check with our r _ and d _ department to see if they have this product <laugh> ready for market . <laugh> we can uh see in our uh r _ and d _ uh <laugh> if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy .", "summary": "abstract: the group will ask if the kinetic energy component can provide enough energy ."}
{"dialogue": "so the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system , a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . the idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . a graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures .", "summary": "abstract: the user interface designer introduced the graphical user interface to the group and suggested using an lcd screen ."}
{"dialogue": "so thehere are some examples . so they cluster the buttons together . they group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well . but this interface are kind of confusing . uh basically there are too many buttons . so some people are propose voice recognition ah by the way i receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine <laugh> for this by a company when you tell theyou say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . and it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , supposedly . mm so somebodysome people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the l _ c _ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a l _ c _ d _ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , touch screen , i mean . and some people propose a scroll button . integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . so there are a few aspects that i collected here . so s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , basically they are programmable , and then they also secure uh covers , to protect uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . but we do n't have to integrate all these complicated features . i 'm just saying that thecurrently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers fcustomisable for different people . and uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . mm maybe useful for children , and for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . so the adults might wan na have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside . this is another company that provides big buttons . i see that that is useful for old people but for our product we do n't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . we should include speech synthesis in this case , no ? but uh as norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control . and uh , this is another one the the the part that 's a v _ standing for the volume . so there 's a up arrow and a down arrow . but you the see that in the v _ , the v _ appears to be the down arrow on the top so it 's confusing interface , and here areis uh here is a s short summary that i summary that i compiled after the findings i found . big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . and uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used . well i <other> i think you it 's it 's it 's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the t _ v _ screen i do n't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so .", "summary": "abstract: he presented several existing products and suggested the following: large buttons ; voice recognition ; either push , scroll , or spinning buttons ; and incorporating some customizable components ."}
{"dialogue": "or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help yeah . that 's a good idea . so you are display on the screen . on the t _ v _ screen the uh how to use your remote . so that eliminates all the complicated documentation , but people are often enough looking at the help , once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff . in the case where they need help , in the case where they need help . and let us see what the market demands .", "summary": "abstract: the group discussed including a help button ; it was decided that it would make the device seem more complicated ."}
{"dialogue": "so we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . and we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . so seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they do n't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . and eighty percent of the people they are always l i mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . and the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . and seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot . and fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they 're not used most of the times . and also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it . fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it 's quite difficult to learn if it 's too complex . so keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations i think this should be the solution for them .", "summary": "abstract: the marketing expert presented that users found remotes too easily lost , complicated , and ugly ."}

{"dialogue": "so keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations i think this should be the solution for them . we should have an l _ c _ d _ on the rem remote control . well mm w well i i i do n't really see the advantage of having uh l _ c _ d _ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen . yeah of course it 's fancy trendy and so on i mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy . so if we have a l _ c _ d _ on the remote , rather than looking onto the t _ v _ you just look into a remote and navigate it . it 's the same menu as we have saw that ipod remote control . yeah but when you play with the ipod you do n't have <laugh> a big screen in front of you , s you can use this screen instead of the big se screen , if you re-use the existing screen , we elementeliminate the l _ c _ d _ , and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , well i think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the speech recognition if the technology is available but well i think l _ c _ d _ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results . so the thing is you can find out how much an l _ c _ d _ will cost <laugh> i mean that should be found out by the industrial designers . <laugh>", "summary": "abstract: he suggested the lcd screen ; the group felt that it was better to utilize the user 's television as a display screen , but that they would inquire about cost before deciding ."}
{"dialogue": "and it 's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls . and also the cost for the speech recognition . ask our r _ and d _ department . yeah it 's o only for a limited vocabulary , say eighty commands or so . and also the scroller button , how much will it cost . <laugh> well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button . from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button . because they they just they 're just frightened to use the scrollings or <laugh> help button . yeah i i i think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button so uh i think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality .", "summary": "abstract: the group will inquire about the cost of voice recognition and scroll buttons ."}
{"dialogue": "and the third problem was to find the remote control . well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find you will listen to a peep , <laugh> special peep . that 's exactly what i mean by voice commander . uh it 's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , and whenever we do n't use the remote control we put it in the charger . so we have some one charger there and when we 're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is . and that 's a good idea , i mean it doe it also does n't require a voice command , because there are problems with a voice command . i mean charger would be fixed because it 's always with electricity plugged . what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off t _ v _ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . you never get it lost because uh every time you 're off the computer <other> the t _ v _ you are asked the the command the t _ v _ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to whereto the charger . but you can have an button for child lock . i meanuh i mean uh i mean uh you see if it 's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and <laugh> use it , you ca n't avoid him . so just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he ca n't use even well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the t _ v _ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that . or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids i think these other four points they 're the market demands and so it 's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think so for my part i will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on . yeah i think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh thesecould be included .", "summary": "abstract: the group discussed incorporating a locator function and customization for children ."}
