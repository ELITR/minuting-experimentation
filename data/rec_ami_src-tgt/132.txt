{"dialogue": "but you ca n't you can not take into consideration all the different brands of t _ v _ s . because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . if it is n't , then we can not reach it . but i think most modern t _ v _ s have it in their menu . uh is n't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ?", "summary": "problems: different tvs have different functions incorporated in their built-in menus , making it hard to know in advance which buttons you can do without on the remote ."}
