{"dialogue": "i do n't really know exactly what we should uh talk about . feel good meaning what ? physically , yeah , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it . okay so , we 're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale , do we feel it 's very easy to use ? two . that 's what i say . okay , fashionable ? i mean like no , i think it 's very fashionable . i 'll give it a two , because at the moment it 's not looking that way . mm i do n't think it 's that fashionable . does it feel good ? and it 's i it is very ergonomically designed . alright , average is two . is it technologically innovative ? does it have voicei mean the phrase recognition on it ? we could do it with the chip , yes . and there 's no way you can represent it on here . y so i 'd probably give it a three . but it is just a t _ v _ remote . it 's just trendy , basically . it 's capable of being squishy and fruity .", "summary": "abstract: the marketing expert gave an evaluation of the prototype using the group 's initial criteria for the remote ."}
