{"dialogue": "this is our last meeting . um i 'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . uh and then we 'll have a , the prototype presentation . then we 'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . um then we 'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we 'll need to make , we had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . um and a spongy feel . um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . um the ipod , we really liked the look of that . the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote .", "summary": "abstract: the project manager opened the meeting and read the minutes of the previous meeting ."}
{"dialogue": "basically we we st went with the colour yellow . um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it 's basically designed around a banana . these would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . and the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an ipod , and then to access the more complicated functions you 'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . we could use the voice . it 's as simple as you , we could make it really . plastic covered with rubber . t the actual thing might be smaller . it 's a quick on-off button .", "summary": "abstract: the industrial designer and user interface designer presented the prototype they created , which was designed to look like a banana ."}
{"dialogue": "you guys are gon na help me do an evaluation of the criteria . we 're gon na be doing it based on a seven point scale . and one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . with seven being false , we did not achieve that . so for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? <laugh> did we make it simple for new users ? um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ? how about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? are we technologically innovative ? um spongy material ? did we put the fashion in electronics ? now we just got ta calculate . okay we 'll say two point four two .", "summary": "abstract: the marketing expert conducted an evaluation of the prototype ."}
{"dialogue": "i think it 's definitely different than anything else out there . i 'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that 's definitely more beautiful than your average . so uh to answer that honestly i would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely . i mean i much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . <laugh> four is fair .", "summary": "abstract: the team found that , although the overall design of the prototype was attractive , its yellow color was ugly ."}
{"dialogue": "it 's very intuitive , i think yeah . 'cause we 've we 've brought it down to basically four controlsmost common , which are channel and volume . so that 's a one . something that big and that yellow you just do n't lose anymore . but um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . that , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . y you could add an extra feature actually . which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . that ca n't cost much . let 's add one of those features and say yes . <laugh> two .", "summary": "abstract: the team rated the prototype highly on its ease of use and felt that its yellow color and shape detracted slightly from its ability to be misplaced and that a feature which causes the remote to make noise based on its proximity to a television needed to be added ."}
{"dialogue": "it 's all just stolen technology when it comes down to <laugh> <other> i do n't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . <laugh> <laugh> um i would say we 're probably at four . we have some spongy , yeah . it 's not a one though . probably a four at most . i 'd say we did . <other> well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the l _ c _ d _ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour ,", "summary": "abstract: the team thought the prototype was fashionable and not technologically innovative or spongy ."}
{"dialogue": "now we get to do the budget numbers . we want a fifty percent profit on this . um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ? two . that 's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah . 'kay then the case is aprobably it 's double curved . case materials are plastic . that 's not a special colour . it 's a specially ugly colour , but it 's not special . well we only have one button so really we should n't be charged , <laugh> we should n't be charged anything for the the button supplements .", "summary": "abstract: the project manager led the team in calculating the production costs of the remote and ensuring that they aligned with the project budget ."}
{"dialogue": "so our total is fifteen point five . by three euros over . you could maybe take out the l _ c _ d _ dis display even , right . we may not need it .", "summary": "abstract: the costs were over budget , so the team opted to exclude the lcd from their design to meet their budget ."}
{"dialogue": "i think that perhaps the project evaluation 's just supposed to be completed by me . but i 'd like to hear your thoughts . uh h what did you think of our project process ? yeah i think we did quite well . um our leadership was quite weak in the beginning . but as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . and um i think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things . super super . i had some problem with the pen i think , minus your powerpoint fiasco .", "summary": "abstract: the team conducted an evaluation of the project process and found that they performed well and were somewhat satisfied by the resources available to them ."}
