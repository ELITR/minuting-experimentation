{"dialogue": "you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control . the push button are usually extremely cheap , but i just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . and i think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can notif if we could combine something with the push button . uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button . so will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve euros to produce ? we should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money . the i i just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , we we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button . um , what is the purpose of the light ? you can easily find the button in the dark or so ? as soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light . i do n't think that this is really expensive , yeah , but i expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , but it can be uh battery consuming , no ? to have the light always on ? yeah , a little bit .", "summary": "abstract: the industrial designer presented the functional components that will appear in the prototype , and discussed with the group the high cost of the wheel sensor and the possibility of incorporating speech recognition ."}
{"dialogue": "so i just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . and let 's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . so it 's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , so basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two .", "summary": "abstract: the user interface designer presented existing remote controls to help show the interface of the prototype ."}
{"dialogue": "and in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we do n't need and it become even simpler . we have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle . with a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part . i think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way . uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case .", "summary": "abstract: he showed how the new design will be more simple and ergonomic than the models he displayed by eliminating extra functions ."}
