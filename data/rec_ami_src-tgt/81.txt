{"dialogue": "we 're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we 'll use for energy , and the material and interface . for energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . first one , we can use simple battery , or we can use <other> traditional solar cells mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this r _ s _ a _ and then uh titanium , which can bewhich have very good look an and then interface we 're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d l _ c _ d _ display . we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . this can be simple kind of programmable chip which can use microphonesensors . still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we 're toin our twelve euros or around that . so we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house . we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells and also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or the problem is with this design we found that we ca n't use double-curved shapes . what is a double-curved shape ? <other> like you can have two curves . we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it 's really lesseruh re really less expensive compared to l _ c _ d _ uh which needs advanced chip technology and it 's more expensive , since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce uh cost . <other> um i want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light . uhuhand also like inif you put ait 's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things w we can use something like you know <other> the whole body 's titanium but there are some rubber or i dunno some rubber parts but full assemblywe 'll use mainly for titanium and also it 's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh . we we would like to use push buttons instead of l _ c _ d _ s y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , mm can we still include the l _ l _ s _ d _ display ? it 's either l _ c _ d _ or push-button . maybe maybe we can see depending on how we 'll come up with our full design because the speech recognition technology will take at least five euros oror something so we want to reduce the cost on display it 's it 's not gon na be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information . the batteries uh are going to be very light . and now i think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just beask . we have dreams and thein the end we find out that it 's not feasible . <laugh>", "summary": "abstract: the industrial designer discussed different options for batteries , case materials and shapes , chips , and interface components and also discussed the components necessary for a speech recognition capable remote control ."}
{"dialogue": "the concept of the interface . generally i developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user 's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your t _ v _ and remote controls . we got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and uh we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the l _ c _ d _ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button , i do n't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , maybe this button is power on and off ? that 's our concept . it 's called the millennium remote control . does n't make sense . this is very <laugh> ugly . too much concept . we will not use this . we will not use this . but instead of this i will devisethat 's our concept . and it 's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed .", "summary": "abstract: the user interface designer presented his concept for the interface design which he called the `` millennium remote control '' ."}

{"dialogue": "i 'm going to talk about trends and um i hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , but uh basically there areuh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should verypay much attention to . the first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . and uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . it has to be fancy . strangely enough it 's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that 's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . and finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it 's not so important that it 's useful as a remote control . <laugh> currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like paris and milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of <laugh> of look or feel and i think of course uh <other> i it applies to everything . <laugh> it it can travel f from clothe to furniture <laugh> same idea . and uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , when we were talking about rubber , i think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it 's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess . so maybe titanium it 's not a good idea . think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . i mean and not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like . these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , it 's more general trend it 's not particular to the remote control . but it seems that trends travel across things . but some materials n they 're to be uh they 're to be something like solid like they ca n't be really spongy we have toi think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables fruit . these things can be easily incorporated . we can have t colours or this shape if if it 's something like rubber made ori think it it 's also going to be good .", "summary": "abstract: the marketing expert discussed current findings from trend watching reports which indicated that there is a desire for products to have a fancy look and feel , be technologically innovative , be easy to use , incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme , and be spongy ."}
