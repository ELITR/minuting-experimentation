{"dialogue": "um now the new project requirements , i 'll just show them . well , teletext goes out . and they do n't want it , well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products .", "summary": "abstract: there are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for tv only , they should ignore the teletext function , as it is dated , and , also , the remote should be recognisable as a real reaction product ."}
{"dialogue": "because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years .", "summary": "abstract: the target group will be people below 30 ."}
{"dialogue": "they also say , that 's about uh i thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . um research shows that they like to have a little l _ c _ d _ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . and uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . they also like that ,", "summary": "abstract: it transpires that customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes , especially if they include lcd screens and speech recognition ."}
{"dialogue": "furthermore , it 's uh <other> seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . a lot of losers um users lose their controls in their <laugh> in their living room . uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it 's it 's too uh too difficult to learn .", "summary": "abstract: functions like zapping are very prevalent , as well as complaints about remotes being difficult to learn and easy to lose ."}
{"dialogue": "and the <other> the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , the chip uh produces morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . now the led produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it 's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the t _ v _ set ,", "summary": "abstract: the function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip , and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver ( the tv ) via infrared ."}
{"dialogue": "uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , so we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , i like user-centr centred uh <other> uh also the best .", "summary": "abstract: the team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons ."}
{"dialogue": "and if if that 's gives you a little bit of sta status information . no not clickable . uh well i think so , yes . um alright , we go with the l _ c _ d _ screen ?", "summary": "abstract: they plan to include an lcd screen to display relevant information ."}
{"dialogue": "and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , <laugh> we have a power button , setting buttons , l _ c _ d _ window , the number buttons channel , yeah . volume control . uh the mute button . oh you always have in the centre an okay button , for your menu . menu button . yeah . i think that 's important .", "summary": "abstract: other functions are served by push buttons: ok , menu , screen sizing , av , settings buttons , mute , digits 1-9 , power , volume control , channel up / down with the last three types being prominent on the device ."}
{"dialogue": "and the design comes into the next round ?", "summary": "abstract: the exact design and placement of the components will be decided in the next meeting ."}
{"dialogue": "and uh we 'll have to decide s things on our own i think . so", "summary": "action: each member of the team will come for the next meeting with their views on function and design issues that they had not time to consolidate during this meeting ."}
{"dialogue": "so it 's better to uh put our attention to the the design . so you can pick up and use it , thani think .", "summary": "decisions: the solution to complaints about remote controls being difficult to learn is to focus on an intuitive design instead of a thorough manual ."}
{"dialogue": "i think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company .", "summary": "decisions: the idea of interchangeable fronts was mentioned again ; if it were adopted , the company should be recognisable in all the available fronts as well as the remote itself ."}
{"dialogue": "so we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , i like user-centr centred uh <other> uh also the best .", "summary": "decisions: the team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons ."}
{"dialogue": "and if if that 's gives you a little bit of sta status information . no not clickable . alright , we go with the l _ c _ d _ screen ? uh well i think so , yes . um", "summary": "decisions: an lcd screen is going to be used to display information , but would not be interactive ."}
{"dialogue": "<laugh> we have a power button , setting buttons , l _ c _ d _ window , the number buttons channel , yeah . volume control . uh the mute button . oh you always have in the centre an okay button , for your menu . menu button . yeah . i think that 's important .", "summary": "decisions: the buttons are going to include: ok , menu , screen sizing , av , settings buttons , mute , digits 1-9 , power , volume control , channel up / down ."}
{"dialogue": "alright so no button for that . are we going to uh do it like uh on mike 's screen with uh one button that says i 'm going to do a t two number digital ?", "summary": "decisions: there is no need for a special button to recognise two-digit numbers ."}
{"dialogue": "", "summary": ""}
{"dialogue": "", "summary": "decisions: the power button will be placed at the top separately ."}
{"dialogue": "but you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . th that 's a bit uh waste . i do think we have to put that underneath a clip .", "summary": "decisions: the less frequently used buttons will not be hidden under a flip , as it had been previously suggested , as there are not that many of them ; they will just be clearly separated from the more important ones ."}
{"dialogue": "but i think it 's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you ca n't have r _ s _ i _ uh consequences . but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject r _ r _ s _ i _ r _ s _ i _ . that 's very irritating , i think . yeah , but what he said about r _ s _ i _ was <other> t kinda true . i think we we should use something like this um to umthe the channel up and channel down button ? <other> yeah , in circle , you know ? so it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . yeah but people do n't like it when their buttons are all over the place . so the the <other> channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , i think , up and down . no i do n't think . i think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you do n't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together .", "summary": "problems: a discussion on ergonomic solutions like placing the main buttons ( power , channel selection , volume ) where they can be easily reached with the thumb ( as many users complain of rsi ) , did not reach a conclusion as to whether this would actually cause more repetitive movements ."}
{"dialogue": "um research shows that they like to have a little l _ c _ d _ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . it 's going to be expensive . yeah . i do n't have any information on that . so <laugh> i think that 's uh difficult to realise also . and uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . um , research has shown that um it 's a high interested uh in features . like l _ c _ d _ screens and voice recognition . <other> yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost .", "summary": "problems: some advanced features , like lcd screen with program information or speech recognition , would be very important in order to attract their target group , but there are costing issues that have not been clarified yet ."}
{"dialogue": "i think it should be at the top . yeah but with with the l _ c _ d _ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . because um when when uh when i use a remote i l i hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . we do n't want them to look like a calculator . i think it 's still important to have it at the top ,", "summary": "problems: there was some disagreement as to whether the lcd screen should be placed at the top or the bottom of the remote ."}
