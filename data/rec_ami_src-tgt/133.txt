{"dialogue": "prototype presentation , well first", "summary": "abstract: the ui and id presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design ."}
{"dialogue": "<other> basically inwhat we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , we chose a different type of colour for the menu . a bit darker yellow", "summary": "abstract: the rubber case is yellow with black buttons and dark yellow for the menus ."}
{"dialogue": "we chose the buttons to be uh teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute .", "summary": "abstract: there are buttons for teletext , favourite channel , mute and ok ."}
{"dialogue": "you have pushbuttons and an l _ c _ d _ display . we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . the sample sensor and uhfor speak recognition anyway .", "summary": "abstract: it incorporates both lcd screen and speech recognition ."}
{"dialogue": "you have the total of seventeen euros in production cost ,", "summary": "abstract: the prototype proved over budget ( 17 euros ) ."}
{"dialogue": "", "summary": ""}
{"dialogue": "", "summary": "abstract: the main contributing factors were the lcd and speech recognition ."}
{"dialogue": "think i had the best solution that i came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition .", "summary": "abstract: the latter was taken out , along with the special colour ."}
{"dialogue": "i think it was too bad we did n't have the financial info the last time . there was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them .", "summary": "abstract: everyone agreed that the financial information should not have been given to them at the last moment ."}
{"dialogue": "let 's eval evaluate uh the product of us , our design . i uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha whatif it 's true or false", "summary": "abstract: after the costing , the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1 ( excellent ) -7 ( very bad ) ."}
{"dialogue": "so so the buttons , the look and feel . one and a half . <laugh> and the next one <other> uhyeah , when it 's lost uh you can find it . so i think itthat'sthat deserves a one . definitely . and the next one . manual . a three . so i might make this a two instead of a one , i guess . you can use the l _ c _ d _ in a good way . i mean the shape is trendy . maybe we should go with a two then , mostly it 's it 's influenced by the fact that we did n't have enough resources to implement speech recognition . 'cause yeah , that gives you a seven ,", "summary": "abstract: the criteria used were look and feel ( 1 ) , whether it is easy to find ( 1 ) , whether it is easy to learn ( 2 ) , use of lcd ( 3 ) , speech recognition ( 7 ) , trendiness ( 2 ) ."}
{"dialogue": "for example , i thou i thought we were pretty creative in what we created . i think we did pretty well as team-work though . because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you can not communicate in the meantime , although for actual design i 'd say the response time should be a little bit higher , so we can not work on more than one page at same time . that 's not possible .", "summary": "abstract: finally , the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity ( satisfactory ) , leadership and teamwork ( happy with it , but they missed communicating in between meetings ) , and means ( smartboard could be improved in terms of response time , the digital pens could not be used on more than one page at the same time ) ."}
{"dialogue": "triple r _ it is .", "summary": "abstract: finally , the decided to call their design triple-r ."}
{"dialogue": "have to write my report now , i guess .", "summary": "action: the pm is going to finish the project report ."}
{"dialogue": "could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report ? yeah , sure .", "summary": "action: the ui and id will send him their design to include ."}
{"dialogue": "think i had the best solution that i came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition . you have the total of seventeen euros in production cost ,", "summary": "decisions: because the prototype was over budget , the team decided to take out the speech recognition from the design ."}
{"dialogue": "i think it 's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect yeah . i would sayi would agree with you on the colour , we 're final on that .", "summary": "decisions: they also discarded the special colour , and decided to rely on the changeable covers for an attractive look ."}
{"dialogue": "triple r _ it is .", "summary": "decisions: the remote control is going to be called triple-r ."}
{"dialogue": "you have the total of seventeen euros in production cost ,", "summary": "problems: the production cost was 17 euros , 4.5 more than the budget ."}
{"dialogue": "what do we scrap .", "summary": "problems: it was imperative that some of the features had to be taken out ."}
{"dialogue": "so i had to take out the special colour i suppose . and if you want itif you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers . i think the colour is more important than the really the curve , but the example is because we do offer the um <other> the possibility of adding your own custom covers . i think it 's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect", "summary": "problems: there was disagreement over whether the special colour should be scrapped and the look to rely on the separate covers ."}
{"dialogue": "we could take out the curve . can we then not also uh change the material ? we take plastic for the basic cover i say lose the curve . oh that 's true ,", "summary": "problems: other solutions , like abandoning the curve of the casing or replace the rubber with plastic were also suggested ."}
{"dialogue": "so ca n't we just basically extend it to thirteen ? uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half , so why why uh <other> do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ? and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company", "summary": "problems: they were also not allowed to raise the budget limit ."}
{"dialogue": "what are we uh displaying on the l _ c _ d _ screen ? things like brightness and uh those kind of things we 've put in the menu , i thought that people wanted previews on their i do n't think it 's possible really . uh with configuring your remote control for favouriteyour favourite channel for example , how do you configure that . so that could be done by l _ c _ d _ display . i do admit that we d <other> did miss a littleor did n't sp did n't talktalk enough about the possibility of the l _ c _ d _ display . like i said , <other> changing channels , everything hidden in your l _ c _ d _ display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything .", "summary": "problems: the precise use of the lcd was not defined: it could be used for tv configuration , or , if possible , for displaying the tv programme and previews ."}
{"dialogue": "i think a smartboard smartboard is pretty cool . although for actual design i 'd say the response time should be a little bit higher ,", "summary": "problems: although the smartboard was useful to draw ideas quickly , it could be improved in terms of response time ."}
{"dialogue": "so we can not work on more than one page at same time . that 's not possible .", "summary": "problems: similarly , the digital pens did not allow the user to work on more than one page at a time ."}
{"dialogue": "because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you can not communicate in the meantime ,", "summary": "problems: the team were unable to communicate amongst themselves in between meetings , which hindered the flow of information ."}
