{"dialogue": "<cough> okay , let 's have a look to the agenda today . <other> so , we are going to have a meeting about the functional design . um so first before starting i w just going to uh to go quickly tothrough the minutes of previous meeting . so uh <cough> basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control , but i have new um new i inputs forabout that topics . i goin i 'm going to share with you . so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations .", "summary": "abstract: the project manager opens the meeting stating that they will address the functional design of the remote and saying they are still undecided about whether it should be universal or specific ."}
{"dialogue": "but first i would like quickly to uh to decide ofto give a name to the project . so , i just put d quickly remo , any ideas ? uh the powerstick . maybe a spanish name would work well . mando . what does it mean in spanish ? control . <other> so , let 's go for mando ?", "summary": "abstract: he suggests they name the project and they come up with `` mando '' , meaning `` control '' in spanish ."}
{"dialogue": "so maybe we could start with the market , yeah . and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls . and also i di i did a study withfor the incorporation of new technologies well <cough> <other> moremost of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . so and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control , the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control . so <cough> <other> in my opinion the mandothis mando should n't be very small so it may be interesting to to think in ain both prototypes , for right and left handed people . well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person . well maybe it could be a universal design .", "summary": "abstract: the marketing expert presents some research done on user opinions of remotes ."}
{"dialogue": "and finally , the incorporation of a l _ c _ d _ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but i do n't know if the budget would be large enough . but most ofyeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology . i think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you thinkif you 're watching t _ v _ you 're gon na have a lot of this uh background noise from the t _ v _ which might interfere with the it could be command control kind of thing . it requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated .", "summary": "abstract: he suggests the use of using voice recognition or an lcd , which they discuss despite concerns about budget limitation ."}
{"dialogue": "okay so um while uh researching this this topic i first of all just thought of a couple of things that i would like to see in a remote , and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site . and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the l _ c _ d _ screen but um the thing that i find most interesting about this remote control , and it 's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , i think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel . because obviously a lot of this stuff ca n't be done for twenty five eu uh euro , this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it 's it 's it 's very simple , the scroll wheel could be used without an l _ c _ d _ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . and maybe we wan na make it something that 's <other> extensible to do other tasks . then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , i dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on ,", "summary": "abstract: the industrial designer presents , showing examples of existing products and suggesting they add a scroll wheel for channel-changing ."}
{"dialogue": "but one possibility is to download program information into the l _ c _ d _ screen so this is something else we might wan na consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , but i think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . um i think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . um if i had my perfect remote control , i 'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they 're just in the way . because w if people see a remo see thesee a remote control without numbers mm they will think it 's very difficult to learn very difficult tovery different buildvery different to the traditional um okay , so , i think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have thisa programme driven interface rather than the channel number .", "summary": "abstract: he says internet capability might be necessary for an lcd and then brings up button size , suggesting having a flip-open door with extra buttons under it ."}
{"dialogue": "user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoingdoing some he is knowing about that technology . and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also beingsitting on the on the remote . but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel . do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target wellof such technologies is enough ? well wh uh i imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones <other> well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though , my personal preference was that we can have a _ s _ r _ sitting there on the remote control . i 'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five euros everyo <laugh> everyone will s will buy it . <laugh> <cough> actually i 'm not so sure you know if i was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because i ca n't hear it very well , i do n't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when i 'm when i'minstead of pressing up on on a remote control .", "summary": "abstract: they discuss voice recognition again , and then the interface specialist presents ."}
{"dialogue": "user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoingdoing some he is knowing about that technology . and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also beingsitting on the on the remote . and for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote . that increases the the cost also .", "summary": "abstract: he suggests they have two types of user interfaces and brings up that voice recognition would increase production price ."}
{"dialogue": "we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big . we should bring new technologies for young peoples , so so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it 's not possible to go s to go to l _ c _ d _ <other> and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to l _ c _ d _ on the remote control ? for twenty five euro ? <laugh> i think it 's impossible . because for twenty five euro i think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , so i would i would like to know if there 's any chance of of increasing the uh of increasing the unit price . what would be the goal of putting an l _ c _ d _ in a remote control ? so what would what would appear in the in the l _ c _ d _ ? so you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it 's up to . i think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper thethan the l _ c _ d _ . we do n't go for speech recognition technology . the l _ c _ d _ is still on disc is still open to discussion . but then we should move to another target b because at twenty five dollars , can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ? i 'm no i 'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies . um <other> so you have to work on the component uh concept . uh you have to work on user interface , and you have to go through a trend watching .", "summary": "abstract: they talk about the budget limitations on features and then the project manager summarizes decisios made and closes the meeting by teeling each group member what he should work on ."}
{"dialogue": "um <other> so you have to work on the component uh concept .", "summary": "action: the industrial designer will work on the component concept ."}
{"dialogue": "uh you have to work on user interface ,", "summary": "action: the interface specialist will work on the user interface ."}
{"dialogue": "and you have to go through a trend watching .", "summary": "action: the marketing expert will work on trend-watching ."}
{"dialogue": "and so they wantedso they want to umthey would like to be restricted to t _ v _ .", "summary": "decisions: the remote control will be for television only ."}
{"dialogue": "we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big .", "summary": "decisions: the remote control should be fancy , a good shape , and not too small or too big ."}

{"dialogue": "", "summary": "decisions: a wheel should be used to navigate ."}
{"dialogue": "<other> and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . we do n't go for speech recognition technology .", "summary": "decisions: because of budget restrictions , they can not do speech recognition technologies ."}
{"dialogue": "and uh finally , <other> it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product .", "summary": "decisions: corporate logo will be clearly displayed on product ."}
{"dialogue": "well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to l _ c _ d _ on the remote control ? the l _ c _ d _ is still on disc is still open to discussion . so the question is still open about the l _ c _ d _ thing .", "summary": "problems: they have not yet decided whether to include an lcd screen ."}
{"dialogue": "so so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it 's not possible to go s to go to l _ c _ d _ so you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it 's up to . so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the t _ v _ , or uh or it should be a special t _ v _ connected to i think the type of people that are gon na want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gon na have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or ayou know .", "summary": "problems: although the project manager clearly does not favor the idea because of budget costs and the possible requirement of internet connection , others are pushing for it ."}
{"dialogue": "so i would i would like to know if there 's any chance of of increasing the uh of increasing the unit price . but then we should move to another target b because at twenty five dollars , can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ?", "summary": "problems: they find that the budget is restricting their capabilities , and mentioned increasing the price of the remote control ."}
