{"dialogue": "okay . so first , <other> let 's uh see the prototype .", "summary": "abstract: this last meeting started with the presentation of a remote control prototype ."}
{"dialogue": "and so , we have buttons and using l _ c _ d _ , or like you can use this <other> jog wheel and select which ever option on the l _ c _ d _ , and then do on and off . <other> so , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume . and you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours . for the l _ c _ d _ . it 's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the l _ c _ d _ screen . the scroll-wheel , okay . one l _ c _ d _ displayed .", "summary": "abstract: it has on-off and volume buttons , an lcd screen ( it can be active or switched off ) in various colours , which largely replaces the use of push buttons , and a jog-wheel for navigation and option selection in the menus presented on the lcd ."}
{"dialogue": "and we have speech recognition . and we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . and then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition . <other>", "summary": "abstract: it also includes speech recognition as an alternative interface , which also serves as mechanism for locating the device ."}
{"dialogue": "", "summary": ""}
{"dialogue": "", "summary": "abstract: it was designed to be powered by a single battery ."}
{"dialogue": "<other> material , we want to stick to titanium . wh what are the strawberries for ? <laugh> the case is silver titanium , no ? so , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours . titanium .", "summary": "abstract: the casing will be made of titanium with rubber strawberries following the fruit and veg fashion ."}
{"dialogue": "let 's see if uh th it 's meet the evaluation criterium . <laugh> so what i propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . one meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . what do you think , is it fancy ? <laugh> so here , two . up . then we have uh technology . d i think it 's a one for that , at least . robustness , uh-huh . it 's um robust , yeah . well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? okay , two . <laugh> <laugh> so size and weight . up to three for that , colour and shape . i suggested three . and uh the last one is adaptive . okay . <other> let 's go for one . <laugh> now we have to do the average . <laugh> two point one seven . so now , it has to fulfil the <laugh> financial criterium ? so we are at seventeen dot eight .", "summary": "abstract: the prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1 ( excellent ) -7 ( very bad ) in terms of fancifulness , technology , robustness , usefulness , size , colour and shape and customizability: the average mark was 2.17 ; the team were satisfied with their prototype , although after costs were calculated it proved very expensive ."}
{"dialogue": "project evaluation , good . < sound indicating relief > mm . see mm how <other> are we a good team ? mm . is there enough room for creativity ? yeah , yeah . team-work , very strong , i would say .", "summary": "abstract: finally , the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team , they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager 's leadership ."}

{"dialogue": "", "summary": "action: * na *"}
{"dialogue": "so , but if we select the hand dynamo it 's okay ,", "summary": "decisions: after the team realised the prototype was over budget , they replaced the battery with a hand dynamo ."}
{"dialogue": "apparently , we have to choose one or the other . <other> if i look at what is the most expensive things , uh it 's the l _ c _ d _ and the speaker . so , put minus one there , please . <laugh> <laugh> i 'm not sure if this is legal . okay , we 're uh on target .", "summary": "decisions: when it became evident from the costs of components and materials that they would have to do without either the lcd or the speech recognition , they decided to change the given prices in order to accommodate them to their design and budget ."}
{"dialogue": "wh what are the strawberries for ? <laugh> that 's location sensors . <other> and what about the strawberries on the top ?", "summary": "problems: the gratuitous presence of decorative rubber strawberries on a titanium case ( even if they cover sensors ) did not meet everyone 's approval ."}
{"dialogue": "<laugh> i 'm not convince . <cough> well y you know , it 's this uh fruit and vegetable year .", "summary": "problems: although , the attempt was towards keeping with the current fashion trends , the result did not satisfy the program manager ."}
{"dialogue": "so we are at seventeen dot eight .", "summary": "problems: the prototype was more than 40 % over budget ."}
{"dialogue": "<other> so think of what we can cut uh here . <laugh> are we supposed to cut things out now ?", "summary": "problems: the team realised that their budget did not allow for all the specifications of their prototype ."}
