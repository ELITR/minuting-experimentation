{"dialogue": "so final design . final design . well first first of all we made a an attractive <laugh> base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it 's not gon na tip over we 've got the two uh <other> uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath <other> we have the uh the turbo button what 's the use uh of the t turbo button already ? this is when you when you uh are scrolling the uhthrough the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that youquickly rather th well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops . if you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the t _ v _ . once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume . <other> and this is the uh the infrared uh port . in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana . and the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ? and for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries . and we have put these different colours so that people do n't mistake them mistake it as a banana . it 's it 's uh it 's about the weight of a banana . i do n't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station . uh i mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ? no eight or eight or ten hours of working . if you are just leaving like that it 'll be much longer . pricing iswas a factor so that 's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip . and what about people who want to use digits ? yeah . so there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape .", "summary": "abstract: they have the prototype presentation and talk about the final design , features , and power source , type of chip and weight of the remote ."}
{"dialogue": "so we have to go through now evaluations . i constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements . so we must users must say i if it 's true or isor if it 's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven . why this strange factor of seven ? because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale , i think i sh i <cough> i could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ?", "summary": "abstract: they go through the evaulations , using the a list of criteria made by the marketing expert ."}
{"dialogue": "okay let 's let 's evaluate if it 's fancy or yeah , it 's fancy , according to me . seven . seven by me . yeah uh five . but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason like i 'd i think it 's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels functional . i 'll give five . well it depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or d does what it does , you know , can it make you coffee ? actually i do n't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro well it 's not a universal remote . four . <laugh> < singing sound > okay cool ? cool device . there i 'll give it seven . for a t _ v _ the most important feature which i felt was the locator which is a cool feature . i would say five . i sayi said seven . of course i 'll buy thebanana . i 'll say five . i find it quite cheap <laugh> actually . i dunno . if i i it depends , if you live in in switzerland or you live in wha the initial specifications were for the whole all europe or <laugh> i do n't want a banana on my <laugh> living room table , a banana remote . anyb anybody who comes here <laugh> anybody who comes to your home he 'll at least ask once what is this . do n't forget who we 're targeting also <laugh> no , it 's i . i would buy i do n't think iat any stage in my life i would want a banana remote control , really . so you say two . i say five . if i had t if i had to spend twenty five euro , if that was like my limit , maybe i would buy it . i stick to five . will i change my rem change my remote control from mando banana . no uh let 's say i 'll put two . if it waschange my remote control of my d _ v _ d _ player for a mando banana then i would be more inclined to i 'd say a three . <laugh> so it 's somewhere three point five i think . so maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling . we can had uh have aout of these numbers , which which is that well we should go for it .", "summary": "abstract: they rate each criteria on a scale of 0 ( true ) to 7 ( false ) : how fancy it is , how handy it is , how functional , how cool it is , whether they would spend twenty five euro for it , and whether they would change their current remote for this one ."}
{"dialogue": "um well we are going to calculate the production costs . we should we should be below twelve point five . no kinetic also . oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing . so we we 'll put some extras , if there is something . we 're just using the the very beepsimple beep , well actually that thatno that sample speaker is notwe we 're not using that , and we have sample speaker . <laugh> yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of <laugh> plastic . so might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things whichthe cord and everything which 'll go so we have margin for that stuff .", "summary": "abstract: next they do a cost estimate for production ."}

{"dialogue": "so we can go tothrough to project evaluation . no we have a product which none of us would buy . <laugh> <laugh> okay so um <other> project process . well in fact i i did not know <laugh> i did n't know really what to say here . yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen , not that much . i dunno i think we had a fair bit of creativity . <laugh> and uh but i think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um <other> like a focus group with the actual people we 're targeting . yeah maybe we should go through , yeah an uh evaluation . because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of pointless . so but i think that 's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market . i think that 's actually something that should be in version two , is the ability to you know to control things other than the t _ v _ i think we we can go okay so thanks very much .", "summary": "abstract: they briefly evaulate the project process and close the meeting ."}
