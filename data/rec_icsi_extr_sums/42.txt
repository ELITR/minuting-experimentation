A:  where this came up was that uh I was showing off these wave forms that we have on the web 
A:  and  and uh <breath> I just sort of hadn't noticed this , but that  the major , major component in the wave  in the second wave form in that pair of wave forms is actually the air conditioner . 

A:  I <laugh> <breath> I have to be more careful about using that as a  as a  <breath> as a good illustration , 
A:  uh , in fact it 's not , of uh  <breath> of the effects of room reverberation . 
A:  It is isn't a bad illustration of the effects of uh room noise . <breath> on  on uh some mikes 

A:  OK , so uh <breath> had some interesting mail from uh Dan Ellis . 

A:  um The other thing that I don't know the answer to , but when people are using Feacalc here , uh whether they 're using it with the high - pass filter option or not . 

A:  So when we 're doing all these things using our software there is  

A:  and <breath> it 's  it 's pretty  it 's not a very severe 
A:  filter . Doesn't affect speech frequencies , 

A:  So . We  we  we want to go and check that in i for anything that we 're going to use the P D 

A:  but if we do make use of the cheap mikes , <breath> uh we want to be sure to do that  that filtering before we <breath> process it . 

A:  since I was talking about reverberation and showing this thing that was noise , it wasn't a good match , 

A:  So I think we 'll change our  our picture on the web , when we 're @ @ . 

A:  um <breath> Another , I was thinking of was um <breath> taking some spectral slices , 

A:  and look at the spectrum or cepstrum that you get out of there , 

A:  Well , I mean um all the recognizers look at frames . 

A:  at one point in time or uh twenty  over twenty milliseconds or something , <breath> you have a spectrum or a cepstrum . 

F:  Uh . Since the last meeting we 've  we 've tried to put together um <mouth> the clean low - pass um downsampling , upsampling , I mean , 
F:  Uh the new filter that 's replacing the LDA filters , 

F:  and then we have results that are not um <mouth> <breath> very impressive . 
F:  Well , there is no <breath> real improvement . 

A:  But it 's not wer worse 
A:  and it 's better  better latency , 

F:  It seems better when we look at the mismatched case 
F:  but <mouth> I think we are like  like cheated here by the  th this problem 
F:  that <breath> uh in some cases when you modify slight  slightly modify the initial condition you end up <breath> completely somewhere air somewhere else in the  in the space , <breath> the parameters . 

F:  I don't  I don't think it means that the new system is more robust 

F:  but I mean <breath> from this se seventy - eight um percent recognition rate system , <breath> I could change the transition probabilities for the  the first HMM and  it will end up to eighty - nine also . 
F:  By using point five instead of point six , point four <breath> as in the  the HTK script . 

B:  Yeah I looked at um  <breath> looked at the results when Stephane did that 
B:  and it 's  it 's really wo really happens . 

B:  and it causes ten percent difference in the word error rate . 

B:  I mean th the only difference is you change the self - loop transition probability by a tenth of a percent 

B:  and n not tenth of a percent , one tenth , 

B:  it 's just very um  
B:  you know get stuck in some local minimum 
B:  and this thing throws you out of it I guess . 

A:  Well , what 's  what are  according to the rules what  what are we supposed to do about the transition probabilities ? 

B:  I think you 're not allowed to  

B:  That 's supposed to be point six , for the self - loop . 

B:  But changing it to point five I think is  
B:  which gives you much better results , 
B:  but that 's <breath> not allowed . 

F:  Yeah , but even if you use point five , I 'm not sure it will always give you the better results 

B:  Right . We only tested it on the  the medium mismatch , 

B:  Somebody , I think it was Morgan , suggested at the last meeting that I actually count to see <breath> how many parameters and how many frames . 
B:  And there are uh almost one point eight million frames of training data 
B:  and less than forty thousand parameters in the baseline system . 

A:  And that  that says that we could have lots more parameters actually . 

B:  For  for all of the digit models , they end up at three mixtures per state . 
B:  And so I just did a quick experiment , where I changed it so it went to four 
B:  and um <breath> it it  it didn't have a r any significant effect at the uh medium mismatch and high mismatch cases 

B:  Uh so I 'm r gonna run that again but <breath> um with many more uh mixtures per state . 

B:  but one one thing I  I wanted to check out before I increased the um <breath> number of mixtures per state was <breath> uh <breath> in their <breath> default training script they do an initial set of three re - estimations 

B:  and then they do seven iterations then the add mixtures 
B:  and they do another seven then they add mixtures 
B:  then they do a final set of seven and they quit . 

B:  and it also makes the experiments go take a really long time 

B:  And so one of the things I did was I compiled HTK for the Linux <breath> machines 
B:  cuz we have this one from IBM that 's got like five processors in it ? 
B:  and so now I 'm  you can run stuff on that and that really helps a lot because now we 've got <breath> you know , extra machines that we can use for compute . 
B:  And if  I 'm do running an experiment right now where I 'm changing the number of iterations ? <breath> from seven to three ? 
B:  just to see how it affects the baseline system . 

B:  And if it 's not a  a huge difference from running with seven iterations , <breath> um , you know , we should be able to get a lot more experiments done . 
B:  And so . I 'll let you know what  what happens with that . 

F:  Yeah , actually the way the final score is computed is quite funny . 
F:  It 's not a mean of word error rate . 
F:  It 's not a weighted mean of word error rate , 
F:  it 's a weighted mean of improvements . 

F:  Which means that <mouth> actually the weight on the well - matched is  
F:  Well I well what what  What happened is that if you have a small improvement or a small if on the well - matched case <breath> it will have uh huge influence on the improvement compared to the reference 
F:  because the reference system is  is  is quite good for  for the well - ma well - matched case also . 

A:  So they do improvement in terms of uh accuracy ? rather than word error rate ? 

F:  No , it 's compared to the word er it 's improvement on the word error rate , 

A:  So if you have uh ten percent error and you get five percent absolute uh <breath> improvement then that 's fifty percent . 
A:  OK . So what you 're saying then is that if it 's something that has a small word error rate , <breath> then uh a  even a relatively small improvement on it , in absolute terms , <breath> will show up as quite  quite large in this . 

A:  But yeah that 's  that 's  it 's the notion of relative improvement . 

A:  That 's why I 've been saying we should be looking at word error rate uh and  and not  not at <breath> at accuracies . 

A:  I mean uh we probably should have standardized on that all the way through . 

A:  but you 're  but when you look at the numbers , your sense of the relative size of things is quite different . 

F:  Well anyway 

F:  Yeah . So it hurts a little bit on the well - match 

F:  No , point six  uh percent absolute on Italian  

F:  Uh well we start from ninety - four point sixty - four , 
F:  and we go to ninety - four point O four . 

F:  For Finnish , we start to ninety - three point eight - four 
F:  and we go to ninety - three point seventy - four . 
F:  And for Spanish we are  we were at ninety - five point O five 
F:  and we go to ninety - three - s point sixty one . 

A:  OK , so we are getting hurt somewhat . 

F:  but the filter  So the filter with the shorter delay hurts on Italian well - matched , 

A:  Uh . Do the  does the new filter make things uh better or worse for the other cases ? 
A:  Doesn't hurt , but doesn't get a little better , or something . 

A:  Um . What I was asking , though , is uh  are  what 's  what 's the level of communication with uh <breath> the O G I gang now , about this 

F:  Well , we are exchanging mail as soon as we  <breath-laugh> we have significant results . 

F:  For the moment , they are working on integrating <breath> the um <mouth> spectral subtraction apparently from Ericsson . 

F:  We are working on our side on other things like <breath> uh also trying a sup spectral subtraction 
F:  but of  of our own , I mean , another <breath> spectral substraction . 

A:  Is there any further discussion about this  this idea of  of having some sort of source code control ? 

F:  Well . For the moment they 're  

F:  There is this Eurospeech deadline , 

A:  Sounds like a great idea 
A:  but  but I think that  that um <breath> he 's saying people are sort of scrambling for a Eurospeech deadline . 
A:  But that 'll be uh , uh done in a week . 
A:  So , maybe after <breath> this next one . 

A:  Yeah . So , I mean , I  I think that you could certainly start looking at  at the issue 
A:  uh but  but uh <breath> I think it 's probably , on s from what Stephane is saying , it 's  it 's unlikely to get sort of active participation from the two sides until after they 've  

B:  but I could  try to look into like this uh CVS over the web . 
B:  That seems to be a very popular <breath> way of  people distributing changes and  over , you know , multiple sites and things 
B:  so maybe <breath> if I can figure out how do that easily and then pass the information on to everybody so that it 's <breath> you know , as easy to do as possible 
B:  and  and people don't  it won't interfere with  their regular work , 

C:  And if you 're interested in using CVS , I 've set it up here , 

B:  so maybe I can ask you some questions . 

C:  So . I 'll be away tomorrow and Monday but I 'll be back on Tuesday or Wednesday . 

A:  Dave , the other thing , actually , is  is this business about this wave form . 
A:  Maybe you and I can talk a little bit at some point about <breath> coming up with a better <breath> uh demonstration of the effects of reverberation for our web page , 

A:  It made a good  good audio demonstration because when we could play that clip the  the  the really <breath> obvious difference is that you can hear two voices and  <breath> <laugh> in the second one and only hear  

A:  but I mean you can't  when you play it back in a room with a  you know a big room , <breath> nobody can hear that difference really . 

A:  But for the  the visual , just , you know , I 'd like to have uh <breath> uh , you know , the spectrogram again , 

A:  The other thing that we had in there that I didn't like was that um <breath> the most obvious characteristic of the difference uh when you listen to it is that there 's a second voice , 
A:  and the  the  the  the  the uh <mouth> cuts that we have there actually don't correspond to the full wave form . 

A:  But <breath> it  it 's um  <breath> it 's the first six seconds or something <breath> of it 
A:  and it 's in <breath> the seventh or eighth second or something where @ @ the second voice comes in . 
A:  So we  we would like to actually see <breath> the voice coming in , too , I think , 

F:  Well . I start  we started to work on spectral subtraction . 
F:  And <mouth> um <mouth> the preliminary results were very bad . 
F:  So the thing that we did is just to add spectral subtraction before this , the Wall uh process , which contains LDA on - line normalization . 
F:  And it hurts uh a lot . 

A:  Can I ask a , I mean  a sort of top - level question , 
A:  which is <breath> um " if  if most of what the OGI folk are working with is trying to <breath> integrate this other  other uh spectral subtraction , <breath> why are we worrying about it ? " 

F:  It 's just uh  Well it 's another  
F:  They are trying to u to use the um  <mouth> the Ericsson 
F:  and we 're trying to use something  something else . 

F:  And what they did at OGI is just <breath> uh they don't use on - line normalization , for the moment , on spectral subtraction 

F:  I think as soon as they will try on - line normalization <breath> there will be a problem . 
F:  So yeah , we 're working on the same thing but <breath> I think 

F:  with different  different system 

A:  Intellectually it 's interesting to work on things th uh one way or the other 
A:  but I 'm  I 'm just wondering if um  <breath> on the list of things that there are to do , 
A:  if there are things that we won't do because <breath> we 've got two groups doing the same thing . 

A:  Just  just asking . 

A:  Do you remember when the next meeting is supposed to be ? 

F:  It 's uh in June . 

A:  Um . Yeah , the other thing is that you saw that  that mail about uh the VAD  V A Ds performing quite differently ? 

A:  This  there was this experiment of uh " what if we just take the baseline ? " 

A:  and you inc incorporate the different V A 
A:  And it looks like the  the French VAD is actually uh better  significantly better . 

F:  Yeah but I don't know which VAD they use . 

F:  It 's Pratibha that  that did this experiment . 
F:  Um . We should ask which VAD she used . 

D:  He  Actually , I think that he say with the good VAD of  from OGI 

A:  I mean it was enough better that  that it would <mouth> uh account for a fair amount of the difference between our performance , actually . 

A:  So if they have a better one , we should use it . 

A:  H Hynek will be back in town uh the week after next , 
A:  back  back in the country . 

A:  And start  start organizing uh <breath> more visits and connections and so forth , 

A:  working towards June . 

D:  Also is Stephane was thinking that <breath> maybe it was useful to f to think about uh <breath> voiced - unvoiced  

F:  Yeah , my feeling is that um actually <breath> when we look at all the proposals , ev everybody is still using some kind of spectral envelope 

A:  No use of pitch uh basically . 

F:  but to look at the um fine  at the  at the high re high resolution spectrum . 

F:  Cuz I have a feeling that <breath> when we look  when we look at the  just at the envelope there is no way you can tell if it 's voiced and unvoiced , 

F:  Um yeah , so yeah , I think if we try to develop a second stream 
F:  well , there would be one stream that is the envelope and the second , it could be interesting to have 
F:  that 's  something that 's more related to the fine structure of the spectrum . 

F:  well , voiced - speech detector , that 's working on  on the FFT 

F:  Larry Saul could be an idea . 
F:  We were are thinking about just <breath> kind of uh taking the spectrum 
F:  and computing the variance of  of the high resolution spectrum <breath> and things like this . 

A:  Uh we had a guy here some years ago who did some work on <breath> um <breath> making use of voicing information uh to <breath> help in reducing the noise . 
A:  So what he was doing is basically y you  <breath> you do estimate the pitch . 

A:  or you estimate fine harmonic structure , 

A:  i if there is strong harmonic structure , <breath> you can throw away stuff that 's  that 's non - harmonic . 
A:  And that  that is another way of getting rid of part of the noise 

A:  brings in a little more information than just spectral subtraction . 

A:  And he had some  I mean , he did that sort of in combination with RASTA . 

A:  and  and got some  some decent results doing that . 
A:  So that  that 's another  another way . 

A:  Yeah , that 's a good idea . 

F:  Because , yeah , well , spectral subtraction is good 
F:  and we could u we could use the fine structure to  to have a better estimate of the noise 
F:  but <breath> still there is this issue with spectral subtraction that it seems to increase the variance of  of  of 

F:  Well it 's this musical noise which is annoying if you d you do some kind of on - line normalization after . 

F:  Well . Spectral subtraction and on - line normalization don't seem to  to go together very well . 

A:  In fact if you get  if you go into uh  a uh harmonics - related thing <breath> it 's definitely going to be different than what they 're doing 

A:  should have some interesting properties in noise .
