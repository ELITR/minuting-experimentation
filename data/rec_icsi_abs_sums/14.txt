C:  Then I 'm also going to present a little talk at EML , about what we have done here 
E:  let 's talk about your thesis proposal . 

C:  Then I 'm also going to present a little talk at EML , about what we have done here 
C:  Then I 'm going to talk about the data , 

C:  e tell a little bit  as much as I  can about the NTL story . 
C:  and then maybe talk about the big picture here , 
C:  So X - schemas , then , I would like to do  
C:  and then at the end about our Bayes - net . 

C:  It basically says , well " this is construal " , 
C:  and then it continues to say that one could potentially build a probabilistic relational model that has some general , domain - general rules 
C:  and then the idea is to use ontology , situation , user , and discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational model  to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what 

None

E:  And to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal . 
E:  but cover only base cases . 
E:  but there are basic cases . 
C:  w Well we have , for example , a canonical use of something 
C:  and y it 's , you know , we have some constructions 
C:  and then it 's construed as something , 
C:  and then we  we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use that 's also relevant to the  to the domain . 

C:  But " walked into the cafe and ordered a drink , " and " walked into the cafe and broke his nose , " 
E:  But " run into " does . 
E:  So " in the bus " and " on the bus , " 
C:  We had  we had  initially we 'd  started discussing the " out of film . " 
C:  Where is the castle ? 
C:  I mean maybe the " where is something " question as a whole , you know , can be construed as , u i locational versus instructional request . 

C:  But I think the argument should be  uh , can be made that , you know , despite the fact that this is not the most met metaphorical domain , 

C:  e tell a little bit  as much as I  can about the NTL story . 
C:  and then maybe talk about the big picture here , 
C:  Oh , maybe the FMRI stuff . 
E:  Well , the time to mention it , if you mention it , is when you talk about mirror neurons , 

E:  the b the combination of the biology and the Leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys , 

E:  there  the  there  we 've got various i generations of slides that show language analysis , and matching to the underlying image schemas , 

E:  OK . So why don't we plan to give you feedback electronically . 

C:  current formalism thing that you presented . 

E:  i i it looks like the , uh , metaphor didn't get in yet . 
E:  but cover only base cases . 
E:  And to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal . 
C:  w Well we have , for example , a canonical use of something

E:  So " in the bus " and " on the bus , " 
C:  We had  we had  initially we 'd  started discussing the " out of film . " 
E:  OK . Can we think of a nice metaphorical use of " where " in the tourist 's domain ? 
A:  A fixed expression , yeah .
