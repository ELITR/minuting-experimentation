E:  The other topic I was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that . 
C:  Um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in . 
C:  so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . 
C:  And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes . 
C:  No , we 're just replacing the wired  the two wired that are still working , 
C:  along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless . 

F:  but I  think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now . 
F:  The next step is to  that I 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . 
F:  and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , Liz requested in terms of um , um  in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about . 
F:  that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , 

A:  Yeah , and I  and I tried t to normalize uh  uh the features , there 's loudness and modified loudness , um , within one channel , 
A:  because they 're , <outbreath> yeah to  to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech . 

C:  I wanna talk a little bit about getting  how we 're gonna to get people to edit bleeps , parts of the meeting that they don't want to include . 
E:  the transcription part ? So I guess the next thing is this uh  bleep editing . 
C:  We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want . 
C:  " If you agree to participate you 'll have the opportunity to have anything ex anything excised , which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . " 
C:  There again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you 'd prefer to have excised from the database , 
C:  and they will m be removed both from the transcript and the recording . " 

C:  " If you agree to participate you 'll have the opportunity to have anything ex anything excised , which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . " 
C:  and they will m be removed both from the transcript and the recording . " 
C:  There again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you 'd prefer to have excised from the database , 
E:  Again let 's you know , sort of circulate the  the wording on each of these things and get it right , 

C:  so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . 
C:  And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes . 
C:  No , we 're just replacing the wired  the two wired that are still working , 
C:  along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless . 

C:  Well we should talk to them about it because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff , 
C:  and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone  on the same page with that . 

F:  In listening to  some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things , 

None

B:  Are  are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking ? 
B:  So that means other people are editing what you say ? 

E:  But I really think we wanna make it the rare incidence . 
E:  And  and uh , I am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do ,
