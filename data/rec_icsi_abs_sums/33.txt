A:  So , I think this is gonna be a pretty short meeting because I have four agenda items , 

A:  three of them were requested by Jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today . 
F:  Um  Well first of all with IBM I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a  week or week and a half ago 
F:  and hopefully next week we 'll have the transcription back from that . 
E:  So we 're doing some in parallel . 

F:  so I 've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected 
F:  That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages 
A:  So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but I don't really think there 's much to talk about . 
A:  I 'm gonna send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to  suggest edits . 
C:  So but it 's just transcripts , not the  not the audio ? 
A:  Nope , they 'll have access to the audio also . 
A:  Because the transcripts might not be right . 
F:  So , um the audio that they 're gonna have access to , will that be the uncompressed version ? 
F:  Or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and  
A:  Yeah , it 's  it 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , uh , uh , it takes too long to do random access decompression . 

A:  Um , DARPA demo status , not much to say . 
A:  The back - end stuff is working out fine . 
E:  And , also um , I was just showing Andreas , I got um an X Waves kind of display , 
E:  and I don't know how much more we can do with it  
E:  with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom 

C:  I 've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows 
D:  But  But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the  you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is  that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform . 
E:  and see the pitch contours also . 
A:  Just record the audio clip and show an image and I think that 's  
B:  and , <clear throat> the more live , the better , but uh , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent . 
B:  So I think   For a lot of reasons , I think it would be very nice to have this Transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it 

A:  And the last i item on the agenda is disk issues yet again . 
A:  We 're  We 're only about thirty percent on the second disk . 
A:  but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings . 

B:  Uh , you know Dave Johnson is gone for , like , ten days , 
B:  I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , 
B:  So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave , 
B:  But at any rate I think that there 's a  there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need 

D:  um yot I tested the uh  the sort of final version of the PLP configuration um on development test data for  for this year 's Hub - five test set . 
D:  And the recognition performance was exactly , and I mean exactly up to the  you know , the first decimal , same as with the uh Mel Cepstra front - end . 
D:  They  They were  The males I think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really . 
D:  And then the really nice thing was that if  if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement . 

D:  And then we had some results on  digits , uh , with um  
D:  And the reason is basically there 's a whole bunch of read speech data in the Hub - five training set . 

D:  And then I th guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system 

B:  so something that we wanna do next meeting is  is uh to put together um , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it , um , that we 've done . 
B:  I mean just sort of bulletize I mean o e do do I can  I can dream up text but  this is basically gonna lead to the annual report . 
A:  So just a week from tomorrow ? 
D:  Um  Uh  One thing  I mean  we  <inbreath> <clear throat> in past meetings we had um also a you know various  variously talked about the um work that w uh was happening sort of on the  on the recognition side 
D:  Well , it 's that  It 's just gonna be ver very boring for people who are not you know , sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system . 
B:  Well , OK , so how many  how many people here would not be interested in uh  in a meeting about recognition ? 
D:  Liz and Jane probably . 
F:  Why don't we alternate this meeting every other week ? 
F:  But I do I don't  I mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on Meeting Recorder . 
B:  And then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting . 
B:  Uh . So uh . Um . Let 's chat about it with Liz and Jane  when we get a chance , see what they think and  

D:  Because I  I need to ask Jane whether it 's  it would be OK for her  um , s some of her people to transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection , which is these short like five or seven minute sessions . 
D:  But to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started . 
D:  And so um I wanted to ask Jane if  if uh , you know , maybe one of their transcribers could  could do  
D:  I mean since these are very short , that should really be uh , 

F:  I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it . 

A:  So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but I don't really think there 's much to talk about . 
A:  I 'm gonna send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to  suggest edits .

A:  Yeah , it 's  it 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , uh , uh , it takes too long to do random access decompression . 
F:  Yeah , I was just wondering because we 're uh running out of the un - backed - up disk space on 

B:  Uh , you know Dave Johnson is gone for , like , ten days , 
B:  I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , 
B:  So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave , 
B:  But at any rate I think that there 's a  there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need 

E:  I have um  I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer . 
B:  I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , 
B:  So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave , 
B:  But at any rate I think that there 's a  there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need

A:  but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings . 
A:  And , my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space , 
A:  but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data  all at once , in a lot of different ways . 
A:  You  we need about a gig per meeting . 
E:  I have um  I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer . 
B:  But at any rate I think that there 's a  there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need 

B:  Well , maybe it should get another rack . 
B:  Uh , you know Dave Johnson is gone for , like , ten days , 
E:  I have um  I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer . 
B:  I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , 
F:  Well I sent that message out to , I guess , you and Dave asking for  if we could get some disk . 
A:  The sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine . 
A:  So they don't want to stack up external drives . 
B:  So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave , 
F:  I think part of the reason why Dave can't get the  the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now . 
B:  But at any rate I think that there 's a  there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need 

A:  Uh  The back - end is uh , going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I 'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer . 

D:  But  But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the  you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is  that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform .
