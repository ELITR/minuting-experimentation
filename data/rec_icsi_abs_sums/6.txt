None

B:  one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what 

B:  the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes 
B:  uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from the uh user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse . 
D:  These are all like saying EV or A , 

B:  one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what 

E:  if it 's fixing things selling things , or servicing things 
B:  so the idea would be that you might wanna merge those three 
B:  you could have a node that 's  that was a measure of the match between the object 's feature , you know , the match between the object the entity , I 'm sorry and the user . 

E:  So here is the  the  we had that the user 's budget may influence the outcome of decisions . 
B:  Well the fir see the first thing is , getting back to thing we left out of the other is the actual discourse . 

B:  and we don't know what they are yet . 

B:  because uh we 're gonna want to know you know , which constructions indicate various of these properties 

D:  So um recall the basic problem which is that um you have a belief - net and you have like a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node . 
D:  So the problem is to specify the uh so the conditional property of this given all those , 

D:  and we just take the uh we essentially take um averages , 
D:  This is a hidden variable . 
C:  W I was just , if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w a weighting s system though too , 

C:  OK , so they  they could either be hand coded or learned or 

None

D:  Yeah , I  I mean , it might soon , if this is gonna be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for our purposes . 

None

A:  so , I mean I know we 're going for sort of a rough and ready . 

None

E:  we have the user interest is a  is a vector of five hundred values , 
B:  that you 'd have to do see in order to do reference and stuff like that um you 've gotta have both the current discourse and the context to say I wanna go back there , 

B:  and we don't know what they are yet . 

D:  but then the question is do you  do we wanna propagate beliefs every single time it 's updated or only when we need to ? 

None

C:  OK , so they  they could either be hand coded or learned or 
C:  Based on training data , 
D:  like , are we able to get these nodes from the data ? 

D:  Yeah , I  I mean , it might soon , if this is gonna be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for our purposes .
