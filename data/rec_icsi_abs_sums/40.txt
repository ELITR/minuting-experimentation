C:  So what are you doing ? 
B:  Uh , well , we 've  a little bit worked on trying to see , uh , what were the bugs and the problem with the latencies . 

None

C:  You  you had a discussion with Sunil about this though ? 
B:  No . 
C:  Yeah , you should talk with him . 
C:  uh , cuz they could be doing the same thing and  or something . 
C:  We just  we just have to be in contact more . 
C:  I think that  the  the fact that we  we did that with  had that thing with the latencies was indicative of the fact that there wasn't enough communication . 
B:  But , well , when we add up everything it 's  it will be alright . 
B:  So it would be around two hundred and forty  
A:  What 's the allowable ? 
C:  Two - fifty , 
C:  Uh , well the people who had very low latency want it to be low  uh , very  <laugh> very very narrow , uh , latency bound . 
C:  Unfortunately we 're the main ones with long latency , 
A:  A person  I don't think a person can tell the difference between , uh , you know , a quarter of a second and a hundred milliseconds , 
A:  I 'm not even sure if we can tell the difference between a quarter of a second and half a second . 
A:  I mean it just  it feels so quick . 
C:  uh , one thing that would be no  good to find out about from this conference call is that what they were talking about , what they 're proposing doing , was having a third party , um , run a good VAD , and  and determine boundaries . 
C:  And then given those boundaries , then have everybody do the recognition . 
C:  uh , I guess they argued about that yesterday 

C:  Uh , maybe we can talk about a couple other things briefly , 
C:  So you 're coming up with your quals proposal , 
E:  Um , but I 'm , uh , looking into extending the work done by Larry Saul and John Allen and uh Mazin Rahim . 
C:  so , uh , y you want to talk maybe a c two or three minutes about what we 've been talking about today and other days ? 
F:  we 're interested in , um , methods for far mike speech recognition , 
F:  um ,  mainly , uh , methods that deal with the reverberation  in the far mike signal . 

B:  Do you have news from the conference talk ? 
D:  Yesterday morning on video conference . 
C:  No , nobody 's told me anything . 
C:  No , that would have been a good thing to find out before this meeting , 
C:  I mean , let 's  let 's assume for right now that we 're just kind of plugging on ahead , 
C:  because even if they tell us that , uh , the rules are different , uh , we 're still interested in doing what we 're doing . 
C:  uh , one thing that would be no  good to find out about from this conference call is that what they were talking about , what they 're proposing doing , was having a third party , um , run a good VAD , and  and determine boundaries . 
C:  And then given those boundaries , then have everybody do the recognition . 
C:  uh , I guess they argued about that yesterday 
C:  I don't  don't know the answer 
C:  but we should find out . 

C:  I mean , let 's  let 's assume for right now that we 're just kind of plugging on ahead , 
C:  because even if they tell us that , uh , the rules are different , uh , we 're still interested in doing what we 're doing . 

C:  You  you had a discussion with Sunil about this though ? 
B:  No . 
C:  Yeah , you should talk with him . 
C:  No , I mean , because the  the  the  the whole problem that happened before was coordination , 
C:  So  so you need to discuss with him what we 're doing , 
C:  uh , cuz they could be doing the same thing and  or something . 
C:  We just  we just have to be in contact more . 
C:  I think that  the  the fact that we  we did that with  had that thing with the latencies was indicative of the fact that there wasn't enough communication .

C:  because even if they tell us that , uh , the rules are different , uh , we 're still interested in doing what we 're doing . 

B:  So it would be around two hundred and forty  
C:  Just  just barely in there . 
A:  What 's the allowable ? 
C:  Two - fifty , 
C:  unless they changed the rules . 
C:  Which there is  there 's some discussion of . 
A:  What were they thinking of changing it to ? 
C:  Uh , well the people who had very low latency want it to be low  uh , very  <laugh> very very narrow , uh , latency bound . 
C:  And the people who have longer latency don't . 
C:  Unfortunately we 're the main ones with long latency , 
B:  and basically the best proposal had something like thirty or forty milliseconds of latency . 

D:  Also we were thinking to  to , uh , apply the eh , spectral subtraction from Ericsson 
D:  and to  to change the contextual KLT for LDA . 
C:  Well , there 's a lot of different ways of computing the noise spectrum . 
A:  it seems like this kind of thing could add to the latency . 
A:  I mean , depending on where the window was that you used to calculate  the signal - to - noise ratio . 
C:  Not necessarily . 
C:  Cuz if you don't look into the future , 
B:  Actually , it 's a mmm  If - if you want to have a good estimation on non - stationary noise you have to look in the  in the future . 
C:  but what does  what  what  what does Alcatel do ? 
C:  And  and France Telecom . 
B:  They just look in the past . 
B:  I guess it works because the noise are , uh pret uh , almost stationary 
C:  Yeah , y I mean , you 're talking about non - stationary noise 
C:  but I think that spectral subtraction is rarely  is  is not gonna work really well for  for non - stationary noise , 
C:  But it 's hard to  
B:  that 's hard to do .
