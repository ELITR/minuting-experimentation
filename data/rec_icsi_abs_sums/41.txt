A:  Let 's  let 's , I mean , I think that as  as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that uh there  there will be <inbreath> uh in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly uh uh do something about noise 
A:  So um I suggest actually now we  we  we sorta move on and  and hear what 's  what 's  what 's happening in  in other areas 
A:  Um . <inbreath> And uh I don't know if we 've talked lately about the  the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning 
A:  Uh what 's next ? 

A:  So y you guys had a  a meeting with uh  with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss . 
A:  So everybody knows what happened except me . 
C:  Well . Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week . 
C:  About the um , well  the downsampling problem . 
C:  Uh and about the f the length of the filters 
C:  So basically that was  that 's <inbreath> all we discussed about . 

A:  Let 's  let 's , I mean , I think that as  as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that uh there  there will be <inbreath> uh in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly uh uh do something about noise 
A:  So um I suggest actually now we  we  we sorta move on and  and hear what 's  what 's  what 's happening in  in other areas 
A:  like <inbreath> what 's  what 's happening with your <inbreath> investigations <inbreath> about echos and so on . 
F:  Well um I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today 
F:  um and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for um <mouth> <inbreath> running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits . 
F:  I haven't asked Hynek for  for the  for his code yet . 
F:  Cuz I looked at uh Avendano 's thesis and <mouth> I don't really understand what he 's doing yet 
A:  Um . <inbreath> And uh I don't know if we 've talked lately about the  the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning 
E:  Um .  So continuing to um extend 
A:  So I mean , there 's these issues of what are the  what are the variables that you use 
A:  and do you combine them using the soft " AND - OR " or you do something , you know , more complicated 
A:  Uh what 's next ? 
B:  I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with . 

A:  I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is  is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides 
A:  uh I was talking with Hynek about it later 
A:  and the  the  sort of had the sense sort of that  that neither group of people wanted to  to bother the other group too much . 
A:  but I think that <inbreath> you were sort of waiting for them to <inbreath> tell you that they had something for you 
A:  and <inbreath> they were sort of waiting for you 
A:  and  and  and uh we ended up with this thing where they  they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , 
C:  But there was also problem  perhaps a problem of communication . 
C:  Now we will try to  
A:  Just talk more .

A:  So the only  the only uh hesitation I had about it since , I mean I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's  it 's <inbreath> continuous variables and a bunch of them . 
A:  I don't know how complicated it is to go from there  
A:  What you really want are these binary  labels , and just a few of them . 
A:  And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it 
A:  and it 's e but it  
A:  I  I  I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , 
A:  whereas um <inbreath> if you did something instead that  like um having some manual annotation by <inbreath> uh you know , linguistics students , 
A:  this would  there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with  with John before 
A:  Course then , that 's the other question is do you want binary variables .
