F:  Well , um , I can  give you an update on the  transcription effort . 
F:  because at present , <spike on /p/> <inbreath> um , because <spike on /b/> of the limitations of <inbreath> th the interface we 're using , 
F:  overlaps are , uh , not being <spike on /b/> encoded by <spike on /b/> the transcribers in as complete <spike on /p/> and , uh , detailed a way as it might be , 
A:  What our decision was is that  we 'll go ahead with what we have with a not very fine time scale on the overlaps . 

F:  The  we have great  great , uh , p steps forward in terms of the nonspeech - speech pre - segmenting of the signal . 
C:  Um , so , uh , what we basically did so far was using the mixed file to  to detect s speech or nonspeech  portions in that . 
F:  But <spike on "but"> it  it saves so much time  the  the <spike> transcribers 

F:  Uh , maybe <mike spike> raise the issue of microphone , uh , um procedures 
G:  Well , let 's  why don't we talk about microphone issues ? 
G:  But I  I think that it  it doesn't hurt , uh , the naturalness of the situation to try to have people  wear the microphones properly , if possible , 
B:  So , anything to reduce breathing is  is  is a good thing . 
A:  So you want it enough to the side so that when you exhale through your nose , it doesn't  the wind doesn't hit the mike . 

G:  But , I mean , the other things that we talked about is , uh , <inbreath> pitch - related things and harmonicity - related things , 
G:  You know , have a  have a couple Markov models 
G:  which is to say , don't worry so much about the , uh , features . 
G:  and , uh , try to indi try to determine , you know , w when is th when are you in an overlap , when are you not in an overlap . 
G:  And let the , uh , uh , statistical system  determine what 's the right way to look at the data . 
D:  And I hope the  the next week I will have , eh , some results and we  we will show  we will see , eh , the  the parameter  the pitch , <inbreath> eh , tracking in  with the program . 
G:  uh , the  has  has , uh , been exploring , uh , e largely the energy issue 
G:  So far , um , uh , Jose has  has been  
G:  but it may be  given that you have a limited time here , it  it just may not be the best thing to  <inbreath> to  to focus on for the remaining of it . 
G:  Th - they were suggesting going to Markov models , 

A:  What our decision was is that  we 'll go ahead with what we have with a not very fine time scale on the overlaps . 
F:  then <spike on /th/> when they 're encoding the overlaps <spike on /p/> it would be nice for them to be able to specify when  you know , the start points and end points of overlaps . 
A:  And I hope that if we do a forced alignment with the close - talking mike , that will be enough to recover at least some of the time the time information of when the overlap occurred . 

A:  Oh , we should definitely get with them then , 
A:  agree upon a format . 

A:  I think it would also be interesting to have , uh , a couple of the meetings have more than one transcriber do , 
A:  cuz I 'm curious about inter - annotator agreement . 

G:  But I  I think that it  it doesn't hurt , uh , the naturalness of the situation to try to have people  wear the microphones properly , if possible , 
B:  So , anything to reduce breathing is  is  is a good thing . 
A:  So you want it enough to the side so that when you exhale through your nose , it doesn't  the wind doesn't hit the mike . 

G:  But , I mean , the other things that we talked about is , uh , <inbreath> pitch - related things and harmonicity - related things , 
D:  And I hope the  the next week I will have , eh , some results and we  we will show  we will see , eh , the  the parameter  the pitch , <inbreath> eh , tracking in  with the program . 
D:  But , eh , what did you think about the possibility of using the Javier software ? 
A:  Right . So if we  if we fed the hand - segmentation to Javier 's and it doesn't work , then we know something 's wrong . 
A:  Yeah . I think that 's probably worthwhile doing . 

F:  Cuz there is one thing that we don't have right now and that is the automatic , um , channel identifier . 
F:  That  that , you know , that would g help in terms of encoding of overlaps . 

B:  Well , the thing that you  is hard to deal with is whe <inbreath> when they speak while laughing . 

G:  But the bottom line is it 's still not , uh , separating out very well . 
G:  So far , um , uh , Jose has  has been  
G:  and  and so far at least has not come up with <inbreath> any combination that really gave you an indicator .
