D:  and the other bit of news is we had  you know , uh , I was visited by my German project manager 
D:  and he came up  we came up  with a pretty strange idea . 
D:  It should be possible to make that system produce questions . 

D:  But maybe one could do some learning . 

B:  The basic idea I guess would be to give  allow the system to have intentions , basically ? 
D:  Well you can observe some user and context stuff and ask , what 's the posterior probabilities of all of our decision nodes . 

B:  I mean we just  I mean it wouldn't hurt to write up a paper , 
D:  Well , I  I also think that if we sort of write about what we have done in the past six months , we  we  we could sort of craft a nice little paper that  if it gets rejected , which could happen , doesn't hurt 
D:  And then we can say , uh well what we do is this . 

D:  So this will be sort of documenting what we think , and documenting what we have in terms of the Bayes - net stuff . 
D:  Well , in the moment it 's a Bayes - net . 
D:  And it has sort of fifty not - yet - specified interfaces . 

D:  The SUDO - square <writing on whiteboard> is , <three-syllable laugh> " Situation " , " User " , " Discourse " , right ? " Ontology " . 

D:  and Johno coming up with the idea that if the person discussed the  discussed the admission fee , in  eh previously , that might be a good indication that , " how do I get to the castle ? " , actually he wants to enter . 

D:  and specify um , what  what we think the  the output uh , observe , out  i input nodes for our Bayes - nets for the sub sub - D , for the discourse bit , should be . 
D:  So we want to sort of come up with what gets uh , input , and how inter in case of a " where is " question . 
D:  so that we actually end up with um , um , nodes for the discourse and ontology 
D:  so that we can put them into our Bayes - net , 

D:  and we can run our better JavaBayes , and have it produce some output . 

None

None

D:  Look at the web page and let 's talk about it maybe tomorrow afternoon ? 

D:  So this will be sort of documenting what we think , and documenting what we have in terms of the Bayes - net stuff . 

D:  and specify um , what  what we think the  the output uh , observe , out  i input nodes for our Bayes - nets for the sub sub - D , for the discourse bit , should be . 
D:  So we want to sort of come up with what gets uh , input , and how inter in case of a " where is " question . 
D:  so that we actually end up with um , um , nodes for the discourse and ontology 

A:  Wait , so do , or do not take other kinds of constructions into account ? 
D:  Well , if you  if you can , oh definitely do , 

E:  e I 'm sort of  have the impression that getting it to say the right thing in the right circumstances is much more difficult than getting it to understand something given the circumstances and so on , 
D:  it 's not the same as the understanding . 

E:  just the fact that we 'll get  The point is that getting it to understand one construction doesn't mean that it will n always know exactly when it 's correct to use that construction . Right ? 

D:  But maybe one could do some learning . 
E:  Yeah , it 's g Anyway , the point is that given all of these different factors , it 's uh e it 's  it 's still going to be impossible to run through all of the possible situations or whatever . 

D:  I mean , it 's obvious that we can't do any kind of evaluation , 

A:  Like introducing the formalism might be not really possible in detail , 

None

None

D:  but normal statements that seem completely unambiguous , such as " where is the blah - blah " , actually are terribly complex , and completely ambiguous .
