C:  Oh , I wonder  I wonder if we ran out of disk space yet . 
C:  OK , so that 's 
C:  Wait . 
C:  You 're going to sit there ? 
C:  Yeah , OK , 
C:  maybe I 'll put this thing here then . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , that 's   that 's the dummy  dummy PDA . 
C:  Yeah , it is . 
C:  Oh , hang on . 
C:  Yeah , it is at the moment . 
C:  Yep . 
C:  Hang on , let 's  let 's  OK let 's just  let 's just name the microphones . 
C:  So I 'm speaking on the  ear mounted  uh wired headset thing . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  You 're on one . 
C:  Absolutely . 
C:  Yes . 
C:  OK so this is  this is the PZM nearest the eh eh the machine room end of the table . 
C:  Then  there 's  
C:  I know , but yeah . 
C:  It 's number three , it says , but  we 'll be able to figure it out . 
C:  This is at the middle of the table 
C:  This further down the table . 
C:  And this  this one is right at the end of the table , 
C:  OK ? 
C:  And then we 've got the uh  
C:  This is the left side of the dummy PDA and this would be the right side . 
C:  Very exciting . 
C:  No . 
C:  Just write it down . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Well , how about  you give me one of those 
C:  and we can fill it out 
C:  and Morgan can read 
C:  and then we can do it like that . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
C:  This is  these are things we will find out . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Can I have something to write on the back of ? 
C:  Thanks . 
C:  Oh ! 
C:  It didn't  doesn't take  Well , I mean as you see we haven't really set it up that well , but it doesn't  it doesn't take long to set up . 
C:  I mean , We just came up here  one night after recording so it took like twenty minutes something like that . 
C:  I mean it 's  
C:  Yeah ,  I mean the equipment  
C:  Right . 
C:  The equip Me and Adam went through it yesterday , just looked at everything . 
C:  But it 's all kind of here and set up , so it 's just a question of turning it all on . 
C:  And , um  running the program . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Um , it 's  it 's gonna b it 's  for reasons  because of the microphones runs we want that chunk there . 
C:  There 's more equipment in there . 
C:  But there 's   the idea is that there are  these microphones on the table , 
C:  there are some cables coming down  sort of under a nice  mat , 
C:  and then that 's   they  a bunch of them get sort of converged with digital there . 
C:  And the idea is that this gets replaced by a cabinet with doors , so that   so that it 's not  open to fiddling . 
C:  That 's 
C:  We need to do that . 
C:  It 's on a list of things to do . 
C:  I keep on hoping that  they 're gonna get done but they don't . 
C:  I  
C:  Yeah ! 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Um . I don't know . 
C:  A cabinet is probably going to cost  a hundred dollars , two hundred dollars something like that . 
C:  I mean . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  But ,  well we should get to a  a nice kind of working state of our set up  as quickly as possible . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I mean  there 's one big issue with the equipment still , which is um ultimately we 're gonna  well the idea is to have any number of these wired headsets , 
C:  but there 's this amplification problem . 
C:  I built this thing , it 's  that 's  it 's very noisy . 
C:  We 're actually recording  I 'm  I 'm going through it at the moment ,  but it 's so noisy that I am not using for this . 
C:  it 's  it 's designed to be used for the  for the desktop meeting as well . 
C:  But I 'm using  running that through my uh  damp machine as a pre - amp as an alternative . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  It 's just  it eh 
C:  You see how clumsy this is 
C:  right ? 
C:  I have to use these batteries to bias them . 
C:  And I 'm only get two channels and there 're a bunch of   There are like three connectors in the circuit . 
C:  The thing is , like , it 's  it 's not s it 's not that the thing doesn't exist  commercially , but there isn't one unit which does the whole thing in one  in one  swoop . 
C:  So it seemed like it was a good idea to make one . 
C:  um And I 'm still not sure . 
C:  I mean , I think  I probably know how to fix this . 
C:  I can probably build it better so it doesn't have such noise , but it 's kind of a buy . 
C:  Well , we could just  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well n 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Jim is busy at the moment . 
C:  That 's the problem . 
C:  I was kind of hoping that Jim was going to build this box . 
C:  But um  but he hasn't had time . 
C:  Well , I think  I think he is quite interested in doing it . 
C:  But . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh ! 
C:  Oh . 
C:  OK . 
C:  This happened . 
C:  I think   uh , I mean , uh my guess is that means it 's just that if it 's  if it 's near field ,  the mathematics of beam   beam steering is different . 
C:  If the f if the wavefronts are not approximately planar  then you can't just do delay and sum and expect it to work . 
C:  I guess . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  Right , right , right . 
C:  I mean the  um The  the weird thing is that actually  delay in some beam - forming is not  is not the clever thing to do . 
C:  The  the  the underwater guys do this stuff which is  different . 
C:  And it actually means that you should get the microphones as close together as possible . 
C:  Rather than trying to get them far apart so you can get  separation , you sort of   you want them very close . 
C:  And  And  the math is too difficult for me to understand but it 's  but it 's there . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well we could  I mean . 
C:  By the time   We 'll have  we 'll have data so we can actually  you know , demonstrate that . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  But I mean . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yep , yep . 
C:  For those those we can make several  several more of these  and then we can have actual  recording with you know three  P D 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right , right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  And that  that seems very uh  easy to believe scenario , I mean , given the number of palm pilots we 've got on the table right now , so . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , but  But that  it 's 
C:  We 're not , even , you know   It 's  we 're just  It 's not like we  We  we may be technical , but we 're not particularly PDA people . 
C:  So it 's  That 's just how it is . 
C:  Well , I know . 
C:  Well , that 's true . 
C:  I mean . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Well we 've got  we 've got  Right now we could have two more people on wireless , 
C:  with a trip to Leo 's Audio we could get a third extra person on wireless , 
C:  and uh  right now we could have three more   three more people wearing mikes like this , and that would just work . 
C:  I mean I 'm not sure how   how good the quality is on this mike but I think it 's going to be OK . 
C:  So we could actually have  eight people with  with headset mikes  with , I mean , basically no extra effort . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Nine . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  We have the um  the ones we 've been using , the ones we got for the PC . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  I think we have three of those . 
C:  So , and the h 
C:  Right , right . 
C:  They don't all work , but the nice ones , the um Plan - Plantronic ones work . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Per channel , or  ? 
C:  We figured out that it was t twelve gig twelve gigabytes an hour ? 
C:  For  for all the channels ? 
C:  Was that with or without the  
C:  Cuz no , we 've only  no , I mean we 've only got four gigabytes and that 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  And then we  then we cut it in half . 
C:  But  By s  saving sixteen bits on instead of thirty  instead of thirty - two . 
C:  Well no I mean it 's uh four gigabytes for forty minutes . 
C:  Forty - eight kilohertz ,  yeah . 
C:  So we can actually triple that . 
C:  So , hang on  
C:  so that would  OK 
C:  Well I think it 's  I think it 's two gig an hour . 
C:  Cuz like , we don't   Maybe we don't  We don't need to save all channels , 
C:  right ? 
C:  So , on average . We could  we don't  we  we wouldn't use all the channels , necessarily . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I 'm sure . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  It 's a pain . 
C:  I mean , you know , because  cuz we 've got data on " user " , 
C:  right ? 
C:  And then we 'd have to back it all up and  copy it back on again . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  No . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  We don't need all  we don't necessarily need it all on - line . 
C:  I mean it will be different subsets . 
C:  So you won't  you won't , you know , do all  sixteen channels in a single  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  You typically train  I mean you 'd have fi you 'd have fifty hours 
C:  we 'd only use  one of the PZM channels , 
C:  something like this , 
C:  and so that would you wouldn't have to use all sixteen channels  at once . 
C:  But it 's kind of  painful for  because basically , if we put them on C Ds then each CD will have  all the channels for one  recording , 
C:  and then when you want to build the P - files , you just want to get one of those files off each of  the sessions 
C:  and  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well , maybe two of them , but I mean we wouldn't use  we 'd only use the distant mikes , 
C:  right ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right if  if we  if we burn it all on CD - ROM , then , um , 
C:  in fact , we could you know  we could throw away the Broadcast News stuff and put it on there or something like that . 
C:  Somebody used it recently . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  It 's uh twenty C Ds , 
C:  so that 's twelve gigabytes . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Probably , we could  we could probably just run Shorten on them or something and it will get a big win . 
C:  I think that 's a good  
C:  Shorten . 
C:  Tony Robinson 's  uh lossless compression thing . 
C:  Um , it   it does  AR  modeling 
C:  and so it looks at a section ,  it runs an AR model to sort of r w to whiten it  and then quantizes  the residual  with a nice  with the three bits it can get away with . 
C:  Something like that . 
C:  So I think it  On  on each block it 'll   it 'll compress you know if there 's load on in any range it 'll use ratio bits . 
C:  I think it does that . 
C:  Yeah , well . 
C:  Well , it 's OK , 
C:  it 's only the first try . 
C:  I  what I 'm thinking is um  obviously we can do the  we can  we can choose any sixteen bits from the twenty four , so we can just have different gain things that we use  you know per channel . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I think   probably the bottom four bits are not any good , 
C:  Right ? 
C:  Although you know it claims they are . 
C:  But probably the  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh , yeah ! 
C:  Oh yeah ! 
C:  These theories things are pretty amazing . 
C:  And And there 's help  help they seem  they seem good though they seem to be 
C:  Oh , God knows . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  That  that card  that machine 's got sound  They 've got a sound blaster built into it . 
C:  I just  I just disabled it cuz I wanted to find out  how well the  sound infrastructure would deal with both at once 
C:  but I think yeah , that 's , uh   probably it will be fine . 
C:  There 's no , 
C:  For a couple of reasons . 
C:  Well , but the @ @   There are two ways we could listen to it . 
C:  There 's a sound  there 's actually sound output built into this thing . 
C:  But the driver  I haven't  the driver may not support it yet . 
C:  And then there 's also the sound or the sound card built in . 
C:  But I don't know how to  I don't know how the  operating system would like having two sound cards . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Sure . 
C:  Well no , OK , the question I still have about what we 're going to do is what is  what  eh  OK , so we can get the equipment set up so that basically we 're in a situation where we can   with , you know , ten minutes of preparation , we can bring  nine people in here and do a multi channel recording . 
C:  Um . 
C:  What are  wh When are we  Are we going to do that ? 
C:  Who are they going to be ? 
C:  What meetings are we going to record ? 
C:  So which  which meetings  What meetings do we have ? 
C:  I mean like " us " being the Meeting Recorder people or " us " being anything that speech  local does . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  And we should have like  we should have Decoder meetings and stuff . 
C:  Yeah , I mean that 's the thing . 
C:  It 's OK to g 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Well , we 've got to make it really really easy to start it going then in that case . 
C:  Cuz that  that 's the real  goal . 
C:  Right . 
C:  But I mean if we  if we want  Jerry 's group to  use it then we probably @ @ won't ask them to read any numbers , 
C:  right ? 
C:  Cuz . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  That 's great . 
C:  I know . 
C:  I know , it 's a disaster . 
C:  It 's alright 
C:  she doesn't mind as long as we don't video her , 
C:  right ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  We could  we could have the reading group in here . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I mean . 
C:  Yeah , it 's great . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Mm - hmm 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Well , Except that you wouldn't transcribe them all individually , 
C:  right ? 
C:  You would send  I mean ,  uh a transcriber is used  I mean , I don't know , assume  presumably a transcriber  transcribes a single meeting , 
C:  right ? 
C:  And so they  they just have to  indicate that the  speaker changes . 
C:  Right ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  So  so they  they 're gonna  they 're gonna have to make speaker assignments  or something like this . 
C:  For one of  one of @ @ . 
C:  Or we could mix  we could mix the  the headset mikes , you know , just to make a single high q high quality  
C:  and we could do  and we could do all kinds of weird things like having you know squelch so that  you only , you know  you only  you cut it out when there 's no energy . 
C:  So you don't @ @ noise . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I mean there 's  it 's  If we  if we do something which is have a little bit of human input to get the words then we can  leverage that a lot by some clever cross thing to figure out which channel they really belong to and stuff like this , probably . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  And  Yeah . 
C:  As much work as you want . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Wow . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I have  just because it 's such an un 
C:  The transcribing is sort of something I can imagine doing , whereas having this distraction of having sort of something that looks like it might be right but has got some  very wrong bits in is sort of a less  less easy thing to do . 
C:  I 'm sure the professional transcribers obviously don't have any use for  
C:  Yeah Yeah , that 's true , 
C:  that 's true . 
C:  Yeah , by fixing up  transcripts . 
C:  Yeah , but  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  They should all be in India right now . 
C:  That 's where the good , but the cheap English speakers are . 
C:  I 'm sorry , yeah . 
C:  Well they don't speak  such clear English 
C:  Yep . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Wow . 
C:  What fun  it is . 
C:  It 's interesting that um it m it 's not clear whether it 's better to have them written as  as words or  or  figures . 
C:  But , of course , to get zero and " O "s distinguished we  you have to do it . 
C:  But  it 's kind of weird to read . 
C:  Thanks . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Oh , I wonder  I wonder if we ran out of disk space yet .
