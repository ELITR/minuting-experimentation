A:  And how  how much disk do we have ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  We 're somewhere in between . 
A:  OK , so we have some sheets for uh  some standard doohickies to  
A:  OK , so this is February second , eh , two thousand , 
A:  this is eh meeting number one  with Adam and Dan and Morgan , about five o ' clock uh in the afternoon . 
A:  A range of microphones . 
A:  What 's this one here ? 
A:  This  this one is  has a couple of cheezy electrettes and  
A:  That 's connected too , or  ? 
A:  That 's connected . 
A:  It 's got two  to both channels . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  This is  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Um , I have no idea which one I 'm  I 'm on . 
A:  Oh one ! 
A:  Oh , I 'm number one . 
A:  OK , <laugh> which is a  a l a lapel , 
A:  in fact it 's sticking through my  lapel . 
A:  I think listening to this is gonna be like watching somebody 's home movies . 
A:  Yeah , OK . 
A:  OK , what do we do with the stuff on top ? 
A:  But I  
A:  Do we say it after we  
A:  What are we  why are we writing it down ? 
A:  Oh . 
A:  OK That 's good . 
A:  So I don't need to fill that out right now . 
A:  So maybe we should just say it . 
A:  So then we 're not spending the time writing it out . 
A:  So that we 're spending the time talking . 
A:  I 'm just uh concerned about a bunch of dead time while we all sit here and fill out the things . 
A:  Right ? 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Right . 
A:  OK , so this is Morgan . 
A:  I 'm going to read some numbers now . 
A:  That 's my group . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I don't know if I said mine was transcript zero , 
A:  but it was . 
A:  Oh , good . 
A:  OK . 
A:  That 's a little bit . 
A:  So , so where are we in this ? 
A:  Let 's see , so we now  we now have a few mikes that work . 
A:  How long did it take you to set this up ? 
A:  Are we gonna  I mean , is it gonna be over there , or is it gonna be in there ? 
A:  So that 's what 's gonna happen . 
A:  Oh  I mean , I don't know . 
A:  Did we s did we spend our  the budget already that we had ? 
A:  Uh , how much  are we talking about here ? 
A:  Yeah , I mean , you know , we  we can spend under a thousand dollars or something without  without worrying about it . 
A:  I mean , I think  um  I 'm more worried about things being kept in a funky state long enough that  that uh stuff gets broken or  or you know . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , and there 's also the minor matter , it 'd be kind of nice to able to  bring people in and say " yes , this is where we do such - and - such " , and then be able to see uh , you know ,  some kind of  I mean it 's less important than doing what we 're doing right now 
A:  but  
A:  So . 
A:  Well , we should be able to just go buy some preamps ,  I would think . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Are we ? 
A:  Well . 
A:  I guess I 'd sort of figured that  that Jim would do that at some point . 
A:  Right ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Well If it 's too noisy and if there 's something we can buy , again for , you know , moderate amount of price , even if it takes a couple boxes or something , maybe we should just do it . 
A:  And then  and then later we can  uh replace it with  
A:  Because there may be other considerations  that will go into the design . 
A:  I mean , uh our getting some experience with this may help to determine  some of things that are  I don't know  might change this design , So . 
A:  There was uh a statement made uh which I don't think is right , by the way , but   there was a statement made at the uh DARPA Communicator meeting I was at recently that um  <swallows> microphone  multiple microphones  at a distance of less than  three feet or something like that were totally useless , 
A:  completely irrelevant . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  for nois noise cancelling . 
A:  Um , my counter argument is  is an  uh uh um , a white rat . 
A:  uh , which  has th it 's two microphones exceedingly close together and it works pretty well . 
A:  Um but  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  But I think that if  my point is I guess if you  if you have a um  a uh s a volume in between  the two  the two uh uh sensors and you do something cleverer , there clearly are ways  to get more out of it . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , there are various points in meeting where people were making uh uh very strong statements as a matter of fact , like one shouldn't even question it 
A:  and  this was one of them that  was kind of  funny . 
A:  Um but I  I  I  what I take it to mean is doing  doing the dumb thing uh with two microphones would be very difficult to get too much out of it 
A:  but I think it will be interesting to do other things that aren't dumb . 
A:  So I  I still think it 's potentially   interesting to do that . 
A:  Although we we 'll have to be uh a aware of this if we 're writing proposals about it , wherever , that there may well be reviewers who will say , " well everyone knows that  you can't get anything out of it if it 's  <laugh> if it 's close " . 
A:  Uh , that is an interesting point . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Certainly you can get some  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Hopefully . 
A:  Well , we 're getting some  we we 're getting some right now . 
A:  Well someone someone might be interested in  in it . 
A:  Maybe . 
A:  But on the other hand ,  suppose that uh , you 're the only one uh who is advanced enough in this thinking to actually bring such a PDA to  to a meeting 
A:  and  and  <laugh> and therefore you bring it in , 
A:  and you probably want it to be as near to people as possible so you might in fact shove it to the middle of the table . 
A:  Well . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , I think we should . 
A:  I mean , I think at least with two . 
A:  Right ? 
A:  Because uh one of the th one of the fantasies that was at least fun to talk about was that uh 
A:  uh OK maybe you th  you 're   the range of things you can do with multiple microphones is limited if they 're a few inches apart , 
A:  but what if you have two of these things ? 
A:  And you know we have this  this idea of the handshake  back and forth and say " I 'm here , I 'm here " 
A:  " We 're now an array . " 
A:  Yeah 
A:  So uh  so where are we  uh now ? 
A:  I mean so we 've just  uh We 're doing this recording so we show  we can  we 're capable of doing recording 
A:  uh there 's  I guess a little more wiring to do or something to have  to have more  if we had more people participating in the meeting we 'd wouldn't quite be ready for that . 
A:  Uh . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  So a little bit of futzing , there 's the issue about a cabinet , we might want to change some pre - amps . 
A:  So we can do some more recordings but there 's  there 's a little  little bit of ramp up  on that over the next month ,  say . 
A:  Yeah we were talking about that a little bit over coffee today , that  that um uh if you downsample it sounded like it came  it sounded like it was something like a gig gigabyte an hour if you didn't downsample 
A:  and once you downsampled then it was something like four hundred megabytes an hour , if you used all  if you used all  
A:  no , if you used all the channels . 
A:  Something like that ? 
A:  I thought it was one gigabyte . 
A:  It couldn't be twelve . 
A:  How 'd you cut it ? 
A:  OK , so that 's  so that 's two gigabytes . 
A:  And then  
A:  Right . 
A:  But that 's at forty four kilohertz with sixteen channels . 
A:  So you can  
A:  right , so you can 
A:  Oh , we 'll do the higher math later , maybe but it 's  so it 's  so maybe like a gig or two a  an hour , 
A:  um but  um  
A:  OK , that is a bit more than I thought . 
A:  Yeah so this 'll take some thought cuz we have  we  um 
A:  If we are in fact gonna have forty or fifty hours at some point and we  we wanna ha have part of our work be on feature extraction , it means that we need to have waveforms available  somehow . 
A:  What would you do ? 
A:  I mean  
A:  So what would we do for training ? 
A:  So if we 're  if we 're training distant mi we 'd just use one of them ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Well , although we wanted to get alignments from the close mike  stuff . 
A:  Right . 
A:  But you don't want to be constantly take  putting that on disk and off disk and on disk . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  The thing is it 's really not very expensive right now . 
A:  So it 's more of an issue of  of structuring it with uh the uh Sys Admin folks so we don't panic them and figuring out where it goes . 
A:  Well , we don't  it doesn't need to be backed up . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I think the only one using it has been Javier , 
A:  but at this point I think it 's  he 's only been using it for features that he calculated quite a while ago , 
A:  so if nobody else is doing  feature calculation  
A:  Pardon ? 
A:  How much space is that using up ? 
A:  Do you have any idea ? 
A:  Yeah , couple hours ! 
A:  Well , anyway for this  this recording we 're fine 
A:  cuz we 're only  we 're only  
A:  how many mikes are we recording right now ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah , well that we can do something about . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  What 's it do ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah , so I think initially we should take up more space until we 've analyzed this and get a better sense of it 
A:  because  uh we don I mean we 're not talking about forty or fifty hours at this point 
A:  we 're talking about  a half hour of  of speech 
A:  and so  uh we should look at this carefully 
A:  but  
A:  Yeah , I was  interested when I saw the twenty - four on there . 
A:  Wow , I mean that 's probably eight bits of noise . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  It 's some sort of oversampling thing I imagine , 
A:  right ? 
A:  Didn't we already get that ? 
A:  Cuz you  you can't have  uh component tolerances that are  uh  sixteen million  one in sixteen million parts , 
A:  so . 
A:  I 'm s 
A:  Oh ! 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  But we can FTP stuff over , 
A:  right ? 
A:  So  it 's connected . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Um . 
A:  One suggestion I have is that um I think this   maybe we should just read some more  you made more of these , 
A:  right ? 
A:  I think we should read some more because  because this is very f 
A:  we   we need to  to work the  the  the uh  the talkers more 
A:  because we 're not gonna have that many meetings 
A:  and this is a pretty tiny amount of data . 
A:  So maybe we should do another  number list and  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well this is us . 
A:  We 'll have a fair amount of annoyance 
A:  yeah I think 
A:  uh . 
A:  So , can we do  we do another set ? 
A:  Are we  are we  are we  sort of  
A:  we talked out about what we 're  
A:  OK . 
A:  Right . 
A:  I think they would . 
A:  And also he 's  he 's  he 's got  at least one woman . 
A:  And we 're  we have a little problem of  no women , 
A:  Yeah , well , when L when Liz uh Shriberg starts coming , then there 's another woman although she  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Ah , that 's right . 
A:  That was it . 
A:  So . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  No , well , actually we could have Jane uh  Jane 's interested and curious about this stuff so she could attend one of  
A:  probably not the decoder meeting but some of the other stuff she  would be interested enough and have her read  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Um I think that one of the neat things about having this little pilot thing from today is we should try it a couple different ways , 
A:  so we should  try to do it internally , 
A:  maybe ask  ask Jane if we could get her to do it or  or  or have her  supervise a linguistics student or somebody 
A:  and uh see how long it takes , and you know , multiply out the cost , 
A:  and then send  send the same thing out , or maybe split it in halves or something  something like that to a  to an outside service 
A:  and uh see what that costs and how much hassle that is . 
A:  And then we can assess it . 
A:  No . 
A:  No . 
A:  Right . 
A:  This was  this was the point of having near zero skew . 
A:  Right ? 
A:  So you just pick one , with the best sounding one , and give it to somebody and they transcribe it . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah , you could do fancy things , but it seems like that 's enough . 
A:  Yeah But uh I don't know . 
A:  This meeting , so , say it 's maybe going to be a half hour or something , 
A:  and   and uh we 've heard estimates ranging between ten and twenty  times uh real time to do this kind of transcription 
A:  um  so you know in  in principle then it 'll take somebody a day for somebody to deal with this . 
A:  And uh we 'll see  which one of those seems closest to right 
A:  and if they   ramped up , if towards the end it was faster you know , get some sort of sense from them uh from whoever does it 
A:  and um then uh like I say , check it out with an external service and see  if it 's faster , cheaper , better , worse , whatever . 
A:  Then we 'll go from there . 
A:  I don't know . 
A:  I do I don't know the answer to that . 
A:  I don't know . 
A:  Well , I mean there 's this Cyber Transcriber service , 
A:  right ? 
A:  And at least supposedly the way they work is by feeding them what is the output of the recognizer . 
A:  So maybe it depends on what the software tools are like . 
A:  If it 's  you know , if they can easily flip through stuff and get to the right thing , 
A:  or do you point , 
A:  or I don't know . 
A:  There 's supposed to be some out  out  out - of - work shepherders or something in <laugh> Scotland but  
A:  Ah , the internet . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Inexpensive . 
A:  OK so we 're degenerating , 
A:  right . 
A:  Are  are  are we done with uh MR business , 
A:  or  ? 
A:  I mean what what 's  maybe we should  what are our action items ? 
A:  So there 's  there 's the continuing process of  cleaning up the stuff and making it easier to do that . 
A:  There 's taking  the results of this meeting  and putting it in some kind of decent form , 
A:  probably getting  some kind of single channel  merged sum data or something so that you can give a simple  sound file of some sort to a transcriber to deal with it rather than this massive thing . 
A:  That 's a little bit of  stuff to do . 
A:  Right ? 
A:  Yeah , although it  it  it  it may be separating out these numbers  from the rest . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  And then 
A:  Yeah  and uh 
A:  Right . 
A:  So , with this next  
A:  Sure . 
A:  OK . 
A:  How many more you got ? 
A:  Well , let 's do some more while we got them here . 
A:  Well , you know , it 's not , but 
A:  Yeah , there 's just two more . 
A:  uh 
A:  OK . 
A:  So . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  I 'd say we 're done . 
A:  So , is it  it 's going to disk , 
A:  or is this  
A:  And how  how much disk do we have ?
