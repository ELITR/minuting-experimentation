E:  OK . 
E:  Hello ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Hi ? 
E:  Hello ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  Um .  So continuing to um extend 
E:  Oh yeah . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  F right , 
E:  and uh he doesn't have to have hard labels . 
E:  Right . 
E:  For the full band . 
E:  Right . 
E:  From uh canonical mappings  um at first 
E:  and then it 's unclear um eh 
E:  using TIMIT 
E:  right , right . 
E:  And then uh he does some fine tuning um for um special cases . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I  I think uh Mike tried it 
E:  and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave . 
E:  Octave is the um UNIX clone of  of Matlab which you can batch . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  What 's that ? 
E:  Uh , Octave ? 
E:  Yeah it 's  it 's  it 's free . 
E:  I think we have it here  r running somewhere . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Um <mouth>  i it 's a little behind , 
E:  it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that  Matlab went to these like um 
E:  you can have cells and you can  you can  uh implement object - oriented type things with Matlab . 
E:  Uh Octave doesn't do that yet , 
E:  so I think you , 
E:  Octave is kinda like Matlab 
E:  um four point something or . 
E:  The basic stuff , right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK .
