F:  Oh , yeah . It was . 
F:  Channel five ? 
F:  Channel five . 
F:  I 'm on channel five . 
F:  Little low ? 
F:  Channel five . 
F:  Channel five . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Is it ? 
F:  Oh . 
F:  Maybe it should be a little higher . 
F:  It 's not showing much . 
F:  Test , test , test , test , test , test , test , test , test , test . 
F:  OK , that  that seems better ? 
F:  Yeah ? 
F:  OK , good . 
F:  Ah , that 's good , that 's good . 
F:  That 's 
F:  Ahh . Mmm . 
F:  So I  I had a question for Adam . 
F:  Have we started already ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Is Jane around 
F:  or  ? 
F:  Uh . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Yeah . Great idea . 
F:  I was gonna ask Adam to , uh , say if he thought anymore about the demo stuff 
F:  because <inbreath> it occurred to me that this is late May and the DARPA meeting is in  mid July . 
F:  Uh , but <breath> I don't remember w what we  
F:  I know that we were gonna do something with the transcriber interface is one thing , 
F:  but I thought there was a second thing . 
F:  Anybody remember ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Alright . So anyway , you have to sort out that out 
F:  and get somebody going on it 
F:  cuz we 're  got a  got a month left basically . 
F:  So . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Um 
F:  OK . So , what are we g else we got ? 
F:  You got  you just wrote a bunch of stuff . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  Oh , 
F:  oh . 
F:  That 's cool . 
F:  So , the choice is , uh , which  which do we want more , the  the  the comparison , uh , <inbreath> of everybody saying them at the same time or the comparison of people saying the same digits at different times that  ? 
F:  I know that . 
F:  But , you know , which opportunity should we 
F:  exploit ? <laugh> Unison . 
F:  I guess we 'll see 
F:  i I guess it 's dependent on 
F:  how long we go and how good the snack is out there . 
F:  Yeah . Hmm . Get some advance intelligence . 
F:  Yeah . We 'd have to train . 
F:  Yeah . We 'd have to get s get some experience . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Really  boring chorus . 
F:  Um . Do we  have an agenda ? 
F:  Adam usually tries to put those together , but he 's ill . 
F:  So . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Uh ju what  what might those be ? 
F:  Meeting info organized . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Um . 
F:  Is there stuff that 's happened about , um , uh , the  SRI recognizer et cetera , 
F:  tho those things that were happening before with  ? 
F:  Y y you guys were doing a bunch of experiments with different front - ends and then with  
F:  Is  is that still sort of where it was , uh , the other day ? 
F:  We 're improving . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  Just with  with age , kind of . 
F:  Yeah . Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  That 's pretty funny . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Ah ! 
F:  Yeah . Well , that 's always good to do . 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Uh  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Y think  you think we should increase the error rate . 
F:  Good . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Good . 
F:  So , uh , why don't we , uh , do the IBM stuff ? 
F:  You had some  thing about that ? 
F:  Right . 
F:  The , uh , Chuck chunks . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Uh , maybe we should have you record A , B , C for those or something . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  OK . Do w do  what  Do you have any idea of the turn - around on  on those steps you just said ? 
F:  Uh . 
F:  Including IBM 's . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Well , I meant the overall thing . 
F:  e e u u  The reason I 'm asking is because , uh , Jane and I have just been talking , and she 's just been doing . <laugh> Uh , e a , you know , further hiring of transcribers . 
F:  And so we don't sort of really know exactly what they 'll be doing , how long they 'll be doing it , and so forth , 
F:  because right now she has no choice but to operate in the mode that we already have working . 
F:  And , uh , 
F:  so it 'd be  It 'd be good to sort of get that resolved , uh , soon as we could , 
F:  and then  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah . Um  
F:  I mean in particular I would  I would really hope that when we do this DARPA meeting in July that we sort of have  we 're  we 're into production mode , somehow  
F:  You know , that we  we actually <breath> have a stream going and we know how  how well it does and how  and how it operates . 
F:  I think that would  that would certainly be a  a very good thing to know . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Uh . 
F:  Maybe before we do the meeting info organize thing , maybe you could say relevant stuff about where we are in transcriptions . 
F:  They die off after they do this for a while . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  No backs . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah . An - and the other thing is , I mean , in the unlikely event  
F:  and since we 're so far from this , it 's a little hard to plan this way  
F:  in the unlikely event that we actually find <inbreath> that we have , uh , transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs 
F:  because , you know , there 's , you know , <inbreath> all the stuff that  that was sitting there has been transcribed and they 're  and they 're faster  the  the pipeline is faster than  <inbreath> uh , than the generation , 
F:  um , 
F:  eh , i in  in the day  e event that that day actually dawns , uh , I  I bet we could find some other stuff for them to do . 
F:  So I  I think <inbreath> that , eh , eh , a as we were talking , if we  if we hire twelve , then we could , you know , run into a problem later . 
F:  I mean , we also just couldn't sustain that forever . 
F:  But  but , um  for all sorts of reasons  
F:  but if we hire f you know , f we have five on staff  five or six on staff at any given time , then <inbreath> it 's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way . 
F:  Good . 
F:  OK . 
F:  So , uh , u you were saying something about organizing the meeting info ? 
F:  Did you record it ? 
F:  Now would the ones that , um , are already transcribed  we h we have enough there that c 
F:  you know , we 've already done some studies and so forth 
F:  and  
F:  um , shouldn't we go through and do the business - es u of  of having the , um , uh , participants approve it , uh , for  approve the transcriptions for distribution and so forth ? 
F:  Well , le let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of  as  as I did with the , uh , uh  the  the pipeline . 
F:  Um , we are gonna have this DARPA  meeting in the middle of July , 
F:  and I think it w it 'd be  
F:  given that we 've been  we 've given a couple public talks about it already , spaced by months and months , I think it 'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available . 
F:  Um . 
F:  Right . So we can s we  we wanna be able to say " here is a subset that is available right now " 
F:  and that 's has been through the legal issues and so forth . 
F:  So . 
F:  OK ? 
F:  So , by  before July . 
F:  Well , in principle , yes . But , I mean , i if  if  if somebody actually did get into some legal issue with it then we 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I it  you know , there there is a point at which I agree it becomes ridiculous 
F:  because , you know , you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say , you know , that should be a period and not a question mark . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  And you don't  you  there 's no way that we 're gonna go back and ask everybody " do you approve this , uh , you know  this document now ? " 
F:  So  
F:  So I think what it is is that the  the  the  the thing that they sign  I  I haven't looked at it in a while , but it has to be open enough that it sort of says " OK , from now on  you know , now that I 've read this , you can use  do anything you want with these data . " 
F:  And , uh  But , i I think we wanna  
F:  So , assuming that it 's in that kind of wording , which I don't remember , <inbreath> um , I think i we just wanna have enough confidence ourselves that it 's so close to the final form it 's gonna be in , a year from now that they 're  
F:  Uh . 
F:  Well , I forget how we end 
F:  Right . I forget how we ended up on this , 
F:  but I remember my taking the position <inbreath> of not making it so  so easy for everybody to observe everything 
F:  and Adam was taking the position of  of having it be really straightforward for people to check every aspect of it including the audio . 
F:  And I don't remember who won , Adam or me , 
F:  but  
F:  uh , the  
F:  Uh , that that 's why I 'm bringing this up again , because I can't remember how we ended up . 
F:  That it was the transcrip 
F:  He wanted to do a web interface that would make it  
F:  that would give you access to the transcript and the audio . 
F:  That 's what Adam wanted . 
F:  And I don't remember how we ended up . 
F:  You decided you were whispering Satanic incantations under your breath when you were  
F:  They disappeared from view . 
F:  Uh . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  W 
F:  anyway , haven't we  we 've gone down this path a number of times . I know this can lead to extended conversations and  and not really get anywhere , 
F:  so let  let me just suggest that  <inbreath> uh , off - line that , uh , the people involved figure it out and take care of it before it 's July . 
F:  OK . So  so that in July we can tell people <mouth> " yes , we have this and you can use it " . 
F:  Uh . 
F:  So , let 's see . 
F:  What else we got ? 
F:  Uh . Don did  did a report about his project in class 
F:  and , uh  an oral and written  written version . 
F:  So that was stuff he was doing with you . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So the dominant features , including everything , were those  those quasi - cheating things . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  Where these are  
F:  Right . 
F:  On the average . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  How about time position normalized by speak 
F:  Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 

F:  Hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Great . 
F:  Has  has , uh  ? We just  I think , just talked about this the other day , but h has  has anybody had a chance to try changing , uh , insertion penalty sort of things with the  with the , uh  <breath> uh , using the tandem system input for the  ? 
F:  Oh . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . So that  
F:  So that 's  So that 's not the problem . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Yeah . We get twelve of those , 
F:  huh ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Great . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Good . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  OK . So then  then we 'll have our baseline to  to compare the currently hideous , uh , uh , new thing with . 
F:  But  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Right . But all of these effects were j like a couple percent . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  I mean , y the  
F:  Add  all of them . 
F:  I thought one was one point five percent and one was point eight . 
F:  That 's three point three . 
F:  Yeah . But the part that 's actually adjustment of the front - end per se as opposed to doing  putting VTLN in or something is  it was a couple percent . 
F:  Right ? It was  it was  there was  <inbreath> there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight . 
F:  So  and  and  
F:  let me see if I remember what they were . 
F:  One of them <inbreath> was , uh , the change to , uh  because it did it all at once ,  to  uh , from bark scale to mel scale , 
F:  which I really feel like saying in quotes , 
F:  because @ @  they 're essentially the same scale 
F:  but the  but  but  but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place . 
F:  So that 's why I wanted to look  
F:  I still haven't looked at it yet . 
F:  I  I wanna look at exactly where the filters were in the two , 
F:  and it  <inbreath> it 's probably something like there 's one fewer or one more filter in the sub <breath> one kilohertz band 
F:  and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better 
F:  one way or the other . 
F:  Um , it could be there 's something more fundamental 
F:  but it  you know , I  I don't know it yet . 
F:  And the other  and the other  that was like one and a half or something , 
F:  and then there was point eight percent , 
F:  which was  
F:  what was the other thing ? 
F:  Yeah . Those  those two were together . 
F:  We d weren't able to separate them out 
F:  cuz it was just done in one thing . 
F:  But then there was a point eight percent which was something else . 
F:  Do you remember the  ? 
F:  Oh , yeah . So that was  that was , uh  that one I can claim credit for , uh , i in terms of screwing it up in the first place . 
F:  So that someone e until someone else fixed it , 
F:  which is that , um , I never put  
F:  when I u 
F:  We had some problems before with offsets . 
F:  This inf this went back to , uh , I think Wall Street Journal . 
F:  So we  we had , uh  
F:  ea everybody else who was doing Wall Street Journal knew that there were big DC offsets in th in these data  in those data 
F:  and  and  and nobody happened to mention it to us , 
F:  and we were getting these , like , really terrible results , 
F:  like two , three times the error everybody else was getting . 
F:  And then in casual conversation someone ment mentioned " uh , well , I guess , you know , of course you 're taking care of the offsets . " 
F:  I said " what offsets ? " 
F:  And at that point , you know , we were pretty new to the data 
F:  and we 'd never really , like , looked at it on a screen 
F:  and then when we just put it on the screen  and wroop ! 
F:  there 's this big DC offset . 
F:  So , um , in PLP 
F:  No . It 's just , it  it 's  it 's not at all uncommon for  for recorded electronics to have different , um , DC offsets . 
F:  It 's  it 's , you know , no big deal . 
F:  It 's  you know , you could have ten , twenty , maybe thirty millivolts , whatever , 
F:  and it 's consistently in there . 
F:  The thing is , most people 's front - ends have pre - emphasis with it , with zero at zero frequency , 
F:  so that it 's irrelevant . 
F:  Uh , but with P L P , we didn't actually have that . 
F:  We had  we had the equivalent of pre - emphasis in a  a , uh , Fletcher - Munson style weighting that occurs in the middle of P L 
F:  but it doesn't actually have a zero at zero frequency , 
F:  like , eh , uh , typical simple fr pre - emphasis does . 
F:  We had something more fancy . 
F:  It was later on 
F:  it didn't have that . 
F:  So at that point I reali " oh sh we better have a  have a high - pass filter " 
F:  just , you know  <breath> just take care of the problem . 
F:  So I put in a high - pass filter at , uh , I think ninety  ninety hertz or so <breath> uh , for a sixteen kilohertz sampling rate . 
F:  And I never put anything in to adjust it for different  different sampling rates . 
F:  And so  well , so , you know , the code doesn't know anything about that 
F:  and so this is all at eight kilohertz 
F:  and so it was at forty - five hertz instead of at  <breath> instead of at ninety . 
F:  So , um , 
F:  I don't know if Dan fixed it or  or , uh , what he  
F:  He made it a parameter . 
F:  So . Yeah , I guess if he did it right , he did fix it 
F:  and then  and then it 's taking care of sampling rate , 
F:  which is great . 
F:  He had a  
F:  H  
F:  Yeah . Does HPF on  on his feat feature . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I mean , frankly , we never did that with the RASTA filter either , 
F:  so the RASTA filter is actually doing a different thing in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you 're doing , 
F:  which is <laugh> another old  old bug of mine . 
F:  But , um  
F:  Um . So that  that was the problem there was th we  we  we had always intended to cut off below a hundred hertz 
F:  and it just wasn't doing it , 
F:  so now it is . 
F:  So , <breath> that hep that helped us by , like , eight tenths of a percent . 
F:  It  still wasn't a big deal . 
F:  Oh , yeah . 
F:  But  but , I guess my  my point was that  that , um , the hybrid system thing that we did was , uh , primitive in many ways . 
F:  And I think I agree with you that if we fixed lots of different things and they would all add up , we would probably have a  a  a competitive system . 
F:  But I think not that much of it is due to the front - end per se . 
F:  I think maybe a couple percent of it is , as far as I can see from this . 
F:  Uh , unless you call  well , if you call VTL the front - en front - end , that 's , uh , a little more . 
F:  But that 's sort of more both , kind of . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  But . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Well , that 's what we 're seeing in other areas . Yes . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  So , it 's  so , 
F:  um , um  
F:  I mean , the reason to think it should is because you 're putting in the same information and you 're transforming it to be more discriminative . 
F:  So . Um . 
F:  Now the thing is , in some databases I wouldn't expect it to necessarily give you much 
F:  and  and part of what I view as the real power of it is that it  gives you a transformational capability <breath> for taking all sorts of different wild things that we do , 
F:  not just th the standard front - end , 
F:  but other things , like with multiple streams and so forth , 
F:  and allows you to feed them to the other system with this  through this funnel . 
F:  Um , so I think  I think that 's the real power of it . 
F:  I wouldn't expect huge in huge improvements . 
F:  Um , but it should at least be roughly the same and maybe a little better . 
F:  If it 's , you know , like way way worse then , you know  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Let  let me  let me just ask you something . 
F:  When you say take the fifty - six outputs , these are the pre final nonlinearity  outputs 
F:  and they 're  and  
F:  through the KLT . 
F:  OK . 
F:  And so  so then you u Do you use all fifty - six of the KLT 
F:  or  ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Uh . Talk with Stephane . 
F:  He did some things like that . 
F:  It was either him or Carmen . 
F:  I forget . 
F:  I mean these were all different databases and different  you know , in HTK and all that , 
F:  so i it  it may not apply . 
F:  But my recollection of it was that it didn't make it better but it didn't make it worse . 
F:  But , again , given all these differences , maybe it 's more important in your case that you not take a lot of these low - variance , uh , components . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Which could be good or not . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . Worth trying . 
F:  There might be , 
F:  cuz that 's a pretty big difference . 
F:  But 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  What if  ? 
F:  That 's  
F:  well , and another one is the normalization of the inputs to the net . 
F:  These nets are trained with particular normalization 
F:  and when that gets screwed up it  it can really hurt it . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Well , you might e e 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . <inbreath> I  I would actually double check with Stephane at this point , 
F:  cuz he 's probably the one here  
F:  I mean , he and Dan are the ones who are at this point most experienced with the tandem 
F:  thing and there may  there may be some little bit here and there that is not  not being handled right . 
F:  Not unless you had a lot of time 
F:  and  
F:  That 's right . 
F:  Well , the other  
F:  Yeah , th the  
F:  Well , you actually are . 
F:  But  but it  but in an indirect way . 
F:  So wha w what  an and you may not be in this case , 
F:  come to think of it , 
F:  because , uh , you 're just taking something that 's trained up elsewhere . 
F:  So , what  what you  what you do in the full procedure <breath> is you , um , uh , have an embedded training . 
F:  So in fact you  the  the net is trained on , uh , uh , a , uh , Viterbi alignment of the training data that comes from your full system . 
F:  And so that 's where the feedback comes all around , so that it is actually discriminant . 
F:  You can prove that it 's  it 's a , 
F:  uh  
F:  If you believe in the Viterbi assumption that , uh , getting the best path , uh , is almost equivalent to getting the best , uh , total probability , um , then you actually do improve that by , uh  by training up on local  local , uh  local frames . 
F:  But , um , we aren't actually doing that here , 
F:  because we did  we did that for a hybrid system , 
F:  and now we 're plugging it into another system 
F:  and so it isn't  <breath> i i i it wouldn't quite apply here . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . Another thing is since you 're not using the net for recognition per se but just for this transformation , it 's probably bigger than it needs to be . 
F:  So that would save a lot of time . 
F:  Yeah . Actually all those things could  could  could  could , uh  could affect it as well . 
F:  The other thing , uh , just to mention that Stephane  this was an innovation of Stephane 's , which was a pretty neat one , 
F:  uh , and might particularly apply <clears throat> here , given all these things we 're mentioning . 
F:  Um , Stephane 's idea was that , um , discriminant , uh , approaches are great . 
F:  Even the local ones , given , you know , these potential outer loops which , you know , you can convince yourself turn into the global ones . 
F:  Um , however , there 's times when it  is not good . 
F:  Uh , when  something about the test set is different enough from the training set that  that , uh , the discrimination that you 're learning is  is  is not a good one . 
F:  So , uh , his idea was to take as the input feature vector to the , uh , Gaussian mixture system , <breath> uh , a concatenation of the neural net outputs and the regular features . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . I mean , I 'm sure that Stephane wasn't the first to think of it , 
F:  but actually Stephane did it 
F:  and  <laugh> and  and it helped a lot . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So that 's  that  that 's our current best  best system in the , uh  <breath> uh , in the Aurora thing . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I  I , uh , missed what you said . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Well , actually , I , uh  you should check with him , 
F:  because he tried several different combinations . 
F:  Yeah . I , uh , th 
F:  what I don't remember is which came out best . 
F:  So he did one where he put o put e the whole thing into one KLT , 
F:  and another one , since the  the PLP things are already orthogonalized , he left them alone and  and just did a KLT on the  on the  on the net outputs 
F:  and then concatenated that . 
F:  And I don't remember which was better . 
F:  No . I don't know , i I  I don't know . 
F:  You have to check with him . 
F:  I 'm into big ideas these days . 
F:  Not to mention the fact that we 're missing snacks . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Uh 
F:  Um . 
F:  I  I g I think , given that we 're in a hurry for snacks , maybe we should do them together . 
F:  Well , it 's  <breath-laugh> it 's  it 's not  You know , it 's not gonna work out 
F:  but we could  we could just , uh , uh , see if we find a rhythm , 
F:  you know , 
F:  what  
F:  Uh , O 's or zeroes , 
F:  we wanna agree on that ? 
F:  Oh , but if we were a singing group , we would wanna decide . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  We might wa 
F:  So these are excellent . 
F:  Why don't we do zer 
F:  i Anyone have a problem with saying zero ? 
F:  Is zero OK ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  One and a two and three . 
F:  Once more with feeling . 
F:  No , just k just kidding . 
F:  Oh , yeah . It was .
