A:  Completely useless ! 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Hm 
A:  I think you  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I think we should  
A:  In this thing of seamless handoff  or handovers  should think more maybe in  different layers ? 
A:  So one layer is  having the seamless handover . 
A:  It 's clear if a technology doesn't provide that  quality of service , you can't do magic and have it . 
A:  There are certain constraints on that . 
A:  It 's true . 
A:  That 's still in mind . 
A:  But for  with the cases there  There , it is possible . 
A:  So that should be made possible then ? 
A:  So 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  There are still enough problems i  in doing it . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yep . 
A:  But it might be the wrong thing to promise , uh , ten megabits to everywhere . 
A:  There you are . 
A:  But saying " OK if it 's  a  if the technology is OK , you can do it . " 
A:  Yep . 
A:  Yep . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yep . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Hi . 
A:  ist fertig . 
A:  How 's it start ? 
A:  Who is using mobile phones ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  But usually WAP shouldn't  is so general that it can be used with UMTS . 
A:  So if you  still want to use WAP with UMTS you might be able to do it . 
A:  But 
A:  that shouldn't be your only way of  
A:  But usually  that 's not the reason to have UMTS . 
A:  Yep . 
A:  My impression on this proposal is that every single block  has some  research done already . 
A:  So , multicast . This means that there are many things done . 
A:  Oh , what was it ? 
A:  Maybe I was routing mobility management 
A:  But no one actually put them  together . 
A:  But  So that 's the big problem . 
A:  But the problem with this problem , might be that it 's too  big 
A:  to put all these big pieces to 
A:  So that you really have a complete  a complete scenario . 
A:  You have , in one scenario , multicast ,  quality of service , routing  and mobile  um networking . 
A:  Not just  the islands alone . 
A:  Yeah , but  but  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  But  
A:  But for theoretical  or for historical reasons  a really good question , " if we would have the money what would we do with that ? " 
A:  So if we don't know what we would like to do with the money , we probably wouldn't get any money to do what we don't know . 
A:  So that 's why , I think , yeah , it 's a good question . 
A:  Yep . 
A:  That 's just the same question just other way around . 
A:  Modernistic stuff ! 
A:  Completely useless !
