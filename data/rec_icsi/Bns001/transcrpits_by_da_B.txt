B:  At this number ? 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Hi . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK , 
B:  thank you Joe . 
B:  Well , I , uh , as all of you know I came from  from Spain , 
B:  from the uh  Polytechnic University of Valencia 
B:  and i uh  I um , just finished my PHD thesis about uh  um power - saving  techniques for wireless networking . 
B:  uh , In fact , I have developed an algorithm to control the ra radio frequency power uh of a wireless transceiver . 
B:  And , uh  I 've been working  also in routing issues , especially in the so - called ad - hoc netw wireless networks . 
B:  Where uh , you have a set of , uh , mobile nodes and , no other infrastructure , 
B:  no base stations . 
B:  So all the routing functions are done by the node  by the same nodes . 
B:  OK ? 
B:  So , nodes act as both end points and routers . 
B:  eh 
B:  I 've in the study for some time these kind of networks . 
B:  And , uh , in fact , there are a lot of  of  research uh articles about this  this kind of networks because You know , uh , mmm infrastructure - based network  network has been a long topic of research . 
B:  So , 
B:  for example , routing on  on wired networks is a  a topic still to be researched 
B:  but it has an important background . 
B:  But mobile network this kind of mobile networks is a little bit  uh newer , 
B:  especially because uh , until not so long uh , the  the things were too heavy to have a computer , a wireless transceiver , on a more or less portable thing . 
B:  So , with the advent of this new technology , low power uh , high , uh , processing capability and wireless  eh  networking capability , in a really small package , new kind of devices are  are being built and are appearing , in the market . 
B:  And , eh , well this is more or less what I have done . 
B:  And the kind of , uh , things , I 'm interested is more or less all , around this  these  kind of networks . 
B:  But I could say , uh in general , mobile service is not only about , uh these specific kind of networks . 
B:  But , in general , about , uh services uh over mobile or services that can benefit from the  uh , capability of nodes to move around . 
B:  And , uh , well , I  I 've been teaching now for twelve years , comp eh At a computer sciences school in my university , 
B:  I 've been teaching computer networks . 
B:  And , well , I am  more or less uh , knowledgable about , well , TCP IP networking , ISO uh , networking , 
B:  and , uh 
B:  well I 'm  I 'm a computer guy , 
B:  so I 'm really  um Well , I can say uh , proudly uh , more or less , computer skilled . 
B:  I mean , uh , operating systems uh , programming languages uh , networking @ @ . 
B:  So this kind of things I think I 'm more or less well - trained . 
B:  So 
B:  this is , I think , um , my first presentation . 
B:  Next  maybe next meeting I will uh , do a small sketch about uh , my past work , and  well , presenting some det a little bit more detailed approach with some schemes and  and some things from previous talks , so you can have a better idea of w the kind of work I 've been doing . 
B:  OK ? 
B:  Thank you . 
B:  Y 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  That 's OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
B:  Well , like have a  blueprint . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
B:  And you can build a  a  <inbreath> an  a  a double technology adapter , too . 
B:  So you can market these double - technology adapters . 
B:  And , this can be a  a potential uh um you know , uh , income , too . 
B:  Because you just have to license , uh uh WaveLAN technology . 
B:  You can build , uh , the whole thing . 
B:  This U - UMTS WaveLAN , uh mixed together . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  I think , they are using different , uh , radio technologies . 
B:  So ,  uh , at the physical level , they 're  they 're  they are not compatible . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  That  that 's right . 
B:  Yeah but I  I have a point uh regarding the  this question , is eh the cost function . 
B:  I mean . 
B:  uh 
B:  What about the user who is switching from one  let 's say  zero - cost area network to another  network where he has to pay . 
B:  It is OK  for the service to continue when he uh switches from one network to another . 
B:  But probably , the user wants to be aware that he 's switching from one place  from one network to another . 
B:  Because maybe , <inbreath> while he 's uh having , let 's say , a  vide video conference uh over the  the WaveLAN oh he 's not paying any extra cost . 
B:  But when he continues with this service on the UMTS , he 's having to cover uh an important  let 's say , an important cost  or some cost , non - null cost . 
B:  So  uh 
B:  this can be something that probably the user wants to be aware of . 
B:  Of course , this doesn't mean that the user wants the connection to be dropped when he switches . to the w uh  r uh from the zero - cost area network to  to the  uh um non - null cost area network . 
B:  But maybe some users want to do this . 
B:  Because they say " OK  
B:  I 'm not willing to pay any back for this service , 
B:  because I 'm just watching  uh you know the sports news . 
B:  So , if I switch  If  if , because of my motion , I 'm switching , or I 'm going out of the coverage of the  of the uh wave  uh wireless uh local area network , well , I  I want the service to be uh stopped . " 
B:  And this can be some pattern then that  some users will follow . 
B:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
B:  But when quality of service comes to the uh scene , well , I think  we have a  a bigger problem 
B:  because maybe this  this uh uh seamless migration cannot be seamless at all , 
B:  because maybe the  the quality of service we are getting when we are  connected to a certain network , let 's say high - speed networking , cannot be  sustained when we are switching to a different technology . 
B:  So , this is another thing that is uh putting a little bit in more trouble our  our scheme 
B:  or  
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh , sorry . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  It can be done . 
B:  It is just  Mmm uh Trying to  to  to  to poi to pinpoint The  the possible problems . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  In fact , if you take the slower technology  of the ones you are planning to  to support , you can offer this warran this  uh this throughput as uh the minimum warranty you  you can get . 
B:  So , if everybody is  is asking for less than this minimum amount , no problem at all . 
B:  But in this case , maybe not too much effort should be put  on providing this quality of service 
B:  because you just have a  usually a huge  bandwidth compared on a  a  w with what the user is  is using . 
B:  I mean , if you have a ten megabits bandwidth and the user is asking two kilobits per second , of course , you can uh build uh certain reserve mechanisms to warranty the user these two kilobits per second bandwidth . 
B:  But probably in  it isn't  it is not worth because you have so many uh available bandwidths that maybe uh it is not a problem . 
B:  Hi . 
B:  Oh , OK . 
B:  Have you  have you read about this  uh Barwan project held at Berkeley University ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Barwan . 
B:  Barwan . 
B:  Uh da it was another related project called Daedalus . 
B:  And uh well it seems they what they were doing was some kind of  uh things si somehow similar to this . 
B:  u 
B:  Uh  Don't know . 
B:  I  I  I  I just uh take a  a quick uh look at the  at the thing 
B:  because I  I was  uh read about this uh a long time ago . 
B:  And it  the  the latest report I  I found was in nineteen ninety eight . 
B:  And in this report , well , they  they pres  they have uh some slides , some uh papers , some  well , a lot of things . 
B:  And  well the main thing and the quick uh thing I  I was uh looking at was a  a video available in MP - thr  in MPG M - peg format . 
B:  And uh 
B:  well  what this video was presenting was a kind of test of  of one guy with a  portable computer , moving across different networks . 
B:  So starting at the CS department at Berkeley 
B:  and then going out the street 
B:  switching to the  a campus - wide network , 
B:  uh um I think it 's a Metricom uh network , 
B:  an which is uh a test  
B:  Ricochet , 
B:  yeah , 
B:  that 's right . 
B:  And then , finally switching to  I think it was city PD or something like this . 
B:  OK . 
B:  I  as lo uh as the  as the user is moving out of the  of the coverage area of this second network . 
B:  And , well , what they have built is a a  kind of uh proxy structure . 
B:  So they are  they are putting most of the work of this adaptational layer on   on the side of the proxies . 
B:  So the client or the server is not changed . 
B:  It is the proxy , the one that does the work . 
B:  OK , 
B:  so you can even , for example , use  
B:  It 's the same ? 
B:  Oh , OK . 
B:  OK , 
B:  I  
B:  It is just that  that  well , maybe we can  we can take a look at  oh maybe a more in - depth look at this project 
B:  just to see if we are doing the same , or if we are doing something similar . 
B:  It would be important for us  to  to highlight the differences . 
B:  Because if not , well , they can say , " Oh , you are doing the same thing . " 
B:  " This was done  now . " 
B:  Yeah , well we are close . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  No problem . 
B:  Yeah , 
B:  UC Ber - uh Berkeley , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  I 'll  I  you  uh  I seen uh uh reports from nineteen ninety uh ninety - six , ninety - seven and ninety - eight . 
B:  Maybe the project  
B:  n uh 
B:  I think that  that the leader was uh Professor Katz . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah 
B:  b le let me  let me ask you <inbreath> a question about eh UMTS or  or third or possible fourth generation communic wireless communication systems . 
B:  Uh , from the point of view of the user , uh  is there uh something more that  nnn , that  than more speed ? 
B:  Is there any other advantage , from the point of view of the user or of  of the terminals ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
B:  But in fact  
B:  But in  fact now , at the GSM level , what you have is that every voice channel you use provides a  a p a pretty fine fixed uh data speed . 
B:  So , we can say that every voice channel has an i an incr uh  implied um  quality of service , 
B:  which is nnn ninety six hundred bits per second . 
B:  Full duplex . 
B:  Doesn't it ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  So . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  No , but  um but not only because of  of data speed , 
B:  but also about delay , 
B:  you know , 
B:  because GSM networks were developed to y uh  with a voice service in mind . 
B:  Ah , delay is also  considered in these networks . 
B:  So , 
B:  uh , in fact for every voice channel you have uh a pretty fine maximum uh delay and jitter , and a  a  a specified um data speed . 
B:  So you can scale up  scale up this uh this um thing by using several channels . 
B:  So , in fact , you have , using just GSM technology , you have more or less the same building blocks as you can get uh with the UMTS . 
B:  I mean that one thing is that the technology is a little bit different , 
B:  that uh the base station thing is different 
B:  and maybe uh the  the internal routing uh inside the network is different 
B:  but from the point of view of the mobile things uh I 'm not sure if  if  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah , but  The  You know , it is also being d uh developed , this G uh P - DPRS thing , GPRS thing . 
B:  which is uh pack uh packet data over GSM . 
B:  So , 
B:  I mean . Uh , I don't see that a  a lot of difference . 
B:  We can expect a lot of differences f uh from the uh mobile terminal point of view . Uh , when uh UMTS be deployed . 
B:  What I 'm trying to say is that  is that  well , uh maybe uh it is not a big problem that any of us uh be uh um were um a UMTS expert 
B:  because uh I  I don't see  it  I think that the UMTS thing is more a technology issue , than a research issue . 
B:  Maybe I 'm wrong . 
B:  Just es 
B:  um 
B:  explaining my  m 
B:  I mean  to be done here , 
B:  not  not at the  
B:  of course , you know , <laugh> I 'm  I  I agree with you that there are a lot o of things to be developed 
B:  but  But the point is that  uh this is  probably not here . 
B:  Because uh well , you know the  the  the orientation of our group which is uh " Networks Services and Applications " , not uh wireless technology or the underlying wireless technology . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  You know , radio frequency technology , 
B:  wide - band w uh CDMA . 
B:  These kind of things all have a lot of things to be  to be  uh researched . 
B:  But uh I don't think w this is not something we are doing  here . 
B:  Voice , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  One question . 
B:  I have a  an important doubt about the IP availability over UMTS . 
B:  I mean  you know that the carriers and some manufacturers have done an important effort in developing this web thing 
B:  and uh I 'm not sure what they plan to do with next generation . 
B:  I mean , are they  maintaining  are they holding the same web technology ? 
B:  Or , are ju just they  discarding this technology 
B:  and forgetting about the thing ? 
B:  I  I don't know what will happen . 
B:  uh , I  I don't have a clue . 
B:  Probably , if after searching a little bit on the  on the net I can get the answer , 
B:  but initially this is something to  to  to have in mind . 
B:  I mean . Because maybe this UMTS thing will appear on the market without IP as a native protocol . 
B:  And if this is the case well , thus seamless integration could be we strongly affected . 
B:  At least , uh , if you  we want to use U M 
B:  I 'm  I 'm  just uh throwing the question . 
B:  uh I mean , looking for an answer 
B:  because I don't know if uh some of you have a clue about this . 
B:  I don't know what  what carriers are planning to do about this . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  No . 
B:  No . 
B:  Not me . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  In Spain it 's available 
B:  but uh you know , uh my main complaint has been all the time that it is difficult to me to believe that I can do interesting work with a 4 lines display . 
B:  Ah  Maybe , check the lottery result <laugh> or something like this , 
B:  but  
B:  Huh - huh - huh . 
B:  Well 
B:  I  I don't know what will  
B:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
B:  u 
B:  Let me  let me propose a  a  a  a reasoning way . 
B:  Uh let 's assume that we are successful with this proposal , 
B:  so we get the funding to do whatever what we want to do . 
B:  So my question is , what we want to do is ? 
B:  Let 's assume that we have the funding . 
B:  What will be our first and or  or and second steps ? 
B:  Ah , what kind of things uh we  eh we will buy , 
B:  what kind of things we will eh program or we will deploy ? 
B:  Because answering this  these questions  we can  know much better  what the application we want . 
B:  So let 's assume  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Absolutely . 
B:  Let  let me put an example . 
B:  You know I  Some days ago , I bought , like some of you , this kind of things . 
B:  This is a PDA 
B:  eh three com uh Palm Pilot compatible , 
B:  nothing  nothing that great , 
B:  but it has some  some possibility of  being expanded . 
B:  But the point is eh , the only  in here  The only thing  wireless thing I can put on  on this is just uh this Omnisky modem , 
B:  which is uh , I think it is a subscription - based uh thing . 
B:  You have to pay every  every month , 
B:  and eh of course , I cannot imagine that uh tomorrow I 'll be able to buy a different thing with four different networks , 
B:  four different providers on it . 
B:  Maybe I 'm wrong 
B:  but 
B:  if I have the funding I say " OK , well , I can buy this or even I can buy a mobile computer , 
B:  a notebook " . 
B:  OK ? 
B:  A lot more expensive , 
B:  but  that 's OK , 
B:  I have the funding 
B:  Then I can add a couple of cards at most , 
B:  because mmm the majority of the  of the notebooks only have two PC cards uh type two slots . 
B:  So 
B:  In  in the better case , maybe I 'm only able to add two different networks to this thing . 
B:  So ah 
B:  the difficulty I see is that  ah if we are  if you want to think in  in two three four different technologies um , maybe we are uh too advanced too , um , let 's say , uh too in advance for the current technology . 
B:  Which is not bad , 
B:  but uh , I 'm just saying that it will be able  It will  
B:  Sorry . 
B:  It will be difficult for us to develop a  a reasonable test bed with the available technology . 
B:  If somebody tell us , " OK , now here you have the thing , and just put these four networks you want on the thing . " How can I do it now ? 
B:  So mmm 
B:  I 'm still trying to  you know , to get used to the uh  all the ideas 
B:  and to see that all the things are really connecting 
B:  because this the eh most difficult thing I see to  to  to get this alignment to this connection point  among the different things we are trying to align . 
B:  So that 's why I was proposing this  this question . 
B:  Let 's assume we have the funding . 
B:  Now let 's proceed . 
B:  What  what kind of things we can buy , we can put together , we can program . 
B:  Because oh at the end uh somebody will uh be asking us " OK , did you do your homework ? 
B:  Did you do what you  
B:  So . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  But for different networks ? 
B:  The point is for 
B:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm - hmm . 
B:  I think so 
B:  Oh yeah . 
B:  W 
B:  A long way , yeah . 
B:  That 's right . 
B:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Bless you . 
B:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
B:  OK 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  But  
B:  Hmm - mmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Sure . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  And  and 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  N Not only this . 
B:  We can even use this u platform to  to get some European projects in the future 
B:  because you know , sometimes eh it 's a good thing  
B:  Yeah but  uh , this will  I think w This will improve over time , I 'm sure . 
B:  So uh  
B:  Probably . 
B:  You know , this kind of joint work of different countries de companies , universities .  This is usually the best ah  the best place to  to put a project on . 
B:  Because it is involving different partners from different points of  of Europe . 
B:  Hm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
B:  Uh . 
B:  Unless  unless we speak about quality of service , 
B:  which is not eh embedded on  on IP services . 
B:  Yeah , but  
B:  Yeah but for example nobody 's really using RSVP . 
B:  OK , sorry , sorry . 
B:  Hmm - hmm - hmm . 
B:  That 's right . 
B:  Well , if  Klaus  
B:  OK . 
B:  OK 
B:  OK , 
B:  yeah , that 's right . 
B:  Oh , can you call Adam ? 
B:  At this number ?
