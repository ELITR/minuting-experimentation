B:  OK . 
B:  I had the same intuition last  last  last week . 
B:  I think it 's  to start with it 's s your  your idea of simplifying , 
B:  starting with something that  you can see  eh you know without the  extra  layers of  
B:  Sorry , 
B:  what ? 
B:  Well , you  you  you don't have to study everybody individually 
B:  but  just simple case 
B:  and the one that has the lot of data associated with it . 
B:  Or  or what if what if the equipment  what if the equipment adjusts somehow , 
B:  there 's some equalizing in there ? 
B:  OK . 
B:  Saturation . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  I wanted to ask just s something on the end of this top topic . 
B:  So , when I presented my results about the uh distribution of overlaps and the speakers and the profiles of the speakers , at the bottom of that I did have a proposal , 
B:  and I had plan to go through with it , of  of co coding the types of overlaps that people were involved in s just with reference to speaker style so , you know , with reference  
B:  and you know I said that on my  in my summary , 
B:  that  you know so it 's like people may have different amounts of being overlapped with or overlapping 
B:  but that in itself is not informative without knowing what types of overlaps they 're involved in 
B:  so I was planning to do a taxonomy of types overlaps with reference to that . 
B:  So , but it you know it 's like it sounds like you also have uh something in that direction . 
B:  Is  is it  
B:  Interesting . 
B:  Well maybe we can 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  It seems like we also s with reference to a purpose , too , that we we 'd want to have them coded . 
B:  OK . 
B:  I can do that . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah , I see this as a prototype , to use the only the  the already transcribed meeting as just a prototype . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah , maybe  It may be correlated . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  It is an empirical question , it seems like . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  It 's possible to try it both ways , 
B:  isn't it ? 
B:  in this small 
B:  OK . 
B:  Great . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yep , I agree . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Coming off of the other  
B:  Good . 
B:  So , it wouldn't be  I wasn't planning to label the time marks . 
B:  I was thinking that that would come from the engineering side , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  There you go . 
B:  Good . Good . 
B:  Great ! 
B:  Good , good . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  It would be very inefficient . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Good . OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Good . 
B:  Yeah . Let 's do that later . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh ! 
B:  Oh good , OK . 
B:  How  So it 's two pages per person ? 
B:  Oh ! 
B:  Oh , I see . 
B:  Alright . 
B:  Date and time . 
B:  Uh why did you switch the order of the Date and Time fields ? 
B:  This is rather a low - level , but 
B:  On  on the new one , Time comes first and then Date , 
B:  but I thought  
B:  This is  this is rather a low level question , but  but it used  used to be Date came first . 
B:  Oh I see . 
B:  Well , how would the  How would the user know the time if they didn't know the date ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I always assumed  
B:  So the time is supposed to be pretty exact , 
B:  because I 've just been taking beginning time  time of the meeting . 
B:  Oh dear . 
B:  We 've been  we 've been messing up your forms . 
B:  Oh , well , I was saying if we started the meeting at two thirty , 
B:  I 'd put two thirty , and I guess d e everyone was putting two thirty , 
B:  and I didn't realize there was " uh oh I 'm about to read this and I should "  
B:  This would be a radical suggestion but  
B:  Ei - either that or maybe you could maybe write down when people <laugh> start reading digits on that particular session . 
B:  I know , OK . 
B:  That 's a good point . 
B:  I see . 
B:  Good point good point . 
B:  Oh , OK . 
B:  Alright . 
B:  I rest my  
B:  OK . 
B:  w 
B:  Seat and Session . 
B:  Actually you could  
B:  Well that does raise another question , which is why is the " Professional use only " line not higher ? 
B:  Why doesn't it come in at the point of Date and Seat ? 
B:  Oh . Because we 're filling in other things . 
B:  Well , because  If y your  your professional use , 
B:  you 're gonna already have the date , and the s 
B:  Well I 'm comparing the new one with the old one . 
B:  This is the digit form . 
B:  Oh ! I wasn't supposed to  
B:  Sorry . Sorry . 
B:  That  
B:  uh OK . 
B:  Sorry about that . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Alright s but I didn't mean to derail our discussion here , 
B:  so you really wanted to start with this other form . 
B:  Alright yeah , I was comparing  
B:  so th this is  So I was looking at the change first . 
B:  So it 's like we started with this and now we 've got a new version of it wi  with reference to this . 
B:  So the digit form , 
B:  we had one already . 
B:  Now the f the fields are slightly different . 
B:  What  And there 's an addition of the native language , which is a bit redundant . 
B:  This one has Native Language and this one does too . 
B:  Oh ! Thank you .  Thank you , thank you . 
B:  There we go . 
B:  Oh , yeah . 
B:  I 'll catch up here . 
B:  OK , I see . 
B:  That 's the old and that 's the new . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  No , that 's not bad . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Well , I was thinking you could have ma multiple ones and then the amount of time  
B:  so , roughly . 
B:  So . You could say ,  you know " ten years  on the east coast , five years on the west coast " or something or other . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Oh . OK . 
B:  I think a lot of people  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I wouldn't know how to characterize mine either . 
B:  And  and so I would think  I would say , I 've  I 've got a mix of California and Ohio . 
B:  Uh - huh . 
B:  Geek region . 
B:  I 'm wondering about a question like , " Where are you from mostly ? " 
B:  I agree . I agree . 
B:  I agree . 
B:  Scandinavian , the Minnesota area 's north . 
B:  Oh , @ @ .  OK . 

B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Just rule them out . 
B:  It 'd be pretty simple , yeah . 
B:  Where are you from mostly ? 
B:  Hmm ? 
B:  Oh . 
B:  Well , see , I 'm thinking " Where are you from mostly " 
B:  because , you know , then you have some  some kind of subjective amount of time factored into it . 
B:  Well  
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  I  
B:  Yeah , or Boston . 
B:  I can't do it , but  
B:  Yeah , they do . 
B:  Yeah I agree I agree . I agree . 
B:  And they 're proud of it . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  It 's identity thing . 
B:  Well , we ca Well , why can't we just say characterize  something like char characterize your accent 
B:  and  and so I would say , " I don't know " . 
B:  But someone from Boston with a really strong coloration would know . 
B:  And so would an R - less Maine  or something , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Good . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Hmm ? 
B:  Oh .  Yeah . I  I would say more  more sweepingly , " how would you characterize your accent ? " 
B:  Well , I think this discussion has made me think that 's s something to consider . 
B:  I guess  
B:  Well , I was not sure that  
B:  I  
B:  So . I was suggesting not having the options , 
B:  just having them  
B:  Yes , but if , as Liz is suggesting , people who have strong accents know that they do  
B:  and are  
B:  Well , I know . 
B:  That 's true . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah that 's fine . 
B:  They might say " Other " for Region because they don't know what category to use 
B:  but they might have something  
B:  because it is easier to have it open ended . 
B:  Well , we thought about it . 
B:  Yeah , OK . 
B:  We just  We sort of thought , " yes ,  " y y I mean  
B:  At the last meeting , my recollection was that  we felt people would have uh less  
B:  that  that there are so many types and varieties of  these other languages 
B:  and we are not going to have that many subjects from these different language groups 
B:  and that it 's a huge waste of  of space . 
B:  That 's what I thought . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I don't think that 's what they mean . 
B:  It does seem  
B:  I mean . I  I would think that these categories would be more  w would be easier for an an analyst to put in rather than the subject himself . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  I sort of thought they were part of the  one of the Midlands . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Fine by me , fine by me . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Be easier on the subjects . 
B:  I think that 's fine . 
B:  No . 
B:  I think  
B:  I like that . I like that . 
B:  Yeah , I do . 
B:  Sure , yeah ! 
B:  I think that 's fine . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Alright . 
B:  Well . Well . I mean , pure  
B:  That 's right . 
B:  And it 's easy on the subjects . 
B:  Now I have one suggestion on the next section . 
B:  So you have native language , 
B:  you have region , 
B:  and then you have time spent in English speaking country . 
B:  Now , I wonder if it might be useful to have another open field saying " which one parenthesis S  paren closed parenthesis " . 
B:  Cuz if they spent  time in  in Britain and America  
B:  It doesn't have to be ex all  at all exact , just in the same open field format that you have . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  with a  with an S 
B:  " which one 
B:  sss ,  optional S . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , that 's good . 
B:  Isn't that wonderful ! 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Excellent ! 
B:  Thank you ! 
B:  So you  this is n Dan 's patches , Dan Ellis 's patches . 
B:  Fantastic ! 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  That 's a consideration . 
B:  And this 'll be a  hav having the multiwave will be a big help 
B:  cuz  in terms of like disentangling overlaps and things , that 'll be a big help . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  That 's excellent . 
B:  He also has version control which is another nice 
B:  e so you  e the patches that you  
B:  Oh , I thought it was in one of those patches . 
B:  Oh OK . 
B:  Well . Alright . 
B:  Well , or use the one that crawls . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  And it 's also  also the case that  that uh this multi - wave thing  is proposed to the  
B:  So . Dan proposed it to the Transcriber central people , 
B:  and it 's likely that uh  
B:  So . And  and they responded favorably 
B:  looks as though it will be incorporated in the future version . 
B:  They said that the only reason they hadn't had the multi the parallel uh stream one before was simply that  they hadn't had time to do it . 
B:  And uh  so it 's likely that this  this may be entered into the ch this central @ @ . 
B:  Well that 's  that 's  that 's true , too . 
B:  This is a   a useful thing for us . 
B:  Oh . No . I just mean  I just mean that it 's  that  that his  
B:  So .  This one that we now have does have the status of  potentially being incorporated l likely being incorporated into the central code . 
B:  Now , tha Now , if we develop further then , y uh , I don't  
B:  I mean it 's  I think it 's a nice feature to have it  set that way . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
B:  I just like the idea of it being something that 's , you know , tied back into the original , so that other people can benefit from it . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  However . I also understand that you can have  widgets that are very useful for their purpose and that you don't need to always go that w route . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Uh - oh . 
B:  Well , should we  e should we switch off the g 
B:  Ke 
B:  Turn it off . 
B:  But wait till he  
B:  OK .
