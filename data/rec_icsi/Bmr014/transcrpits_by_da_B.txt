B:  But I feel like I could now . 
B:  " Spikes " , you mean like uh , instantaneous click type spikes , or  ? 
B:  Huh . 
B:  You could try an experiment and say " OK , I 'm about to test for spikes " , 
B:  and then wiggle the thing there , 
B:  and then go and when they go to transcribe it , it could , ask them to come and get you . 
B:  " Come get me when you transcribe this and see if there 's spikes . " 
B:  No I 'm just  

B:  That 'll be  
B:  I think that 'll help  
B:  That 'll help a lot , actually . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  I would  I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him . 
B:  I don't quite understand how that  how that works , . 
B:  If  
B:  So we 're not increasing the number of channels . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  I see . 
B:  Three wireds work , 
B:  right ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I checked them this morning , 
B:  they should be . 
B:  SRI , 
B:  really ? 
B:  Oh . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  He might have . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  You know , Jane ? 
B:  Um , one suggestion 
B:  and you may already be doing this , 
B:  but I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone through transcriptions and you know in  in order to build lexicons and things , 
B:  if you um , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them ,  a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of  inconsistencies and mis 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Oh so you already have that , 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and uh , 
B:  i in alphabetized lists , they 'll appear next to each other and  and so it makes it easier . 
B:  Oh that 's great . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  When  
B:  for the person who missed " gobbledy - gook " what did they put ? 
B:  Oh . 
B:  Oh good . 
B:  Sort of how it sounds . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Boy , they 're moving right along . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Are  are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking ? 
B:  So that means other people are editing what you say ? 
B:  I don't know if I like that . 
B:  So far . 
B:  What um  
B:  When you display it on the web page , what are  what are you showing them ? 
B:  Utterances , 
B:  or  ? 
B:  And so can they bleep within an utterance ? 
B:  Whole utterances . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  I know where you 're going . 
B:  I think what Morgan 's saying is the easier it is , the more is gonna be bleeped . 
B:  So you 're saying the  the sequence would be more like first Adam goes to the contact lists , contacts them via whatever their preferred method is , to see if they want to review the meeting . 
B:  And then if they don't , you 're done . 
B:  If they do , then he provides them access to the  the web site . 
B:  Or  a printed - out form . 
B:  Only if they want it . 
B:  I think it probably leaves it open how we get it to them . 
B:  Sarcasm , 
B:  how do you  how do you indicate sarcasm ? 
B:  Any sub - word level thing . 

B:  No . 
B:  There were quite a few . 
B:  Uh . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Oh good . 
B:  You know having this headset reminds me of like working at Burger King or something . 
B:  No I never did . 
B:  But I feel like I could now .
