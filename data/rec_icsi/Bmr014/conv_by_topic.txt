E:  Alright . 
E:  So . 
C:  So are you  
C:  Are we going ? 
E:  It is uh , must be February fifteenth . 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  Yu - 
C:  I think the date 's written in there , yep . And actually if everyone could cross out the R - nine next to " Session " , and write MR eleven .  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . We didn't have a front - end meeting today . 
C:  <outbreath> 
C:  And let 's remember also to make sure that one 's  gets marked as unread , unused . 
E:  OK . 
A:  MR eleven . 
C:  MR eleven . 
F:  That sounds like a spy code . <laugh> 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  <noise> 
E:  OK . So . 
C:  There 's lots of clicking I 'm sure as I 'm trying to get this to work  correctly . 
topic_description:	opening


E:  Agenda . 
E:  Any agenda items today ? 
C:  I wanna talk a little bit about getting  
C:  how we 're gonna to get people to edit bleeps , 
C:  parts of the meeting that they don't want to include . 
C:  What I 've done so far , and I wanna get some opinions on , how to  how to finish it up . <breath> 
E:  OK . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  I wanna ask about um , 
F:  some aud audio monitoring 
F:  on some of the  um  well 
F:  some of the equipment . 
F:  In particular , the  well 
F:  uh , that 's just what I wanna ask . 
E:  Actually it  
E:  This  this maybe brings up another topic which is um  
E:  So we 're done with that topic . 
E:  The other topic I was thinking of was 
E:  the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that . 
C:  Yeah , actually I  I was going to say we need to  talk about that too . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Why  why don't we do that . 
topic_description:	summary of meeting agenda items


E:  OK audio monitoring , Jane . 
C:  <clears throat> 
F:  Ba - based on some of the tran uh  i 
F:  In listening to  some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things , 
F:  and in pact  in fact this one I 'm talking on is one of  of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings , so I  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
C:  Oh really . 
B:  " Spikes " , you mean like uh , instantaneous click type spikes , or  ?  
A:  Spikes ? 
C:  Clicks . 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  Hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  Huh . 
F:  And I don't know what the e electronics is but . 
E:  <outbreath> 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Well , I think it 's 
A:  Touching . <outbreath> 
C:  uh , it  it could be a number of things . It could be touching and fiddling , and the other thing is that it could  the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious . It might be a connector . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh , OK . 
F:  Well maybe  
F:  Then we don't really have to talk about that as an  I  I take that off the agenda . 
B:  You could try an experiment and say " OK , I 'm about to test for spikes " , and then wiggle the thing there , and then 
C:  Yeah .  Right . 
B:  go and when they go to transcribe it , it could , ask them to come and get you . <laugh> " Come get me when you transcribe this and see if there 's spikes . " <laugh> 
F:  Oh that  
E:  Um . 
F:  Well , 
B:  No I 'm just  @ @ <breath> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  OK . 
E:  I mean , 
E:  were this a 
E:  professional audio recording , 
E:  <laugh> 
E:  what we would do   
E:  what you would do is  in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and 
E:  make sure that  that  that things are not giving that kind of performance . 
E:  And if they are , then they can't be used . 
C:  Right . 
topic_description:	audio monitoring


E:  So . 
E:  Um . Let 's see . I guess  I would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on 
E:  uh , recording , transcription  you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus . 
F:  Good . 
E:  And then um , 
E:  the other thing which I would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , I think , deal is , uh , agendas . 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  So maybe I 'll  I 'll start with that actually . Uh , 
E:  um . <mouth noise> 
E:  Andreas brought up 
E:  the fact that he would kinda like to know , 
E:  if possible , what we were gonna be talking about because 
E:  he 's 
E:  sort of peripherally involved to this point , 
E:  and if there 's gonna be a topic about  
E:  discussion about something that he 
E:  uh strongly cares about then he would come and  
E:  And I think part of  
E:  part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out , in the  
E:  because of uh 
E:  the fact that the meetings are  are tending to become 
E:  reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so , 
E:  he figures he could help that out by not showing  and  and I 'm sure help 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Mmm . 
E:  out his own time . 
E:  <laugh> by not showing up if it 's a 
E:  meeting that he 's  he 's  
E:  So , uh in order  
E:  I 'd  I think that 
E:  this is a wish on his part . Uh . It 's actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times 
E:  uh things come up that are unanticipated and  and  
E:  But um , 
C:  Right . 
E:  we could try anyway , uh , 
E:  do another try at coming up with the agenda 
E:  uh , at some point before the meeting , 
E:  uh , say the day before . 
C:  Well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to  like on Wednesday , or Tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  You  you wanna volunteer to do that ? 
C:  Sure . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Alright so we 'll send out agenda request . 
E:  Uh . 
C:  Let me 
B:  That 'll be  I think that 'll help  <breath> 
C:  I 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not  get done . 
B:  That 'll help a lot , actually . 
E:  Yeah , I have to tell you for the uh  for the admin meeting that we have , Lila does that um every time before an admin meeting . 
E:  And uh , she ends up getting the agenda requests uh , uh ten minutes before the meeting . But  but   But . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Uh .  
E:  But we can try . 
E:  Maybe it 'll work . 
C:  Yeah . Maybe . <laugh> 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  Weirder things have happened . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  I 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics , I mean . 
F:  Maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more . 
B:  I would  I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him . 
C:  Well then  
E:  <mike noise> 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  <mike noise> 
topic_description:	pre-establishing meeting agendas


C:  OK . Um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in . 
C:  Um .  And they are being assembled as we speak , I hope . 
C:  And I didn't bring my car today so I 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow . 
C:  Um , and then the other question I was thinking about is  
C:  well , a couple things . First of all , 
C:  if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them . 
C:  So we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in , 
A:  Uh - 
C:  and get people 's opinions on  on what they think of them . 
E:  Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector , 
E:  which means some hand - soldering or something , right ? 
C:  Uh , no , we 're having the  them do it . So it 's so hand - soldering it , but I 'm not doing it . 
E:  No ? 
E:  Oh . 
E:  OK . 
C:  So , they  they charge  right . 
E:  Nothing against you and your hand - soldering but   <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  You 've never seen my hand - soldering . 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  But uh , 
E:  Uh , 
E:  OK , so that 's being done professionally and   Yeah . 
C:  a as I said they 're coming in . 
C:  I  I mean  Yeah . I mean . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  As professionally as I guess you can get it done . 
E:  Well , 
E:  it could  if they do a lot of it , it 's  
C:  I mean i it 's just their repair shop . 
C:  Right ? Their maintenance people . 
E:  Well , we 'll see what it  it 's like . That  tha that can be quite good . 
C:  Yep . 
E:  Th - this  Yeah , OK . 
E:  Good . Yeah . So let 's go with that . Uh , 
C:  And , I mean we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like . 
E:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	new microphones


C:  Um , then the other question I had is maybe we should get another wireless . 
C:  Another wireless setup . I mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be  better than the wired . 
E:  So how many channels do you get to have 
E:  in a wireless setup ? 
C:  Um , 
C:  well , 
C:  I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . 
C:  So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , 
C:  possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together . 
C:  And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes . 
E:  So , um . 
C:  And  
E:  So let 's see we  
C:  So , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six . 
C:  Right ? So we could have up to nine . 
E:  And right now we can have up to six . 
C:  Right . 
C:  And we have five , we 're getting one more . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  And it 's um , about nine hundred dollars for the base station , 
C:  and then eight hundred per channel . 
E:  Oh . So yeah so the only  
E:  Beyond the mike  the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars . 
C:  Right . 
E:  Oh , we should do it . 
C:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  OK , so I 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and  and then just go ahead and order them . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  I don't quite understand how that  how that works , . If  
B:  So we 're not increasing the number of channels . 
C:  No , we 're just replacing the wired  the two wired that are still working , 
B:  OK . OK . I see . 
C:  along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , 
C:  one of the wired that 's not working , 
C:  with a wireless . 
E:  Yeah . Basically we found  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Three wireds work , right ? 
C:  I  I guess three wireds work , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . But we 've had more problems with that . 
C:  Yep . 
E:  And that sort of bypasses the whole  the whole Jimbox thing and all that . 
C:  Right . 
E:  And so 
E:  um , 
E:  we  we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes , as long as we 're conscious about the batteries . 
E:  That seems to be the key 
C:  Right . 
C:  Everyone 's battery OK ? 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  issue . 
B:  I checked them this morning , they should be . <inbreath> 
C:  OK . 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Um , 
E:  <mouth> That 's the only thing with them . But the quality seems really good and   
E:  Um I heard from UW that they 're  they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . They 're  they 're  they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf . 
C:  Well we should talk to them about it because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff , 
C:  and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone  on the same page with that . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  SRI , really ? 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh . 
C:  They got sa apparent 
C:  Well , 
C:  Maybe  this needs to be bleeped out ? I have no clue . 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  Uh , I don't know . Probably we shouldn't  probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff . 
C:  I don't know how much of it 's public . 
C:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  But anyway there 's  there 's  there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and  and uh  and NIST and UW . So . 
E:  Um . But  but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is  is quite positive with the Sony , uh , radio - mikes . 
C:  Right . 
topic_description:	purchasing an additional wireless setup


E:  So , um , 
E:  uh , 
E:  Dave isn't here but he was going to 
E:  start working on some things with the digits . 
E:  Uh , 
E:  so he 'll be interested in what 's going on with that . I guess  Was  the decision last time was that the  
E:  the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
E:  Has that started , or is that  ? 
F:  Uh , it would be to use his interface and I was going to meet with him today about that . 
C:  Right , so , the decision was that Jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . So I did the  all that last week . 
C:  So all the  all the forms are now  on the computer . 
C:  And uh , then I have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and 
C:  let the uh  transcribers use different tools . And I just want to talk to Jane about how we transition to using those . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So he has a nice set up that they  
F:  it w it will be efficient for them to do that . 
E:  OK . So anyway  
C:  I  I don't think it 'll take too long . 
C:  So , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days I suspect . 
E:  <mouth noise> 
E:  So anyway I think we  we have at least one uh , user 
E:  for the digits once they get done , which will be Dave . 
C:  Right . 
C:  I 've already done five or six  sets . 
F:  OK .  
C:  So if he wanted to , you know , just have a few to start with , he could . 
E:  Yeah , he might  he might be asking  <mike noise> 
C:  You know , and I also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate P - files and run recognition on them also . 
E:  Right . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Uh , is Dave  
E:  I don't know if Dave is on the list , 
E:  if he 's invited to these meetings , uh  
E:  if he knows .  
F:  I don't tend to get an invitation myself for them even . 
A:  No , no . 
C:  Uh , we don't have a active one but I 'll make sure he 's on the list . 
F:  Yeah .  
F:  Should we call him ? I mean is he  d is he definitely not available today ? 
E:  I don't know . 
F:  Should I call his office and see ? 
E:  Uh , well i it 's uh  
A:  He was in . Yeah . 
C:  I mean , he 's still taking classes , so uh , he may well have conflicts . 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , he was in  s 
F:  He wasn't there at cof 
E:  Yeah , so this might be a conflict for him . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Uh , so . 
C:  Yeah didn't he say his signal - processing class was like  
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  I think he has a class . Yeah . 
C:  Tuesdays and Thursdays ? 
B:  Yeah . He might have . 
E:  Oh , OK . 
D:  You talking about David Gelbart ? 
C:  Oh well , whatever . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  Yes . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I think he 's taking two twenty - five A which is now . 
E:  Yeah . OK . 
F:  OK . 
D:  So . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  So , that 's why we 're not seeing him . OK . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	processing digits, David Gelbart's involvement


E:  Uh , transcriptions , uh , beyond the digits , where we are , and so on . 
F:  OK . 
F:  <inbreath> Um  
E:  And the  and the recordings also , just where we are . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  Well , 
F:  so um , should we  we don't wan wanna do the recording status first , or  ? 
E:  <mike noise> 
E:  <mike noise> 
C:  Well , we have about thirty - two hours  uh 
C:  as of , 
C:  I guess a week and a half ago , so we probably now have about thirty - five hours .  
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  And  and that 's  that 's uh  How much of that is digits ? 
E:  It 's uh  that 's including digits , right ? 
C:  That 's including digits . I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits . 
E:  So  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours , or something of  
E:  There 's got to be more than thirty hour  i it couldn't  of  
C:  Of  of non - digits ? 
A:  Mmm . 
E:  Of non - digits . 
C:  Yeah , absolutely . I mean , the digits don't take up that much time . 
E:  Yeah , yeah . 
E:  OK . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  OK , and the transcribers h I , uh , don't have the exact numbers , but I  
E:  <mike noise> 
E:  <mike noise> 
E:  And  and again the main track that you 're working with is elev eleven hours ? Is that right ? 
F:  Yes exactly . 
E:  Yeah , OK . 
F:  And that 's part of this  
F:  Eleven hours . 
E:  Is that  is that  that including digits ? 
F:  Yes it is . Mm - hmm .  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So let 's say roughly  ten hours or so of  
E:  I mean it 's probably more than that but  but with  of  of non - digits . 
F:  It 'd be more than that because I  my recollection is the minutes  that da digits don't take more than half a minute . Per person . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh , OK . 
F:  But um  the  the total set that I gave them is twelve hours of tape , 
E:  Oh , I see . 
F:  But they haven't gotten to the end of that yet . So they 're still working  some of them are  Two of them are still working on completing that . 
E:  Oh , I see . 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  Boy , they 're moving right along . 
F:  Yeah . They are . Mm - hmm . They 're very efficient . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  There 're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others . Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Um , let 's see . 
E:  I think the uh  
E:  Were  were you basically done with the transcription part ? 
F:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	update on transcriptions, amount completed


F:  think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now .  The next step is to  that I 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , 
E:  <mike noise> 
E:  <mike noise> 
F:  and then channelized . What I mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked , that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that 
E:  <mike noise> 
F:  uh , Liz requested in terms of um , um  in terms of having a s a 
E:  <mike noise> 
F:  systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about . 
F:  Um , for example , i they 'll say uh " ninety - two " . And you know , so how  you could  
C:  Nine two , right . 
F:  e Exactly . So if you just say " nine two " , the  there are many s ways that could have been expressed . An - and I just had them  
F:  I  I mean , a certain number of them did put the words down , 
F:  but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things . 
B:  You know , Jane ? 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Um , one suggestion and you may already be doing this , but 
B:  I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone 
E:  <mike noise> 
B:  through transcriptions and you know in  in order to build lexicons and things , 
B:  if you um , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them ,  
B:  a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of  inconsistencies and mis 
F:  <inbreath> 
C:  Misspelled . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  You 're talking about the type token frequency listings , and I use those too . 
F:  Y you mean just uh  on each  on each line there 's a one word right ? 
F:  It 's one token from the  from the corpus . 
B:  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah , those are e extremely efficient and I and I  I agree that 's a very good use of it . 
B:  Oh so you already have that , OK . 
F:  Well that 's  that 's a way  that 's  You know , the spell - check 
F:  basically does that but  but in addition  yes , that 's  that 's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are 
F:  you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon . 
B:  Mm - hmm . Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , 
F:  Exactly . And then you ca then you can do a s 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  and uh , i in alphabetized lists , they 'll appear next to each other 
F:  Absolutely . I agree . 
B:  and  and so it makes it easier . 
F:  That 's a very good  that 's a very good uh , suggestion . 
F:  And that was  that 's my strategy for handling a lot of these things , in terms of things that need to be glossed . I didn't get to that point but  
F:  So there are numbers , then there are acronyms , and then um , there 's a  he she wants the uh , actually a  
F:  an explicit marker of what type of comment this is , so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either 
F:  " VOC " for vocalized , like cough or like laugh or whatever , 
F:  " NONVOC " for door - slam , and " GLOSS " for things that have to do with  if they said a s a spoken form with this  m this pronunciation error . I already had that convention but I  
E:  <mike noise> 
C:  Right . 
B:  Oh that 's great . 
F:  I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz I think it most  ha most efficiently handled by uh  by a  a filter . That was what I was always planing on . So that , you know you get a whole long list  exactly what you 're saying , 
E:  <mike noise> 
F:  you get a whole list of things that say " curly bracket laugh curly bracket " , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  then y you know it 's  it 's  You  you risk less error if you handle it by a filter , 
F:  than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space , so man 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  So many ways that error prone . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
F:  So , um , 
F:  <inbreath> um I 'm  I 'm going to convert that via a filter , into these tagged uh , subcategorized comments , 
F:  and same thing with you know , we see you get a subset 
F:  when you do what you 're saying , you end up with a s with uh , you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens and you can um , have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes . But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand , because , you know I mean , jus 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  You don't know what they could be . 
F:  Yeah now TIMIT 's clear um  and PLP is clear <laugh> but uh there are things that are not so well known , in  or  or have variant  u u uses like the numbers you can say " nine two " or you can say " ninety - two " , and uh 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  So how are you doing the  
F:  I 'd handle the numbers individually . 
C:  How are you doing the uh , acronyms so if I say PZM what would it appear on the transcript ? 
F:  <mouth noise> It would be separate  The letters would be separated in space and potentially they 'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards e but I 'm not sure if that 's necessary , clarifying what it is , so gloss of  whatever . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Right . 
F:  I don't know if that 's really necessary to do that . 
F:  <inbreath> Maybe it 's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is 
F:  uh , a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there , and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it 's uh <inbreath> the 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  you know ,  uh enumerated , or i it 's not a good way of saying  but it 's  it 's the <inbreath> specific uh way of stating these  these letters . 
C:  Right . So it sounds good . 
F:  And so anyway , the clean  those are those things and then channelized is to then um , get it into this multichannel format . 
E:  <mike noise> 
F:  And at that point then it 's ready for use by Liz and Don . 
F:  But that 's been my top priority  beyond getting it tanel channelized , the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
F:  And uh , Thilo had a  e e a breakthrough with this  this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um 
F:  uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um , up and running and I haven't  I haven't been able to use that yet cuz I 'm working s re this is my top priority  get the data clean , and channelized . 
A:  I actually gave 
C:  Have you also been doing spot checks , Jane ? 
F:  Oh yes . Well you see that 's part of the cleaning process . I spent 
C:  Okay , good . 
F:  um actually um I have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers , 
C:  Oh good . Good . 
F:  and I went through it last night , it 's  it 's almost spooky how similar these are , word for word . And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I  I left them discretion at commas . 
C:  Right . 
F:  Uh  and so because it 's not part of our st of our ne needed conventions . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And um , 
F:  and  so they 'll be a difference in commas , but it 's word - by - word the same , 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  in  in huge patches of the data . And I have t ten minute stretch where I can  where I can show that . And  and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon , and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech . So 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Hmm . 
F:  um , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up " gobbledy - gook " . And the other one didn't . And on this side , this one 's picking up things like " neural nets " and the one that 's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the uh colloquial didn't . 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  Right . 
B:  When  for the person who missed " gobbledy - gook " what did they put ? 
F:  <inbreath> It was an interesting approximation , put in parentheses , cuz I have this convention that , i if they 're not sure what it was , they put it in parentheses . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh . 
F:  So they tried to approximate it , but it was  
B:  Oh good . 
F:  it was spelled GABBL  
B:  Sort of how it sounds . 
F:  Yes . More of an attempt to  I mean apparently it was very clear to her that these  the a this  this was a sound  these are the sounds , but  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  It was a technical term that she didn't recognize , <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . But she knew that she didn't know it . Maybe it was a technical ter exactly . But she  even though her technical perception is just really  uh you know I 've  I 'm tempted to ask her if she 's taken any 
F:  courses in this area or if she 's taken cognitive science courses then cuz " neural nets " and  oh she has some things that are  oh " downsampled " , she got that right . 
C:  Right . 
B:  Hmm . 
F:  And some of these are rather  uh unexpected . 
C:  Obscure , yeah . 
F:  But ch ten solid uh  m ch s chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data . And um  
A:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	post-transcription manipulations


E:  So what  what  what 's the deal with  with your  
A:  The channel u thing ? 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh , it 's just uh , I ran the recognizer  uh , the   speech - nonspeech detector on different channels and , 
A:  it 's just in uh  in this new multi - channel format and output , and 
E:  Oh , I see . 
A:  I just gave one  one meeting to  to Liz who wanted to  to try it for  for the recognizer 
A:  as uh , apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech , which took too much memory or whatever , 
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  and so  she  she will try that I think and    I 'm  I 'm working on it . So , I hope  
C:  Is this anything different than the HMM system you were using before ? 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  No . 
A:  Uh , 
A:  I  mmm , use some  some different features but not  not  The basic thing is this HMM base . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  So there 's still no  
C:  no knowledge using different channels at the same time . You know what I mean ? 
A:  There is some , uh as the energy is normalized across channels yeah . 
C:  Across all of them . OK . 
A:  So . But basically that 's one of the main changes . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <inbreath> What are some of the other features ? Besides the 
E:  energy ? You said you 're trying some different features , or something . 
A:  Oh I just uh  <outbreath> Mmm , 
A:  I just use um our loudness - based things now as they  before there were  they were some in  in the log domain and I  I changed this to the  
A:  to the  
E:  Cu - Cube root ? 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  To  <laugh> 
A:  No , I changed this to the  to the  to the loudness thingy with the  with the how do you call it ? I 'm not sure . 
C:  Hmm . 
E:  Ah . 
A:  With the , uh  
E:  Fletcher Munson ? 
E:  No . 
A:  I 'm not sure about the term .  
E:  Oh , OK . 
A:  Uh , I 'll look it up . <laugh> And say it to you .  
E:  Yeah , alright . 
A:  Uh , OK , and  Yeah . That 's  that 's basically the  the  the thing . <outbreath> 
E:  OK . 
A:  Yeah , and I  and I tried t to normalize uh  
A:  uh the features , there 's loudness and modified loudness , um , within one channel , 
A:  because they 're , <outbreath> 
A:  yeah to  to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech . 
A:  And it works quite well . But , not always . <laugh> 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Uh - huh .  
A:  So . 
E:  OK . 
C:  Good . 
topic_description:	speech, non-speech segmentation


E:  So I guess the next thing is this uh  bleep editing . 
C:  Right . So the  
C:  The idea is that we need to have  We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting 
C:  to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want . So I 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages , 
C:  uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece  pieces and they can scroll through and read them , and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded . 
C:  And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded . 
C:  And so , uh , some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password , a single password . Each person will have a single password , user name and password . 
E:  <mike noise> 
C:  And then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it . 
C:  And that way each person only has to remember one password . 
E:  I  I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed . I mean if people have  
E:  Uh , I mean , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it . 
E:  And then  um  if I thought it was OK , I 'd say " it 's OK " . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And , I  
E:  uh  I mean it depends how this really ends up working out , but I guess my thought was that the 
E:  occasion of somebody wondering whether something was OK or not and needing to listen to it 
E:  was gonna be extremely rare . 
C:  <inbreath> Right , I mean so th th th the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that I had already done for  other reasons . 
E:  OK . 
C:  And so that  that 's a minor part of it , I just wanted some web interface so that people  you didn't actually have to send everyone the text . 
C:  So m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready , 
C:  um  I would take them , and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted , 
C:  and just uh , tell them , " here 's the web page " , 
C:  um , " you need a password " . So th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords , 
C:  and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it . 
E:  <breath> That 's  
E:  I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say <breath> 
E:  " here is a  here is  " 
E:  I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but  but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , 
E:  that said , uh , " here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ? 
E:  and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK " . And then they 'd hand it back to you . 
C:  I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide . 
C:  But certainly I wouldn't want a printout . These are big , and I would much rather be  
C:  ha be able to just sit and leaf through it . 
E:  You find it easier to go through a large  I mean how do you read books ? 
C:  Well I certainly read books by hand . But for something like this , I think it 's easier to do it on the web . 
E:  Really ? 
E:  I mean , it  
C:  Cuz you 're gonna get , you know , if I  I 'm  I 'm in a bunch of meetings and I don't wanna get a stack of these . I wanna just be able to go to  go to the web site  and visit it as I want . 
E:  Going to a web site is easy , but flipping through a hundred pounds  a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the web . 
C:  Well , I don't think it 's that much harder than , paper . 
F:  <inbreath> I have one question . So are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript ? Because I  I do think that there 's a benefit to being able to hear the 
E:  Really ? 
C:  So . 
F:  tone of voice and the   
E:  So here 's the way I was imagining it , and maybe I 'm wrong , but the way I imagined it was that 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  um , the largest set of people is gonna go " oh yeah , I didn't say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead , where 's the  where 's the release ? " 
E:  And then there 'll be a subset of people , right ?  OK there 's  I mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly . OK there 'll be a subset of people , 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . 
E:  who um , will say uh " well , yeah , I really would like to see that . " And for them , 
E:  the easiest way to flip through , if it 's a really large document , 
E:  I mean unless you 're searching . Searching , of course , should be electronic , but if you 're not  so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that , but see then we 're getting more elaborate with this thing . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  Um 
E:  if  if uh 
A:  <mouth noise> 
E:  you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document , I mean whenever I 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , I 've always ended up printing it out . 
E:  I mean , so it 's  it 's  I mean , you  you 're  you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time , you wanna figure you have a train ride , 
E:  and there 's all these situations where  where I  
E:  I mean , this is how I was imagining it , anyway . And then I figured , 
E:  that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go " hmm you know I 'm really not sure about this section here , " 
E:  and then that group would need it  
E:  S It seems like i if I 'm right in that , 
B:  <yawn> 
E:  it seems like you 're setting it up for 
E:  the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case . 
E:  So that uh , now we have to worry about privacy , we have to worry about all these passwords , for different people 
C:  Well , no fre for the most  
C:  For the most frequent case they just say  " it 's OK " and then they 're done . 
C:  And I think  almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <sniff> 
F:  The other thing too is it seems like  Go ahead . 
E:  Um , 
E:  yeah , that 's true . 
C:  I mean , cuz you don't have to visit the web page if you don't want to .  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  I guess  Yeah , I guess we don't need their signature . I guess an email OK is alright . 
C:  Oh that was another thing I  I had assumed that we didn't need their signature , that it  that an email approval was sufficient . 
C:  But  I don't actually know . 
F:  And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l I 'm not a law lawyer , but it strikes me that <inbreath> uh , we wouldn't want someone to say " oh yes , I was a little concerned about it but <inbreath> it was too hard to access " . 
F:  So I think it 's kind of nice to have this facility to listen to it . Now  in terms of like editing it by hand , I mean I think it 's  i some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part 
F:  by having a document they edited . But  but it seems to me that sometimes um , 
F:  you know i if a person had a bad day , and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like , you know it 's nice  it 's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was OK . 
C:  I mean I can certainly provide a printable version if people want it . 
E:  Um  I mean it 's also a mixture of people , I mean some people are r 
C:  Um . 
E:  do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web , and others do not . 
E:  Others would consider it  this uh  a  
C:  Yep . 
E:  a set of skills that they would have to gain . 
E:  You know ? It depends on what meetings . 
C:  Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former . 
F:  That 's true . 
B:  So far . 
C:  So . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  In the meetings so far , yeah . 
C:  Yep . 
E:  But we 're trying to expand this , right ? 
C:  Right . 
E:  So I  I  I actually think that paper is the more universal thing . 
C:  And that  
F:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
C:  Well , but if they want to print it out that 's alright . I think everyone in the meeting can access the web . 
E:  No , I think we have to be able to print it out . It 's not just if they want to print it out . I  I think  
C:  OK , so does that mean that I can't use email ? 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  Or what ? 
F:  Cuz you could send it through email you 're thinking . 
E:  I  I th well  we  there was this  
C:  Well , I don't think I  well I don't think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issues . 
F:  Good . For security ? Yeah , OK good . Good point . 
E:  No . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
C:  Um . 
F:  @ @  
C:  So giving them , you think a web site to say , " if you wanna print it out here it is " , is not sufficient ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I 
E:  Certainly for everybody who 's been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient . I 'm just wondering about  
C:  Yeah , I 'm just thinking for people that that 's not sufficient for , what  the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them . 
A:  <outbreath> 
F:  You could mail it to them . Get an a mailing address . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  Equivalent . 
A:  But  
F:  But I think it 's easier to drop in the box .  <laugh> 
A:  Just put the button on  on the web page which say " please send me the  the scripts " . 
F:  Oh that 's interesting . 
C:  That 's right . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> What um  When you display it on the web page , what are  what are you showing them ? Utterances , or  ?  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  And so can they bleep within an utterance ? 
C:  No . Whole utterances only . 
B:  Whole utterances . 
C:  And that was just convenience for my sake , that it 's uh , uh 
F:  <mike noise> 
C:  it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub - utterance level . 
C:  Because this way I can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand . 
E:  There 's another aspect to this which maybe  
F:  <mike noise> 
E:  is part of why this is bothering me . 
E:  Um , I think you 're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this . 
C:  I mean that 's why I did the web form , because for me that would be my most convenient . 
B:  Mmm . 
E:  I  I  I understand . I think that 's the bad idea . 
B:  I know where you 're going . 
C:  Oh .  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <inbreath> See because you 're gon you 're  uh  Really . You 're gonna end up with all these little patchy things , whereas really what we want to do is have the  the  the bias towards letting it go . 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  Because nob you know it  
E:  There was a  one or twi once or twice , in the re in the meetings we 've heard , where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by , 
E:  but overall people are talking about technical topics . Nobody 's gonna get hurt . Nobody 's being l libeled . 
E:  You know , this is  this  we 're  we 're covering  We 're playing the lawyer 's game , and we 're playing we 're  we 're  we 're looking for the extreme case . 
E:  If we really orient it towards that extreme case , make it really easy , we 're gonna end up encouraging a headache . 
E:  That  I think that 's   
E:  I 'm sort of psyching myself out here , I  I 'm trying to  uh  but I  I think that 's  
C:  I guess I don't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that mu much of a headache , bleeped out . So . 
E:  <inbreath> Well , it 's  but i 
B:  I think what Morgan 's saying is the easier it is , the more is gonna be bleeped . 
E:  And  and it really depends on what kind of research you 're doing . 
E:  I think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there 's a bunch of stuff in there  that 's missing from the dialogue . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  You know , it depends on the kind of research they 're doing , but it might be , uh  it might be really a  a pain . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  And , you know where it 's really gonna hurt somebody , in some way  the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about ,  
E:  we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out . But I really think we wanna make it the rare incidence . 
E:  And  and uh , I am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do , and so much fun ! 
E:  <laugh> that they 're gonna go through and bleep out stuff .  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> So much fun .  
A:  <laugh> 
E:  and they can bleep out stuff they don't like too , right from somebody else , as you say , you know , so " well I didn't like what he said . " 
F:  <laugh> <mike noise> 
C:  Well I don't see any way of avoiding that . I mean , we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  So that the  
E:  No , no , I  I  I don't  
C:  The only question is  
E:  You - you 've talked me into that , but I  I just think that we should make it harder to do .  
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  The problem is if it 's harder for them it 's also harder for me . 
F:  <inbreath> 
C:  Whereas this web interface , I just get email , it 's all formatted , it 's all ready to go and I can just insert it . 
E:  So maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it . 
F:  Well I guess  
E:  So  so  so I 'm sorry  so  
F:  Yeah . Hmm . 
E:  so  
E:  So maybe this is a s a way out of it . 
E:  You 've provided something that 's useful for you to do  
E:  handle , and useful for someone else if they need it . 
E:  But 
C:  Well  
E:  I think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh , they get access to this if they really need it . 
B:  So you 're saying the  the sequence would be more like 
B:  first Adam goes to the contact lists , contacts them via whatever their preferred method is , to see if they want to review the meeting . 
E:  Right . 
B:  And then if they don't , you 're done . If they do , then he provides them access to the  the web site . 
E:  W w 
C:  Well , to some extent I have to do that anyway because as I said we have to distribute passwords . 
B:  Or  a printed - out form . 
E:  There 's  there  
E:  y 
C:  So , 
E:  but you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what I 'm saying . 
C:  Well , but  
E:  So  
B:  Only if they want it . 
C:  what I 'm saying is that I can't just email them the password because that 's not secure . 
E:  No , no , no . But you aren't necessarily giving them  
C:  So they have to call me and ask . 
E:  Right . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  But  we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at all . 
C:  Well , we do because of privacy . We can't just make it openly available on the web . 
F:  <inbreath> Mm - hmm . 
E:  No , no . You 're missing the point . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  We 're  We 're trying i 
E:  We 're trying to make it less of an obvious just l l l l 
E:  uh fall off a log , to do this . 
F:  Not everyone gets a password , 
F:  unless they ask for it . Yeah . 
E:  Right ? 
E:  So th so what I would see , is that 
E:  first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the  not just for fun , 
E:  OK ? but to  to check this 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  for uh things that they 're worried about having said or if they 're willing to just send an approval of it , at  from their memory . 
E:  Um  and , uh , and we should think carefully actually we should review  go through how that 's worded , OK ? 
E:  Then , if someone uh  wants to review it , 
E:  uh , and I know you don't like this , but I 'm offering this as a suggestion , is that  is that we then give them a print out . 
E:  And then if they say that " I have a potential problem with these things , " then , 
E:  you  you say " OK well you might wanna hear this in context to s think if you need that , " you issue them a password , i in the  
C:  But the  the problem with what you 're suggesting is it 's not just inconvenient for them , it 's inconvenient for me . 
C:  Because that means multiple contacts every time  for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything . 
C:  I would much prefer to have all be automatic , they visit the web site if they want to . Obviously they don't have to . 
E:  I know you 'd prefer it , but the proble we have  there 's a problem with it . 
C:  Yeah . So I think you 're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and I just don't think that 's gonna happen . 
F:  <inbreath> I 'm also concerned about the spirit of the  of the informed consent thing . Cuz I think if they feel 
F:  that uh , it 's  I th I th You know , if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect , 
F:  then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that , um , 
F:  but  but they might be able to argue " oh well it was cumbersome , and I was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down " . So it could that the burden would come back onto us . So I 'm a little bit worried about uh , making it harder for them , from the legal standpoint . 
E:  <inbreath> Well you can go too far in that direction , and you need to find somewhere between I think , because  
F:  Yeah . 
C:  It seems to me that sending them email , 
E:  Uh - huh . 
C:  saying " if you have an O - OK reply to this email and say OK , 
C:  If you have a problem with it contact me and I 'll give you a password " , 
C:  seems like is a perfectly , reasonable compromise . And if they want a printout they can print it out themselves . 
F:  <inbreath> Or we could print it up for them , I mean we could offer that  but  but there 's uh , another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form , 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  um , my impression is that they  that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript . And  and I ha I don't know that there 's a chance of really skipping that stage . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  I mean I  I thought that you were  Maybe I misinterpreted what you said but it 's  
E:  <inbreath> Having access to it doesn't necessarily mean , that  having it right ? It just means they have the right to have it . 
E:  <mike noise> 
C:  So I guess I probably should at the minimum , 
C:  think about how to present it in a printed form . 
C:  I 'm not really sure what 's best with that . The problem is a lot of them are really short , 
F:  <inbreath> Well   
C:  and so I don't necessarily wanna do one per line . 
F:  <inbreath> Well I s 
C:  But I don't know how else to do it . 
F:  I also have this  I  I think it 's nice you have it uh , viewab her  hearable on the  on the web for those who might wonder about 
F:  um , the non nonverbal side , I mean I  I agree that our bias should be as  as expressed here , and  but 
F:  I  I think it 's nice that a person could check . Cuz sometimes you know you  the words on a  on the page , come out soun sounding different in terms of the  social dynamics if they hear it . And I realize we shouldn't emphasize that people  you know , shouldn't borrow trouble . What it comes down to but  
C:  Hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <mike noise> 
E:  <mike noise> 
C:  Yeah I think actually  my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is uh 
E:  <mike noise> 
C:  not good . 
C:  You know , if  if there are lots of mumbles and parentheses and things like that . 
F:  <inbreath> Oh , you know , or what if there was an error in the transcript that didn't get detected and there was a whole uh  i segment a against some  <laugh> personal <laugh> i th 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Right . 
C:  That was all mumbled ? I think Microsoft is @ @  
A:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah exactly  @ @ <inbreath> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Oh , <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  Sorry transcribers .  
F:  Or  or even  <inbreath> or even  there was a  a line you know about how 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  " hmm - mmm - mmm  Bill Gates duh - duh - duh - duh . "  
F:  but  but it was all  the words were all visible , but they didn't end up i some there was a slip in the transcript .  
C:  @ @  
A:  Oh , God . 
C:  They 're gonna hate this meeting . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah that 's true .  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Actually Liz will like it . You know , but .  
E:  Liz will like it . We had a pretty strong disagreement going there . Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Yep , yep , that 's right .  
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So I don't know . I mean , I  I guess we 're assuming that the transcript is a close enough approximation and that  that my double checking will be  so close to absolutely perfect that it  that nothing will slip by . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  But it  the  some something might sometime , and they  uh  if  if it 's something that they said , they might  
E:  i i 
E:  I mean , you might be very accurate in putting down what they actually said , 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  but , when they hear it , themselves , they may hear something different because they know what they meant . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> <mike noise> <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  I don't know how to notate that . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , that 's right . Yeah that 's right .  <laugh> 
B:  Sarcasm , how do you  how do you indicate sarcasm ? 
E:  No , I 'm serious . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  So  the  so  i the  so we might  we might get some feedback from people that such - and - such was , 
E:  you know , not  not really what I said . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well that would be good to get , definitely . 
E:  Yeah , but , 
E:  Yeah , sure . 
C:  Just for corrections . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  So um , in terms of password distribution , I think phone is really the only way to do it , phone and in person . Or mail , physical mail . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Or if for leave it on their voice mail . 
B:  Any sub - word level thing . @ @ 
C:  Any sub - wor Yeah , OK .  
C:  I mean you could do it with PGP or things like that but it 's too complex . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  You know I just realized something , which is of  e th this question about the  uh the possible mismatch of  
F:  I mean i well , and actually also the lawyer saying that um , we shouldn't really have them  have the people 
F:  believing that they will be cleared by our checks . You know ? 
F:  I mean . So it 's like i in a way it 's  it 's nice to have the responsibility still on them to 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  listen to the tape and  and hear the transcript , to have that be the  
E:  <inbreath> Well yeah , but you can't dep 
E:  I mean , 
E:  most people will not wanna take the time to do that , though . 
F:  Yeah , OK , fair enough . 
F:  And they 're s they 're absorbing the responsibility themselves . So it 's not  it 's not um  Yeah , good . 
E:  And they  they have to  
E:  <inbreath> But I mean if you were at a meeting , and  and you  you don't think , at least , that you said anything funny and the meeting was about , you know , some  some funny thing about semantics or something , or uh   
C:  You probably won't listen to it .  
E:  Yeah .  
F:  It is true that tec that the content is technical , I  and so i 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  and we 're not having these discussions which  
F:  I  I mean , when I listen to these things , I don't find things that are questionable , 
E:  Yeah . You would think it would be rare , I mean we 're not talking about the energy crisis or something , people have  
F:  in other people 's speech or in my own . 
F:  Just  
F:  It should be very rare . 
F:  Yeah . Yeah , OK . 
C:  How about them energy crises . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	editing bleeps, posting to webpage versus printout


B:  Are  are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking ? 
C:  Yes . 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  I also  mm - hmm .  
C:  If someone feels strongly enough about it , 
C:  then I  I  I think they should be allowed to do that . 
B:  So that means other people are editing what you say ? 
E:  Uh  
C:  Yeah . 
E:  I don't know about that . 
B:  I don't know if I like that . <laugh> 
C:  Well , the only other choice is that the person would say " no , don't distribute this meeting at all " , and I would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say " don't distribute it at all " . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  But th 
E:  what they signed in the consent form , 
E:  was something that said you can use my voice . 
C:  Well , but if  
E:  Right ? 
C:  if someone is having a conversation , and you only bleep out one side of it , that 's not sufficient .  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , but that 's our decision then . Right ? 
C:  Um , I don't think so . 
F:  <inbreath> 
E:  I think it is . 
C:  I mean , because if I object to the conversation . If I say 
E:  <unintended whistle sound> 
C:  " we were having a conversation , and I consider that conversation private , " 
C:  and I consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , I wanna be able to bleep out your side . 
F:  The  I agree that the consent forms were  uh , I cons agree with what Adam 's saying , that <inbreath> um , 
F:  the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or didn't say them . 
E:  I see . 
E:  OK , well , if that 's what it said . 
topic_description:	editing others' speech


C:  Having it . Well the in  the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it , so . 
F:  Giving it to them . OK . 
F:  Alright . Fine . OK . Fair enough . 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Sh - sh well I could  I 'm closer . I could  
C:  D you want me to grab one ? 
C:  Yeah , but you 're wired aren't you ? 
F:  Yeah . That is true . 
E:  Um . 
E:  <inbreath> Yeah , I mean I don't wanna fool them , 
F:  I don't know  
E:  I just meant that e every  ev any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a  a bias that is presented , right ? of  and  
F:  Oh yeah yeah  oh I know . 
F:  Yeah that 's true . Yeah . 
C:  " If you agree to participate you 'll have the opportunity to have anything ex anything excised , which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . "  
E:  Yeah . 
C:  " Once a transcript is available we will ask your permission to include the data in the corpus for the r larger research community . There again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you 'd prefer to have excised from the database , and they will m be removed both from the transcript and the recording . "  <outbreath> 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Well that 's more open than I realized . 
C:  Well , I mean it  
E:  <inbreath> I  
C:  The one question is definitely clear with anything as opposed to just what you said . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , uh no that  it  tha that 's right . 
F:  Tha - that 's true . That 's more severe , 
F:  but the next one says the transcript will be around . And it doesn't  really say we 'll send it to you , or wi it 'll be available for you on the web , or anything . 
B:  I think it probably leaves it open how we get it to them . 
E:  I I  
F:  At least it more often . Yeah . 
F:  It means also we don't have to g 
F:  To give it to them . I mean like  like Morgan was saying they  they  
C:  They just have to make sure that it is available to them . 
F:  It 's available to them if they ask for it . 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  Yeah , OK , so . wh um  I think I have an idea that may be sat may satisfy both you and me in this which is , 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  um , it 's a  it  we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded . 
E:  So I  I just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre it gives very , I mean nothing hidden , v very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data . 
C:  Right . 
E:  That  that we really would rather it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out , that it would be better for , um , our , uh , field 
F:  Good . 
E:  if that is the case . But if you really think something is gonna   
E:  And I don't think there 's anything in the legal aspects that  that is hurt by our expressing that bias . 
F:  Great . Great , great . Yeah . I agree . 
E:  And then  then my concern about  which  you know you might be right , it may be it was just paranoia on my part , uh but people just  
A:  <laugh> 
E:  See I 'm @ @ worried about this interface so much fun <laugh> that people start bleeping stuff out  
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> just as  just because they can . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  It 's just a check box next to the text , it 's not any fun at all . <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Well I don't know . I kind of had fun when you played me something that was bleeped out . You know .  I - 
C:  <laugh> Well , but they won't get that feedback . 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  All  no because it doesn't automatically bleep it at the time . It just sends me  
E:  Oh they won't ? 
E:  Oh good . So you haven't made it so much fun . 
C:  Right .  
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Oh good . OK , <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  It just sends me the time intervals . And then at some point I 'll incorporate them all and put bleeps . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  I mean I don't wanna have t ha do that yet until we actually release the data because um , then we have to have two copies of every meeting and we 're already short on disk space . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  So I  I wanna  I  just keep the times until we actually wanna release the data and then we bleep it . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Alright , so I think  
E:  Yeah so if we have if  i 
E:  Again let 's you know , sort of 
E:  circulate the  the wording on each of these things and get it right , but  
C:  Well since you seem to feel heart uh , strongest about it , would you like to do the first pass ? <laugh> 
E:  but  
E:  OK . 
E:  Uh , fair enough . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> Al - 
E:  Turn about is fair play , <laugh> Sorry . 
F:  Also it ther there is this other question , the legal question that  that Adam 's raised , uh about whether we need a concrete signature , or email c i suffices or whatever and I don't know how that works . i There 's something down there about " if you agree to  " 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  <mike noise> 
E:  I 'm  I 'm  I 'm  I thought  I  I thought about it with one of my background processes and I  uh it 's  uh it 's uh , it 's fine to do the email . 
C:  I don't think so . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Ah . 
F:  Fine . Good . OK . 
E:  OK .  
C:  Yeah because thi th they 're signing here that they 're agreeing to the paragraph which says 
C:  " you 'll be given an opportunity . " 
E:  Yeah . And  
F:  <laugh> 
C:  And so I don't think they need another signature . 
E:  Well and furthermore I  it 's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that I do with people on contracts and so forth that  that uh if it 's  if it 's that sort of thing where you 're 
E:  you 're saying uh " OK I agree , we want eighty hours of this person at such - and - such amount , and I agree that 's OK , " 
E:  uh if it 's a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it 's often done in email now so it 's  it 's OK . 
C:  Right . 
F:  Great . 
E:  Um . 
topic_description:	consent form


E:  I think we 're uh  
C:  Done ?  
E:  Kind of done . Actually , I was gonna  
E:  Di - Did you have anything n that 's going on , or  
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Not really . No . Um , <outbreath> my project is going along but um , I 'm really just here to um fill the project uh  the overall progress . <inbreath> 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  I don't really have anything specific to  to talk about . 
E:  That 's fine . 
E:  <inbreath> I just didn't wanna go by you , if you had something . <inbreath> 
D:  Oh , OK . 
C:  Hmm .  
E:  You don't have anything to say . 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  j I don't know . @ @

F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  Shall we do digits ? 
E:  Oh yeah . 
D:  It um  
C:  Um , oh by the way I did find a bunch  Uh , we should count out how many more digits to forms do we have back there ? 
E:  <mike noise> 
B:  There were quite a few . 
C:  That 's what I thought . I f I was going through them all and I found actually a lot filed in with them , 
B:  Uh . 
C:  that were blanks , that no one had actually read .  And so we still have more than I thought we did . So , we have a few more digits before we 're done . 
E:  <mike noise> 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Oh good . 
C:  Oops .  
B:  You know having this headset reminds me of like working at Burger King or something . <laugh> No I never did . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> I 'd like a burger with that , do you want fries with that ? 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Burger King  <laugh> 
F:  Oh , did you do that ? 
E:  <laugh> Wow . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> But I feel like I could now .
