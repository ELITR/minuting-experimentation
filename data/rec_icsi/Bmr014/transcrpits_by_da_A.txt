A:  Burger King 
A:  MR eleven . 
A:  Spikes ? 
A:  Touching . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 

A:  No , no . 
A:  He was in . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , he was in  s 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I think he has a class . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I actually gave 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  The channel u thing ? 
A:  Oh , it 's just uh , I ran the recognizer  uh , the   speech - nonspeech detector on different channels 
A:  and , it 's just in uh  in this new multi - channel format and output , 
A:  and I just gave one  one meeting to  to Liz who wanted to  to try it for  for the recognizer 
A:  as uh , apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech , which took too much memory or whatever , 
A:  and so  she  she will try that I think 
A:  and  
A:  I 'm  I 'm working on it . 
A:  So , I hope  
A:  No . 
A:  Uh , I  mmm , use some  some different features but not  not  
A:  The basic thing is this HMM base . 
A:  There is some , uh as the energy is normalized across channels 
A:  yeah . 
A:  So . 
A:  But basically that 's one of the main changes . 
A:  Oh I just uh  <outbreath> Mmm , I just use um our loudness - based things 
A:  now as they  
A:  before there were  they were some in  in the log domain and I  I changed this to the  to the  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  To  
A:  No , I changed this to the  to the  to the loudness thingy with the  with the 
A:  how do you call it ? 
A:  I 'm not sure . 
A:  With the , uh  
A:  I 'm not sure about the term . 
A:  Uh , I 'll look it up . 
A:  And say it to you . 
A:  Uh , OK , and  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  That 's  that 's basically the  the  the thing . 
A:  Yeah , and I  and I tried t to normalize uh  uh the features , there 's loudness and modified loudness , um , within one channel , 
A:  because they 're , <outbreath> yeah to  to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech . 
A:  And it works quite well . 
A:  But , not always . 
A:  So . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah .
