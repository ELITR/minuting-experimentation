E:  and I  I want to manipulate the  the waveform , then . 
E:  Yeah . <laugh> <laugh> <laugh> <laugh-sputter> <laugh> Yeah . We did . 
E:  I think it 's  
E:  Is it the same set as  the alignments ? 
E:  I think it 's five Meeting Recorder meetings . 
E:  Oops . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Nope . 
E:  I was wondering  if they were  in . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Something w went wrong . 
E:  Nothing happened . 
E:  No ? Yeah . 
E:  Synthesizers ? 
E:  Yeah , yeah . I was doing something for  the SmartKom data collectioners . 
E:  Robert has taken his laptop t back to Germany so we needed a new synthesis machine . 
E:  And we have now a SUN workstation in the library , which does the synthesis 
E:  and the Festival speech s s system is running on 
E:  His laptop where , uh  which we used for the SmartKom data collection , for the synthesis . 
E:  And so he took it to Germany 
E:  and  so we couldn't do any data collection . 
E:  Uh  
E:  No . He 's just gone to a SmartKom workshop . 
E:  And so , we have now the SUN in the library which can do that . 
E:  And I looked into the ts F - zero thing and talked to  to Liz , 
E:  and it seems that it 's quite s what she wants , 
E:  but we 'll <breath> have to think about the  the energy thing  
E:  uh , what we wanna do . 
E:  For w for Festival ? 
E:  Uh , you can just  use it from the  
E:  Yeah . Basically from the command line , 
E:  and the defining the phones , whatever you want to have synthesized , 
E:  and <breath> give the F - zero targets , 
E:  and then ts get  gives out a  a waveform , 
E:  and I  I want to manipulate the  the waveform , then .
