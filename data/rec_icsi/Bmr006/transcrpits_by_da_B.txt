B:  OK , I 'm gonna go off . 
B:  OK , 
B:  now we 're on and it seems to be working . 
B:  So , I mean  
B:  I don't know what it is . 
B:  But all  all I know is that it seems like every time I am up here after a meeting , and I start it , it works fine . 
B:  And if I 'm up here and I start it and we 're all sitting here waiting to have a meeting , it gives me that error message 
B:  and I have not yet sat down with  been able to get that error message in a point where I can sit down and find out where it 's occurring in the code . 
B:  Yep , we will . 
B:  One of these days . 
B:  No . 
B:  And what 's he interested in , specifically ? 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Great . 
B:  Right . 
B:  One offs ? 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Yeah , we 're  we 're hoping that they 'll let us start recording regularly . 
B:  So . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting . 
B:  Yeah , we  we 've only had three . 
B:  So . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Um  
B:  Right . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah , just talking about . 
B:  We all had the same thought . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Well , I think that , um  I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English . 
B:  And  and I think if it 's a pre - existing meeting and it 's held in English ,  I  I think it 's probably OK if a few of the people don't have uh , g particularly good English skills . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Well , not to mention the fact that I would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen , probably even an anyone under twenty - one . 
B:  So . 
B:  What 's that ? 
B:  Well , age - ist .  The " eighteen " is because of the consent form . 
B:  We 'd hafta get  find their parent to sign for them . 
B:  So . 
B:  I think we 'd need a real motivated partner to do that . 
B:  We 'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Well , I know that space is really scarce on  at least in CS . 
B:  You know , to  to actually find a room that we could use regularly might actually be very difficult . 
B:  That 's true . 
B:  True . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Yeah , I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting . 
B:  another type of meeting . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah , but  
B:  I think if we  if we wanna just record with the tabletop microphones , that 's easy . 
B:  Right ? 
B:  That 's very easy , 
B:  but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting . 
B:  And you don't really need the close microphone , you mean . 
B:  Ye - Yeah . Yep . 
B:  Tape recorder . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Not enough for others , right . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  For some of it . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Special ? 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Here . 
B:  Yeah , I thought so too . 
B:  Well , I was thinking , lunch after . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Um , I had a  I spoke with some people up at Haas Business School who volunteered . 
B:  Should I pursue that ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  So . 
B:  They  they originally  They 've decided not to do  go into speech . 
B:  So I 'm not sure whether they 'll still be so willing to volunteer , 
B:  but I 'll send an email and ask . 
B:  I 'll tell them about the free lunch . 
B:  And they 'll say there 's no such thing . 
B:  So . 
B:  Right . 
B:  That 's alright . 
B:  No , the they  they 're very weird . 
B:  The problem with engineers is " beep . " 
B:  Yep . Let them have their meeting . 
B:  Mmm . Of the meeting ? 
B:  It 'd be fun . 
B:  I think it would just be fun , you know , if nothing else , you know . 
B:  It 's a novelty item . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Oh , yeah . 
B:  I mean , anyone can have the transcripts . So . I thought we could point that out . 
B:  Yeah , that 's right . 
B:  That 's a good point . 
B:  Right , it can't be the internal one . 
B:  That 's right . 
B:  Yeah , that 's true . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK , see you . 
B:  No . 
B:  Bye . 
B:  We are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough sp room to record meetings . 
B:  So I uh did a bunch of archiving , and still doing a bunch of archiving , 
B:  I  I 'm in the midst of doing the P - files from uh , <inbreath> Broadcast News . 
B:  and it took eleven hours  <inbreath> to do  to uh copy it . 
B:  And it 'll take another eleven to do the clone . 
B:  Well , it 's Abbott . 
B:  It 's Abbott , so it just  But it 's  it 's a lot of data . 
B:  Tape . 
B:  I did an archive . 
B:  So I 'm archiving it , and then I 'm gonna delete the files . 
B:  So that will give us ten gigabytes of free space . 
B:  And  and  
B:  Yep . 
B:  And so one That  that will be done , like , in about two hours . 
B:  And so uh , <inbreath> at that point we 'll be able to record five more meetings . 
B:  So . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Well , especially because I 'm generating a clone , also . 
B:  So . And that takes a while . 
B:  Two copies . 
B:  One offsite , one onsite . 
B:  No , the  the  these are the P - files from Broadcast News , which are regeneratable  regeneratable 
B:  um , if we really need to , but we had a lot of them . And  for the full , uh , hundred forty hour sets . 
B:  And so they  they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of them or something . 
B:  Or maybe six . 
B:  The SUN , ha uh , takes more disks than the Andatico one did . 
B:  The SUN rack takes   Th - One took four and one took six , or maybe it was eight and twelve . Whatever it was , it was ,  you know , fifty percent more . 
B:  Well , what happened is that we  we bought all our racks and disks from Andatico for years , according to Dave , 
B:  and Andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices . 
B:  And so , uh , we 're looking into other vendors . 
B:  " We "  By " we " of course I mean Dave . 
B:  So . 
B:  SPINE . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  So , so , uh , we have space on the current disk right now , where Meeting Recorder is , 
B:  and that 's probably enough for about four meetings . 
B:  So . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  No , no , 
B:  well , it 's wherever the Meeting Recorder currently is . 
B:  I think it 's DI . 
B:  I don't remember . 
B:  Th - I think it 's DC - It 's whatever that one is . 
B:  I just don't remember , it might be DC . 
B:  And that has enough for about four more meetings right now . 
B:  Yeah , I mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand . 
B:  Um , someone deleted something somewhere . 
B:  And so we have some room again . 
B:  And then with Broadcast News , that 's five or six more meetings , 
B:  so , you know , we have a couple weeks . 
B:  Uh , so , yeah , I think  I think we 're OK , until we get the new disk . 
B:  We should put it onto the Broadcast News one . 
B:  That 's probably the best thing to do . And that way we consolidate Meeting Recorder onto one disk  rather than spreading them out . 
B:  No . 
B:  I mean , I can tell you , I just don't know off the top of my head . 
B:  But , so we could ' jus just do that at the end of today , once the archive is complete , and I 've verified it . 
B:  Cuz that 'll give us plenty of disk . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I 've seen it already . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Throughout the meeting . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Oh , you did that by hand ? 
B:  Can I see that ? 
B:  Can I get a copy ? 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yes , absolutely . 
B:  And so are you planning to do that or have you done that already ? 
B:  Have you done that or are you planning to do that ? 
B:  OK . 
B:  Darn ! 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah , fans . 
B:  So  so you intend to hand - mark those and exclude them ? 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Whew ! 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  I should 've  got the digital camera . 
B:  Oh well . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Nonspeech . 
B:  Well , training , and validation . Sure . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah , but this is what you 're starting with . 
B:  One or two or more . 
B:  Yeah , yeah , that 's what he was saying before . 
B:  Yeah , so that 's what he was saying before , is that he excluded those . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  With the fan . 
B:  Right . So  Fine . Go on . 
B:  Right . 
B:  " Tone " , whatever . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Bad . 
B:  Right . 
B:  But , you know , as a feature , it might be OK . 
B:  So , we don't know . 
B:  Supervised clustering . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  What sort of classifier ar ? 
B:  Unimodal ? 
B:  So is it just one cluster per  
B:  Right . 
B:  Right , you can't analyse it . 
B:  Well , using something simpler first I think is probably fine . 
B:  Decision tree . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Deltas , 
B:  yeah . So . 
B:  Context window ? 
B:  Yep . 
B:  So , some sort of  
B:  That 's  
B:  I 'm  I 'm  I 'm sorry , I didn't understand you  what you said . 
B:  What  what model ? 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Features . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Features ? 
B:  With  
B:  Right . Mixed . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah , I think that that 's a good way to start . 
B:  But . 
B:  It would be interesting in itself to see . 
B:  Well , I think that would be an interesting result . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . But it I think it would be interesting to try a couple with both . 
B:  Because it  I think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed , and  And don't  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah , they 're totally hidden . 
B:  Are probably better , yep . 
B:  Well , if you used the array , rather than the signal from just one . 
B:  But that 's  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah , we hav need to put it on a little turntable , 
B:  and  
B:  But it 's another source of information . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Cross - co cross - correlation . 
B:  Subtract them . 
B:  And you find  They get peaks . 
B:  And if there are multiple people talking , you 'll see two peaks . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Or  or even if , like , if people were sitting right across from each other , you couldn't tell the difference either . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Must do .  Yeah . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  But  
B:  And I think Dan is still working on it . 
B:  So . He actually  he wrote me about it a little bit , 
B:  so . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Then they 're much broader . 
B:  Yeah , we can do whatever we want . 
B:  Whatever you 're interested in . 
B:  Well  
B:  Yep . 
B:  Big micro @ @ arrays . 
B:  Very finely . 
B:  Oh , I saw one that was like a hundred microphones , a ten by ten array . 
B:  And they had very precision . 
B:  Right . 
B:  It was all in software and they  and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it . 
B:  It was  yeah , it was interesting . 
B:  But I think  
B:  Yep . 
B:  That 's on my web pages . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Though  
B:  All sorts of interesting things you can do with that , 
B:  I mean , not only can you do microphone arrays , but you can do all sorts of um multi - band as well . 
B:  So it 's  it would be neat . 
B:  But  
B:  I think  
B:  in terms of  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  In terms of the research  th research , it 's really  it 's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do . 
B:  So if  if Jose is interested in that , that 's great . 
B:  But if  if he 's not , that 's great too . 
B:  Catch some tea ? 
B:  Um . 
B:  Well , I had a couple things that I did wanna bring out . 
B:  One is , do we need to sign new  these again ? 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Yeah , I  I should 've checked with Jane first , but the ch the form has changed . 
B:  So we may wanna have everyone sign the new form . 
B:  Um , I had some things I wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff I 'm doing . 
B:  But , if we 're in a hurry , we can put that off . 
B:  Um and then also anonymity , how we want to anonymize the data . 
B:  Uh . 
B:  No - well , we don't have to do digits . 
B:  OK , go ahead , Jane . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Alright . 
B:  We 're  we 're just  We 're getting enough data now that I 'd sort of like to do it now , before I get overwhelmed with  once we decide how to do it 
B:  going and dealing with it . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  No , because then that would give you a mapping , and you don't wanna have a mapping . 
B:  No . 
B:  Because that would give you a mapping between the speaker 's real name and the tag we 're using , and we don't want  
B:  OK . 
B:  We don't  we wanna  we ha we want the transcript to be " Roger " . 
B:  Because if we made the  the transcript be the tag that we 're using for Roger , someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between the anonymized name and the real name , and we wanna avoid that . 
B:  Oh . 
B:  Ugh ! 
B:  That 's a good point . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Ugh ! 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 

B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , shoot ! 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Shoot ! 
B:  I  I 'm thinking too much . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Well , I would sug I  I  don't wanna change the names in the transcript , 
B:  but that 's because I 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse , and so I think that 's a really good point . 
B:  You 're right , this is going to require more thought . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  How will we  how would the person who 's doing the transcript even know who they 're talking about ? 
B:  Do you know what I 'm saying ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I mean , so so  how is that information gonna get labeled anyway ? 
B:  I mean , so if I 'm saying in a meeting , " oh and Bob , by the way , wanted  wanted to do so - and - so " , 
B:  if you 're doing  
B:  Yeah , @ @ they 're just gonna write " Bob " . 
B:  And so . If you 're  if you 're doing discourse analysis , 
B:  Yeah , really . 
B:  Well , the current one they don't do speaker identity . 
B:  because in NaturallySpeaking , or , excuse me , in ViaVoice , it 's only one person . 
B:  and so in their current conventions there are no multiple speaker conventions . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  y Yu - Ching . 
B:  Yeah we  we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close - talking mikes . 
B:  So . But I mean that doesn't  This doesn't answer the  the question . 
B:  The p It 's a good point , " which  what do you do for discourse tracking ? " 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  For  for acoustics you don't but for discourse you do . 
B:  Ugh ,  that 's a problem . 
B:  if you wanted to anonymize . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah , darn ! 
B:  I mean , what I was gonna say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names . 
B:  but then , again that kills your discourse analysis . 
B:  Ugh ! 
B:  Well , but that but that  as I said , that  that  that works great for the acoustics , but it  it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse . 
B:  Because you don't have a map of who 's talking versus  their  name that they 're being referred to . 
B:  Sure but , h then you have to know that Jose is speaker - one and  
B:  Someone who 's doing discourse would wanna do that . 
B:  And that violates our privacy . 
B:  And that violates our privacy issue . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Making some decisions ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  For the public one . 
B:  You know , what we could do also is have more than one version of release . 
B:  One that 's public and one  one that requires licensing . 
B:  And so the licensed one would  w we could  it would be a sticky limitation . 
B:  You know , like  
B:  Well , we can talk about that later . 
B:  Well , depending on how much editing we do , you might be able to  still have it useful . 
B:  because for discourse you don't need the audio . 
B:  Right ? 
B:  So you could bleep out the names in the audio . 
B:  and use the anonymized one through the transcript . 
B:  But , n excuse me , but you could bleep out just the names . 
B:  Right . 
B:  But in the transcript , you could say , everywhere they said " Jose " that you could replace it with " speaker - seven " . 
B:  And then it wouldn't meet  match the audio anymore . 
B:  But it would be still useful for the  
B:  But they  
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah , OK , good point . 
B:  I didn't think  when I wrote you that email I wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms , but I guess it is . 
B:  Discourse . 
B:  Yeah , ab absolutely . 
B:  Oh , yeah , sure . 
B:  Did you read the paper on Eurospeech ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables ? 
B:  They were di they they had the utterances . 
B:  and they would extract out the syllables and they would play them backwards . 
B:  Everything was in the same order , but they were  the individual syll  syllables were played backwards . 
B:  And you could listen to it ,  and it would sound the same . 
B:  People had no difficulty in interpreting it . 
B:  So what we need is something that 's the reverse , that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people can't understand it . 
B:  Oh right . The speech recognizer 's totally symmetric , isn't it . 
B:  Ah , anyway . 
B:  Uh  OK , we 'll quickly do digits . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK , go off here . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Well , except , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  We have the transcript . 
B:  We have the actual numbers they 're reading , so we 're not necessarily depending on that . 
B:  OK , I 'm gonna go off .
