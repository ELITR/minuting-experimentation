D:  So . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So uh  so the uh , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which I think is a good idea is that um , we do the digit recordings at the end . 
D:  And that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's uh meeting , and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time , uh , then they can run off . 
D:  It 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer uh , sets of digits , 
D:  but um , I think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , um , if someone 's on strict time uh , less . 
D:  So , I th I think  I think we should start doing that . 
D:  Um , so , uh , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , maybe we should bring that up , about uh , the nature of the data that we are collecting . 
D:  uh @ @ that uh , we should have a fair amount of data that is um , collected for the same meeting , so that we can , 
D:  uh  
D:  I don't know . 
D:  Wh - what  what were some of the points again about that ? 
D:  Is it  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  S So  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Now , let  l l let me just give you the other side to that 
D:  cuz I ca because I  I don't disagree with that , 
D:  but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too . 
D:  Uh , for other kinds of research , particularly the acoustic oriented research , I actually feel the opposite need . 
D:  I 'd like to have lots of different people . 
D:  As many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have uh too few people from my point of view . 
D:  I 'd like to have many different speakers . 
D:  So , um I think I would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and  and uh , 
D:  I mean , sure , if we can get more from them , fine , 
D:  but if we only get one or two from each group , that still could be useful acoustically just because we 'd have close and distant microphones with different people . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Well , you want to i 
D:  Well , OK , uh , first place , I  I  I don't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another , 
D:  I think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz I  I think that 's what we 're investigating , 
D:  so 
D:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  So I was  I was thinking more in terms of talking to professors uh , and  and  and uh , senior uh , uh , d and uh , doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their  hold their meeting down here . 
D:  Uh , that 's the first point . 
D:  The second point is 
D:  um 
D:  I think that for some time now , going back through BeRP I think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents and I th I think that  
D:  Oh , OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh ! 
D:  You 're not talking about foreign language at all . 
D:  You 're just talking about  
D:  Yeah , then we 're completely gone . 
D:  It 's  <laugh> The  the habits are already burnt in . 
D:  But  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  I guess  I maybe  
D:  Hmm . 
D:  I 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group . 
D:  because  because they  most  the network group is almost entirely Germans and Spaniards . 
D:  I see . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK , well , i i let 's  let 's see what we can get . 
D:  I mean , it  it  I think that if we 're aiming at  at uh , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together , and it 's from the Berkeley campus , probably most of it will be OK , 
D:  but  
D:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Oh , you age - ist ! 
D:  Yes . 
D:  They 're  they 're  yeah , they 're d they 're uh  assessing whether they should do that or y do something else , hopefully over the next few weeks . 
D:  Well , the other thing  Yeah , I mean the other thing that I was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around . 
D:  Uh . 
D:  But . Um , and  
D:  Uh  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , maybe John would let us put it into the phonology lab or something . 
D:  You know . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Actually , that 's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that 's maybe worth repeating . 
D:  We realized that , um , when we were talking about this that , OK , there 's these different things that we want to do with it . 
D:  So , um , it 's true that we wanna be selective in some ways , uh , the way that you were speaking about with , uh , not having an interlingua and uh , these other issues . 
D:  But on the other hand , it 's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it . 
D:  So , a a as per the example that we wanna have a fair amount that 's done with a small n recorded with a small , uh , typ number of types of meetings 
D:  But we can also have another part that 's , uh , just one or two meetings of each of a  of a range of them 
D:  and that 's OK too . 
D:  Uh , i We realized in discussion that the other thing is , what about this business of distant and close microphones ? 
D:  I mean , we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way , 
D:  that 's why we did it . 
D:  But  what about  For th for these issues of summarization , a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone . 
D:  You actually don't . 
D:  You d You don't ne it doesn't  you just need some microphone , somewhere . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  You need some microphone , 
D:  but I mean  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . So that  
D:  But I think that  I 'm raising that cuz I think it 's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about , " Well , gee , we have this really complicated setup to do , " well maybe you don't . 
D:  Maybe if  if  If really all you want is to have a  a  a recording that 's good enough to get a  <inbreath> uh , a transcription from later , you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording . 
D:  I mean , we  we could have a fairly  We could just get a DAT machine and  
D:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I  I  I  I  I agree . 
D:  Uh but I  I think that the uh <inbreath> i We can't really underestimate the difficulty  shouldn't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up . 
D:  And so ,  uh it took quite a while to get that together and to say , " Oh , we 'll just do it up there , "  
D:  If you 're talking about something simple , where you throw away a lot of these dimensions , then you can do that right away . 
D:  Talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here , 
D:  it won't happen quickly , it won't be easy , and there 's all sorts of issues about th you know <inbreath> keeping the equipment safe , or else hauling it around , and all sorts of o 
D:  I think the first priority should be to pry  to get  try to get people to come here . 
D:  We 're set up for it . 
D:  The room is  is really , uh , underused . 
D:  Uh  
D:  Free lunch is good . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , they have to do their digits or they don't  get  they don't  get their food . 
D:  Yeah 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Tell them about the free lunch . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  The  the  <laugh> The oth the other h 
D:  Uh , 
D:  " beep " 
D:  Uh , the  the  
D:  They make funny sounds . 
D:  The o the o the other  The other thing is , uh , that we  we talked about is give to them  uh , burn an extra CD - ROM . 
D:  and give them  So if they want a  <noise> basically and audio record of their  
D:  Oh . 
D:  If you 're having some planning meeting of some sort and uh you 'd like  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  But it als It  it  it also I think builds up towards the goal . 
D:  We 're saying , " Look , you know , you 're gonna get this . 
D:  Is - is isn't that neat . 
D:  Then you 're gonna go home with it . 
D:  It 's actually p It 's probably gonna be pretty useless to you , 
D:  but you 'll ge appreciate , you know , where it 's useful and where it 's useless , 
D:  and then , we 're gonna move this technology , so it 'll become useful . " 
D:  So . 
D:  Oh yeah . 
D:  Good point . 
D:  That 's a very good point . 
D:  So we can  so we can  
D:  r Right . 
D:  Although it 's  
D:  Yeah so that 's  so let 's start with Haas , and Yeah . 
D:  Oh , that 's fine . 
D:  OK . 
D:  That 's alright . 
D:  OK . 
D:  So , uh  Let 's see . 
D:  So that was that topic , 
D:  and <breath> then um , I guess another topic would be <breath> where are we in the whole disk resources  question 
D:  for  
D:  Sk - It 's copying from one place on Abbott to another place on Abbott ? 
D:  Oh ! 
D:  I 'm sorry . 
D:  Is it ? 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  S 
D:  W w we are getting more space . 
D:  We are getting , uh , another disk rack and  and four thirty - six gigabyte disks . 
D:  Uh  so  uh  but that 's not gonna happen instantaneously . 
D:  Or maybe six ? 
D:  How many  
D:  How much  
D:  So , but , uh y you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the Broadcast News , 
D:  but , we have some other disks , some of which you 're using for Aurora , 
D:  but are we g do we have some other  other space now ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Uh , OK , @ @  So , uh , then I guess th the last thing I 'd had on my  my agenda was just to hear  hear an update on <inbreath> what  what Jose has been doing , 
D:  so 
D:  OK . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Go ahead . 
D:  No , but there 's  but , I think she 's saying " Where do you  In these three categories , where do you put the instances in which there is one person speaking and other sounds which are not speech ? " 
D:  Which category do you put that in ? 
D:  Right , so where do you put speech from one speaker that does have a nonspeech event at the same time ? 
D:  Which catege which category ? 
D:  Oh , so you  not  not marked . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Got it . 
D:  Fine . So  so  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , that 's fine . 
D:  Oh , no  no , it 's a perfectly sensible way to go . 
D:  We just wondered  trying to understand what  what you were doing . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah , I  I don't think we were asking for that . 
D:  We were jus just trying to understand  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Sure . 
D:  What you  
D:  Well  
D:  w <laugh> I  I think what you m I think what you mean <laugh> is that it 's nonspeech segments that don't have impulsive noises . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  Cuz you 're calling  what you 're calling " event " is somebody coughing <breath> or clicking , or rustling paper , or hitting something , which are impulsive noises . 
D:  But steady - state noises are part of the background . 
D:  Which , are being , included in that . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right , it 's  I mean , it 's  " Background " might be  might be a better word than " silence " . 
D:  It 's just sort of that  the  the background acoustic  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
D:  Well , actually , you can do sensitivity analyses which show you what the importance of the different parce pieces of the input are . 
D:  It 's hard to  w w what you  It 's hard to tell on a neural net is what 's going on internally . 
D:  But it 's actually not that hard to analyse it and figure out the effects of different inputs , especially if they 're all normalized . 
D:  Um , but  
D:  Well , this isn't tru if  if  if you really wonder what different if  if  
D:  Yeah , then a decision tree is really good , 
D:  but the thing is here he 's  he 's not  he 's not like he has one you know , a bunch of very distinct variables , like pitch and this  he 's talking about , like , a all these cepstral coefficients , and so forth , 
D:  in which case a a any reasonable classifier is gonna be a mess , and it 's gonna be hard to figure out what  what uh  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I  I mean , I think the other thing that one  I mean , this is , I think a good thing to do , to sort of look at these things at least  
D:  See what I 'd  I 'd  Let me tell you what I would do . 
D:  I would take just a few features . Instead of taking all the MFCC 's , or all the PLP 's or whatever , I would just take a couple . 
D:  OK ? 
D:  Like  like C - one , C - two , something like that , so that you can visualize it . 
D:  and look at these different examples and look at scatter plots . 
D:  OK , so before you do  build up any kind of fancy classifiers , just take a look in two dimensions , at how these things are split apart . 
D:  That I think will give you a lot of insight of what is likely to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier . 
D:  And the second thing is , once you actually get to the point of building these classifiers , <breath> @ @ what this lacks so far is the temporal properties . 
D:  So if you 're just looking at a frame and a time , you don't know anything about , you know , the structure of it over time , and so you may wanna build @ @  build a Markov model of some sort uh , or  or else have features that really are based on um on  on some bigger chunk of time . 
D:  But I think this is a good place to start . 
D:  But don't uh anyway , this is my suggestion , is don't just , you know , throw in twenty features at it , the deltas , and the delta del and all that into some classifier , even  even if it 's K - nearest - neighbors , you still won't know 
D:  what it 's doing , even  You know it 's 
D:  Uh , I think to know what it 's  to have a better feeling for what it 's 
D:  look at  at som some picture that shows you , " Here 's  These things uh , uh are  offer some separation . " <breath> And , uh , in LPC , uh , the thing to particularly look at is , I think  is something <breath> like , uh , the residual  
D:  Um So . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  OK , but , I  I think  in any event we 're agreed that the first step is  
D:  Because what we had before for  for uh , speaker change detection did not include these overlaps . 
D:  So the first thing is for you to  to build up something that will detect the overlaps . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  So again , I think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these uh , in  in  in  in  
D:  Well , I  again , the things you 've written up there I think are way too  way too big . 
D:  OK ? If you 're talking about , say , twelfth  twelfth - order uh MFCC 's or something like that it 's just way too much . 
D:  You won't be able to look at it . 
D:  All you 'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does . 
D:  Whereas I think if you have things  if you pick one or two dimensional things , or three of you have some very fancy display , uh , and look at how the  the different classes separate themselves out , you 'll have much more insight about what 's going on . 
D:  Well , you 'll  you 'll get a feeling for what 's happening , you know , 
D:  so if you look at  <breath> Suppose you look at first and second - order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first - order is much more effective than the second , <breath> and then you look at the third and there 's not  and not too much there , <breath> you may just take first and second - order cepstral coefficients , 
D:  right ? 
D:  And with LPC , I think LPC per se isn't gonna tell you much more than  than  than the other , maybe . 
D:  Uh , and uh on the other hand , the LPC residual , the energy in the LPC residual , <breath> will say how well , uh <breath> the low - order LPC <breath> model 's fitting it , which should be <breath> pretty poorly for two two or more <breath> people speaking at the same time , and it should be pretty well , for w for  for one . 
D:  And so <breath> I  i again , if you take a few of these things that are  are <breath> prob um   promising features and look at them in pairs , <breath> uh , I think you 'll have much more of a sense of " OK , I now have  <breath> uh , doing a bunch of these analyses , 
D:  I now have ten likely candidates . " 
D:  And then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they combine . 
D:  OK . 
D:  N u We 
D:  Well , I think  I think  I think it 's not a  it 's not at all unreasonable . 
D:  It makes sense to start with the simpler signal 
D:  because if you have features which don't  aren't even helpful in the high signal - to - noise ratio , then there 's no point in putting them into the low signal ratio , one would think , anyway . 
D:  And so , if you can get  @ @  Uh again , my prescription would be that you would , with a mixed signal , you would take a collection of possible uh , features <breath> look at them , look at how these different classes that you 've marked , separate themselves ,  <breath> and then collect , uh in pairs , <breath> and then collect ten of them or something , and then proceed <breath> with a bigger classifier . 
D:  And then if you can get that to work well , then you go to the other signal . 
D:  And then , and you and you know , they won't work as well , but how m you know , how much  
D:  And then you can re - optimize , and so on . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  That 's  well , the  It  it 's  it 's true that it also , it could be <breath> useful to do this exploratory analysis where you 're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases . Sure . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , that  that  that 's another reason why very simple features , things like energy , and things  things like harmonicity , and <breath> residual energy are uh , yeah are  are better to use than very complex ones because they 'll be more reliable . 
D:  Ch - Chuck was gonna ask something I guess . 
D:  Nah . 
D:  Yeah , no , you you 're  you 're right 
D:  that  In fact , if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones , you do have some location information . which we don't have with the one 
D:  and  and so that 's  
D:  Uh , well , no , I mean , we we don't have any rules , r really . 
D:  I think  <laugh> I  I think  I think it 's  it 's  it 's a  it 's an additional interesting question . 
D:  I mean , I think you wanna know whether you can do it with one , 
D:  because you know it 's not necessarily true that every device that you 're trying to do this with will have two . 
D:  Uh , if , on the other hand , we show that there 's a huge advantage with two , well then that could be a real point . 
D:  But , we don't n even know yet what the effect of detecting  having the ability to detect overlaps is . 
D:  You know , maybe it doesn't matter too much . 
D:  So , this is all pretty early stages . 
D:  But no , you 're absolutely right . 
D:  That 's  a good thing to consider . 
D:  Well , it  it  it does , i it d it does , but the  the  the issue is that  that  
D:  Yeah , it 's timing difference . 
D:  It - it 's not amplitude , 
D:  right ? 
D:  S Right . 
D:  That 's  That 's fine . 
D:  That 's  So  so i @ @  I think the issue is , " Is there a clean signal coming from only one direction ? " 
D:  If it 's not coming from just one direction , if it  if th if there 's a broader pattern , it means that it 's more likely there 's multiple people speaking , 
D:  wherever they are . 
D:  Is it a  is it  
D:  Yeah , is there a narrow  Is there a narrow beam pattern or is it a  a distributed beam pattern ? 
D:  So if there 's a distributed beam pattern , then it looks more like it 's  it 's uh , multiple people . 
D:  Wherever you are , even if he moves around . 
D:  Oh , ideal would be to have the wall filled with them , 
D:  but I mean  <laugh> But the thing is just having two mikes  If you looked at that thing on  on Dan 's page , it was  When  when there were two people speaking , and it looked really really different . 
D:  Uh , well , basic he was looking at correlation . 
D:  Just cross - correlation between two sides . 
D:  So cross - correlation is pretty sensitive . 
D:  You take the signal from the two microphones and you cros and you cross - correlate them with different lags . 
D:  OK . 
D:  So when one person is speaking , then wherever they happen to be at the point when they 're speaking , <breath> then there 's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the l in  in the lag . 
D:  So if  at whatever angle you are , <breath> at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there , you get this boost in the  in  in the cross - correlation value  function . 
D:  It 's spread out . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  The - the  Oh , I 'm sorry , 
D:  if they 're right next to one another ? 
D:  i i 
D:  Yeah , e I see . 
D:  Yeah . Oh , yeah . 
D:  Well , we d yeah , we don't have a third dimension there . Yeah , so it 's  
D:  But it 's almost  but it 's almost a  <breath> I think what you 're talking about i there 's two things . 
D:  There 's a sensitivity issue , and then there 's a pathological error uh issue . 
D:  So th the one where someone is just right directly in line is sort of a pathological error . 
D:  If someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it . 
D:  Uh , if they 're  if they 're close , it 's just a question of the sensitivity . 
D:  So if the sensitivity is good enough  and we just  we just don't have enough , uh , experience with it to know how  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  I mean , the other thing you can do  uh , if  I mean , i We 're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody  convince somebody to put two microphones in the PDA . 
D:  But if you h put a third in , <laugh> you could put in the other axis . And then you know  then you 're sort of  Yeah , then  then you pretty much could cover  
D:  Uh @ @  <inbreath> But - but that 's  I mean , we can we 'll be  all of this is there for us to study . 
D:  But  <laugh> but  but the thing is , uh , one of the  at least one of the things I was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a PDA . 
D:  Right . Yeah . 
D:  Well , that 's  that 's the constraint of one question that I think both Adam and I were  were  were interested in . 
D:  Uh , 
D:  but  you know if you can instrument a room , this is really minor league compared with what some people are doing , right ? 
D:  Some people at  at  uh , yeah , at Brown and  and  and  and  at uh  um and at Cape , 
D:  they both have these , you know , big arrays on the wall . 
D:  And you know , if you could do that , you 've got microphones all over the place 
D:  uh , you know p tens of microphones , 
D:  and  and uh  
D:  And if you do that then you can really get very nice uh kind of selectivity  
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Ye - Pretty much . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  But , the reason why I haven't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because um , I 'm interested in what happens for people , random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion . 
D:  And you can't just always go , " well , let 's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up " . 
D:  The other thing actually , that gets at this a little bit of something else I 'd like to do , is what happens if you have two P D 
D:  and they communicate with each other ? And then  You know , they 're in random positions , the likelihood that  I mean , basically there wouldn't be any  l likely to be any kind of nulls , if you even had two . If you had three or four it 's  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Um , I  i I  i I would actually kind of like us to wind it down , see if we can still get to the end of the , uh , birthdays thing there . 
D:  So 
D:  OK . 
D:  Oh , this morning we didn't sign anything cuz we said that if anybody had signed it already , we didn't have to . 
D:  Ah - oh . 
D:  Um . I mean , wha what  
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Well , why don't we  
D:  Uh , so @ @ OK . @ @  It sounds like u uh , there were  there were a couple technical things people would like to talk about . 
D:  Why don't we just take a couple minutes to  to briefly  do them , and then  and then  and then  and then  and then we  
D:  OK . 
D:  Oh , yeah . Sure . 
D:  Oh yeah , yeah . 
D:  We could s 
D:  Yeah Yeah , once you get to the publication you can certainly do that . 
D:  You can go , you know , uh , " Z " <laugh> uh , for instance . 
D:  Uh . Um , yeah , I mean , t it doesn't  I mean , I 'm not knowledgeable about this , 
D:  but it certainly doesn't bother me to have someone 's first name in  in the  in the transcript . 
D:  Uh , I think  you don't wanna have their full name to be uh , listed . 
D:  And so  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So again , th the issue is if you 're tracking discourse things , you know , if someone says , uh , uh , " Frank said this " and then you wanna connect it to something later , you 've gotta have this part where that 's " Frank colon " . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I was too . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  L let me just back up this to make a  a brief comment about the , uh , what we 're covering in the meeting . 
D:  Uh I realize when you 're doing this that uh  I mean , I didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about . 
D:  Uh , and so , uh  and so I was proceeding some somewhat at random , frankly . 
D:  So I think what would be helpful would be uh , i and I 'll  I 'll mention this to  to Liz and Andreas too , that um , before the meeting if anybody could send me , any  any , uh , uh , agenda items that they were interested in and I 'll  I 'll take the role of organizing them uh , into  into the agenda , 
D:  but I 'd be very pleased to have everyone else <breath> completely make up the agenda . 
D:  I 've no desire to  <laugh> to make it up , 
D:  but if  if no one 's told me things , then I 'm just proceeding from my  my guesses , and  and uh , and i ye yeah , I  I 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to  I mean , I 'm just always asking Jose what he 's doing , you know , and  <laugh> and so it 's   There 's uh , there 's obviously other things going on . 
D:  What ar how are they gonna do any of this ? 
D:  I mean , they 're gonna say speaker - one , or speaker - two or speaker I mean I  I  
D:  So it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words . 
D:  Uh  Yu - Ching , Yu - Ching . Yeah . 
D:  And it  and it may very well be  I mean , since they 're not going to sit there and  and  and worry ab about , uh , it being the same speaker , they may very well go the  eh the  the first se the first time it changes to another speaker , that 'll be speaker - two . 
D:  And the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it 's actually speaker - one . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  But that  
D:  Well , you do . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  If  if  if  if someone says , uh , " what  what is Jose doing ? " and then Jose says something , you need to know that that was Jose responding . 
D:  Uh , so . 
D:  " Is you know who up in you know where ? " 
D:  Right ? Use the  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Th - Bec 
D:  OK , so suppose someone says , " well I don't know if I really heard what  uh , what Jose said . " 
D:  And then , Jose responds . 
D:  And part of your learning about the dialogue is Jose responding to it . 
D:  But it doesn't say " Jose " , it says " speaker - five " . 
D:  So  uh  u 
D:  Right . 
D:  And so , if we pass out the data to someone else , and it says " speaker - five " there , we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker - five is Jose , 
D:  and if were gonna do that we might as well  give them " Jose "  say it was " Jose " . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I  I agree . 
D:  I  I agree with Jane . 
D:  I  I think that we  we have a  need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort , and  
D:  Uh . 
D:  She  
D:  No , but she 's saying , from the argument before , she wants to be able to say if someone said " Jose " in their  in their thing , and then connect to so to what he said later , then you need it . 
D:  Oh I see . 
D:  I see . 
D:  And th and the other thing is if  if  if Liz were here , <laugh> what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue , 
D:  and so , <breath> uh , 
D:  yeah . Sorry . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Yeah , a lot of these things are . 
D:  Uh , maybe we should only have meetings between people who don't know one another and who are also amnesiacs who don't know their own name . 
D:  Oh , well that 's  there 's an easy way to do that . 
D:  Jus - jus just play it all backwards . 
D:  What , what does the speech recognizer care ? 
D:  Um , 
D:  Let 's do digits . 
D:  Yeah , we  we  we already missed the party . 
D:  So .
