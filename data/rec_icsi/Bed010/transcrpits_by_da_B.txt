B:  right . 
B:  Thank you . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Oh , 
B:  Am Spartacus . " 
B:  Verstehe . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK . N , 
B:  N , V 
B:  yeah , 
B:  OK . 
B:  Alright . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah , I noticed that um , that some of the examples they had , had you know , non - English word orders and so on , 
B:  you know . And then all that good stuff . 
B:  So . 
B:  Like . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I  I still don't  I still don't really understand e like  
B:  I mean we sort of say , um  
B:  You know , I  I still don't exactly understand sort of the information flow uh in  in this thing , or what the modules are and so on . 
B:  So , you know , like just that such - and - such module uh um decides that it wants to achieve the goal of greeting the user , 
B:  and then magically it sort of s 
B:  I mean , how does it know which syntactic structure to pull out , and all that ? 
B:  R uh 
B:  Sure . 
B:  Yeah , 
B:  soon . 
B:  OK . 
B:  That 's fine . 
B:  OK . 
B:  And I remember one thing that  that came up in the talk last Wednesday . Um , was this , 
B:  I  I think he talked about the idea of like , um  He was talking about these lexicalized uh , uh , tree adjoining grammars where you sort of  for each word you , um  
B:  For each lexical item , the lexical entry says what all the uh trees are that it can appear in . 
B:  And of course , that 's not v That 's the opposite of constructional . 
B:  That 's , you know , that 's  that 's HPSG or whatever . 
B:  You know ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Make our stuff fit to that . 
B:  Uh - huh . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Right . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Oh OK . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Right , yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Oh OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Got it . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Right , OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  So I mean , the  the point is that like the meetings um so far that I 've been at have been  sort of been geared towards this demo , 
B:  and then that 's going to go away pretty soon . 
B:  OK . 
B:  And then we 'll sort of shift gears a Fairly substantially , 
B:  huh ? 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Right . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Uh - huh . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK , 
B:  right . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  It 's alright . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  How do you go about this process of deciding what these connections are ? 
B:  I know that there 's an issue of how to weight the different things too , and stuff . 
B:  Right ? 
B:  I mean do you just sort of guess and see if it sort of  
B:  OK . 
B:  Right . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Alright . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , 
B:  that 's right . 
B:  Yeah , oh , and by the way , speaking of data , um , are there 
B:  I could swore  uh , I could swear I saw it sitting on someone 's desk at some point , 
B:  but is there a  um a transcript of any of the , sort of , initial interactions of people with the  with the system ? 
B:  Cuz you know , I 'm still sort of itching to  to look at what  look at the stuff , and see what people are saying . 
B:  Yeah , 
B:  u OK . 
B:  Yeah , I mean I  I sort of um found the uh , uh the audio of some of those , 
B:  and um , it kind of sounded like I didn't want to trudge through that , you know . 
B:  It was just  Strange , 
B:  but . 
B:  Oh yeah , 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK , 
B:  yeah , I mean . 
B:  Oh , um , I just wanted to , uh , s like mention as an issue , um , you know last meeting I wasn't here 
B:  because I went to a linguistics colloquium on the fictive motion stuff , 
B:  and that was pretty interesting 
B:  and you know , I mean , 
B:  seems to me that that will fairly obviously be of relevance to uh  to what we 're doing here 
B:  because you know people are likely to give descriptions 
B:  like you know , " What 's that thing uh right where you start to go up the hill , " or something like that , 
B:  you know , meaning a few feet up the hill or whatever from some reference point and all that stuff 
B:  so I mean , I 'm sure in terms of you know , people trying to state locations or , you know , all that kind of stuff , this is gonna be very relevant . 
B:  So , 
B:  um , now that was  the talk was about English versus Japanese , um , which obviously the Japanese doesn't affect us directly , except that , um , some of the construction  
B:  he 'd  what he talked about was that you know in English we say things like th you know , " your bike is parked across the street " 
B:  and we use these prepositional phrases , you know , " well , if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike " , 
B:  but um in  in Japanese the  the more conventionalized tendency is to use a  sort of a description of " where one has crossed to the river , there is a tree " . 
B:  Um , and you know , you can actually say things like , um , " there 's a tree where one has crossed the river , but no one has ever crossed the river " , or something like that . 
B:  So the idea is that this really is you know that 's supposed show that 's it 's really fictive and so on . 
B:  But um  
B:  But the point is that that kind of construction is also used in English , you know , like " right where you start to go up the hill " , or " just when you get off the train " , or something like that to  uh , to indicate where something is . 
B:  So we 'll have to think about  
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Right , so the canonical direction of motion determines where the front is . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Right . 
B:  I think  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  I mean , it seems to me that you can get both in  in English depending o 
B:  You know , like , " in front of the car " could you know  Like , 
B:  here 's the car sideways to me in between me and the car or something 's in front of the car , or whatever . 
B:  I could see that , 
B:  but  
B:  But anyway , so you know , I mean , this was  this was a  a very good talk on those kinds of issues and so on . 
B:  So uh . 
B:  Alright ! 
B:  Cool ! 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  The origin . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh , OK . 
B:  I never heard it . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  You  you can actually say things like , um , " it 's behind the tree from me " or something like that , I think , in  in  in certain circumstances in English , 
B:  right ? 
B:  As sort of " from where I 'm standing it would appear that "  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh , OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Me too . 
B:  Huh . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Circuits . 
B:  That 's cool . 
B:  Yeah 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  What 's going on at the end of the tool , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  What 's going on at the end of the tool , or whatever . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh , OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  That 's cool . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Alright . 
B:  I  
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Be of use to someone who 's trying to do this , 
B:  right ? 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I see . 
B:  Right . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Good to know . 
B:  Oh , OK . 
B:  Alright . 
B:  Cuz I don't have to implement anything . 
B:  Yeah , right . 
B:  Cool ! 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Just a drive up . 
B:  Ca - chuk ! 
B:  There you go . 
B:  Exactly . 
B:  Drive through , yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Sure . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh , so in Switzerland . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Pretty soon . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Quite relevant , yeah . 
B:  Yeah , 
B:  oh yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah , I 'm actually probably going to be in contact with her uh pretty soon anyway because of various of us students were going to have a reading group about precisely that sort of thing over the summer , 
B:  so . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Right , 
B:  no faculty ! 
B:  Yeah , right . 
B:  It 's as if we didn't tell anyone at all , 
B:  right .
