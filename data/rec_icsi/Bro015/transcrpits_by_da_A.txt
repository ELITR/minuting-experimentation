A:  so . <breath> That 's probably the next little thing I 'll play with when I get a chance 
A:  OK 
A:  So they would just provide that as part of the data . 
A:  How about the um  the thing that you guys were working on before 
A:  the uh Uh <clear throat> voiced - unvoiced 
A:  uh  

A:  Ah . You stopped working on it 
A:  I see 
A:  No . I didn't . 
A:  Um , are you talking about  
A:  Uh , no . 
A:  This week I haven't . 
A:  I 've been  my whole time 's been taken up with uh <breath> Meeting Recorder stuff . 
A:  Uh , disk crash and uh covering things . 
A:  Oh . You know , there is one other thing . 
A:  Um Stephane showed me a paper yesterday <breath> um where th uh for the Italian system they had done a series of experiments playing around with the um  <breath> the number of iterations , that I talked about last week ? 
A:  And , um , so , there was a whole series of those that they had done . 
A:  They didn't , I don't think , reported timing <breath> for those , 
A:  but um <breath> it turns out that the one that they 're actually using was not the best , uh in  in their series of experiments , which I uh  Maybe it 's because they <breath> uh wanted to use the same number of iterations across all different languages and this was only done on Italian or something . 
A:  Uh , I don't know who did it 
A:  do you know , Stephane ? 
A:  Who did that ? 
A:  So um <breath> you know there wasn't a huge difference in terms of the performance across all the different experiments that they did . 
A:  Um . But it varied a little bit . 
A:  And uh  So I guess the main thing that I take out of that is that I think that for our purposes here we could definitely <breath> you know decrease the number of iterations that we do 
A:  and um , 
A:  at least while we 're , you know , working on uh <breath> all different of kinds of variations , and that would let us , you know , pump through a lot more experiments . 
A:  So um I still have to  to send everybody a pointer about uh <breath> how to run the um <mouth> HTK system <breath> on the Linux boxes and about changing these number of iterations so that  so that you can do that . 
A:  Um . <breath> So the  the other thing that that I was thinking about maybe trying out next is 
A:  um  
A:  Oh ! 
A:  The other th the other experiment that they had in that paper was uh uh playing with the number of Gaussians per state . 
A:  And so . 
A:  OK . 
A:  I should look at that more carefully cuz I wonder what they did about  
A:  Oh , OK . 
A:  I was thinking it was Gaussians but it 's states . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So . <breath> The thing I was thinking about was uh , you know , the number of insertions really goes up when you <breath> start adding all the noise in , 
A:  and maybe the thing to do next would be to try to um <breath> uh make the silence model more powerful , 
A:  you know , increasing the number of Gaussians to the number of states , different  different things like that , 
A:  so . <breath> That 's probably the next little thing I 'll play with when I get a chance
