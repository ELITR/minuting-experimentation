F:  OK . 
C:  @ @  Adam , what is the mike that , uh , Jeremy 's wearing ? 
F:  It 's the ear - plug mike . 
E:  <laugh> 
E:  That 's good . 
A:  Ear - plug .  <laugh> 
C:  Is that a wireless , or  ?  
F:  No . 
C:  Oh . 
G:  It 's wired . 
G:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
B:  Oh ! 
A:  Is that  Does that mean you can't hear anything during the meeting ? <laugh> 
D:  It 's old - school . 
F:  <laugh> <mike noise> 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> What ?  <laugh> 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Huh ? What ? Huh ?  
B:  Should we , uh , close the door , maybe ? So it 's  Yeah . 
F:  It  it 's a fairly good mike , actually . 
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  Huh . 
F:  Well , I shouldn't say it 's a good mike . All I really know is that the signal level is OK . I don't know if it 's a  
B:  <laugh> 
F:  the quality . 
B:  Well , that 's a  
F:  Ugh !  
topic_description:	opening


B:  <papers shuffling> necessary  <paper shuffling> 
F:  <inbreath> So I didn't send out agenda items because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item and now we have two . So . 
B:  OK . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> And , uh . <outbreath> 
B:  <mouth> <mouth> 
B:  So , just to repeat the thing bef that we said last week , it was there 's this suggestion of alternating weeks on 
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  <inbreath> more , uh , automatic speech recognition related or not ? Was that sort of  the division ? 
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  Right . 
C:  <yawn> 
B:  So which week are we in ? 
B:  <mike noise> 
F:  Well  
B:  <breath> 
F:  We haven't really started , but I thought 
F:  we more  we more or less did Meeting Recorder stuff last week , so I thought we could do , uh  <inbreath> 
B:  I thought we had a thing about speech recognition last week too . 
F:  But I figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each . So . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <breath> 
F:  I seem to be having difficulty getting this adjusted . Here we go . 
B:  <papers shuffling> OK .

topic_description:	data consent forms


B:  <papers shuffling> 
F:  So , uh , as most of you should know , I did send out the consent form thingies and , uh , 
F:  so far no one has made any  
F:  Ach !   
F:  any comments on them . So , no on no one has bleeped out anything . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Um . 
F:  So . 
B:  Yeah . @ @  Um . <breath> 
F:  I don't expect anyone to . But . 
B:  So , w what follows ? At some point y you go around and get people to sign something ? 
F:  No . 
F:  We had spoken w about this before and we had decided that they have  they only needed to sign once . 
B:  Yeah , but I 've forgotten . 
F:  And the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity . 
F:  So as long as we do that , we 're covered . 
B:  <inbreath> And how long of an opportunity did you tell them ? 
F:  Uh , July fifteenth . 
B:  July fifteenth . 
B:  Oh , so they have a plenty of time , and y 
F:  Yep . <outbreath> 
B:  <inbreath> Given that it 's that long , um , 
B:  um  
B:  Why was that date chosen ? You just felt you wanted to  ? 
F:  Jane told me July fifteenth . So , that 's what I set it . 
B:  Oh , OK . 
A:  Oh . I just meant that 
A:  that was  the release date that you had on the  data . 
D:  <mike noise> 
A:  @ @  
F:  Oh . I  I didn't understand that there was 
A:  I , uh  
F:  something specific . You  y you had  
A:  I thought  
B:  I don't  
B:  <breath> 
F:  I had heard July fifteenth , so that 's what I put . So . 
B:  No , the only  th the only  mention I recall about that was just that July fifteenth or so is when <inbreath> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  this meeting starts . 
A:  That 's right .  That 's why . 
H:  <mike noise>  
B:  Oh , I see . 
A:  You said you wanted it to be available then . I didn't mean it to be the hard deadline . It 's fine with me if it is , or we cou But I thought it might be good to remind people two weeks prior to that 
B:  OK . 
B:  <inbreath> <two vocal squeaks> 
B:  Right .  
H:  <mike noise> 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  w 
A:  in case , uh  you know , " by the way  this is your last  " 
B:  <outbreath> 
B:  Right .  
A:  Uh . Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> We probably should have talked about it , cuz i because if we wanna be able to 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  give it to people July fifteenth , if somebody 's gonna come back and say " OK , I don't want this and this and this used " , uh , clearly we need some time 
B:  to respond to that . Right ? 
F:  <mouth> Yeah . As I said , we  
F:  I just got one date and that 's the one I used . So . But I can send a follow - up . I mean , it 's almost all us . 
H:  Damn !   
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> Yeah . 
F:  I mean the people who are in the meeti this meeting was , 
A:  <inbreath> 
F:  uh , these  the meetings that  in  are in set one . 
C:  Was my  was my response OK ? I just wrote you  replied to the email saying they 're all fine . 
A:  That 's right . <inbreath> 
F:  Right . I mean , that 's fine . 
C:  OK , good . 
A:  <inbreath> 
F:  I  we don't  My understanding of what we  had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that , 
C:  That makes it easy . <laugh> 
F:  uh , we don't actually need a reply . 
F:  We just need to tell them that they can do it if they want . 
B:  OK . 
B:  I just didn't remember , but  
F:  And so no reply is 
F:  no changes . 
A:  And he 's got it so that the default thing you see when you look at the page is " OK " . 
B:  OK . 
A:  So that 's very clear all the way down the page , " OK " . And they have two options they can change it to . One of them is  " censor " , and the other one is " incorrect " . 
A:  Is it  is  your word is " incorrect " ? Which means also we get feedback on  if  um , there 's something that they w 
F:  Right . 
A:  that needs to be  adjusted , because , I mean , these are very highly technical things . I mean , it 's an added , uh , level of checking on the accuracy of the transcription , as I see it . But in any case , people can agree to things that are wrong .  So . 
F:  Well  
F:  Yeah . The reason I did that it was just so that people would not censor  not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly , 
A:  <inbreath> And the reason I liked it was because  
F:  as opposed to , uh  
A:  was because it , um  it gives them the option of , uh , being able to correct it . 
F:  Right . 
A:  Approve it and correct it . 
A:  And  um . 
A:  So , you have  it nicely set up so they email you and , uh  
F:  <mouth> When they submit the form , it gets processed and emailed to me . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . <inbreath> And I wanted to say the meetings that are involved in that set are Robustness and Meeting Recorder . 
F:  So . 
A:  <inbreath> The German ones will be ready for next week . 
A:  Those are three  three of those . A different set of people . And we can impose  
C:  The German ones ? 
H:  <mouth> 
A:  Uh , well . <outbreath> 
H:  Yeah . Those  
D:  <mike noise> 
H:  uh  
B:  NSA . 
A:  <laugh> OK . I spoke loosely . The  the German , French  Sorry , the German , <laugh> Dutch , and Spanish ones .  
H:  <throat clear> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Spanish . Yeah .  
F:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  Oh , those are the NSA meetings ? 
H:  Those are  
E:  The non - native  
A:  Yeah . Uh - huh . 
B:  German , Dutch , Swiss and Spanish . <laugh> 
C:  Oh , oh ! OK . 
A:  <laugh> That 's  that 's  that 's r  <laugh> 
E:  The all non - native  
F:  Mm - hmm .  
H:  Uh - huh .  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  OK . I 'd  I d 
A:  Yeah .  It 's the other group . 
B:  I It was the network  
B:  network services group . Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Yeah , exactly . Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> 
A:  I didn't mean to  isolate them . 
B:  Otherwise known as the German , Dutch , and Spanish . <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Sorry . It was  it was not the best characterization .  But what  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <inbreath> what I meant to say was that it 's the other group that 's not  
A:  n no m no overlap with our present members . <inbreath> 
A:  And then maybe it 'd be good to set an explicit deadline , something like  a week  before that , uh , J July fifteenth date , or two weeks before . 
B:  <inbreath> 
topic_description:	overview


B:  I mean , I would suggest we discuss  I mean , if we 're going to have a policy on it , that we discuss the length of time that we want to give people , 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  so that we have a uniform thing . So , tha that 's a month , which is fine . I mean , it seems  
F:  <inbreath> Well , the only thing I said in the email is that  the data is going to be released on the fifteenth . I didn't give any other deadline . 
C:  Twelve hours . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <inbreath> So my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says , " wow I suddenly found something " , 
F:  we 'll delete it from our record . We just won't delete it from whatever 's already been released . 
A:  Hmm . That 's a little bit difficult . 
F:  What else can we do ? 
A:  Yeah .  
F:  If someone says " hey , look , I  found something in this meeting and  it 's libelous and I want it removed " . 
F:  What can we do ? We have to remove it . 
A:  <inbreath> Well .  That 's true . I  I agree with that part , but I think that it would  it , uh  we need to have , uh , a  a  a message to them very clearly that 
H:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  <inbreath> beyond this date , you can't make additional changes . 
B:  <inbreath> I mean , um , 
B:  I  I  
F:  <laugh-breath> 
B:  <inbreath> i 
B:  I think that somebody might  request something even though we say that . But I think it 's good to at least start some place like that . So if we agreed , <inbreath> 
A:  Mm - hmm . Good .  
B:  OK , how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have  if we say two weeks , or if we say a month , 
B:  <inbreath> I think we should just say that  say that , you know , i a as  um , 
B:  <mouth> " per the  the  the , uh , page you signed , you have the ability to look over this stuff " and so forth <inbreath> 
B:  " and , uh , because we w " 
B:  these , uh  I would  I would imagine some sort of generic thing that would say " because we , uh , will continually be making these things available <inbreath> 
B:  to other researchers , uh , this can't be open - ended and so , uh , uh , please give us back your response within this am you know , within this amount of time " , whatever time we agree upon . 
H:  <abrupt outbreath> @ @  
F:  <mouth> Well , did you read the email and look at the pages I sent ? 
B:  Did I ? No , I haven't yet . No , just  
F:  No . OK , well why don't you do that and then make comments on what you want me to change ? 
B:  <mouth> No , no . I 'm not saying that you should change anything . I I 'm  what I 'm  what I 'm  
F:  <mike noise> <laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> I 'm trying to spark a discussion hopefully among people who have read it  so that  that you can  
A:  <inbreath> 
H:  <abrupt outbreath> 
B:  <inbreath> you can , uh , decide on something . So I 'm not telling you what to decide . 
A:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  Mm - hmm . <mouth> <inbreath> 
B:  I 'm just saying you should decide something , and then  
F:  I already did decide something , and that 's what 's in the email . And if you disagree with it , why don't you read it and give me comments on it ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . OK , so  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  <inbreath> Well  
A:  @ @  
A:  I  I think that there 's one missing line . 
B:  Well , the one thing that I did read and that you just repeated to me  was that you gave the specific date of July fifteenth . <inbreath> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  And you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it to you . <inbreath> 
F:  Right . 
B:  So what I 'm telling you  is that what you should do is come up with a length of time that you guys think is enough 
B:  and you should use that rather than  this date that you just got from somewhere . That 's all I 'm saying . 
F:  OK . 
B:  OK ? 
topic_description:	time constraints


A:  <inbreath> I ha I have one question . This is in the summer period and presumably people may be out of town . But we can make the assumption , can't we ? that , um , they will be receiving email , uh , most of the month . Right ? 
B:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
A:  Because if someone  
B:  It  well , it  well , you 're right . Sometimes somebody will be  away and , uh , you know , there 's , uh  for any length of time that you 
B:  <breath> 
B:  uh , choose  there is some person sometime who will not  end up reading it . 
A:  OK . 
B:  That 's  it 's , you know , just a certain risk to take . 
H:  S so maybe when  <abrupt outbreath> Am I on , by the way ? 
F:  <mouth> I don't know . 
H:  Oh . Hello ? Hello ? 
F:  You should be . 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  @ @  
F:  You should be channel B . 
H:  Oh , OK . Alright . So . The , um  
H:  <mouth> 
H:  Maybe we should say in  
H:  w you know , when the whole thing starts , when they sign the  
H:  <mouth> the agreement <inbreath> 
H:  that  
H:  you know , specify exactly 
H:  uh , what , 
H:  you know , how  how they will be contacted <inbreath> 
H:  and they can , you know  they can be asked to give a phone number and an email address , or both . <inbreath> 
H:  And , um , then  <outbreath> 
A:  <mouth> We did that , I  I believe . 
H:  Right . So . <inbreath> 
E:  Yeah . 
H:  A And , then , you know , say very clearly that if they don't  if we don't hear from them , 
H:  you know , as Morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain <inbreath> 
H:  period after we contact them <inbreath> 
H:  that is implicitly giving their agreement . <outbreath> 
D:  <mike noise> 
F:  Well , they 've already signed a form . 
A:  <inbreath> 
H:  @ @  Right . 
A:  <mouth> And the form says  
E:  And nobody  nobody really reads it anyway . 
F:  So . And the s and the form was 
H:  Says that . 
H:  Right . 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
H:  Well , if that 's i tha if that 's already  if  
F:  approved by Human Subjects , so , eh , that 's gonna be a little hard to modify . 
A:  Uh , the f 
A:  <inbreath> Well , the form  Well , the form doesn't say , if  uh , you know , " if you don't respond by X number of days or X number of weeks  " 
H:  I see . 
H:  Uh  
H:  Oh , OK . 
H:  So what does it say about the  the  the process of  of , uh  
A:  It doesn't have a time limit . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  y the review process ? 
A:  That you 'll be provided access to the transcripts and then , uh , allowed to  remove things that you 'd like to remove , 
F:  <outbreath>  
F:  <mike noise> 
H:  Oh , OK . 
H:  Hmm . 
A:  before it goes to the general  uh , larger audience . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Oh . 
F:  Here . You can read what you already signed . <laugh-breath>  
A:  There you go . 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
E:  I guess when I  read it , um  
B:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
H:  OK . 
F:  <mike noise> 
E:  I 'm not as diligent as Chuck , but I had the feeling I should probably respond and tell Adam , like , 
E:  " I got this and I will do it by this date , 
E:  and if you don't hear from me by then  " You know , in other words responding to your email  once , 
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  Right . 
E:  right away , saying " as soon as you get this could you please respond . " <inbreath> 
E:  And then if you  if the person thinks they 'll need more time because they 're out of town or whatever , they can tell you at that point ? 
E:  Because  
F:  <mouth> Oh , I just  I didn't wanna do that , because I don't wanna have a discussion with every person  if I can avoid it . 
E:  <inbreath> Well , it 's  
F:  So what I wanted to do was just send it out and say 
F:  " on the fifteenth , the data is released , if you wanna do something about it , do something about it , but that 's it " . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  <clears throat> 
A:  <inbreath> I  I kind of like this . Yeah . 
E:  Well  
E:  OK . So , we 're assuming that  
H:  <inbreath> Well , that 's  that would be great if  
H:  but you should probably have a  legal person look at this and  make sure it 's OK . Because if you  if you , uh , do this <inbreath> 
H:  and you  then there 's a dispute later and , uh , some  <inbreath> 
H:  you know , someone who understands these matters concludes that they didn't have , uh , you know , enough opportunity to actually <inbreath> 
H:  exercise their  their right  <inbreath> 
E:  Or they  they might never have gotten the email , because although they signed this , they don't know by which date to expect your email . <inbreath> 
E:  And so  someone whose machine is down or whatever  I mean , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  we have no  in internally we know that people are there , but we have no confirmation that they got the mail . 
F:  Well , OK . l Let me  Let me reverse this . 
F:  So let 's say someone  I send this out , and someone doesn't respond . 
F:  Do we delete every meeting that they were in ? 
F:  <laugh> I don't think so . 
E:  Well , then  
H:  No . 
E:  It  we 're hoping that doesn't happen , but that 's why there 's such a thing as registered mail or  
F:  <mouth> That will happen . 
E:  <breath> Right . 
H:  That will happen . 
F:  That will absolutely happen . 
F:  Because people don't read their email , or they 'll read and say " I don't care about that , I 'm not gonna delete anything " and they don just won't reply to it . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  Maybe  uh , do we have mailing addresses for these people ? 
F:  No . We have what they put on the speaker form , which was just generic contact information . 
H:  No . 
A:  <mouth> Well   
A:  <mouth> Most  
H:  Oh . 
A:  <inbreath> But the ones that we 're dealing with now are all local , except the ones who  I mean , we  we 're totally in contact with all the ones in those two groups . 
H:  <mouth> Well , then  
H:  Mmm . 
H:  <mouth> 
H:  OK . 
A:  <inbreath> So maybe , uh , I  you know , that 's not that many people and if I  if , uh  
H:  <outbreath> 
A:  i i there is an advantage to having them admit  and if I can help with  with processing that , I will . It 's  it 's  there is an advantage to having them be on record as having received the mail and indicating  
F:  Yeah . I mean I thought we had discussed this , like , a year ago . And so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again . 
A:  Yes , we did . 
A:  You 're right . 
A:  Well , I  you know . But sometimes    
F:  <inbreath> So . 
B:  Well , we  we haven't experienced it before . Right ? So  
A:  That 's right . 
A:  <inbreath> 
E:  You 'll either wonder  at the beginning or you 'll wonder at the end . 
A:  Need to get it right . 
E:  I mean , there 's no way to get around  
E:  I It 's pretty much the same am amount of work except for an additional email just saying they got the email . And maybe it 's better legally to 
A:  Yeah .  
E:  wonder before  you know , a little bit earlier than  
F:  <mouth> 
F:  Well  <outbreath> 
A:  It 's much easier to explain  this way . T t to have it on record . 
F:  OK . Well , why don't you talk  t Morgan , can you talk to our lawyer about it , 
F:  and find out what the status is on this ? Cuz I don't wanna do something that we don't need to . Because 
A:  Yeah , but w Mmm . <mouth> 
F:  what  I 'm telling you , people won't respond to the email . 
A:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
F:  No matter what you do , you there 're gonna be people who  you 're gonna have to make a lot of effort to get in contact with . 
D:  I mean , i it 's k 
F:  <inbreath> And do we want to spend that effort ? 
H:  Hmm . 
A:  Well , then we make the effort . 
B:  <inbreath>  
D:  It 's kind of like signing up for a mailing list . They have opt in and opt out . And there are two different ways . I mean , and either way works  probably , I mean . 
A:  We make the effort . 
A:  <inbreath> Except I really think in this case  I  I 'm agr I agree with Liz , that we need to be  in the clear 
A:  and not have to after the fact say " oh , but I assumed " , and " oh , I 'm sorry that your email address was just accumulating mail without notifying you " , you know . 
B:  If this is a purely administrative task , we can actually have administration do it . 
A:  Oh , excellent . 
B:  <inbreath> But the thing is that , you know , I  I  I think , without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers , <inbreath> 
B:  from my previous conversations with them , my  my sense very  much is that we would want something 
B:  on record  as indicating that they actually were aware of this . 
A:  Yes . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  Well , we had talked about this before and I thought that we had 
A:  <inbreath> 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  even gone by the lawyers asking about that and they said 
F:  you have to s they 've already signed away the f with that form  that they 've already signed once . 
A:  <inbreath> I don't remember that this issue of  the time period allowed for response was ever covered . 
C:  <outbreath> 
F:  Yeah . <mouth> 
B:  @ @  
D:  <mike noise> 
F:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . We never really talked about that . 
E:  Or the date at which they would be receiving the email 
A:  Or  or how they would indicate  
B:  Yeah . 
E:  from you . 
E:  They probably forgot all about it . Yeah . 
B:  We certainly didn't talk , uh , about  with them at all about , uh , the manner of them being  <inbreath> 
H:  <inbreath> We do it like with these  
B:  made the , uh , uh , materials available . That was something that was sort of just within our implementation . 
H:  <throat clear> 
H:  We can use it  we can use a  
F:  OK . 
H:  a ploy like they use to , um  
H:  <mouth> 
H:  you know , that when they serve , like  
H:  <inbreath> uh , uh , uh   
H:  uh , you know , like dead - beat dads , they  they  they make it look like they won something in the lottery  and then they open the envelope and that  <inbreath> 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  And they 're served . 
G:  <mike click> 
H:  Right ? Because  and then the  the  the  the thing is served . <inbreath>  
A:  <laugh> 
H:  So you just make it , you know , " oh , you won  you know , go to this web site and you 've , uh  you 're  " 
G:  <mike click> 
E:  That 's why you never open these things that come in the mail .  
A:  That one . 
H:  <laugh> Right . <laugh> 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> Well , it 's just , we 've gone from one extreme to the other , where 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <sneeze> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  Right . No , it I  it might  
F:  at one point , a few months ago , Morgan was  you were saying let 's not do anything , and now we 're  
A:  Well , it doesn't matter . 
H:  i i <inbreath> 
H:  it  it might well be the case  it might  
F:  we 're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature ? I mean , what are we gonna doing here ? <laugh> 
H:  Right . <inbreath> 
H:  It might well be the case that  that this is perfectly  
B:  Well .  
H:  you know , this is enough to give us a basis t to just , eh , 
H:  assume their consent if they don't reply . <inbreath> But , I 'm not  you know , me not being a lawyer , I wouldn't 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <inbreath> 
H:  just wanna do that without  having the  the expert , uh , opinion on that . <inbreath> 
F:  <mouth> 
A:  <inbreath> And how many people ? Al - altogether we 've got twenty people . These people are people who read their email almost all the time . 
F:  Then I think we had better find out , so that we can find a  
H:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> Let me look at this again . 
B:  <mike noise and paper shuffling> 
F:  Right . 
A:  <inbreath> I  I really don't see that it 's a problem . I  I think that it 's a common courtesy to ask them  
H:  <outbreath> 
H:  <mike noise> 
F:  For  for th 
A:  uh , to expect for them to , uh , be able to have 
A:  @ @  us try to contact them , u just in case they hadn't gotten their email . I think they 'd appreciate it . 
G:  <mike click> 
B:  <inbreath> Yeah . My  Adam , my  my view before was about  the nature of what was  of the presentation , 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  of  of how  my  my  the things that we 're questioning were along the lines of how easy  
B:  uh , h how m 
B:  how much implication would there be that it 's likely you 're going to be changing something , as opposed to  That was the kind of dispute I was making before . <inbreath> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . I remember that . 
B:  But , um , the attorneys , I  uh , I can guarantee you , the attorneys will always come back with  and we have to decide how 
B:  stringent we want to be in these things ,  but they will always come back with saying <inbreath> 
B:  that , um , you need to  you want to have someth some paper trail or  which includes electronic trail  <inbreath> 
B:  that they have , uh , in fact  O K 'd it . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <breath> So , um , 
B:  <mouth> 
B:  I think that if you f i if  we send the email as you have and if there 's 
B:  half the people , say , who don't respond  at all by , you know , some period of time , 
C:  <yawn> 
B:  <breath> 
B:  we can just make a list of these people and hand it to , uh  
B:  you know , just give it to me and I 'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever , and they 'll just call them up and say , you know , " have you  <inbreath> 
F:  Right . 
B:  Is  is this OK ? And would you please mail  you know , mail Adam that it is , if i if it , you know , is or not . " 
topic_description:	contacting for consent


E:  The other thing that there 's a psychological effect that  
B:  So , you know , we can  we can do that . 
E:  at least for most people , that if they 've responded to your email saying " yes , I will do it " or " yes , I got your email " , they 're more likely to actually do it   later  than to just ignore it . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And of course we don't want them to bleep things out , but it  
E:  it 's a little bit better if we 're getting the  
E:  their , uh , final response , once they 've answered you once than if they never answer you 'd  at al at all . 
E:  That 's how these mailing houses work . So , I mean , it 's not completely lost work because it might benefit us in terms of getting  responses . 
A:  Mm - hmm .  
E:  You know , an official OK from somebody  is better than no answer , even if they responded that they got your email . 
E:  And they 're probably more likely to do that once they 've responded that they got the email . 
A:  <inbreath> I also think they 'd just simply appreciate it . I think it 's a good  a good way of  of 
H:  <mike noise> 
A:  fostering goodwill among our subjects . 
A:  Well , our participants . 
B:  <inbreath> I think the main thing is  I mean , what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases . So they s so  so  Tha - that 's what they 're paid to do . 
F:  <laugh> Sending lots of spam . 
F:  Yep . 
B:  And so , <inbreath> it is certainly possible that , uh , somebody 's server would be down or something and they wouldn't actually 
B:  hear from us , and then they find this thing is in there and we 've already distributed it to someone . So , <inbreath> 
B:  what it says in there , in fact , is that they will be given an opportunity to blah - blah - blah , 
A:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  but if in fact  if we sent them something or we thought we sent them something but they didn't actually receive it for some reason , <inbreath> 
B:  um , then we haven't given them that . 
F:  Well , so how far do we have to go ? Do we need to get someone 's signature ? 
B:  <inbreath> 
F:  Or , is email enough ? Do we have to have it notarized ?  I mean  <inbreath> 
B:  I i i em email is enough . 
F:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . I mean , I 've been through this  I mean , I 'm not a lawyer , but I 've been through these things a f things f like this a few times with lawyers now so I  I 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  I I 'm pretty comfortable with that . 
C:  <mouth> Do you track , um , 
C:  when people log in 
F:  <mouth> Uh . If they submit the form , I get it . 
C:  to look at the  ? 
C:  Uh - huh . 
F:  If they don't submit the form , it goes in the general web log . But that 's not sufficient . 
C:  Hmm . 
F:  Right ? Cuz if someone just visits the web site that doesn't  imply anything in particular . 
C:  Except that you know they got the mail . 
A:  Mm - hmm . That 's right . I  I could get you on the notify list if you want me to . 
F:  Right . 
F:  I 'm already on it . 
A:  For that directory ? OK , great . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <mouth> So again , hopefully , um , this shouldn't be quite as odious 
B:  a problem either way , uh , in any of the extremes we 've talked about because <breath> 
B:  uh , we 're talking a pretty small  number of people . 
F:  <inbreath> W 
F:  For this set , I 'm not worried , because  we basically know everyone on it . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  You know , they 're all more or less here or it 's  it 's Eric and Dan and so on . <inbreath> 
B:  <sniff> <throat clear> 
F:  But for some of the others , you 're talking about visitors who are  gone from ICSI , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  whose email addresses may or may not work , 
A:  <mouth> Oh . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  and  
A:  <inbreath> 
F:  So what are we gonna do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with ? 
A:  <inbreath> I don't think , uh  They 're so recent , these visitors . I  and  and I  they 're also so  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . <mike noise> 
A:  They 're prominent enough that they 're easy to find through  I  I mean , I  I w I 'll be able to  if you have any trouble finding them , I really think I could find them . 
F:  Other methods ? 
F:  OK . 
B:  <mouth> Yeah . Cuz it  what it  what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission . <inbreath> 
B:  Um , and I think , you know , if you go into a room and close the door and  and ask their permission <laugh> and they 're not there , it doesn't seem  
B:  that that 's the intent of , uh , meaning here . So . 
F:  <inbreath> Well , the qu the question is just whether  how active it has to be . 
F:  I mean , because they  they filled out a contact information and that 's where I 'm sending the information . <inbreath> 
B:  Right . 
F:  And so far everyone has done email . There isn't anyone who did , uh , 
F:  any other contact method . 
B:  <inbreath> Well , the way ICSI goes , people , uh , who , uh , were here ten years ago still have acc <laugh> have forwards to other accounts and so on . So it 's unusual that  that they , uh  
A:  <mike noise> 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  Yeah . <laugh> 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  <outbreath> 
A:  <interval of mike rustling> 
F:  So my original impression was that that was sufficient , that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  Then they just come back . 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  <inbreath> All my files were still here .  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
F:  that  we fulfilled our burden . 
E:  Same as us .  <laugh> 
B:  <mouth> So if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe I will call the attorney about it . But , you know , hopefully we won't need to . 
A:  <inbreath> I just  
F:  OK . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  I d I just don't think we will . 
F:  Alright . 
A:  For all the reasons that we 've discussed . 
B:  So we 'll  we 'll see if we do or not . 
F:  Yep . And we 'll see how many people respond to that email . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  So far , two people have . So . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  <inbreath> Yeah . I think very few people will and  and  and , you know , people  people see long emails about things that they don't think 
H:  <outbreath> 
B:  <breath> is gonna be high priority , they typically , uh , don't  don't read it , or half read it . 
F:  Right . 
B:  Cuz people are swamped . But  
A:  <inbreath> And actually , um , I  I  
A:  didn't anticipate this so I  that 's why I didn't give this comment , and it  I  this discussion has made me think it might be nice 
A:  to have a follow - up email within the next couple of days saying " by the way , you know , we wanna hear back from you by X date 
A:  and please  " , and then add what Liz said  " please , uh , respond to  please indicate you received this mail . " 
B:  <inbreath> <swallow> 
B:  Uh , or e well , maybe even additionally , uh , um , 
B:  " Even if you 've decided you have no 
B:  changes you 'd like to make , if you could 
B:  tell us that " . Yeah . 
F:  Respond to the email .  Yep . 
A:  Mm - hmm . It is the first time through the cycle . 
E:  Right . That would  that would definitely work on me . You know , it makes you feel m like , 
E:  um , 
E:  if you were gonna p if you 're predicting that you might not answer , you have a chance now to say that . 
E:  Whereas , I  I mean , I would be much more likely myself , 
C:  And the other th 
E:  given all my email , t to respond at that point , saying " you know what , I 'm probably not gonna get to it " or whatever , 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  rather than just having seen the email , thinking I might get to it , and never really , 
E:  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah . I was  
E:  uh , pushing myself to actually do it until it 's too late . 
C:  I was thinking that it also  lets them know that they don't have to go to the page to  accept this . 
E:  Right . R Right . That 's true . 
B:  Right . 
C:  I mean , I  I  Yeah . So that way they could  
B:  <inbreath> 
C:  they can see from that email that if they just write back and say " I got it , no changes " , 
C:  they 're off the hook . They don't have to go to the web page and  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> I mean , the other thing I 've learned from dealing with  dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth , uh , is , um , 
E:  Yeah . That 's true . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  if you say " you 've got three months to do this review " , 
B:  <breath> 
B:  um , people do it , you know , 
B:  <mouth> 
B:  two and seven eighths months from now . If you say " you 've got three weeks to do this review " , they do  do it , you know , two and seven eighths weeks from now  <inbreath> they do the review . 
F:  Right . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  And , um  
B:  So , 
B:  if we make it  a little less time , I don't think it 'll be that much  
F:  <inbreath> Well , and also if we want it ready by the fifteenth , that means we better give them deadline of the first , 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time . 
B:  <mouth> 
topic_description:	level of consent required


B:  There 's the responding part and there 's also what if , 
B:  uh , I mean , I hope this doesn't happen ,  
B:  what if there are a bunch of deletions that have to get put in and changes ? Then <inbreath> 
F:  Right . 
B:  we actually have to deal with that if we want it to  
A:  Mm - hmm . Some lead time . 
A:  <inbreath> 
F:  Ugh !  Disk space , oh my god ! <breath> I hadn't thought about that . 
A:  <inbreath> By the way , has  has Jeremy signed the form ? 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  OK . 
F:  That for every meeting  
D:  <inbreath> 
E:  <inbreath> 
F:  any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of . 
H:  <outbreath> 
H:  Oh .  
C:  Just that channel . Oh , no . We have to do  
D:  Can't you just do that channel ? 
F:  No , of course not . You need all the channels . 
E:  Yeah . You have to do all of them , 
D:  Oh . 
C:  Do you have to do the other close - talking ? 
E:  as well as all of these . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  Wow . 
F:  Yes . Absolutely . There 's a lot of cross - talk . 
H:  <outbreath> 
E:  You have to do all  You could just do it in that time period , though , but I guess it 's a pain . 
A:  Well  <inbreath> 
F:  <inbreath> Well , but you have to copy the whole file . Right ? Because we 're gonna be releasing the whole file . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . You 're right . 
A:  Well  <inbreath> I  you know , I think at a certain point , that copy that has the deletions will become the master copy . 
F:  <inbreath> Yeah . It 's just I hate deleting any data . 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  So I  I don't want  I really would rather make a copy of it , rather than 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <mouth> 
B:  Are you del are you bleeping it by adding ? 
F:  bleep it out and then  
F:  Overlapping . So , 
F:  it 's  it 's exactly a censor bleep . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  So what I really think is " bleep "  and then I want to  
E:  <inbreath> 
B:  I I 
B:  I I understand , but is  is it summing signals or do you  delete the old one and put the new one in ? 
F:  <mouth> I delete the old one , put the new one in . There 's nothing left of the original signal . 
B:  Oh , OK . Cuz  
B:  Oh . Cuz if you were summing , you could  
B:  No . But anyway  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . It would be qui quite easy to get it back again . 
A:  <inbreath> But  <outbreath> 
H:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  And then w I was gonna say also that the they don't have to stay on the system , as you know , cuz  cuz the  the ones  
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Then someday we can sell the  unedited versions .  
C:  <laugh> Yeah .  
F:  Say again ? 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  Once it 's been successfully bleeped , can't you rely on the  ? 
C:  Or  we 'll tell people the frequency of the beep and then they could subtract the beep out .  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  Encrypt it . 
D:  You can hide it . Yeah . 
H:  Oh , yeah . 
A:  Can't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version ? 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Right . Exactly . I see . 
F:  <mouth> Yeah , that 's true . Yeah . Yep , that 's true . 
D:  It wouldn't be that hard 
E:  See , this is good . I wanted to create some  side conversations in these meetings . So  
B:  <inbreath> Yeah . You could encrypt it , <inbreath> 
D:  to hide it . 
A:  OK . 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  You can use spread spectrum . Hide it . <inbreath> Yeah , there you go . 
B:  you know , with a  with a two hundred bit  <laugh> thousand bit , uh  <laugh> 
C:  Uh - huh . 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Here we go . <laugh> 
H:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  Yeah . Yeah . Cuz we don't have enough asides . 
A:  <laugh> 
H:  I have an idea . You reverse the signal , so it  it lets people say what they said backwards . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  There you go . 
D:  <laugh> Then you have , like , subliminal , uh , messages , like . 
F:  Backwards . 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> But , 
F:  ha you 've seen the  this  the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments . Did you read that paper ? 
H:  Yeah . <inbreath> 
F:  <inbreath> It wouldn't work . The speech recognizer still works . 
H:  No . 
E:  Yeah . And if you do it backward then  
F:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  That 's cuz they use forward - backward . 
E:  H - good old HMM . <laugh> No , it 's backward - forward . 
G:  <outbreath> 
F:  Forward but backward . That 's right . Good point . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  A point . 
A:  <mike noise> 
B:  Uh . 
topic_description:	censoring techniques


F:  <mouth> Well , I 'm sorry if I sound a little peeved about this whole thing . It 's just we 've had meeting after meeting after meeting a on this and it seems like we 've never gotten it resolved . <breath> 
B:  <inbreath> Well , but we never also  we 've also never done it . 
A:  Hmm . 
E:  Uh .  
F:  So . Yeah . 
E:  <inbreath> If it makes  
B:  <laugh> So . <inbreath> 
A:  This is the first cycle . There 're bound to be some glitches the first time through . 
B:  And , uh  and I 'm sorry responding without , uh , having much knowledge , but the thing is , uh , I am , like , one of these people who gets a gazillion mails and  and stuff comes in as 
A:  <mike noise> 
F:  <inbreath> Well , and that 's exactly why I did it the way I did it , which is the default is if you do nothing we 're gonna release it . Because , 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  you know , I have my  stack of emails of to d to be done , 
F:  that , you know , fifty or sixty long , and the ones at the top I 'm never gonna get to . 
B:  <inbreath> Right . 
F:  <inbreath> And , uh  So  so  
B:  <mouth> 
C:  Move them to the bottom . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <mouth> So  so the only thing we 're missing is  is some way to respond to easily to say , uh , " OK , go ahead " or something . Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , right . 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  <mike noise> 
F:  So , i this is gonna mean  
C:  <laugh> 
C:  Just re - mail them to yourself and then they 're at the bottom . <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath> 
F:  Yeah . That 's actually definitely a good point . The m email doesn't specify 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  <outbreath> 
F:  that you can just reply to the email , as op as opposed to going to the form and  
A:  <inbreath> 
H:  In  
A:  Mm - hmm . <inbreath> 
E:  Right . 
A:  And it also doesn't give a  a specific  I didn't think of it . 
A:  S I think it 's a good idea  an ex explicit time by which this will be considered 
F:  Yeah , release . 
A:  definite . 
A:  And  and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint . 
B:  Yeah . It 's converging . 
H:  <inbreath> 
B:  <laugh> 
H:  This  um , I 've seen this recently . Uh , I got email , and it  
F:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  Yeah . That 's right . 
H:  i if I use a MIME - capable mail reader , it actually 
H:  says , you know , click on this button to confirm receipt  of the  of the mail . 
D:  Hmm . 
A:  Oh , that 's interesting .   
H:  So  
F:  <mouth> You  you can  
F:  A lot of mailers support return receipt . But it doesn't confirm that they 've read it . <laugh> 
D:  It 's like certified mail . 
A:  Could do that . 
H:  Right . <inbreath> 
H:  No , no , no . This is different . This is not  So , I  I know , you can tell , you know , the , uh , mail delivery agent to  to confirm that the mail was delivered to your mailbox . But  but , no . This was different . 
B:  <throat clear> 
A:  Mmm . 
F:  Right . 
H:  <inbreath> Ins - in the mail , there was a  
F:  Oh , just a button . Oh , yeah . 
H:  uh , th there was a button that when you clicked on it , it would send , 
H:  uh , you know , a actual acknowledgement to the sender that you had actually looked at the mail . 
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  Yeah . Unfor - Yeah , we could do that . But I hate that . <laugh> 
H:  But it o but it only works for , you know , MIME - capable  you know , if you use Netscape or something like that for your n 
B:  <inbreath> 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  You might as well just respond to the mail . I mean  
B:  And  <outbreath> 
H:  Right . <inbreath> 
B:  And we actually need a third thing . It 's not that you 've looked at it , it 's that you 've looked at it and  and  and agree with one of the possible actions . Right ? 
H:  <inbreath> No , no . You can do that . You know , you can put this button anywhere you want , and you can put it the bottom of the message and say " here , by  you know , by clicking on this , I  I agree  <inbreath> 
B:  Oh ? 
B:  Oh , I see . 
H:  uh , you know , I acknowledge  " 
B:  That i i my first - born children are yours , and  Yeah . 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  Quick question . Are , um  
F:  Well , I could put a URL in there without any difficulty and  even pretty simple MIME readers can do that . So . 
G:  <click> 
A:  <inbreath> 
B:  <mouth> 
A:  But why shouldn't they just  email back ? I don't see there 's a problem .  It 's very nice . I  I like the high - tech aspect of it , but I think  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . Reply . 
B:  Yeah . 
H:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
H:  <inbreath> No , no , no . <laugh> I actually don't . I 'm just saying that <inbreath>

E:  Anyway , quick question . How m 
F:  You could put wed bugs in the email . 
D:  I see . 
H:  Yeah . 
E:  Like , there were three meetings this time , or so or how many ? Six ? 
A:  Six . 
E:  But , no of different people . So I guess if you 're in both these types of meetings , you 'd have a lot . But  
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  How  I mean , it also depends on how many  
E:  Like , if we release  this time it 's a fairly small number of meetings , but what if we release , like , twenty - five meetings to people ? 
F:  <inbreath> Well , what my s expectation is , is that we 'll send out one of these emails  every time a meeting has been checked and is ready . 
E:  In th 
E:  I don't know . 
E:  Oh . Oh , OK . So this time was just the first chunk . OK . 
F:  So . Tha - that was my intention . It 's just  yeah  that we just happened to have a bunch all at once . <inbreath> 
E:  Well , that 's a good idea . 
F:  I mean , maybe  Is that  the way it 's gonna be , you think , Jane ? 
A:  I agree with you . <inbreath> It 's  we could do it , uh  I I could  I 'd be happy with either way , batch - wise  What I was thinking  Uh , so this one  
A:  That was exactly right , that we had a  uh , uh  
A:  I  I had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready .  
A:  <inbreath> Don't have it . 
A:  But , uh , this was the biggest clump I could do by a time where I thought it was reasonable . People would be able to check it and still have it ready by then . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <inbreath> My , um  I was thinking that with the  NSA meetings , I 'd like  there are three of them , and they 're  uh , I  I will have them done by Monday . 
A:  Uh , unfortunately the time is later and I don't know how that 's gonna work out , but I thought it 'd be good to have that released as a clump , too , because then , 
A:  <inbreath> you know , they 're  they  they have a  it it 's in a category , it 's not quite so distracting to them , is what I was thinking , and it 's all in one chu 
H:  <mike noise> 
A:  But after that , when we 're caught up a bit on this process , then , um , I could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available . 
B:  <mike noise> 
E:  OK . 
A:  <inbreath> I could do it either way . I mean , it 's a question of how distracting it is to the people who have to do the checking .

B:  We heard anything from IBM ? 
B:  <mouth> at all ? 
C:  <mouth> Uh . Let 's see . We  Yeah , right . So we got the transcript back from that one meeting . Everything seemed fine . 
C:  Adam  had a script that will  put everything back together and there was  Well , there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix . 
C:  <breath> 
C:  And then , um , <mouth> we , uh  I sent him a pointer to three more . 
C:  And so he 's  off and  working on those . 
F:  Yeah . Now we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting , to see whether the transcript is correct and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff . So at some point we need to do that . 
C:  <inbreath> Yeah . 
A:  That 's on my list . 
A:  Well , that 's on my list . 
C:  <inbreath> Yeah . It 's gonna have to go through our regular 
F:  <mouth> I mean , the one thing I noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels . There are a fair number of " yeahs " and " uh - huhs " that  it 's just  that aren't in there . 
C:  process . 
F:  So . 
B:  <inbreath> 
A:  Hmm . 
B:  But I think  Yeah . Like you said , I mean , that 's  that 's gonna be our standard proc that 's what the transcribers are gonna be spending most of their time doing , I would imagine , once  once we  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . 
F:  Yes , absolutely . Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> It 's gonna  
A:  <inbreath> One question about the backchannels . Do you suppose that was because they weren't caught by the pre - segmenter ? 
F:  Yes , absolutely . Absolutely . 
A:  Oh , interesting . 
A:  Oh , interesting . OK . 
F:  Yeah . They 're  they 're not in the segmented . It 's not that the  IBM people didn't do it . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
F:  Just they didn't get marked . 
A:  OK . So maybe when the detector for that gets better or something   <inbreath> I w I

A:  There 's another issue which is this  we 've been , uh , contacted by University of Washington now , of course , to , um  
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  We sent them the transcripts that correspond to those  six meetings 
A:  and they 're downloading the 
A:  audio files . So they 'll be doing that . Chuck 's  Chuck 's , uh , 
A:  put that in . 
C:  Mm - hmm . Yeah , I pointed them to the set that Andreas put , uh , on the 
C:  <breath> 
C:  web so th if they want to compare directly with his results they can . 
C:  <breath> 
C:  And , um , then once , uh , 
C:  th we can also point them at the , um , 
C:  uh , the original meetings 
C:  and they can grab those , too , with SCP . 
E:  Wait . So you put the reference files  ? 
C:  <mouth> No , no . They d they wanted the audio . Jane sent them the , uh , transcripts . 
E:  Or the  ? 
E:  No , I mean of the transcripts . 
E:  Um . 
E:  Well , we can talk about it off - line . 
F:  <mouth> There 's another meeting in here , what , at four ? 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <mike noise> 
F:  Right ? Yeah , so we have to finish by three forty - five . 
H:  D d So , does Washi - does  does UW wanna u do this  wanna use this data for recognition or for something else ? 
C:  Uh , for recognition . 
H:  Oh . 
E:  I think they 're doing w didn't they want to do language modeling on , you know , recognition - compatible transcripts or  ?

topic_description:	University of Washington data


A:  <mouth> This is to show you , uh , some of the things that turn up during the checking procedure . 
B:  Yeah . 
H:  <breath> 
A:  <inbreath> Um @ @  
A:  So , this is from one of the NSA meetings and , uh , i if you 're familiar with the diff format , the arrow to the left is what it was , and the arrow to the right is  what it was changed to . So , 
A:  <inbreath> um . <inbreath> 
A:  And now the first one . " OK . So , then we started a weekly meeting . 
A:  The last time , uh  " And the transcriber thought " little too much " <laugh> 
A:  But , <inbreath> uh , 
A:  @ @  
A:  really , um , it was " we learned too much " , which makes more sense syntactically as well . 
H:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
H:  And these  the parentheses were f from  
A:  <inbreath> Then  
A:  Oh , this  that 's the convention for indicating uncertain . So the transcriber was right . 
F:  U uncertains . 
H:  S 
A:  You know , she was uncertain about that . So she 's right to be uncertain . 
H:  OK . 
H:  Oh .  OK . 
A:  And it 's also a g a good indication of the  of that . The next one . This was about , uh , Claudia and  she 'd been really b busy with stuff , such as waivers . 
A:  <breath-laugh> Uh , OK . Um , next one . Um . 
H:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  <inbreath> This was  an interesting one . So the original was " So that 's not  so Claudia 's not the bad master here " ,  <laugh> and then he laughs , but it really " web master " .  
F:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  Web master . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Oh .  Uh - oh . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh-breath> 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  And then you see another type of uncertainty which is , you know , they just didn't know what to make out of that . 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  So instead of " split upon unknown " ,  it 's " split in principle " . 
F:  Yep . 
D:  Jane , these are from IBM ? The top lines ? 
F:  Spit upon ? 
A:  No , no . These are  these are our local transcriptions of the NSA meetings . The transcribers  transcriber 's version ver versus the checked version . 
F:  No , these are  ours . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Oh , I see . 
A:  My  my checked version , after I go through it . 
D:  OK . 
A:  <inbreath> Um , then you get down here . Um . 
A:  <inbreath> Sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms . That 's the next example , the next one . 
A:  <inbreath> The , uh , version beyond this is  So instead of saying " or " , 
A:  especially those words , " also " and " oder " and some other ones .  Those sneak in . 
A:  <inbreath> Um , the next one  
H:  Discourse markers . 
F:  <laugh> That 's cool . 
H:  Discourse markers . 
A:  S 
A:  Sorry , what ? 
H:  <mouth> Discourse markers . Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Discourse markers ? Sure . Sure , sure , sure . And it 's  and it makes sense cuz it 's , like , below this  it 's a little subliminal there . <inbreath> 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  <inbreath> Um . OK , the next one , 
H:  <breath> 
A:  uh , <laugh> this is a term . The problem with terminology . Description with th the transcriber has " X as an advance " . 
A:  But really it 's " QS in advance " . I mean , I  I 've benefited from some of these , uh , cross - group meetings . 
A:  OK , then you got , um , <inbreath> 
A:  uh , instead of " from something - or - other cards " ,  it 's " for multicast " . 
A:  And instead of " ANN system related " , it 's " end system related " . This was changed to an acronym initially and it should shouldn't have been .  
A:  And then , you can see here " GPS " was misinterpreted . 
A:  It 's just totally understanda This is  this is a lot of jargon . <inbreath> 
A:  Um , and the final one , <inbreath> 
A:  the transcriber had th " in the core network itself or the exit unknown , not the internet unknown " .  
A:  And it  it comes through as " in the core network itself of the access provider , not the internet backbone core " . Now this is a lot of  terminology . 
H:  Mmm . 
A:  And they 're generally extremely good , 
A:  but , you know in this  this area it really does pay to , um  to double check and I 'm hoping that when 
A:  the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you 'll see s substantial improvements in performance cuz the  you know , there 're a lot of these in there . 
H:  Yeah . So how often  ? 
F:  Yeah , but I bet  I bet they 're acoustically challenging parts anyway , though . 
D:  Mmm . 
A:  No , actually no . Huh - uh .  
F:  Oh , really ? Uh , it 's  Oh , so it 's just jargon . 
A:  It 's jargon . Yeah . I mean this is  cuz , you know you don't realize in daily life how much you have top - down influences in what you 're hearing . 
H:  <inbreath> Well , but  
C:  <breath> 
A:  <inbreath> And it 's jar it 's jargon coupled with a foreign accent . 
H:  But  but  
H:  But we don't  I mean , our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow . <outbreath> So , 
H:  you know , un until you actually  get a decent language model , @ @  Adam 's right . You probably won't notice a difference . 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  It probably won't do any better . 
H:  But it 's  I mean , it 's definitely good that these are fixed . I mean , <laugh> obviously . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <mouth> Well , also from the standpoint of getting people 's approval , cuz if someone sees a page full of 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <mike noise> 
A:  uh , um , barely decipherable w you know , sentences , and then is asked to approve of it or not , <laugh> it 's , uh , uh  
H:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  Did I say that ? <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah . That would be a shame if people said " well , I don't approve it because  the  it 's not what I said " . <laugh> Yeah .  
F:  <mike noise> 
A:  OK . 
A:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  Well , that 's exactly why I put the extra option in , 
A:  Exactly . That 's why we discussed that . 
F:  is that I was afraid people would say , " let 's censor that because it 's wrong " , and I don't want them to do that . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	transcription accuracy


A:  <inbreath> And then I also  the final thing I have for transcription is that I made a purchase of some other headphones because of the problem of low gain in the originals . <inbreath> 
B:  <inbreath> 
H:  C <breath noise> 
A:  And  and they very much appro they mu much prefer the new ones , and actually I  
A:  I mean , I  I think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the  the choice . We 'd originally chosen , uh , 
F:  Yeah . 
A:  very expensive head headsets but , um , they 're just not as good as these , um , 
F:  Ugh !  
A:  in this  with this respect to this particular task . 
H:  Well , return the old ones . <laugh> 
F:  It 's probably impedance matching problems . But  
A:  I don't know exactly , but we chose them because that 's what 's been used here by prominent projects in transcription . So it i we had every reason to think they would work . Sorry , what ? 
B:  Could be . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  So you have spare headsets ? 
H:  <inbreath> You have spare headsets ? 
F:  They 're just earphones . They 're not headsets . They 're not microphones . 
H:  No , no . I mean , just earphones ? <inbreath> 
E:  Right . 
H:  Um , 
H:  because I , uh , 
H:  I could use one on my workstation , just to t because sometimes I have to listen to audio files and I don't have to b go borrow it from 
H:  someone and  
A:  <inbreath> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  We have actua actually I have  W Well , the thing is , that if we have four people come to work  for a day , I was  I was hanging on to the others 
H:  Oh , OK . 
A:  for , eh  for spares , but I can tell you what I recommend . 
B:  <inbreath> No , but you 'd  If you  Yeah , w we should get it . 
H:  Sure . No problem . I just  
F:  But if you need it , just get it . Come on .  <laugh> 
H:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . If you need it . Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . <inbreath> 
B:  <breath-laugh> They 're  they 're  they 're  they 're pretty inexpensive . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I still  I still need to get a pair , too .

B:  No . Just  just  just  just buy them .

H:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  Oh , no . 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> It was while I was out of town .  <laugh> 
D:  Um , this is always a suspect phrase . 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  But , um , no . I , uh  I realized that we 're going to be doing a lot of experiments , um , <inbreath> 
D:  o for this , uh , paper we 're writing , so we 're probably gonna need a lot more  We 're probably gonna need 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  that disk space that we had on that eighteen gig hard drive . But , 
D:  um , we also have someone else coming in that 's gonna help us out with some stuff . So  
B:  We 've just ordered a hundred gigabytes . 
E:  <outbreath> I think we need , like , another eighteen gig disk  to be safe . 
D:  OK . We just need to  
B:  Well , we 're getting three thirty  thirty - sixes . 
E:  So . 
D:  OK . 
B:  Right ? That are going into the main f file server . So . 
E:  OK . 
C:  Markham 's ordering and they should be coming in soon . 
D:  W Well . So  so  
F:  Soon ? 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . I mean , I guess the thing is is , all I need is to hang it off , like , 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  the person who 's coming in , Sonali 's , computer . 
H:  <inbreath> Oh , so  so , you mean the d the internal  the disks on the machines that we just got ? 
A:  <mike noise> 
D:  Whew .  
D:  Or we can move them . 
F:  No . 
C:  <inbreath> These are gonna go onto Abbott . 
H:  Or extra disk ? 
F:  Ne - new disks . 
B:  Onto Abbott , the file server . 
D:  So are we gonna move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in ? OK . That 's fine . 
H:  Oh , oh . OK . 
F:  <mouth> On  Yeah . 
F:  Once they come in . Sure . 
E:  Uh , i 
E:  Do  when  when is this planned for  roughly ? 
C:  They should be  I  I imagine next week or something .  
E:  OK . So  
F:  <mouth> If you 're  if you 're desperate , I have some space on my drive . 
D:  OK . 
D:  I think if I 'm  
F:  But I  I vacillate between no space free and  a few gig free . So . 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . I think I can find something if I 'm desperate and , um , in the meantime I 'll just hold out . That was the only thing I wanted to bring up . 
F:  OK . 
F:  <noise> 
C:  It should be soon . We  we should  
D:  OK . 
B:  So there 's another hundred gig . So . 
D:  Alright . Great . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK .

F:  Oh , yeah . 
B:  get together and talk about , uh , where we are on things . Uh , there 's this meeting coming up , <inbreath> 
B:  uh , and there 's also an annual report . Now , I never actually  I  I was asking about this . I don't really quite understand this . 
B:  She was re she was referring to it as  I think this actually  didn't just come from her , but this is  what , uh , DARPA had asked for . <inbreath> 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  Um , she 's referring to it as the an annual report for the fiscal year . But of course the fiscal year starts in October , 
B:  <inbreath> so I don't quite understand w w 
B:  why we do an annual report that 
C:  She 's either really late or really early . 
B:  we 're writing in July . 
H:  <outbreath> 
B:  <laugh>

G:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <mouth> Or she 's getting a good early start . <laugh> 
E:  <sniff> 
B:  <inbreath> Uh , I think basically it it 's none of those . It 's that the meeting is in July so they  so DARPA just said do an annual report . So . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <laugh> So . 
B:  So anyway , I 'll be putting together stuff . I 'll do it , 
B:  uh , you know , as much as I can without bothering people , just by looking at  at papers and status reports . I mean , the status reports you do are very helpful . <inbreath> 
H:  Hmm . 
F:  <inbreath> 
B:  Uh , so I can grab stuff there . And if , uh  if I have some questions I 'll  <inbreath> 
F:  When we remember to fill them out . 
B:  Yeah . If  people could do it as soon as  as you can , if you haven't done one si recently . Uh . <inbreath> 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  Uh , but , you know , I 'm  I 'm sure before  it 's all done , I 'll end up bugging people for  for more clarification about stuff . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Um . 
B:  <mouth> 
B:  But , um , I don't know , I guess  I guess I know 
B:  pretty much what people have been doing .  We have these meetings and  and there 's the status reports . 
B:  Uh . 
B:  But , um . 
B:  Um .  
B:  Yeah . So that wasn't a long one . Just to tell you that . And if something <inbreath> 
B:  hasn't , uh  I 'll be talking to her late 
B:  tomorrow afternoon , and if something hasn't been in a status report and you think it 's important thing to mention on <inbreath> 
B:  this kind of thing , uh , uh , just pop me a one - liner and  and  and I 'll  I 'll have it in front of me for the phone conversation . <inbreath>

F:  <mike noise> 
E:  Yeah , we 're  
H:  I mean , the  the next thing on our agenda is to go back and look at the , um  <mouth> 
H:  the automatic alignments because , uh , I got some  
B:  <outbreath> 
H:  @ @  
H:  I  I  I learned from Thilo what data we can use as a 
H:  benchmark to 
H:  see how well we 're doing on automatic alignments of the background speech  or , of the foreground speech with background speech .  So . 
F:  Yeah . 
H:  But , we haven't actually  
E:  And then , uh , I guess , 
E:  the new data that Don will start to process  the , um  <inbreath> 
E:  when he can get these  You know , before we were working with 
E:  these segments that were all synchronous and that caused a lot of problems because you have 
H:  Mmm . 
F:  Oh . Right , right . 
E:  timed sp at  on either side . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  And so that 's sort of a <inbreath> 
E:  stage - two of trying the same kinds of alignments with the tighter boundaries with them is really the next step . 
F:  Right . 
B:  <mike noise> 
E:  <sniff>
