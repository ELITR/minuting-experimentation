D:  Oh . 
D:  Yeah .

D:  But , um , no . I , uh  I realized that we 're going to be doing a lot of experiments , um , <inbreath> o for this , uh , paper we 're writing , 
D:  so we 're probably gonna need a lot more  
D:  We 're probably gonna need <inbreath> that disk space that we had on that eighteen gig hard drive .
