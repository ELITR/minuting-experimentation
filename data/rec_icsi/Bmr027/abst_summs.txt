F:  So I didn't send out agenda items 
F:  because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item 
F:  and now we have two . 
F:  And if you disagree with it , why don't you read it and give me comments on it ? 
abst_sum - abstract: Although the Meeting Recorder group only list two agenda items, this meeting explores transcription, and in particular, consent forms in depth, and at times results in heated debate.

F:  So , uh , as most of you should know , I did send out the consent form thingies 
F:  and we had decided that they have  they only needed to sign once . 
F:  No . 
B:  At some point y you go around and get people to sign something ? 
A:  This is in the summer period 
A:  and presumably people may be out of town . 
A:  But we can make the assumption , can't we ? that , um , they will be receiving email , uh , most of the month . 
B:  It  well , it  well , you 're right . Sometimes somebody will be  away 
B:  That 's  it 's , you know , just a certain risk to take . 
B:  cuz i because if we wanna be able to give it to people July fifteenth , 
B:  if somebody 's gonna come back and say " OK , I don't want this and this and this used " , uh , clearly we need some time to respond to that . 
abst_sum - abstract: With regard to obtaining consent, the group discuss the extent to which they need to attempt to contact people, which methods are most appropriate, and how much responsibility rests on participants being available and checking their e-mail regularly.

A:  But I thought it might be good to remind people two weeks prior to that 
B:  cuz i because if we wanna be able to give it to people July fifteenth , 
B:  if somebody 's gonna come back and say " OK , I don't want this and this and this used " , uh , clearly we need some time to respond to that . 
H:  Maybe  uh , do we have mailing addresses for these people ? 
A:  Al - altogether we 've got twenty people . These people are people who read their email almost all the time . 
A:  I  I really don't see that it 's a problem . 
A:  I  I think that it 's a common courtesy to ask them  uh , to expect for them to , uh , be able to have @ @  us try to contact them , 
A:  u just in case they hadn't gotten their email . 
A:  I think they 'd appreciate it . 
B:  and if there 's half the people , say , who don't respond  at all by , you know , some period of time , <breath> we can just make a list of these people 
B:  and I 'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever , 
B:  and they 'll just call them up and say , you know , " have you  
B:  Is  is this OK ? And would you please mail  you know , mail Adam that it is , if i if it , you know , is or not . " 
E:  The other thing that there 's a psychological effect that  at least for most people , that if they 've responded to your email saying " yes , I will do it " or " yes , I got your email " , they 're more likely to actually do it   later  than to just ignore it . 
F:  So what are we gonna do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with ? 
A:  I don't think , uh  They 're so recent , these visitors . 
A:  I  I mean , I  I w I 'll be able to  if you have any trouble finding them , I really think I could find them . 
B:  Well , the way ICSI goes , people , uh , who , uh , were here ten years ago still have acc <laugh> have forwards to other accounts and so on . 
F:  that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate that  we fulfilled our burden . 
A:  and it  I  this discussion has made me think it might be nice to have a follow - up email within the next couple of days saying " by the way , you know , we wanna hear back from you by X date 
abst_sum - abstract: The group suggest sending reminder e-mails, although since many participants are local they can be contacted by other means if necessary.

B:  We heard anything from IBM ? 
C:  So we got the transcript back from that one meeting . 
C:  Everything seemed fine . 
C:  Adam  had a script that will  put everything back together and there was  Well , there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix . 
F:  Yeah . Now we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting , to see whether the transcript is correct 
C:  Yeah . It 's gonna have to go through our regular process . 
F:  I mean , the one thing I noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels . 
A:  Do you suppose that was because they weren't caught by the pre - segmenter ? 
F:  Yeah . They 're  they 're not in the segmented . 
F:  It 's not that the  IBM people didn't do it . 
abst_sum - abstract: Transcriptions are back from IBM, and the group discuss the checking of these, particularly since the pre-segmenter has interfered with back-channel data.

A:  The German ones will be ready for next week . 
B:  NSA . 
A:  Um @ @  So , this is from one of the NSA meetings 
A:  No , no . These are  these are our local transcriptions of the NSA meetings . 
A:  Sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms . 
A:  and I 'm hoping that when the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you 'll see s substantial improvements in performance 
F:  Yeah , but I bet  I bet they 're acoustically challenging parts anyway , though . 
A:  No , actually no . 
F:  Oh , so it 's just jargon . 
A:  I mean this is  cuz , you know you don't realize in daily life how much you have top - down influences in what you 're hearing . 
A:  And it 's jar it 's jargon coupled with a foreign accent . 
H:  But we don't  I mean , our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow . 
abst_sum - abstract: Checking of the NSA meetings has revealed that this non-native English meeting data contains transcription inaccuracies due to the use of foreign language terms and technical vocabulary.

F:  Disk space , 
F:  That for every meeting  
F:  any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of . 
A:  Well  <inbreath> I  you know , I think at a certain point , that copy that has the deletions will become the master copy . 
F:  So I  I don't want  I really would rather make a copy of it , rather than bleep it out 
B:  Are you del are you bleeping it by adding ? 
A:  we 've been , uh , contacted by University of Washington now , of course , to , um  
A:  We sent them the transcripts that correspond to those  six meetings 
A:  and they 're downloading the audio files . 
F:  Uh , the only one was Don wanted to , uh , talk about disk space yet again . 
B:  We 've just ordered a hundred gigabytes . 
B:  uh , and there 's also an annual report . Now , 
B:  so they  so DARPA just said do an annual report . 
H:  I mean , the  the next thing on our agenda is to go back and look at the , um  <mouth> the automatic alignments 
H:  I  I  I learned from Thilo what data we can use as a benchmark to see how well we 're doing on automatic alignments of the background speech  
H:  or , of the foreground speech with background speech . 
E:  And then , uh , I guess , the new data that Don will start to process  
E:  You know , before we were working with these segments that were all synchronous 
E:  We got our abstract accepted for this conference , 
E:  ISCA workshop , in , um , uh , New Jersey . 
E:  but we 're hoping to have a paper for that as well , 
E:  which should be an interesting  
E:  But , I mean , the good news is that that will have sort of the European experts in prosody  
E:  sort of a different crowd , 
E:  and I think we 're the only people working on prosody in meetings so far , 
E:  Uh , it 's ISCA Workshop on Prosody in Speech Recognition and Understanding , or something like that  
B:  Y you going to , uh , Eurospeech ? 
F:  I don't have a paper 
F:  but I 'd kinda like to go , 
abst_sum - abstract: Additional topics covered more briefly in this meeting are disk space, the DARPA annual report, progress with the demo, conference submissions and attendance, and requests from the University of Washington for data.

B:  So , just to repeat the thing bef that we said last week , 
B:  it was there 's this suggestion of alternating weeks on <inbreath> more , uh , automatic speech recognition related or not ? 
F:  Well  We haven't really started , 
abst_sum - decisions: The group discuss whether this meeting will relate to either meeting recorder or speech recognition issues.

B:  So , just to repeat the thing bef that we said last week , 
B:  it was there 's this suggestion of alternating weeks on <inbreath> more , uh , automatic speech recognition related or not ? 
F:  Well  We haven't really started , 
F:  But I figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each . 
F:  So next week we 'll do automatic transcription status , 
F:  plus anything that 's real timely . 
abst_sum - decisions: They decide that covering such topics over alternate weeks will commence at the next meeting, although other topics will be discussed if time allows.

A:  And then maybe it 'd be good to set an explicit deadline , 
A:  something like  a week  before that , 
A:  uh , J July fifteenth date , 
A:  or two weeks before . 
abst_sum - decisions: The group decide that it would be good to set a date for having the non-native network services group data, and one or two weeks before the 15th of July is suggested.

F:  and we had decided that they have  they only needed to sign once . 
F:  No . 
B:  At some point y you go around and get people to sign something ? 
H:  So . <inbreath> A And , then , you know , say very clearly that if they don't  if we don't hear from them , you know , as Morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain <inbreath> period after we contact them <inbreath> that is implicitly giving their agreement . 
F:  Well , they 've already signed a form . 
F:  And the s and the form was approved by Human Subjects , 
B:  I i i em email is enough . 
B:  I mean , I 'm not a lawyer , 
B:  but I 've been through these things a f things f like this a few times with lawyers now 
B:  so I  I <inbreath> I I 'm pretty comfortable with that . 
abst_sum - decisions: With regard to contacting participants to request consent, the group decide that no signature is required, and an e-mail would be enough.

B:  So if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe I will call the attorney about it . 
abst_sum - decisions: However for "boundary cases" legal advice would be sought.

E:  So I guess if you 're in both these types of meetings , you 'd have a lot . 
E:  I mean , it also depends on how many  
E:  Like , if we release  this time it 's a fairly small number of meetings , 
F:  Well , what my s expectation is , is that we 'll send out one of these emails  every time a meeting has been checked and is ready . 
abst_sum - decisions: As soon as the next set of data is ready for checking, participants should be contacted, so that this process is on-going.

A:  But I thought it might be good to remind people two weeks prior to that 
B:  cuz i because if we wanna be able to give it to people July fifteenth , 
B:  if somebody 's gonna come back and say " OK , I don't want this and this and this used " , uh , clearly we need some time to respond to that . 
E:  The other thing that there 's a psychological effect that  at least for most people , that if they 've responded to your email saying " yes , I will do it " or " yes , I got your email " , they 're more likely to actually do it   later  than to just ignore it . 
E:  You know , an official OK from somebody  is better than no answer , even if they responded that they got your email . 
A:  and it  I  this discussion has made me think it might be nice to have a follow - up email within the next couple of days saying " by the way , you know , we wanna hear back from you by X date 
abst_sum - decisions: When the deadline for giving consent is approaching, a reminder e-mail should be sent out.

A:  Al - altogether we 've got twenty people . These people are people who read their email almost all the time . 
A:  I  I really don't see that it 's a problem . 
A:  I  I think that it 's a common courtesy to ask them  uh , to expect for them to , uh , be able to have @ @  us try to contact them ,

F:  So what are we gonna do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with ? 
A:  I don't think , uh  They 're so recent , these visitors . 
A:  I  I mean , I  I w I 'll be able to  if you have any trouble finding them , I really think I could find them . 
B:  Well , the way ICSI goes , people , uh , who , uh , were here ten years ago still have acc <laugh> have forwards to other accounts and so on . 
F:  that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate that  we fulfilled our burden . 
abst_sum - decisions: In cases where no consent response is given, participants could be chased up since many are local.

F:  Disk space , 
F:  That for every meeting  
F:  any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of . 
A:  Well  <inbreath> I  you know , I think at a certain point , that copy that has the deletions will become the master copy . 
F:  So I  I don't want  I really would rather make a copy of it , rather than bleep it out 
B:  Are you del are you bleeping it by adding ? 
F:  and then  
F:  Overlapping . 
F:  So , it 's  it 's exactly a censor bleep . 
F:  So what I really think is " bleep " 
abst_sum - decisions: Original uncensored copies of meetings will be kept, with all of the old signal deleted and replaced with new when censoring.

B:  That 's  it 's , you know , just a certain risk to take . 
H:  you know , specify exactly uh , what , you know , how  how they will be contacted 
H:  w you know , when the whole thing starts , when they sign the  <mouth> the agreement <inbreath> that  
H:  So . <inbreath> A And , then , you know , say very clearly that if they don't  if we don't hear from them , you know , as Morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain <inbreath> period after we contact them <inbreath> that is implicitly giving their agreement . 
H:  Because if you  if you , uh , do this <inbreath> and you  then there 's a dispute later and , uh , some  <inbreath> you know , someone who understands these matters concludes that they didn't have , uh , you know , enough opportunity to actually <inbreath> exercise their  their right  
E:  because although they signed this , they don't know by which date to expect your email . 
E:  And so  someone whose machine is down or whatever  
F:  Because people don't read their email , 
F:  or they 'll read and say " I don't care about that , 
F:  I 'm not gonna delete anything " 
F:  and they don just won't reply to it . 
H:  Maybe  uh , do we have mailing addresses for these people ? 
B:  So if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe I will call the attorney about it . 
abst_sum - problems: Gaining consent from participants for the use of the meeting data is raising a number of issues for the group, some of which may have legal implications.

A:  This is in the summer period 
A:  and presumably people may be out of town . 
A:  But we can make the assumption , can't we ? that , um , they will be receiving email , uh , most of the month . 
B:  It  well , it  well , you 're right . Sometimes somebody will be  away 
B:  That 's  it 's , you know , just a certain risk to take . 
H:  you know , specify exactly uh , what , you know , how  how they will be contacted 
H:  w you know , when the whole thing starts , when they sign the  <mouth> the agreement <inbreath> that  
H:  So . <inbreath> A And , then , you know , say very clearly that if they don't  if we don't hear from them , you know , as Morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain <inbreath> period after we contact them <inbreath> that is implicitly giving their agreement .

F:  I 'm not gonna delete anything " 
F:  and they don just won't reply to it . 
H:  Maybe  uh , do we have mailing addresses for these people ? 
abst_sum - problems: Firstly a relatively arbitrary deadline of 15 July has been set, and since this is during the summer break, the group debate whether enough action has been made to contact participants.

H:  you know , specify exactly uh , what , you know , how  how they will be contacted 
H:  w you know , when the whole thing starts , when they sign the  <mouth> the agreement <inbreath> that  
H:  So . <inbreath> A And , then , you know , say very clearly that if they don't  if we don't hear from them , you know , as Morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain <inbreath> period after we contact them <inbreath> that is implicitly giving their agreement .

F:  that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate that  we fulfilled our burden . 
B:  So if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe I will call the attorney about it . 
abst_sum - problems: If people don't respond in time, the group discuss what facility should there be for later amendments, and whether a meeting can be used if they don't respond at all.

A:  The German ones will be ready for next week . 
B:  NSA . 
A:  Um @ @  So , this is from one of the NSA meetings 
A:  No , no . These are  these are our local transcriptions of the NSA meetings .

A:  And it 's jar it 's jargon coupled with a foreign accent . 
H:  But we don't  I mean , our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow . 
abst_sum - problems: Checking of the NSA meeting transcripts has shown that although acoustically fine, some errors have shown up, especially relating to foreign language terms and jargon or technical terminology.

F:  Disk space , 
F:  That for every meeting  
F:  any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of . 
H:  You have spare headsets ? 
H:  because I , uh , I could use one on my workstation , 
D:  Yeah , I still  I still need to get a pair , too . 
B:  No . Just  just  just  just buy them . 
F:  Uh , the only one was Don wanted to , uh , talk about disk space yet again . 
H:  The disk space was short . 
B:  We 've just ordered a hundred gigabytes . 
D:  Yeah . I mean , I guess the thing is is , all I need is to hang it off , like , <inbreath> the person who 's coming in , Sonali 's , computer . 
F:  If you 're  if you 're desperate , I have some space on my drive . 
D:  Yeah . I think I can find something if I 'm desperate 
abst_sum - problems: Additionally, the discussions reveal that there is a shortage of headphones amongst group members, and also that disk space is in short supply, especially if original copies of edited transcripts are retained.
