H:  Because I have to leave , actually . 
H:  Damn ! 
H:  Yeah . Those  uh  
H:  Those are  
H:  Uh - huh . 
H:  S so maybe when  
H:  Am I on , by the way ? 
H:  Oh . 
H:  Hello ? Hello ? 
H:  Oh , OK . Alright . So . The , 
H:  um  
H:  Maybe we should say in  
H:  w you know , when the whole thing starts , when they sign the  <mouth> the agreement <inbreath> that  
H:  you know , specify exactly uh , what , you know , how  how they will be contacted 
H:  and they can , you know  they can be asked to give a phone number and an email address , or both . 
H:  And , um , then  
H:  Right . 
H:  So . <inbreath> A And , then , you know , say very clearly that if they don't  if we don't hear from them , you know , as Morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain <inbreath> period after we contact them <inbreath> that is implicitly giving their agreement . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Says that . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Well , if that 's i tha if that 's already  if  
H:  I see . 
H:  Uh  
H:  Oh , OK . 
H:  So what does it say about the  the  the process of  of , uh  <inbreath> y the review process ? 
H:  Oh , OK . 
H:  Hmm . 
H:  Right . 
H:  Oh . 
H:  OK . 
H:  Well , that 's  that would be great if  
H:  but you should probably have a  legal person look at this 
H:  and  make sure it 's OK . 
H:  Because if you  if you , uh , do this <inbreath> and you  then there 's a dispute later and , uh , some  <inbreath> you know , someone who understands these matters concludes that they didn't have , uh , you know , enough opportunity to actually <inbreath> exercise their  their right  
H:  No . 
H:  That will happen . 
H:  Maybe  uh , do we have mailing addresses for these people ? 
H:  No . 
H:  Oh . 
H:  Well , then  
H:  Mmm . 
H:  OK . 
H:  Hmm . 
H:  We do it like with these  
H:  We can use it  we can use a  a ploy 
H:  like they use to , um  
H:  you know , that when they serve , like  
H:  uh , uh , uh   uh , 
H:  you know , like dead - beat dads , 
H:  they  they  they make it look like they won something in the lottery 
H:  and then they open the envelope 
H:  and that  
H:  Right ? 
H:  Because  and then the  the  the  the thing is served . 
H:  So you just make it , you know , " oh , you won  
H:  you know , go to this web site 
H:  and you 've , uh  you 're  " 
H:  Right . <laugh> Right . No , it I  it might  
H:  i i 
H:  it  it might well be the case  
H:  it might  
H:  Right . 
H:  It might well be the case that  that this is perfectly  you know , this is enough to give us a basis t to just , eh , assume their consent if they don't reply . 
H:  But , I 'm not  you know , me not being a lawyer , I wouldn't just wanna do that without  having the  the expert , uh , opinion on that . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Oh . 
H:  Oh , yeah . 
H:  I have an idea . 
H:  You reverse the signal , 
H:  so it  it lets people say what they said backwards . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  No . 
H:  In  
H:  This  um , I 've seen this recently . 
H:  Uh , I got email , 
H:  and it  i if I use a MIME - capable mail reader , it actually says , you know , click on this button to confirm receipt  of the  of the mail . 
H:  So  
H:  Right . 
H:  No , no , no . This is different . 
H:  This is not  So , I  I know , you can tell , you know , the , uh , mail delivery agent to  to confirm that the mail was delivered to your mailbox . 
H:  But  but , no . This was different . 
H:  Ins - in the mail , there was a  
H:  uh , th there was a button that when you clicked on it , it would send , uh , you know , a actual acknowledgement to the sender that you had actually looked at the mail . 
H:  But it o but it only works for , you know , MIME - capable  
H:  you know , if you use Netscape or something like that for your n 
H:  Right . 
H:  No , no . You can do that . 
H:  You know , you can put this button anywhere you want , 
H:  and you can put it the bottom of the message and say " here , by  you know , by clicking on this , I  I agree  <inbreath> uh , you know , I acknowledge  " 
H:  Right . 
H:  No , no , no . <laugh> I actually don't . 
H:  I 'm just saying that 
H:  if ev but I 'm  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  So  I  i 
H:  There 's these logos  that you can put at the bottom of your web page , like " powered by VI " . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  D d So , does Washi - does  does UW wanna u do this  wanna use this data for recognition or for something else ? 
H:  Oh . 
H:  Oh . I see . 
H:  And these  the parentheses were f from  
H:  S 
H:  OK . 
H:  Oh .  OK . 
H:  Discourse markers . 
H:  Discourse markers . 
H:  Discourse markers . 
H:  Yeah . Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah , yeah . 
H:  Mmm . 
H:  Yeah . So how often  ? 
H:  Well , but  
H:  But  but  
H:  But we don't  I mean , our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow . 
H:  So , 
H:  you know , un until you actually  get a decent language model , @ @  Adam 's right . 
H:  You probably won't notice a difference . 
H:  But it 's  I mean , it 's definitely good that these are fixed . 
H:  I mean , <laugh> obviously . 
H:  C 
H:  Well , return the old ones . 
H:  So you have spare headsets ? 
H:  You have spare headsets ? 
H:  No , no . I mean , just earphones ? 
H:  Um , 
H:  because I , uh , I could use one on my workstation , 
H:  just to t 
H:  because sometimes I have to listen to audio files 
H:  and I don't have to b go borrow it from someone 
H:  and  
H:  Oh , OK . 
H:  Sure . No problem . 
H:  I just  
H:  Right . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  I think I have a pair that I brought from home , 
H:  but it 's f just for music listening 
H:  and it 's not  
H:  Nnn . Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Anyway . 
H:  The disk space was short . 
H:  Yeah . That 's what I thought too . 
H:  Oh , so  so , you mean the d the internal  the disks on the machines that we just got ? 
H:  Or extra disk ? 
H:  Oh , oh . OK . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Hmm .

H:  Right ? 
H:  Yeah . We did . 
H:  OK . 
H:  Uh , I mean , we  we really haven't done anything . 
H:  Sorry . 
H:  I mean , the  the next thing on our agenda is to go back and look at the , um  <mouth> the automatic alignments 
H:  because , uh , I got some  
H:  I  I  I learned from Thilo what data we can use as a benchmark to see how well we 're doing on automatic alignments of the background speech  
H:  or , of the foreground speech with background speech . 
H:  So . 
H:  But , we haven't actually  
H:  Mmm . 
H:  It 's called Prosody to
