D:  Switching o 
D:  OK . 
D:  Is that good ? 
D:  Did we need to do these things ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Wow , we 're all so high tech here . 
D:  Yet another p PowerPoint presentation . 
D:  Certainly does . 
D:  I 'm sorry I  
D:  OK . 
D:  I can read ! 
D:  I 'm kidding . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Ach u 
D:  It 's a needless good idea . 
D:  Is that the idea ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  I was wondering . 
D:  Yeah , it 's OK . 
D:  Proceed . 
D:  Very nice . 
D:  Perfect . 
D:  Nice coinage . 
D:  Right . 
D:  can I just ask the nice walls part of it is that <breath> uh , in this particular domain  
D:  you said  be  i it could be on two different lines 
D:  but are you saying that in this particular domain it happens the  that landmark - iness cor is correlated with 
D:  their being nice w 
D:  OK . 
D:  And  and  
D:  By " nice " you mean  
D:  OK . 
D:  So " nice walls " is a stand in for like architecturally it , uh  significant 
D:  or something like that . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  There 's a lot of those . 
D:  OK . 
D:  So that count as  counts as a nice wall . 
D:  The  
D:  OK . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Something you want to inspect at close range  because it 's interesting . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Not a landmark at all . 
D:  There 's landmark for um , touristic reasons and landmark for 
D:  I don't know 
D:  navigational reasons or something . 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
D:  but you can imagine maybe wanting the oth both kinds of things there for different um , goals . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  They 're not mutually exclusive ? 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Definitely . 
D:  So , a big flat structure . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And are those mutually exclusive sets ? 
D:  Right . 
D:  Got it . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Simple . 
D:  Stab at it . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  From the  utterance ? 
D:  Inferred from the other ones ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  So some of the  the top row of things  
D:  What 's  what 's " Disc admission fee " ? 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  OK . 
D:  I see . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  OK . 
D:  So there are certain cues that are very strong  either lexical or topic - based um , concept cues 
D:  for one of those . 
D:  And then in that second row  or whatever that row of Time of Day through that  So all of those  Some of them come from the utterance 
D:  and some of them are sort of <breath> either world knowledge or situational  things . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  So that you have no distinction between those and 
D:  OK . 
D:  " Unmark @ @ Time of Day " 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Navigational cue . 
D:  Prosody . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  OK . 
D:  So that 's given in their input . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  So final dest 
D:  So it seems like that would really help you for doing business versus tourist , 
D:  but 
D:  OK . 
D:  so the the context being um , e 
D:  I don't know if that question 's sort of in general , 
D:  " are you  " 
D:  I mean the  
D:  ar ar are 
D:  do they allow business people to be doing non - business things at the moment ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  So then you just have some probabilities over  
D:  OK .  
D:  over which which of those it is . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Take a conti 
D:  So um , of course this will happen when we think more about the kinds of verbs that are used in each cases 
D:  but you can imagine that it 's verb plus various other things that are also not in the bottom layer that would  that would help you  
D:  Like it 's a conjunction of , 
D:  I don't know , 
D:  you know , the verb used and some other stuff that  that would <breath>  determine  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Exactly . 
D:  Um . 
D:  Usually . 
D:  I  I don't know if that 's always the case 
D:  I  I guess haven't looked at the data as much as you guys have . 
D:  So . Um . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  That would be a cue . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Um . OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Go ahead . 
D:  it 's starting to grow on me 
D:  I 'd like to do that again . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That seems kind of redundant 
D:  but . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  So slightly  biased  toward " Tango " ing 
D:  OK . 
D:  So . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Huh ! 
D:  Um . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Maybe the bias toward " Tango " ing was yours , then ? 
D:  So , the real case ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  So . Are " doing business " versus " tourist "  
D:  They refer to your current task . 
D:  Like  like current thing you want to do at this moment . 
D:  And are th 
D:  Oh , 
D:  so , I thought that was directly given by the context  switch . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Oh , I see , 
D:  you may have a task . 
D:  wh you have to go get money and so you are doing business at that stage . 
D:  I see . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  OK . 
D:  So the " tourists " node  should be  um , very consistent with the context node . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  If you say that 's more their  in general what their background is . 
D:  Are you assuming that or not ? 
D:  Like is that to be  I mean if that 's accurate then that would determine tourist node . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  It seems like it would for uh , uh  determining whether they wanna go into it or not . 
D:  Cuz they  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  I think you could just add it . 
D:  I mean , I have before 
D:  OK . 
D:  Whew ! 
D:  Oh , right . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Yes . 
D:  Really <breath> I ha I 've  I haven't used it a lot 
D:  and I haven't used it in the last you know many months 
D:  so 
D:  um , uh , we can ask someone . 
D:  Um . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Srini  
D:  Srini 's the one to ask I would say . 
D:  Um . He might know . 
D:  And . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  God ! 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right . 
D:  The layout  of the table . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  You could . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I actually seem to recall Srini complaining about something to do with Entering probability 
D:  so this is probably 
D:  Yeah , it 's  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  The d the data tables . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Can't you have both ? 
D:  Right . 
D:  I missed my turn . 
D:  It 's like yawning . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Could you put the  the um , net up again ? 
D:  Thanks . 
D:  So a more general thing than " discussed admission fee " um , could be  
D:  I  I 'm just wondering whether the context , the background context of the discourse <breath> might be  
D:  I don't know , 
D:  if there 's a way to define it or maybe you know generalize it some way 
D:  um , there might be other cues that , say , um , in the last few utterances there has been something that has strongly associated with say one of the particular modes 
D:  uh , I don't know if that might be  
D:  uh , and  and into that node would be various  various things that  that could have specifically come up . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Exactly . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Opening hours or something like that . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  I mean it sort of get into plan recognition kinds of things in the discourse . 
D:  I mean that 's like the bigger um , version of it . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  That 's a whole set of discourse related cues to your middle layer . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  What do you mean by that ? 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Or maybe um , a famous restaurant . 
D:  or , I don't know . 
D:  There are various things that you might w not want to eat a  meal there but  your own table . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  you have to have some notion of not just  
D:  I mean there 's a  there 's change across several turns of discourse 
D:  so <breath> I don't know how  if any of this was discussed  but how i if it all this is going to interact with <breath> whatever general <breath> uh , other  other discourse processing that might be happen . 
D:  I mean . 
D:  So one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the  use of " admission fee discussion " as a cue for entry , <breath>  is thinking about the plans that various people might have . 
D:  Like all the different <breath> sort of general schemas that they might be following 
D:  OK . 
D:  This person is um , finding out information about this thing in order to go  in as a tourist or finding out how to get to this place  in order to do business . 
D:  Um , because then  anything that 's a cue for one of the steps  would be slight evidence for that overall plan . 
D:  Um , I don't know . 
D:  They 're  in  in non in sort of more traditional AI kinds of plan recognition things you sort of have <breath>  you know , some idea at each turn of agent doing something , 
D:  " OK , wha what plans is this a  consistent with ? " 
D:  and then get s some more information and then you see  " here 's a sequence that this sort of roughly fits into " . 
D:  It  it might be useful here too . 
D:  I  I don't know how 
D:  you know you 'd have to <breath>  figure out what knowl what knowledge representation would work for that . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Not direct . 
D:  The Transcontinental Railroad , 
D:  doesn't that ring a bell ? 
D:  I think it has to exist somewhere . 
D:  Well most of the way . 
D:  Uh . Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well .  You seem to know better than we do so . 
D:  I have . 
D:  But not transcontinentally . 
D:  It 's not like German trains . 
D:  Like German trains are really great 
D:  so . 
D:  Um , but they 're faster . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Let 's all say it a few more times . 
D:  Just kidding . 
D:  Right . 
D:  So by the way tha that structure  that Robert drew on the board was like more um , <mouth>  cue - type - based , 
D:  right , 
D:  here 's like we 're gonna <breath> segment off a bit of stuff that comes from discourse 
D:  and then  some of the things we 're talking about here are more  
D:  you know , we mentioned maybe  if they talk about  um , 
D:  I don't know , 
D:  entering or som you know like they might be more task - based . 
D:  So I  I don't know if there  There 's obviously some  m more than one way of organizing  the variables into something 
D:  so . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  That feed into those ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  It 's a even distribution . 
D:  Like , 
D:  whatever . 
D:  And  
D:  That 's terrible . 
D:  That 's uh  <laugh> Well  
D:  In which case you 're supposed to alert the authorities , <laugh> and see appropriate action . 
D:  Maybe . 
D:  Quite possibly . 
D:  Oh , oh , sorry . 
D:  Sorry , 
D:  Wednesday , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Ben ? 
D:  I think it 's Ben actually , 
D:  yeah , 
D:  um , 
D:  giving his job talk I think . 
D:  um , 
D:  Sorry . 
D:  I was just reading the screen . 
D:  Oh , no . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Good . 
D:  Reference . 
D:  I haven't done it yet . 
D:  Oh plants ? e u someone who can plant difficult things . 
D:  Well , in this case it 's a p it 's a  sort of testing of the wizard rather than of the subject . 
D:  It 's uh  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That might be a little unfair . 
D:  Um . 
D:  I 'm sure if we uh ,  
D:  You think there 's a chance we might need Liz for , whatever , the technical side of things ? 
D:  I 'm sure we can get  other people around who don't know anything  um , if we want another subject . 
D:  You know . Like I can drag Ben into it or something . 
D:  Although he might cause problems 
D:  but . 
D:  So , is it a experimental setup for the um , data collection  totally  ready  determined ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  OK . 
D:  So the ideal task um ,  will have  whatever 
D:  I don't know how much the structure of the evolving Bayes - net <breath>  will af affect  
D:  Like we wanna  we wanna be able to collect <breath> as much of the variables that are needed for that , 
D:  right ? 
D:  in the course of the task ? 
D:  Well not all of them 
D:  but you know . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  OK . 
D:  So in other words this data collection is  more general . 
D:  It could  it could  be used for not just this task . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Exactly . 
D:  Looks like it . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Switching o
