D:  Ah , OK . 
D:  Hello ? 
D:  OK , 
D:  uh  What 's  
D:  Hi . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Mmm , 
D:  yep . 
D:  Yeah , very much 
D:  Yeah 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Oh 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Hmm , ah . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Huh . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  uh , No , 
D:  it 's  it 's also a quantrant uh uh  
D:  I think . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Yeah , it 's  it 's not defined yet . 
D:  Um  Yeah . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Yeah , there 's a meeting next next week I think 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah , 
D:  are there currently is uh 
D:  no syntactic analysis 
D:  but in the next release there will be some . 
D:  unless 
D:  and it 's 
D:  um uh 
D:  you can access this 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  um it 's to  to integrate and syntactic analysis . 
D:  and um add some more features like segmentation . 
D:  So then an utter more than one utterance is  There um there 's often uh pause between it 
D:  and a segmentation occurs . 
D:  um 
D:  yeah 
D:  No  no it 's  uh I think it 's it 's totally complicated for 
D:  it 's just one  one person 
D:  and so I have to keep the  
D:  Yeah , 
D:  ah and so <laugh> things must be simpler 
D:  but uh , Miel syntactic analysis with um finite state transducers . 
D:  Yeah , uh the problem is th that it has to be very fast 
D:  because um if you want to for more than one path anywhere 
D:  what 's in the latches from the speech recognizer 
D:  so it 's speed is crucial . 
D:  uh 
D:  And they are not fast enough . 
D:  And they also have to be very robust . cuz of um speech recognition errors 
D:  and 
D:  I think it 's that 
D:  might , 
D:  at Tuebingen I thought . 
D:  was  Do you know something about that ? 
D:  In Tub - at  
D:  oh 
D:  Oh from  from Stuttgart , 
D:  yeah , also 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  yeah . 
D:  yeah 
D:  that 's In this direction , 
D:  yes 
D:  Yeah , it 's in  in this direction . 
D:  Mm - hmm , yeah , 
D:  it would be very interesting , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mmm , yeah . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  um 
D:  yeah , I 've  I 've looked at it 
D:  but  but it 's no  not much uh information available . 
D:  I found , 
D:  but it 's also finite - state transducers , I thought . 
D:  and 
D:  Yeah , and  and Purely finite - state transducers are not so good for German since there 's um 
D:  The word order is  is uh not fixed 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . Also it 's uh  it 's um  Yes , uh the um choice between uh this processing and that processing and my template matcher . 

D:  Um , yeah but it 's all in the  in the lexicon . 
D:  So it 's  
D:  Yeah th the information is available . 
D:  So  
D:  Yeah 
D:  Yeah , we can , 
D:  oh yeah . 
D:  We have knowledge bases from  from Verbmobil system we can use 
D:  and so . 
D:  It  
D:  um 
D:  Yeah , but  but it 's used for  for stem forms . 
D:  Oh , OK . 
D:  What ? 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  um Not yet but it 's planned to do that . 
D:  Yeah 
D:  Oh yes . 
D:  um Yeah , 
D:  it 's um I think it 's um 
D:  yes , it 's  it 's um possible to  to do list processing . 
D:  and Maybe this is um more adequate for English 
D:  and in German um set processing is used . 
D:  Maybe yeah . 
D:  Some extensions uh have to be made . For  for a English version 
D:  Mm - hmm , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  Ah  
D:  mmm . No . 
D:  Oder there was an  talk ? 
D:  uh Mmm , yeah . 
D:  Ah . 
D:  Mmm , ah . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Ah , OK .
