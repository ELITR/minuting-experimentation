A:  So what happened since , um , <breath> last week is  
A:  well , from OGI , these experiments on  putting VAD on the baseline . 
abst_sum - abstract: The ICSI Meeting Recorder Group at Berkeley met to discuss progress on their main project, Aurora.

C:  I have something just fairly brief to report on . 
C:  And  but it runs much much faster . 
C:  I  I think m  it only took something like , uh , three or four hours to do the full training , 
C:  as opposed to wh what , sixteen hours or something like that ? 
C:  Oh , the other thing that I did was , um , <breath> I compiled  the HTK stuff for the Linux boxes . 
A:  There was a conference call this Tuesday . 
A:  I don't know yet the  <breath> what happened <breath> Tuesday , 
A:  but <breath> the points that they were supposed to discuss is still , <mouth> uh , things like <breath> the weights , 
A:  So what happened since , um , <breath> last week is  
B:  There was a <breath> start of some effort on something related to voicing or something . 
A:  So basically we try to , <breath> <breath> uh , find <breath> good features that could be used for voicing detection , 
abst_sum - abstract: They discussed a conference call with project partners, there have been some developments that should help speed up experiments, along with some progress made in the current area they are looking, voiced/unvoiced detection.

D:  N um , not not not much is new . 
B:  Um , anything to  add ? 
E:  Well , I 've been continuing reading . 
E:  I went off on a little tangent this past week , 
abst_sum - abstract: A number of other members of the group also reported the progress they were making on their work.

C:  I 've forgotten now what the name of that machine is 
C:  but I can  I can send email around about it . 
C:  Um , you have to make  you have to make sure that in your dot CSHRC , <breath> um , it detects whether you 're running on the Linux or a  a Sparc and points to the right executables . 
C:  and you may not have had that in your dot CSHRC before , if you were always just running the Sparc . 
C:  uh , I can  I can tell you exactly what you need to do to get all of that to work . 
abst_sum - decisions: Me018 will mail people with details about changes to their system in order to run code on the IBM Linux machine, along with the name of the machine.

B:  When you say " we have that " , does Sunil have it now , too , 
A:  No . 
A:  Because we 're still testing . 
A:  So we 'll perhaps <breath> <mouth> <breath> try to convince OGI people to use the new  <breath> the new filters 
B:  Uh , has  has anything happened yet on this business of having some sort of standard , uh , source , 
A:  not yet 
A:  but I wi I will <breath> call them 
A:  now they are  I think they have more time 
A:  well , Eurospeech deadline is <breath> over 
abst_sum - decisions: Mn007 is going to try and convince OGI to use his new filters, and enquire as to the setting of a standard for the system.

A:  There was a conference call this Tuesday . 
A:  I don't know yet the  <breath> what happened <breath> Tuesday , 
A:  but <breath> the points that they were supposed to discuss is still , <mouth> uh , things like <breath> the weights , 
abst_sum - problems: There was a conference call for the Aurora Project, but no one from ICSI was involved.

B:  Do you know who was  who was  since we weren't in on it , uh , do you know who was in from OGI ? 
A:  but <breath> the points that they were supposed to discuss is still , <mouth> uh , things like <breath> the weights , 
A:  I have no idea . 
A:  So the points were the  the weights  how to weight the different error rates <breath> that are obtained from different language and  and conditions . 
A:  it 's not clear that they will keep the same kind of weighting . 
A:  Some people are arguing that it would be better to have weights on 
A:  well , to  to combine error rates  before computing improvement . 
A:  And so , perhaps they will change the weights to  
B:  Well , I mean , the fact that it 's inconsistent is an obvious mistake . 
B:  But the question is , do you average the relative improvements  or do you average the error rates and take the relative improvement maybe of that ? 
B:  And the thing is it 's not just a pure average because there are these weightings . 
B:  It 's just when you  when you get all done , I think that they pro 
B:  but I think they started off this process with the notion that <breath> you should be  significantly better than the previous standard . 
B:  so they said " how much is significantly better ? 
B:  And  and so they said " well , <breath> you know , you should have half the errors , " or something , " that you had before " . 
B:  But it does seem like 
B:  i i it does seem like it 's more logical to combine them first 
A:  But there is this  this  is this still this problem of weights . 
A:  When  when you combine error rate it tends to  give more importance to the difficult cases , 
A:  Some people think that <breath> it 's more important to look at  <breath> to have ten percent imp relative improvement on  well - matched case than to have fifty percent on the m mismatched , 
A:  and other people think that it 's more important to improve a lot on the mismatch 
C:  It sounds like they don't really have a good idea about what the final application is gonna be . 
B:  I mean , they don they  they don't  they don't really  know , I think . 
B:  So the argument for that being the  the  the more important thing , <breath> is that you 're gonna try and do that , <breath> but you wanna see how badly it deviates from that when  when  when the , uh  it 's a little different . 
B:  The opposite argument is you 're never really gonna have a good sample of all these different things . 
B:  I gather that in these meetings it 's  it 's really tricky to make anything <breath> ac <breath> make any  policy change 
B:  because <breath> <clears throat> everybody has  has , uh , their own opinion 
A:  but there is probably a  a big change that will <breath> be made 
A:  is that the  the baseline  th they want to have a new baseline , perhaps , 
A:  And apparently , <mouth> uh , some people are pushing to still keep this fifty percent number . 
A:  So they want <breath> to have at least fifty percent improvement on the baseline , 
B:  So whose VAD 
A:  Uh , they didn't decide yet . 
abst_sum - problems: Not only are the group unsure what if anything was decided, but project changes are being considered including changing the baseline and improvement weighting, though everyone has their own opinion on these matters.

B:  and  he 's been doing all the talking 
B:  This is  this by the way a bad thing . 
B:  We 're trying to get , um , m more female voices in this record as well . 
B:  Make sur make sure Carmen <laugh> talks as well . 
F:  I don't know . 
abst_sum - problems: The group needs more female voices in the Meeting Recorder data, though fn002 does not consider herself very suitable.
