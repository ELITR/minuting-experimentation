F:  After the  after , uh , the result for the TI - digits <breath> on the meeting record there will be foreigns people . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Good . 
F:  Yeah . It depends . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh , this is a  
F:  OK . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Isn't it 
F:  Oh , well , I have the picture . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  We have some  
F:  uh , um , this , this , and this . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  We have here some histogram , 
F:  but they have a lot of overlap . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  We , uh , use  TIMIT on this , 
F:  for  
F:  But if we look at it in one sentence , it  apparently it 's good , 
F:  I think . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  No . 
F:  Uh , we distend the  we have the twenty - three coefficient af after the mel f <breath> filter , 
F:  and we extend these coefficient between the  all the frequency range . 
F:  And i the interpolation i between the point <breath> is  give for the triang triangular filter , the value of the triangular filter 
F:  and of this way we obtained this mode this model speech . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  mmm Yeah , it 's linear . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  At the n 
F:  at the center of the filter  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I have here one example if you  if you want see something like that . 
F:  Two thou two   fifteen hundred ? 
F:  No . 
F:  Two hundred and fifty thousand . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Two thousand and fifteen hundred . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Log domain . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  The dif 
F:  No . Unvoiced , I don't have 
F:  for unvoiced . 
F:  I 'm sorry . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  This is the  between  
F:  No . 
F:  But it 's this , 
F:  but between the frequency that we are considered for the excitation  
F:  for the difference 
F:  and this is the difference . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Because we begin , <breath> uh , in fifteen <mouth> point  the fifteen point . 
F:  Fifteen p 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  This is the  the auto - correlation  the R - zero energy . 
F:  For  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I have the mean . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Here . 
F:  Ah , no . 
F:  This is this ? 
F:  More close . Is this ? 
F:  And this . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Less robust . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Uh , not here . 
F:  No , I have s 
F:  But not here . 
F:  Not here . 
F:  Well , so . 
F:  I can't see you  now . 
F:  I don't have . 
F:  Pfft . 
F:  Oops . 
F:  The mean is different <laugh> with it , 
F:  because the  <breath> the histogram for the  <breath> the classifica 
F:  Oh ! 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  I have here the same frame for the  clean speech  
F:  the same cle 
F:  But they are a difference . 
F:  Because here the FFT is only with <breath> two hundred fifty - six point 
F:  and this is with five hundred  twelve . 
F:  Fifty millis 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  No . 
F:  This is the signal . 
F:  This is the signal . 
F:  The frame . 
F:  This is the fra the original frame . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And here  
F:  No , well . 
F:  No . 
F:  Maybe we can do that . 
F:  FFT . Filter bank , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh , I  I am doing this . 
F:  Yeah , yeah . 
F:  I don't know . 
F:  I 'm sorry , 
F:  but 
F:  I think that for the recognizer for the meeting recorder that it 's better that I don't speak . 
F:  Because  
F:  After the  after , uh , the result for the TI - digits <breath> on the meeting record there will be foreigns people .
