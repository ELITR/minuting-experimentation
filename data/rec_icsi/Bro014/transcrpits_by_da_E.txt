E:  L fifty . 
E:  Almost . 
E:  Doo - doop , doo - doo . 
E:  Doo , doo - doo . 
E:  Doo - doo . 
E:  Uh , one , two , 
E:  Oh . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Hmm . Cool . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  So at  at the middle o where the arrows are showing , that 's  you 're adding one more mixture per state , 
E:  or  ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  Oh , OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  For  
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Oh . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  It 's noisy TIMIT . 
E:  Oh , sorry . 
E:  Oh . 
E:  Sure looks  
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Um . 
E:  Well , I 've been continuing reading . 
E:  I went off on a little tangent this past week , 
E:  um , 
E:  looking at , uh , <breath> uh , modulation s spectrum stuff , 
E:  um , 
E:  and  and learning a bit about what  what , um  what it is , 
E:  and , uh , the importance of it in speech recognition . 
E:  And I found some  <breath> some , uh , neat papers , <breath> um , historical papers from , <mouth> um , <breath> Kanedera , Hermansky , and Arai . 
E:  And they  they did a lot of experiments where th where , <breath> um , they take speech <breath> and , um , e they modify <breath> the , uh  
E:  they  they  they measure the relative importance of having different , um , portions of the modulation spectrum intact . 
E:  And they find that the  the spectrum between one and sixteen hertz in the modulation <breath> is , uh  is im important for speech recognition . 
E:  Um . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Um  
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Um , I was thinking more like using them as  as the inputs to  to the detectors . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  S 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  We can talk more about it later . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  L fifty .
