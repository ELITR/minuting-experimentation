C:  <inbreath> Yeah . So I  I  @ @ Adam sent around this thing about what we were going to talk about and  and th we had had this discussion of , uh , flipping back and forth between an emphasis on  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  on the technology , particularly recognition , versus , uh , the recordings and transcriptions and so on . 
B:  <mike noise> 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Um , but , um , I was asking , if we could , to  uh , kind of make it 
C:  just whatever is happening rather than one or the other because , uh , next weekend  next week I 'll be at a meeting on campus and after that I 'll be Europe for , 
B:  <mike noise> 
G:  Sure . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  uh , several meetings ' worth . Uh , you folks 'll be gone for a couple of the meetings ' worth in  in Europe also , right ? 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  I overlap exactly with the times you 're gone . I mean  
G:  <clears throat> 
C:  Really ? OK . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah .  
C:  <mouth> So . 
C:  <breath> 
C:  So , uh , you didn't  you didn't get an agenda , I guess . We 've got the usual  
topic_description:	opening


G:  There 're some words that weren't  
F:  OK . We 're on . 
G:  See , there 're some stretches that weren't even in one or the other , so  
B:  Right . It would have to be hand  Right . 
G:  <inbreath> 
H:  Yeah . 
G:  What are you gonna do about those , though ? You 're never  
B:  It would have to be  
B:  Well , a h a person would  would check it over and then 
A:  Hello ? OK . 
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  give a final  
C:  <mouth> 
A:  Should we close the door ? 
F:  Oh , we 'll wait for Chuck . Close the door behind him . 
H:  I mean , if recognition 's better on the channelized segmentations , then  
C:  <inbreath> <vocal squeak>   
B:  <inbreath> I 'm  
B:  Well , it 's more 
C:  We 're  we 're recording by the way , just for   
B:  you didn't  
B:  Oh , sorry .  
C:  I mean , uh u 
F:  Y you can keep talking , but you should be aware . 
C:  You can keep talking . I just  I just  <inbreath> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  g guess you were gonna  
B:  You were saying that we were waiting for Chuck , so I just  OK . 
C:  <inbreath> Well  
F:  Well , and then , uh  then Morgan said " why don't we start ? " and I said " O K " . 
B:  <mike noise> 
C:  So the compromise is we 're  we 're starting but we 're leaving the door open . <laugh> So we 'll have a little more background noise and  <laugh> Uh . 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  OK . 
B:  <mike noise> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  Or we can close the door and make Chuck knock  when he comes . <laugh> 
B:  <whistle>  
H:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <mouth> Well , I tend to  
B:  <mike noise> 
A:  th there 're a couple meetings where there are a lot of preambles like this ,  in which case the transcription doesn't start until someone actually says 
A:  " OK . " <laugh> So , we 're starting right now . <laugh> 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  Really ? <breath> 
B:  Well , that 's good . 
C:  Yeah . Oh , yeah . The meeting 's started . This is  this is the real thing . <inbreath> 
A:  This is the  <mouth> <inbreath> 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  This is the real thing . Oh well , never mind , it wasn't . There goes Chuck . <laugh> Just kidding , it was . <inbreath> OK , so . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  And Chuck gets stuck with the ear - plug mike . 
C:  <inbreath> 
F:  @ @  
C:  OK . Last guy in <inbreath> gets the  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah .  
A:  u 
I:  <mike noise while sets up> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Didn't get the door .  <breath-laugh> 
C:  <inbreath> Oh , you just get the door now . Yeah . 
F:  But he didn't shut the door . I got it  since

topic_description:	transcriptions


F:  Well , because no one  no one ever rep responded  with any items . So I have  a couple of minor ones . Uh , 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  our  normal transcription status , just so that we can make some  
F:  some plans . So wha what 's up with IBM , Chuck ? Do you know ? 
I:  Um , 
I:  I think Brian is on vacation now but , uh , before he left we gave him , 
G:  <mike noise> 
I:  uh , another set of meetings to give to the transcribers . And  
G:  <mike noise> 
H:  How many ? 
I:  Uh , what is it ? Four ? 
F:  <mouth> Is  is yours working there , Chuck ? 
D:  Four . 
H:  Oh . 
I:  Four . 
G:  <breath> 
F:  Can you  ? 
F:  You 're b you 're B ? 
I:  Test . 
I:  What am I ? 
A:  Is it turned on ?  
F:  There 's no on . 
I:  Test . 
A:  OK .  
I:  <mike noise> 
I:  <inbreath>  Yeah . 
F:  Oh . It 's just  I 'll  Let me raise the gain on that a little bit 
A:  Channel B . 
I:  OK . 
A:  Channel B .  
F:  since it 's so far from your mouth . 
I:  <mike noise> 
B:  <mike noise> 
F:  Sorry . 
C:  <inbreath> OK . <clears throat> So we sent them  
I:  So we gave them four meetings before he left and , um , 
I:  that 's it . So , um , I don't think we 'll hear from him before he gets back . 
F:  OK . 
C:  <inbreath> And the 
A:  <mouth> Do they know about your pie chart ? 
H:  <laugh> 
I:  <mouth> I don't know . 
A:  OK .  
I:  I don't know . 
C:  What pie chart ? 
F:  Pie ? Oh . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  He has a nice pie chart on the , uh , s the current status page , 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  <mike noise> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Pie .  
A:  which shows the amount of transc amount of data that had been transcribed and the amount  out of the entire  and 
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  at this point it 's not quite half . 
A:  Wouldn't  Is that what you 'd say , with the pie chart ? 
A:  <inbreath> 
I:  Yeah . 
A:  And then of that , there 's , uh , a little sliver  I could try and draw it but it 's probably better to describe . <laugh> So  <breath-laugh> 
C:  Half the data that 's been recorded has been transcribed ? 
A:  Roughly . Almost . Not quite . <inbreath> And I haven't actually caught up with , uh  since I got back so recently from my vacation . 
C:  Wow ! That 's getting pretty good . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  Um , I know that the transcribers finished , um , uh , several meetings while I was gone . 
I:  <mouth> Oh . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  And I haven't told you cuz I haven't  I haven't figured out which ones they are y are yet . But when that happens , then that pie will get even closer to the midline . It 's not quite  
B:  <mike noise> 
I:  Right . 
B:  <mike noise> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
I:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  not quite fifty percent but  really getting close . 
C:  <breath> Hmm . 
F:  <mouth> OK . So also , um  
A:  I think it will be . 
G:  You mean , pi will be close to one half ? 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  <laugh> That 's new . <laugh> 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <inbreath> Well , <laugh> not mathematically . n <laugh> 
H:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  Now , that 's a strange  <laugh> 
C:  Well , if we can have three point one four times as much tr transcribed as we recorded , we really would be doing well .  
G:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  Yep . 
G:  Right . 
F:  <mouth> Um . So  
A:  But it 's a nice  it 's  I recommend his  his  his graphic , cuz it 's  it 's a really nice graphic . 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  You know , this  this raises some  
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <mike noise> 
F:  <inbreath> How much  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  <laugh>  
C:  <mike noise> 
G:  How do you transcribe that ? 
topic_description:	IBM, transcriptions status


F:  How much do we need transcribed before it 's worth doing some trainings ? 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
H:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  Oh . B uh  
B:  Mmm . 
F:  I mean , it seems like probably we have enough now . Right ? Because , like  like Macrophone wasn't that much data . Right ? And it helped . 
G:  We can  
B:  You mean  
G:  Well , we already use it for digit training . 
B:  But  but that was read speech . 
F:  You only used that for digits ? Right . 
G:  I mean  
G:  Well , we did do some training on digits  uh , rather adaptation on digits  digits . I mean , supervised adaptation . So . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <inbreath> Yeah . I mean , uh  
B:  Maybe like twenty hours . We could try , but  
B:  Maybe not counting the non - native 
B:  speech , cuz if  That  that just doesn't translate very well . 
topic_description:	amount of transcriptions needed


G:  <mouth> Well , 
G:  <breath> I would  I would love to do some , um  
G:  you know , with adaptation you can use fairly small amount of data to improve your performance . <inbreath> Um , 
F:  Right . 
G:  and 
G:  n you know , it 's just basically , uh  
G:  uh 
G:  You know , I  I don't have to time to  to do too much these days except what I 'm already doing . So  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  um , but if there 's some  someone has some free time , I 'm  I 'll be happy to show them 
G:  how it works and  you can play with it . 
F:  Cool . 
F:  <inbreath> Um . 
C:  <inbreath>  
C:  <outbreath> 
C:  Uh , I thought you  you were already using adaptation 
G:  <inbreath> No , supervised adaptation . So , we 're doing s unsupervised speaker adaptation . 
C:  w on the test set . 
F:  Supervised . 
C:  I see . 
G:  But <inbreath> you could  build a test set which you sort of take your models and ada 
C:  Oh , OK . 
C:  Got it . <outbreath> 
G:  do supervised adaptation . And then you start with the speaker adaptation from sort of channel - adapted <inbreath> or room - adapted or whatever . <inbreath> 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . Yeah , whatever this is . 
topic_description:	speaker adaptation


F:  <mouth> H how would you imagine doing a test set on this corpus ? A test set , training set division ? <inbreath> 
F:  I mean , it it 's really weird . Right ? Because it 's  it would be hard to get speaker disjoint sets . 
G:  <mouth> Right . 
F:  Do y do we just give up on that ? 
B:  Right . And actually the  I was thinking about this   the original application doesn't really appl 
B:  I mean , if you 're using this over and over again , you 're gonna be testing on the same  the same speakers . 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  Well , but then you have the supervised versus unsupervised question . 
B:  I just mean that it 's not a terrible thing to assume that you don't  that 
B:  you don't have disjoint sets , 
C:  <mike noise> 
F:  Right . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So . 
B:  for this particular kind of  application . 
C:  <inbreath> Right . <outbreath> Yeah . 
B:  I mean  
F:  Yeah . 
C:  I mean , you could have some 
C:  parts of it that are disjoint and some that aren't , and see what the difference is , you know , 
G:  <inbreath> It 's  it 's sort of like in , um , Broadcast News  because you have those people who re - occur 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  on the others . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  over and over . I mean , 
G:  the anchor speakers tend typically . So , um  
F:  Right . 
G:  m m m m 
G:  Yeah . As long as you 're aware that you 're doing that , that 's  I don't see that as a problem . 
C:  You can separate it out and see how  if they 're  Yeah . 
F:  And then s s similarly with subject matter . That , you know , if you 're training your language model on 
B:  <outbreath> 
F:  this meeting only and testing on this meeting only , you 're gonna do a lot better than if you start crossing them . <mouth> 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Somewhat . Although what 's interesting is that the majority of the words in the language model are actually  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Are the same . 
B:  <breath> 
B:  Yeah . They 're actually these , like , function words and " Yeah ! " and s stuff like that . And there there 's a lot of speaker dependence there . 
F:  Sure . 
H:  <mike noise> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <outbreath> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Even the transcribers will say they know who the speaker is after a while just from their 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  Just from word choice ? Yeah . 
B:  backchannels and  Right . So y So , I don't think you 're 
B:  talking the way you write , in  in other words . 
F:  Most certainly . So it 's just , uh , 
C:  <breath> 
F:  if we 're gonna do that we should  give some thought to how we wanna divide it up . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , so , you know , maybe someone else would do  a lot of the work where probably  your advice 
G:  Yeah .  
topic_description:	meeting data test set


F:  Yeah . And similarly with digits . We now have a lot of digits but most of them aren't transcribed . 
C:  would be helpful . 
F:  <clears throat> So if we wanted to do a forced alignment on them , we could start collecting ourselves up a fairly large digit corpus . 
H:  <mike noise> 
C:  Yeah . Well , we 'd  
F:  And so , same issue . You know we just need to get 
C:  We want that for sure . Yeah . 
F:  someone who 's interested in that to start looking at it . 
C:  <breath>  
F:  So who 's working on digits currently ? 
C:  <inbreath> Uh , Dave Gelbart . 
F:  OK , maybe I 'll talk to him and see if he 's interested . 
B:  <mike noise> 
C:  Not  right away . He 's got prelims and  Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . <breath-laugh> 
F:  Yeah , certainly . He wants to pass the prelims . <breath-laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  Hmm . 
topic_description:	digit corpus transcriptions


C:  Um , <mouth> 
C:  one thing , uh , uh , just a e uh , uh , an announcement of sorts is that , um , 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  Chuck is gonna be going to a meeting at NIST , 
C:  in , uh , about a month and a half , I guess . They 're still working out the date . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  cuz they want to gather together sort of one person from each site who is involved in the meeting stuff since they 're going to be doing 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  a bunch of meeting recordings there . And so , uh . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <mouth> Is , uh  ? Are the CMU folks gonna be there ? 
B:  <mike noise> 
C:  <inbreath> Somebody  you know , it 's like one person  at the moment it 's one person from each site . So there 'll be somebody from the CMU , and somebody from here , and somebody from , 
C:  <inbreath> uh , a  a number of places . Probably somebody from UW . Um . 
C:  So . 
C:  <inbreath> Yeah , it 's possible they 'll open it up to more people . But  but I think , you know , the main thing is just to , 
C:  uh  uh  uh  uh , it 's not a  it 's not a conference . It 's not a workshop , really . It 's just connecting with them . 
F:  Right . 
C:  So . 
C:  <breath> Um . So , then if they start a bunch of recordings then ultimately they 'll  
B:  <mike noise> 
C:  they 'll have training sets and test sets , and  <inbreath> and all that  all that stuff , and  But . 
F:  <mouth> 
G:  But it would be interesting to hear what they intend to do about the speaker overlap , for instance . 
F:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	upcoming NIST meeting


B:  What 's the plan if  were we still going to be like a  center for transcribing data ? What happens if 
B:  th they don't deliver things until  next year or something when we  have less  resources or  ? 
C:  I 
C:  <breath> Well , again the hope is <outbreath> that , uh  I mean , it 's  it 's looking  I mean , I have to ask these folks but , uh , my impression is that the , um , IBM 
F:  <clears throat> 
F:  Yep . 
C:  path is looking , you know , more promising . 
F:  It  it  pretty good . Yeah . 
C:  <inbreath> 
B:  Hmm . 
C:  And if that 's the case and if it turns out that , uh , it 's really a relatively small amount of time 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  for our transcribers to process things before and after , if they really have taken out enough of the  of the , uh , 
C:  uh , work that  that it 's f feasible , then maybe we can do it with a smaller staff next year . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  I mean , <inbreath> next  next year , uh , in which he 's  you 're referring to is , uh , next year we  we don't have a whole lot of guaranteed funding for this  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  this work . Um , other funding may come . 
C:  You know that 's  But  but if we wanna just count on , uh , 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  uh , what we know about , it 's  it 's more modest than this year . Uh , it 's still  there 'll still be money , 
C:  but it 's just more modest . So  <inbreath> 
C:  um , so I would see us as probably not doing more recordings  at least for  for  for meetings or  or digits or anything . 
G:  <mike noise> 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  But , uh , if  if we feel that we need to , probably still doing some recordings for SmartKom or something . 
C:  <inbreath> Um , but otherwise just , you know , stop that and just  take whatever comes from the other places , which , 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  uh , I guess we have an u unknown rate . If it  if it starts being  if they 're generating this huge amount and we can't 
C:  handle it then , you know , we 'll tell them . 
C:  But . 
C:  Uh , although it would have been nice if that  their stuff had come earlier , it it 's in some ways a good thing , because we 've been <laugh-sniff> ironing out this  path . 
C:  So .  
topic_description:	future data collection, transcription plans


F:  Um . Well , I got a email from one of the UW guys . They want to record the meetings at higher , uh , sampling rate than sixteen  kilohertz . Uh , 
F:  I didn't ask why . But it seems to me  that really doesn't matter . If they have the disk space to do it , 
F:  it seems that that  is not a big deal . 
F:  I was just wondering if anyone had  an opinion 
C:  <mouth> Well , it 's just if that they 're sending it to us , then we have to have the disk space to do it too . 
F:  about mismatched  rates . 
A:  Can't we downsample and , uh , transcribe on that basis ? 
C:  That would be the hope . Yeah . d Are they  doing some nice integer multiple or  ? 
F:  Yep . 
B:  <outbreath> 
F:  Excuse me ? 
C:  <inbreath> Are they doing some nice integer multiple of th of sixteen ? 
F:  No . 
B:  Are they  they 're doing , like , twenty - two or s ?  
G:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  No . No , no , it was like forty something . Forty - four , forty - two . 
B:  Could  Forty - eight ? Forty  forty - four ? Yeah . CD - ROM . Yeah . 
H:  F 
H:  So , CD . 
D:  CD . Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh , forty - four point one . 
B:  Forty - four . 
H:  Forty - four one . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  S 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  Something like that . 
H:  <clears throat> 
C:  Oh , so that 's  
C:  <inbreath> Well , you know , we record here at for at forty - eight or something and then we downsample . 
F:  And then we downsample . Yep . 
H:  But forty - eight 's a nice multiple of  eight . 
B:  <inbreath> But  but it  but forty - four and sixteen are not 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well you can do it . 
H:  You can do it , I think . 
B:  easy ? Yeah ? It 's not lossy ? 
C:  Oh , absolutely you can do it . Yeah . You can do  you can go from anything to anything else . 
H:  You c y 
C:  But  but it 's  it 's just  it 's  it 's just a little more complicated . 
F:  You get aliasing . 
B:  As long as you 're  Yeah . As long as you 're not doing the processing on the  downsampled  I mean  
H:  There 's probably some  
C:  <inbreath> It 's just like  
B:  Just for transcribing it , you mean ?  
C:  Yeah . So  u u u 
C:  Yeah . I mean , it 's just slightly more complicated , but it 's  but i you can  you can go from any frequency to anyth any other frequency . So it 's  
F:  Well , the  the only thought was if we 're gonna do a combined corpus , does it really matter if some 's sampled at one rate and some 's sampled at the other ? My feeling is no , it doesn't . 
G:  <mike noise> 
B:  <mike noise> 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  Your audio , u these days audio tools tend to take care of all of that . 
F:  But I just wanted to double check with other people before I told them " yeah , no problem " . 
A:  <mouth> Also seems like the corpus could all be standardized on s on this  the , uh  Yeah . 
F:  That 's what I was saying . So  so  
I:  Why are  why are they asking us ? 
F:  I don't know . 
F:  Why are they asking us ? Because , you know , we 're sort of doing the corpus , so they want to be as similar as possible . 
E:  <breath> 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  A and , so I gue <outbreath> 
F:  So . But I think the answer is , if  if we tell him " no , that 's not alright " , what he 'll probably say is " well , we 're gonna do it anyway " . But , uh , 
G:  It could be interesting . 
I:  Well that 's  that 's why I 'm asking . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  Well , it will be interesting to find out why they are choosing a higher sampling  
E:  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . 
F:  Uh . Yep . 
C:  <inbreath> Well , I would suspect it 's because it 's what the hardware does . 
H:  It 's kind of a s 
B:  For  
F:  Oh , and they just don't want to downsample ? 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <inbreath> Yeah . 
H:  Well , someone 's gonna have to downsample . 
G:  But then they 're just  they 're just  there 's just deferring the problem to later and they might save themselves a lot of disk space problems by doing it right away . <breath> 
H:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  They 're taking up more disk space . <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . It  
D:  Yeah . 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  I  I <inbreath> I think it 's the sort of thing that 's deserving of discussion 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  OK . 
C:  with them . I d I don't think it 's like , i uh , they 'll ask us , we 'll give a simple answer and come back . It needs some back and forth because it 's  <inbreath> 
G:  I mean that 's wha 
B:  <mike noise> Yeah . 
C:  it it 's a little gnarly to have parts of the database with different things . And it 's , 
G:  That 's like three times  three times as much disk space . 
H:  Yeah . It 's  four or five times . 
A:  <mouth> <inbreath>  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <inbreath> 
H:  Depends what you save . 
C:  um , 
C:  <breath> i 
C:  You know , part of the arguments for the higher sampling rate is that maybe there 's something , you know , say , in six to ten kilohertz that 
B:  <mike noise> 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  you might use for  for some purposes somewhere . If people are doing a wide range of things , doing location , 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  uh , you know , doing a bunch of things , maybe , you know , why  why throw it away if you don't need to ? 
H:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Um , on the other hand , um , I mean , 
C:  it 's @ @  <laugh> sixty kilohertz is plenty .  So  <laugh> so  <inbreath> 
F:  Yep . That 's wh that 's what I thought . 
H:  Yeah . 
C:  So , uh , I th I  I think it 's  it 's , uh  
C:  And they are gonna be using up a lot of disk , both for th them and for us when we 're pr processing their stuff , uh , if they 
G:  <breath> 
G:  <breath> We should warn them that these disk space issues  are gonna creep up on them very fast . <laugh> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  Yep . Yep . 
B:  They 'll have to start kicking people out of the meetings , like  
C:  Well , i w wa if  if they 're going at forty - four , they won't even creep . <laugh> They 'll just pounce . 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , but  
E:  <laugh> 
G:  <inbreath> Right . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
H:  Yeah .  
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  <mouth> <inbreath>  
B:  As long as they have only , like , three people per meeting . <breath-laugh> 
I:  How many channels ? 
B:  I mean , they can just limit the number of people .  
H:  <breath> 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  Um , I don't remember what their hardware set - up was but it was smaller than ours . 
C:  Well , that might help a bit . 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  <breath> Yeah , actually I think at NIST they were ta there were  there was some discussion of fairly high sampling rates too , so . 
F:  <mouth> Well , with NIST I think 
F:  they 're  they 're in a different situation cuz they 're doing video . 
F:  And so compared to the video , the audio is just noise in terms of disk space , literally .  
H:  Hmm . 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  I don't think that 's true . 
F:  Really ? 
C:  They 're recording fifty channels of mikes . 
F:  They 're not recording all fifty of the  array . They 're  they 're cooking it down , aren't they ? 
C:  Yeah , they are . 
B:  Yeah . They were g they said they were gonna record @ @  I don't know if there were fifty , but there were definitely above , like , twenty . 
C:  <mike noise> 
C:  They 're recording all of them . 
F:  Whew .  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> 
F:  That 's funny . I thought that they were cooking down that data  in some way before they were storing it . 
B:  It was  it was high . 
C:  I don't believe so . No . I don't think so . 
H:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  No . So I think they  they have actually a very large audio data rate . I think it is comparable to a video data rate . 
H:  <laugh> OK . 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  So . <laugh> 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
I:  How in the world are they gonna ever distribute this ? 
F:  Yeah , distributing  They 're not going to . 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  Uh .  
D:  <outbreath> 
I:  You 're gonna have to just get  
C:  Interesting question . <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
I:  Because our  
F:  You 'll have to just work on little subsets of it . There 's just no way  you could get it all . 
B:  <laugh> 
I:  <inbreath> We 're  we 're estimating that ours  
G:  <breath-laugh> 
I:  if we collect say a hundred meetings and each meeting is just the audio , compressed audio 's half a gig , so there 's fifty gigs just for our corpus . 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  <breath> <mike noise> 
F:  Yep . 
I:  For a hundred meetings . And , uh , you know  
H:  That 's eight kilohertz ? 
C:  And that 's  and that 's  and that 's no video . 
F:  Sixteen . 
D:  Sixteen . 
I:  That 's sixteen . 
B:  Sixteen . 
H:  Sixteen . 
I:  And so , 
C:  Sample rate , yeah . 
B:  You just get , like , 
H:  Oh , it 's shortened . Oh , OK . 
I:  even  even a distribution of fifty gigs , you know , it 's  if you use D V Ds or something , that 's  
B:  one backchannel at a time or something .  
D:  Yeah . It 's shortened . 
H:  And then shortened . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  A lot .  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
I:  It 's still , yeah , two or three D V Ds but  
C:  Yeah , not if you have to distribute the video also . 
F:  Two or three ? 
I:  If you use both sides and the two layer and all that . 
F:  It 's a lot more than that . Right ? DVD is  eight gig ? 
G:  <breath> 
C:  Well , I think you 'll have some interesting discussions next month when you go out there . I mean , how are they gonna  you know , what 's  what 's the distribution plan ? 
I:  S seventeen . @ @ 
I:  Yeah . Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  <inbreath> 
H:  <breath> 
I:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  If they have something really smart in mind , you know , maybe we can use it . I mean  I mean , 
E:  <breath> 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  w we talked about sending around a disk or a computer . <laugh> 
F:  I think that 's definitely the right way to do it . 
F:  Someone sends us disk . We  we load it with data and send it back . It 's gonna be easier than any other method . 
G:  Mmm  <breath> 
G:  Huh . 
C:  Maybe a compu maybe  
F:  Well , if not  if you want to burn the C Ds , you 're welcome to it .  <laugh> 
I:  I say we give it to LDC and let them do it . <laugh> 
F:  Well , yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
F:  Yeah , absolutely . If they have a way of doing it . I 'm thinking prior to that . 
B:  <inbreath> And there 's never any talk  ? 
H:  What 's LDC ?  
B:  Was there ever any talk of taking the , um , 
G:  Linguistic Data Consortium . 
H:  Mmm . 
B:  close - talking mikes when people aren't talking and deleting those portions ? Or is the breathing and things  ? 
F:  We already do that . Shorten does that automatically . 
B:  Yeah ? OK . 
F:  That 's why you  why  that 's why Shorten  that 's why Shorten reduces the size so much . 
B:  And if they 're still that big   
B:  I see . Yeah , that 's true . 
C:  That 's why it 's only fifty gigs . 
F:  Right . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  OK . So it 's still really big even if you 're  only one person or two people at most are actually talking all the time . 
H:  <breath-laugh> <breath-laugh> 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  Yep . 
B:  Wow . 
G:  We should just talk less . 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> Well , if you talk less it does in fact use less me d m data . 
B:  Have shorter meetings ! 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> Hey , it 's  it 's the first time I 've ever heard you ask for less data .  
B:  <mike noise> 
F:  So , the channels  
G:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  Hmm . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Sorry . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  It 's actually one way to tell if a microphone is dead in a meeting is if the shortened file is too short . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <mike noise> 
B:  Thanks , Morgan . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  It 's really short , yeah . Yeah . 
F:  <mouth> Then you can be pretty sure that the mike was off . 
A:  Oh .  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  Uh , OK . <breath> 
F:  <mouth> And , the t unfortunately the tabletop ones  the six tabletop which we record all the time no matter how many people are there , 
F:  uh , don't compress nearly as well because they 're almost always have signal on them . 
C:  Yeah , that 's probably a lot of it . And they 're gonna have mikes like that too . In fact , their array  their array will be  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah .  
D:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  Most of them . 
H:  All of them are like that . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  So they won't shorten nearly as well . 
C:  <inbreath> @ @  <outbreath> <mike noise> 
G:  <inbreath> So f so for dis 
B:  Wow . Yeah . So  so they 're really going to have a huge  
F:  And I assume they 're gonna do it lossless . 
G:  for distribution purposes it might make sense to split it by channel , 
F:  Yeah . 
G:  uh , rather than by meetings . So , 
G:  you could distribute , like , only the near - field signals , uh , uh , uh , together for a bunch of meetings and then have a second row . 
F:  Yep . Absolutely . 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  And then maybe one far - field . You know ? 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  <breath-laugh> Yeah . 
F:  It 's things  or the mixed channel . Yeah , I think there are a lot of ways to do it , but  
G:  Mmm . 
C:  <mouth> 
F:  Let 's not worry about that now . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah .  
G:  <breath> Right . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah .

F:  How are we on disk space , Chuck ? 
I:  <mouth> Um , we 're OK . We 've got  for the , uh , compressed meetings we 've still got about , I think it was four gigs , 
B:  <mike noise> 
I:  uh , on the one disk that we 're using . 
D:  <mouth> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
I:  <breath> 
I:  And we 've got several  
I:  we ' v we 've still got , uh , quite a bit of space on the , uh , un - backed - up . 
I:  <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
I:  So . But I  I think it 's probably  we should start thinking about where to go next , especially on the backed - up disk space . 
F:  Good . 
C:  <mouth> <inbreath>  
C:  Now we bought  a little  not all that long ago we brought three  uh , thirty - six gigabyte disks . 
I:  That 's the un - backed - up . 
I:  Yeah . Those are the u 
F:  Yeah , we 're using those for the  for the expanded . 
I:  So , for example , the , uh  Guenter 's Wall Street Journal data went onto one of those , uh , some other experiment things that people are doing are on there , and   
C:  Uh - huh . 
I:  <inbreath> So . 
I:  <laugh> If you put it there people will use it . Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
I:  So . 
C:  So I think after that we need another , uh , rack or something . Right ? 
I:  Have to change servers , actually . 
C:  Change servers ? 
I:  Well , we could  we could  There are a bunch of disks that we have , 
I:  uh , that are s s smaller . And they 're , like , seventeen . We could go to thirty - five . So we could <inbreath> 
I:  get some extra space out of that . But the s right now the server 's full . We couldn't add any more disks . We could  change a smaller disk for a larger one . 
C:  <inbreath> We should probably do that while  we have the space left on the  on the th the existing thirty - sixes , so that we can 
I:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
I:  Yeah . 
C:  <mike noise> 
F:  <mouth> Yeah . The problem with that for backed - up media is , uh , the sysadmins wanna keep them at eighteen meg  eighteen gig partitions 
D:  <breath> 
C:  shuffle it around . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  because that takes about a day to get off back - up tape . 
C:  Oh . 
I:  Well , then there 's the other issue is that to g to g 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  So . 
I:  add more disk now , um , David says we really need to go to new servers . But 
I:  he wants to go to new servers not just for us but for other groups too . So there 's this sort of coordination issue , and 
F:  For u the whole institute .  Yeah . 
I:  I guess I need to talk to him more about   
C:  <breath> 
F:  Actually , going to bigger disks we can do even , and just maintain the eighteen gig partitions . You just partition them into multiple . 
D:  Yeah . 
I:  Yeah . 
F:  So that 's probably the next step , is to get 
C:  That 's right . 
F:  the eighty or ninety gig drives to replace the thirty gig or an eighteen gig that we have now . 
C:  There are eighty gig drives now that you can get for that ? 
F:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  <long breath> 
G:  <breath> 
E:  <breath>

C:  <breath> See , and that 's probably what we should send around for these  <laugh> to d for distribution <laugh> of this corpus . <breath-laugh>

C:  Yeah . 
I:  Well , when they come out with an 
F:  Is  is the areal density of the microdrive higher  than of a w normal drive ? It must be . 
I:  When they come out with the eighty gig microdrive then we 'll just send one of those little things around with all the meeting data . 
F:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  <inbreath> Well , they have the two gig already . And I 'm  I 'm just thinking forty of them is probably still smaller  in area than , uh , one normal - sized drive . 
C:  Yeah . That 's what I meant , yeah . 
I:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <inbreath> Actually , what  I think what  what , uh  was it  was it Dave who was suggesting  that , uh , you just get , uh , uh , a  a computer 
F:  Yep . 
C:  that has one of these drives in it <laugh> and just send the computer around to the different sites . And you can just <laugh> get it off the computer and press the  Yeah .

F:  Eighty gig laptop .

F:  Any other items ? 
C:  So . OK , so that 's the meeting stuff . Uh , transcrip So you 're  we 're  you said it was almost half , so that means that we have , like , eighty or so hours and out of that maybe thirty - five or something are  transcribed ? 
I:  <inbreath> Yeah . The  the pie chart shows actually  m meetings that are , 
G:  <mike noise> 
C:  <cough> 
I:  uh  it combines the categories of , you know , " currently in  " 
I:  Oh ! Well , I 've got it right there , I think . 
F:  <laugh> I  I saw the pie chart sticking out , so . 
I:  Yeah . There 's  there 's just a few , uh , 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  <mouth> Do you want to write on the l on the board ? 
I:  Um . Yeah , except I  I 'm tethered . Uh , 
F:  D d do we care ? 
C:  He 's tethered , yeah . 
A:  I could write on the board . <laugh> 
I:  OK . 
H:  <breath> 
E:  <laugh> 
I:  It combines categories . So when we say " transcribed " , we mean either in the process of being transcribed , either here or at IBM , 
C:  Oh . 
C:  Yeah . 
I:  or completed transcription , 
I:  and it also includes , uh , checked . So it includes a lot of categories together . So . <inbreath> 
C:  <mouth> I see . 
F:  We need different color pens , definitely . 
I:  <mouth> And that  I think that that status thing is kinda old actually right now . 
C:  Oh , that 's  Yeah , that 's not half . Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  <mouth> Last updated in July . 
C:  <mike noise> 
I:  That one that you have ? 
A:  Oh , I 'm not sure . The one that I saw on the web when I came back . 
A:  OK .  
H:  <mike noise> 
I:  Yeah . 
I:  The  <paper rustling> 
F:  Rustle , rustle .  
I:  the date on this one is July twenty - sixth , so , uh , I have to update it . Yeah . 
C:  <mike noise> 
C:  <mike noise> 
C:  A couple weeks ago . Yeah . 
A:  <inbreath> 
C:  <clears throat> 
C:  <mouth> But about how much do we have that 's sort of , uh  ? 
A:  OK . 
G:  <breath> 
I:  So we have total number of meetings is seventy - eight  meetings and , 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
I:  uh , 
I:  uh , the total meeting time is seventy - five hours . 
H:  Oh .  
I:  And , um  <mouth> 
I:  So , <outbreath> 
I:  the ones that are finished being transcribed , as opposed to in the process of being transcribed  we 've got twenty - six hours that are 
C:  <mike noise> 
F:  Oh ! Great . 
I:  finished being transcribed . 
H:  What does that mean , " finished being transcribed " ? 
C:  <rustling> 
I:  <mouth> Um . 
I:  So there 's , uh , several processes to the transcription . There 's , uh  
I:  I it ranges from being assigned to a transcriber , 
I:  to  them finishing transcription , to then being checked , you know , with a double - check . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
I:  <inbreath> 
topic_description:	finished transcriptions


I:  And so , when we say the total transcribed , that 's the one that 's gone through being checked , I believe . 
I:  I think that 's what the  I have here . <inbreath> 
H:  OK . 
D:  Just not yet approved for  Yeah ? OK . 
I:  But not yet approved . And then there 's , uh  the final one is approved for release . That 's after the meeting participants have  gone through it . 
F:  <mouth> Oh . 
F:  So I should probably send those to you , shouldn't I ? 
H:  Oh . 
A:  Yes . At present there 's  n none of those are on the pie chart . 
I:  Yeah , if you know . 
I:  <inbreath> Yeah , currently that 's zero , released  uh , approve 
F:  There are five . 
I:  Huh ? 
F:  There are five . We have five where , uh , everyone has replied . 
A:  There 're five ? Good . 
I:  OK . 
G:  <mike noise> 
I:  OK . So we have five that are potentially releasable then . 
A:  <inbreath> So the c the cross - hatching there is , um  is it 's been through the double - check . Right ? 
A:  I mean , it 's  this is the  it 's - it 's been tran 
I:  Yeah . That 's approval in progress . Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Everything on the  <inbreath>

D:  <mike noise> 
A:  So , I mean , it 's  <laugh> 
A:  When I add a couple more from  that , uh  that were done in my absence , I think that th we 'll be down to about there .  
C:  <laugh> <mike noise> 
A:  So it 's not quite as close to half as I 'd thought , but it 's , you know  
C:  <noise> 
A:  it 's more than a  <laugh> And so these right here have been through the double - check . These haven't . 
H:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh , how nice of you , holding  holding the thing so I 'm not    
H:  <laugh>

G:  <breath>

F:  Oh , that 's right . Uh . 
F:  Yeah , we have new hardware . So , I want to set it up at some point , so I just wanted to know what meeting schedules were . 
C:  <mouth> What new hardware ?

D:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
topic_description:	hardware set-up


C:  So , wha what 's your question ? 
F:  Yeah . 
H:  Oh . 
B:  Are they like 
F:  Yeah , they 're like those . Those are the only two choices right now , unfortunately . 
B:  these , right ? OK . 
C:  So what 's your question ? 
F:  Question is , when are we not recording any meetings for a couple days so that I can do it and if it doesn't work , we won't impact people .  
C:  Well , there 's a point when a bunch of us are off at Eurospeech . 
F:  <mouth> So . 
C:  Um . 
F:  <mouth> So , what 's SmartKom ? 
D:  Nothing this week . Maybe n end of next week . 
F:  End of next week . And is EDU still recording ? 
B:  They usually do Thursdays . 
B:  I don't get a lot of advance notice , but 
B:  it 's al always been either Mondays or Thursdays . So . 
I:  Thursdays ? 
B:  Yeah . They  they often do it after  for a while they were doing it after this meeting . 
F:  So if I did it , like , tomorrow that would be alright  it sounds like ? OK . 
I:  Oh ! 
B:  Yeah . Wednesdays , Fridays  
F:  So it sounds like no one n 
B:  Definitely Wed - Definitely Wednesday I 'm not here , so I don't record anything . 
F:  No one early next week . 
C:  <sniff> 
D:  Yeah . Let me check with  Robert again , but I  I 'm  pretty sure that there 's nothing this week . 
F:  OK . 
C:  OK .

C:  <breath> <mike noise> So , I was just thinking maybe just go around and just brief briefly look 
G:  <breath> 
C:  what 's other things that are going on , maybe , since we don't  don't have much of a set a set agenda and we don't have much time . 
C:  <breath> 
D:  <mouth> 
C:  Uh . 
B:  But feel free to overlap . <breath-laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  OK , we 'll all say what we 're doing at the same time . 
B:  <laugh> No , I mean  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  I always get scared when you do these portions where you 're not gonna overlap because <laugh> there 's less data points . Sorry .  
C:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <breath> Well , why don't we d we  we deliberately pick two people to  
B:  I mean , people could , like , backchannel 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  and ask questions and stuff . <mike noise> 
A:  <mouth> <breath> 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  I 'll  I 'll  I 'll keep saying " uh - huh " . Yeah .

C:  This is absolutely natural meetings . We have <laugh> absolutely no effect from our preconceptions .  
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  So , we had  
B:  Right .  
G:  the  the transcribers  have trouble with your backchannel , because  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  With my backchannel ? 
G:  Yeah , with your backchannels . Because sometimes you have this sort of  
C:  Uh - huh . 
G:  this  this " uh - huh " that you don't n 
G:  So there 's " uh - huh " and then there 's " aha ! " . And it 's not quite clear always what  what it is you mean . Yeah . <outbreath> 
B:  Uh - huh . 
F:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  Which one it is ?  
F:  Which " uh - huh " ? 
B:  But I don't think it 's " aha ! " . It 's more like " uh - huh ! "  rather than " uh - huh " .  
D:  Yeah . 
F:  <mike noise> 
D:  I 'm  
H:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  <inbreath> 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  Yeah .  <breath-laugh> 
H:  Yeah .  
D:  I don't like the backchannels at all , as that 's  really a problem with the speech - nonspeech detection . So  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . Let 's get rid of them . 
G:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh>

topic_description:	speaker me011 progress report


F:  I mean , I 'll start if you want . I 've been , uh , most recently rewriting Transcriber in Java for no particular reason . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
H:  <mike noise> 
E:  <breath> 
H:  <mike noise> 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  <mouth> Well , for speed . 
F:  Uh .  
F:  Well , I mean , Trans - What happened was that Transcriber 's very slow to load . 
F:  So when you have a big meeting it c uh , especially on a slower machine , it can take five minutes before you can start doing anything . 
E:  <breath> 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And so I was thinking about why that was and the data structures I would use , and I found myself unable not to sit down and code it . So I did . 
C:  <clears throat> 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  <inbreath> 
C:  <breath> 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  And so I have a big chunk of Transcriber now written in Java and it comes up , you know , in a couple of seconds . Um . 
G:  u Do you take  do you take feature requests ? <laugh> 
H:  Cool . 
B:  Great . 
B:  Great . 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  Y y yeah . W we should talk to you off - line about something . 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <inbreath> Well , wait a minute , what  ? 
F:  I  It 's not really  
G:  <inbreath> That would  th w 
F:  probably not worth doing . But we can talk about it . 
G:  s 
F:  So what I don't have with it so far is it doesn't play wavefiles and it display wavefiles . I just haven't done that since 
F:  that  that part wasn't  
G:  Oh , you mean display as in showing the waveform ? OK . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And , uh  and then also a lot of the fancy user - interface stuff that 's in Transcriber I haven't done . <inbreath> 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <inbreath> 
F:  But it works . 
C:  What 's , uh , the original Transcriber written in ? 
F:  Tcl - TK . 
C:  I see . 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  So . 
C:  So . 
I:  <mouth> Are you using  ? 
F:  Which is nice and flexible but very , very slow in comparison . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . Right . 
I:  Are you using the  ? Oh , you  oh , you are . We already talked about that . The XML  
I:  <inbreath> 
F:  Yep , SAX . 
I:  Reading SAX . Yeah . 
F:  Cuz it 's much faster than DOM and uses less memory . 
I:  Right . 
I:  Right .  
F:  So . 
H:  <mike noise> 
topic_description:	rewriting Transcriber in Java


G:  Well , actually , I think it is worth doing because here 's the thing . We 're sort of  we 're starting to move from transcription to annotation . 
C:  <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  And  the Transcriber interface is fine  if essentially what you 're doing is 
F:  Annotating .  
G:  stringing words together to p 
F:  Yep . 
G:  to make transcripts . 
G:  <inbreath> But , um , in  for instance , what we 're doing now w with , uh , Communicator data , but which we would like to do with Meeting data , 
G:  is to actually label utterances , or words , or whatever units you want <inbreath> 
G:  with , uh , you know , basically doing a multiple choice type of labelling . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <inbreath> And for those type of tasks , it wou it 's much more efficient to present , 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  uh , the  th p present a bunch of , uh , clickable buttons or whatever and , um  
F:  <mouth> Dialogue .  Yeah . 
F:  Buttons .  
B:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  <mouth> But it has to be multi - stream . Th - they  
B:  In other words , the beginning of something could be one  speaker and the end of that unit , like question - answer pair , could be a different speaker . 
B:  That 's why we can't  just annotate the transcripts , uh , one  listening to one at a time . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  So  so that 's why the Transcriber 's nice for sort of listening to it , but you can't actually encode , um  
G:  Hmm .  
F:  Yeah . 
B:  encode someth Yeah , exactly . So . 
F:  I un I understand the problem . So . 
G:  <inbreath> And  and th that 's 
G:  actually a good model , which is what this current tool that we 're using has , is to atta to associate these 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  labels with , um , attributes of SGML tags . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  So , you know , you have , say , a tag for  I don't know  what type of utterance , whether it 's a question or a statement or whatever . And then 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  you have an , uh  you know , an  a tag attribute and the value of that encodes the choice . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Right . 
topic_description:	adding a multiple choice labelling feature


F:  <mouth> And then , uh , 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  preparing for quals . Uh , 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  hopefully second week of September if I can ever get Warren Sack to  answer my emails . <laugh> I probably shouldn't say that on the tape . <laugh>

A:  <laugh> 
C:  Beep .

H:  <laugh> 
I:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh>

C:  Not answering your calls , huh ? <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  actually , I wanted to 
I:  <laugh> 
F:  say off - line with you about any literature  reviews I should do beforehand . 
C:  " War and Peace . " 
F:  " War and Peace . " That 's a good choice . <laugh> Keep me busy .

C:  <breath> 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  <laugh>  
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  It 's actually not a bad idea to say " beep " as a word because you can search the transcripts , y you know , 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  for  for that , to find these places . 
F:  For " beep " . That 's a good idea . 
B:  No , I 'm s I 'm totally serious . To have one word , like " beep " , especially with a really long " eee "  like that . 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  No , absolutely . I agree . 
C:  Yeah . 
H:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  Works great .

topic_description:	chitchat


D:  Yeah . I 've been doing a bunch of recognition experiments on  meeting data with different , uh , 
D:  segmentations  with different  different automatic segmentations , but  it 's not yet finished . It 's  work in progress . 
C:  OK . Any sense about how  how it does on  ? 
B:  <mike noise> 
D:  Yeah . For , uh  for  for the paper I w I want to submit to ASRU to  <inbreath> to , 
I:  <mike noise> 
E:  <breath> 
D:  uh , evaluate the quality of the speech - nonspeech detection by  using it for speech recognition . 
C:  <inbreath> Right , but I was just asking if you had a sense yet of  of , uh , whether  
C:  maybe you already did this experiment , where there 's this question of  of how much it hurt you or helped you to use segmented 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  <inbreath> Yeah , but we didn't have the exact comparison . 
C:  versus  
D:  It  
G:  <breath> 
G:  But  you know , there were  
G:  i i 
D:  <outbreath> 
G:  the experiments were based on different segmentations and different transcripts . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> So we weren't quite sure which  whether the difference came from different  transcripts , for instance . And so <inbreath> Thilo 's  <outbreath> 
D:  So , it hurts compared to the ideal segmentation , when you have the  the manual segmentations , where you have exact boundaries for each s utterances . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Sometimes there are some  some words are cut off or  there 's some segments i are s uh , assigned to s to speech which there is nothing in . And so there are more insertions but 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  most of the time there are more  the  the number of deletions is higher when  when you use the automatic segmentation compared to the ideal one . 
F:  Hmm ! 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  And so I 'm just in  in progress of , 
D:  yeah , trying to feed the recognizer with un - segmented data and to see how much worse that is . 
D:  So that  that I have three things . Un - yeah  un - segmented , the automatic , and the  the ideal one . 
C:  Yeah . 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  <mike noise> 
G:  But the recognizer 's putting up some resistance because it doesn't like the un - segmented data . <laugh>

G:  you know , f apart from getting  preparing the  the da the data for the , um  
H:  <mike noise> 
G:  <mouth> for these experiments for the , um , <mouth> uh  for this prosody workshop , <inbreath> 
E:  <breath> 
G:  um , we just , um  
G:  we just had a phone call with Mari and her students , in fact , and they want to , um , 
G:  e m They 're bringing up their own meeting recognizer , which is based on Bill Byrne 's , uh , recognizer from Johns Hopkins . 
E:  <breath> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <mouth> 
C:  Based on Hub - five , or like  like your  ? 
G:  u  
G:  Based on their Hub - five recognizer . And , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  uh , so they 've been getting from us the , um  <inbreath> 
G:  you know , some support in terms of getting the latest transcripts and the  also the  actually the , <inbreath> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  uh , transcripts annotated with events , uh , like sentence boundaries and stuff like that . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> Um , because one of Mari 's students was to  wants to do some language modeling for , uh , predicting overlaps and , uh , stuff like that . 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
B:  <inbreath> 
G:  Um . <outbreath> 
B:  Yeah . Actually we had this ide from the last time that they were here , that it 'd be nice to have UW do some work on  language modeling that would be 
B:  trying to get at the same  detection as what we do acoustically since they can ramp up much ques quicker in the language modeling and we don 
F:  Can I borrow a piece of paper ?  
G:  Hmm . 
F:  Thank you .  
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  you know , we 'll do the , uh , prosodic side . And so this is supposed to be a project that we could actually  integrate 
A:  <mike noise> 
F:  <paper being torn from pad> 
B:  the posteriors that they get from their language model for every word boundary or every frame boundary , and then train up the classifiers . 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  And it 's  I guess it 's an undergrad , too , that  that 's going to be doing this work . So . 
H:  Cool . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  Um , on the recognition side , actually , um , I think the main person doing that is , uh , Harriet from  Harriet Nock from , uh  formerly of Cambridge . 
E:  <breath> 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  Um , <mouth> and apparently they get reasonable results except in some portions they get very high insertion rates  
G:  even higher than we get with  with the , um  <mouth> like even , you know , on lapel mikes with , uh , 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  background speech . And so they were trying to track that down , and   <inbreath> 
G:  It could be that our recognizer 's actually doing relatively well because it has a reject model for , you know , mismatched speech , essentially , 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  or for unspecified speech . And , um , so  
C:  Oh ! 
G:  so , uh , they 'll  I sent them our recognition output so they can sort of do a  line - by - line comparison and see if  if they , um  <inbreath> 
G:  you know , their insertions correspond to our rejects and stuff like that . So , um , we 'll see what that , uh , leads to .

C:  <inbreath> Yeah , I mean we 're doing , uh  
G:  <breath> <mike noise> 
C:  <mike noise> 
C:  So I should mention , Dave and I have sort of been  pushing through  thinking in terms of an ASRU paper . But I 'm still  @ @

G:  <mike noise> Mm - hmm . <mike noise> 
C:  I think early next week we 'll decide whether we 'll  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  we 'll do one or not . Um . But  because , you know , the results are  are still confusing enough that  
C:  <breath-laugh> that , um , we we gotta be convinced we understand what 's going on . But it 's starting to look like it  it 's almost the opposite of the usual th situation 
G:  <breath> 
F:  Hmm ! 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  where , um , 
C:  <mouth> 
C:  you get some really nice result with , uh  
C:  <cough> with digits , say , and then you go to a large corpus and the result goes away . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Um , we had what looked like a good result in digits but th but then when we went to more training data that kind of went away . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <mike noise> 
C:  So , uh , the digits result right now is kind of equivocal . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <mike noise> 
C:  Um , but the conversational speech one , while not huge , is in sort of Hub - five or Meeting kind of terms , actually it 's  it 's  it 's not bad . You know ? 
G:  <mike noise> 
G:  Hmm . 
C:  So  <breath-laugh> So it 's  it 's  you know , it 's like , 
G:  Right . <outbreath>

G:  <inbreath> 
G:  But is it still true that basically the s speaker adaptation , um , 
G:  sort of negates much of the advantage ? 
C:  <mouth> No , I 'm talking about with the adaptation . 
G:  With it . 
C:  Without the adapt without the adaptation is a much bigger effect . 
G:  OK . 
C:  So it so it 's  it 's very reasonable to think of as an alternative way  of getting this kind o kind of improvement . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <inbreath> 
topic_description:	speaker me013 progress report, ASRU paper


C:  But I think what w ultimately what we have to face with it is that , um  I mean , he gets incredibly good results 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  if you artificially reverberate clean  you know , close  close - miked data . So I think the thing we really have to face is that our model 
G:  <outbreath> 
F:  Right . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  for what 's going on is  is wrong 
F:  Is it wrong ? 
C:  <inbreath> or incomplete ,  
G:  Right . 
C:  and that in this situation in particular there 's a lot of noise . 
G:  Right . 
C:  And noise plus reverberation is not at all the same as just reverberation . So , um , uh , there 's that one thing that  
C:  @ @  been thinking of doing , is there 's a whole lot of work that 's been going on in noise suppression in the  in the Aurora , uh , team . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  And so , uh , they 've got some software and I 'm think of  of just having us integrate that in , uh , cuz it  
F:  Just combine it see .  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah . Cuz it just  I mean , it just subtracts it out . In fact  in fact you can run it in sort of enhancement mode where you get speech out and  and  and , uh , then just run it through the rest of your recognizer . So  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  So , uh  um . 
G:  Yeah . 
F:  Neat . 
G:  <breath> 
C:  So we 're working on that . 
G:  OK . 
topic_description:	noise, reverberation effects


G:  <inbreath> There 's some work , um , <outbreath> 
G:  that  
G:  Do you remember this  paper or poster  by , um , some CMU folks at , uh , HLT ? 
G:  They were talking about  and  and they s they referred to an upcoming ICASSP paper , I think , at the time . <inbreath> 
G:  Some - someone in Karlsruhe , I think , um , worked on , 
G:  <mouth> uh , es you know , estimating noise from the silent regions and then , 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  uh , doing some explicit  I don't know if it 's something akin to parallel model combination or something like that to  to , uh , 
C:  I mean , people have done that for a long time . Right ? 
G:  Right . Anyway , uh , so I  I  I couldn't judge whether this was original or not , but  
G:  but it seemed like they got pretty good results on their meeting data . <inbreath> So we might want to look into that . <outbreath> 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah , I don I don't remember the paper . But I mean , that  th that 's certainly one of the common techniques is to do that . 
G:  Right . 
A:  <mike noise> 
G:  Right . 
C:  Uh , and in all th the stuff that our team is doing they certainly look at 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  regions that you think are <breath-laugh> nonspeech in order to get noise statistics . But , 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <inbreath> 
G:  Right . 
C:  uh , I mean , there 's a host of thing different things you could do . In the Aurora thing , we have  we have a little bit of a handicap in that they  they don't let you , 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  uh , adjust the tis  the statistical models . So y you have to  you have to do everything at the feature level . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <inbreath> Um . But , um , 
C:  um  
C:  <inbreath> but there 's , uh , you know , Wiener filtering and spectral subtraction which are , uh , sort of  i can be looked at as 
B:  <mike noise> 
C:  m minor modifications of one another . Um . 
C:  <inbreath> And they they 've now built up a nice piece of software that does  
B:  <mike noise> 
C:  u um  
C:  has this sort of general framework for a  for it so that you can adjust it to sort of an any  any  any one of a dozen ways that people have done this kind of thing and 
C:  <inbreath> <mouth> 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  they found a particular set of parameters they liked  this week . And  we 're running with that for a while . But . 
G:  OK .

B:  So . Well , I 'll just really briefly , um  
C:  Anything else ? 
B:  So , I 've been working with Don and also  <inbreath> 
B:  and  and Andreas on the  this paper on prosody , and what we 're trying to do is predict where people  
B:  at  <inbreath> 
B:  given all information up to whatever point in time you 're considering , try to predict if that 's a good location for someone else to jump in . 
B:  So , that 's the idea of that paper . And that 's  the same task that Mari , a um , <mouth> a student named Dustin , and also Sarah who was at this last meeting 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  will be looking into doing from the language modeling side . Maybe some kind of clu you know , clustered class N - gram or something . 
G:  <breath> 
C:  Uh - huh . 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Um . And also we 're  we 're using a couple of the labellers who are doing emotion to help us , um , finalize some transcripts for this . So these undergra undergrad students are really helping us out a lot , 
G:  <mike noise> 
H:  Yeah . 
B:  under Don 's supervision , actually . So that 's good . So these offices are being , uh , very busy  Don 's and the one across from him . <inbreath>

topic_description:	prosody paper, collaboration with UW


B:  And then also , um , working with Jeremy on Communicator emotion labelling . And <inbreath> 
B:  most of that up to a few weeks ago was just getting the  people labelling these utterances to a computer for emotion and that 's going pretty well now . 
B:  <inbreath> @ @  
C:  What kind of emotions do you label ? 
B:  Um . 
B:  Well , we 're mostly looking for places where the person 's frustrated with the system . 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  So , there 's just two categories , frustrated and not , or  ? No . 
B:  <inbreath> There  there are actually  that 's how we started it . And we had different levels . Now we have things like " amuse " . Like , " oh , you finally got it " . And  <inbreath> 
G:  <mike noise> 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  <breath> 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  um , and " disappointed - tired " . Like , " yeah , no , that 's wrong again " . 
F:  @ @ 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  Which isn't really mad , but , you know . So th they gave me a lot of feedback . The labellers , after doing this , <inbreath> 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
B:  told me what they wanted as categories . <laugh> So .  
H:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  And then there 's jokes . And  Yeah , right . Um . 
C:  <breath> Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  There 's not a lot of  enough frustration for us to really go through quickly , cuz we have to label every meeting and also things like repeats for the same information , and so forth . And I 've been coordinating a little bit with 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Katrin at , uh , UW who was doing  user correction work that she presented at the  at the meeting . 
B:  So there 's some overlap there in what you m there 's a correlation between corrections and annoyance or frustration . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  <mouth> Um , but Jeremy 's been starting to really work on that project now from the acoustic side . So we have all these waveforms , and he 's been <inbreath> 
B:  with Morgan 's help and , uh , Dan Ellis 's , I think , looking into spectral tilt a bit , so he can talk about that . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  It 's a feature we haven't used before . Um , and starting to , uh , r r take information from alignments and 
B:  create a database that we can use sort of as a  
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  a large feature vector or table to feed to our decision trees , which will try to give us back an answer from the speech only as  to whether the person 's frustrated or not . 
topic_description:	Communicator emotion labelling


C:  <inbreath> That reminds me of something . We  we talked about something a ways back and I sort of lost track of it , about having a synthesizer driven with   <breath-laugh> 
B:  So . 
B:  <mike noise> 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> Yeah . <inbreath> 
D:  I haven't really  had time to do that . 
B:  Actually , I wanted  to talk with you about that cuz there 's a similar project at SRI where we 're using  we want to do something like that to look at whether or not some of the p 
D:  <inbreath> 
I:  <breath> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  stylized pitch stuff <inbreath> is , 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  um , 
B:  sort of perceptually similar to the kinds of things that people would mark . So , I  I actually wanted to talk to you about that . So . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Maybe after Wednesday ? <laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  OK . Yeah . Cuz this will be , like , after  
C:  <inbreath> Yeah , cuz you have this AS - ASRU deadline . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
G:  <breath> Right . 
B:  OK . Yeah . This will be after September anyway , so I  
C:  But that seemed like it would be fairly straight - forward , that if you take the  take the pitch from the real data , 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <outbreath> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
C:  feed it into the synthesizer , and then process the output with a gain box that you also had energy from the  from the real data . 
B:  <outbreath> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . There was just no  way to 
C:  @ @ 
G:  <breath-laugh> Hey ! We could use that in the English  
B:  use the energy in Festival , that was  
G:  We have to do the English synthesis for SmartKom. What if we make the system really  annoyed ? 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	synthesis modelling


B:  OK - Anyway . <laugh> I  I should move on cuz we 're running late , but I wanted to say there 's one question in my mind , which maybe 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Morgan can talk to Jeremy about , is how to sort of normalize spectral tilt . It 's just  I 'm sort of in this , 
B:  uh , area I don't know much about and so we should talk off - line . But if you have a certain speaker 
C:  OK . 
I:  <mike noise> 
B:  <inbreath> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  and you wanna sort of get a bunch of data from that speaker but compare it , you know , directly on a feature to  to like a decision tree that won't 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  normalize anything for you once you feed it the features , how do you sort of normalize over a particular speaker ? What kinds of  
B:  what  what makes sense to do with that feature ? 
C:  Well , I 'll have to hear what he 's using , f given different suggestions he 's gotten . But  
B:  So . 
B:  i Yeah . 
B:  But that 's something we  would  be  glad to  have help on . 
C:  OK . 
topic_description:	normalizing spectral tilt


B:  So . Go ahead , Jeremy . <outbreath>  
E:  <mouth> Right . So I 've been looking at spectral tilt and  different ways of  perhaps generating it . 
E:  And , um , I basically have three ways right now that we 're looking at for , uh  we 're gonna look at for features . 
C:  <mike noise> 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  Uh , one is just looking at , um , the first cepstral coefficient  
C:  <paper rustling> 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  and , uh , using that . 
E:  Um , another is looking at the log ener the difference of log energies between , um , 
E:  the high  like a high - frequency band and a low - frequency band . And the third is just , um , taking a slope , 
E:  um , of the linear fit of the spectrum  and using that . 
E:  So , those are the three  three ways I have right now for generating these spectral tilt numbers . And , 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  um , hopefully soon we can look at some of the labelled stuff and look at , uh , these numbers and see  
C:  <mike noise> 
E:  see which ones w seem to be working well . And things like that . 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  Um , I also recently wrote a script , um , 
B:  <mike noise> 
E:  <mouth> 
E:  that , uh , generates the kappa statistic , um , which is a  
C:  <mike noise> 
E:  for labeller agreement . Um , so , 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  <inbreath> <mike spike> been looking at that as well . <outbreath> 
topic_description:	speaker me051 progress report, spectral tilt


C:  <inbreath> I mean , wh what  <clears throat> 
C:  specifically , what you wanna do is remove the  the  the  the average , uh , speaker  tilt in some sense ? 
B:  <breath> 
B:  <inbreath> The thing i Yeah . We  we  you wanna use spectral tilt to try to get at the s 
C:  <mike noise> 
B:  n the voice quality of these utterances . So you could have something like " no " versus " no ! "  and these might differ in that way . <inbreath> 
B:  But the problem is we don't know  <laugh> th we don't  we don't know whether the " no " is frustrated or not . 
C:  You don't know it . Yeah . Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  So  Right . <laugh> Exactly . 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  Mmm . 
B:  <breath> And then you also have the different speakers . And so , the sort of question is , 
C:  <breath> Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  do you wanna average all the data together or do you  do you  ?  
B:  You wanna capture the change in voice quality within a speaker , 
C:  <mouth> 
B:  without having to know ahead of time w which is which , cuz that would be circular . So , 
C:  <breath> I mean , 
B:  <inbreath> 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  m maybe  maybe this is too obvious to be right , but I mean , the  the  the  the normal thing for C - one would be to  to , uh , get rid of the mean and th and the variance . Right ? 
B:  u this is   
C:  Does that  ? <inbreath> The mean and variance . Have it be zero mean and unity variance . And then  
A:  To get rid of what ? 
F:  Mean and variance . 
A:  OK . 
G:  <mike noise> 
B:  <mouth> But do you do this , say , just in the vowel regions , and do you  ?  a There 's  there 's a whole bunch of , um , 
A:  <noise> 
B:  sort of unknowns . And we can try all of them and just put them into the tree as features , and  
C:  <mouth> Right . 
H:  <mike noise> 
C:  <mouth> Well , the answer 's yeah . I mean , you want  you want it for every place that 's voiced . 
G:  <inbreath> But  but you can't do it  
G:  I mean you can't just normalize it based on the utterance because then you 're gonna have zero everywhere . 
G:  Right ? So you 'd have to normalize it based on  the  
C:  No , ev everything for that speaker . 
G:  <inbreath> Yeah , OK . But that 's not really feasible because you 're having a sys you have a system , a dialogue system , 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Everything up to that point . 
C:  Yeah ? 
G:  where you only have access to the  what the speaker said before . So it 'd have to be sort of a causal , 
B:  Oh , yeah . That 's OK . That  that 's the sort of  w we keep  you keep , uh , iterat you keep updating those numbers for future utterances . Th - 
G:  uh , 
G:  version of @ @ . 
F:  Yeah . 
G:  <mouth> Or you c u <breath> 
C:  Yeah . I mean , but  but the main  I think the main thing is that  
B:  That  that would work . 
C:  the  You 're right . I mean , the main distinction is whether it 's voiced or  or  voiced or not . 
C:  If it 's  if it 's  if it 's silence or  or unvoiced regions , then you  you  you don't really want that in there , uh , if you can help it . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <inbreath> But actually , I mean , just to first order ,  suppose you just didn't do anything smart at all and just 
C:  did  you know , did that , it wouldn't be that bad . 
C:  <inbreath> Because you 'd get some number that would be skewed by  be skewed by that  
B:  <inbreath> So you mean , you 're just  using a mean and the varian and a variance ? 
C:  You know , uh , uh , X - X  X  X - X  X minus mu over sigma . Yeah . <breath>  
B:  You mean just a  a Z - square , like ? 
B:  Right , right . Right . OK . So it is distributed  in a way that you can do this . Yeah . OK . 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  <breath> Mmm . <breath> 
G:  <breath> 
C:  <mike noise> 
C:  <inbreath> It  it  it 's  it 's sort of the first - order thing to do . There 's , uh , you know , uh , obviously much  much more arcane things to do and complicated things to do . 
B:  @ @ 
B:  <noise> 
B:  <noise> 
B:  OK . So , that 's  so  that was our sort of  
H:  <mouth> 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  But that 's  
C:  th that 's the first thing to do . And then  you know , then <inbreath> 
B:  maybe this will work , I don't know .  OK . 
H:  <whistles part of a song>  
C:  the next thing is , " well , let 's just look at the voiced regions " , you know , and that would be a reasonable thing to do . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  And then if it 's really  when you look at what y i i i 
G:  <mike noise> 
C:  Since you 're looking at something that 's sort of in log domain , cepstral is like log d linearly transformed of a log domain ,  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  it 's probably not that terrible an assumption to pretend it 's Gaussian anyway . And so the other things that get more  more tricky are , 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  uh , to handle the fact that it 's not  not really Gaussian . And  and y you may  you may not really need that for this . 
B:  Well , we probably won't get that far . Yeah . 
C:  <inbreath> Yeah . So I think 
B:  OK . 
C:  that would be  that would be the obvious thing to do . 
B:  OK . 
G:  Well , we 're not gonna build a parametric model of the  
G:  o o of the  of the feature . Right ? We 're just gonna  we we 're gonna use 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <inbreath> No , I understand . It 's just  it  it  No , it 's more that  that if you felt something wasn't Gaussian and you were trying to  
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  like thresholding or something . 
C:  normalize for some kind of , uh , bias of some sort , you might use a non - parametric 
G:  <breath> Right , right . OK . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  measure , like you might use a median , you know , and rank statistics , and all that sort of stuff . But I mean , you shouldn't bother with it if it 's roughly Gaussian . Just  Yeah . 
B:  m Median , yeah . We could just plot  plot these for a speaker , and 
G:  Right . 
B:  get a bunch of histograms . 
G:  Right . 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  OK .  
G:  OK . 
G:  <mike noise> 
B:  Right . 
G:  Uh , yeah . 
B:  Thanks . <outbreath> 
C:  Sure . <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
C:  Uh , and I already  I already said what  I was doing , which is  mostly 
C:  trying to give advice to Dave when he  he  <laugh> he actually does the real <inbreath> work on this , uh , reverberation thing . But I think it 's  it 's  it 's a real , uh  
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  it 's a real learning experience for both of us . And  and , uh , I think it 's  it 's a problem  ar  problem area that people really haven't 
C:  dealt with that much , as we know . So , 
C:  <inbreath> uh , w h he kind of did  he started off with what was 
G:  <mike noise> 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  in some sense sort of the first obvious thing to do , although  hardly anybody had done it yet . And , uh , it  
C:  it does work very well under some conditions and other conditions it doesn't . And now we 're understanding  trying to understand what those are .
