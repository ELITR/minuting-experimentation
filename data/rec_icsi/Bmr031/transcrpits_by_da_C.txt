C:  And you were worried we wouldn't have any overlap today . 
C:  We 're  we 're recording by the way , 
C:  just for  
C:  I mean , uh u 
C:  You can keep talking . 
C:  I just  I just  
C:  g guess you were gonna  
C:  Well  
C:  So the compromise is we 're  we 're starting but we 're leaving the door open . 
C:  So we 'll have a little more background noise 
C:  and  <laugh> Uh . 
C:  Really ? 
C:  Yeah . Oh , yeah . The meeting 's started . 
C:  This is  this is the real thing . 
C:  This is the real thing . 
C:  Oh well , never mind , 
C:  it wasn't . 
C:  There goes Chuck . 
C:  Just kidding , 
C:  it was . 
C:  OK , 
C:  so . 
C:  OK . Last guy in <inbreath> gets the  
C:  Oh , you just get the door now . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . So I  I  @ @ Adam sent around this thing about what we were going to talk about 
C:  and  and th we had had this discussion of , uh , flipping back and forth between an emphasis on  <inbreath> on the technology , particularly recognition , versus , uh , the recordings and transcriptions and so on . 
C:  Um , but , um , 
C:  I was asking , if we could , to  uh , kind of make it just whatever is happening rather than one or the other 
C:  because , uh , next weekend  next week I 'll be at a meeting on campus 
C:  and after that I 'll be Europe for , <inbreath> uh , several meetings ' worth . 
C:  Uh , you folks 'll be gone for a couple of the meetings ' worth in  in Europe also , 
C:  right ? 
C:  Really ? 
C:  OK . Yeah . 
C:  So . 
C:  So , uh , you didn't  you didn't get an agenda , 
C:  I guess . We 've got the usual  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . <clears throat> So we sent them  
C:  And the 
C:  What pie chart ? 
C:  Half the data that 's been recorded has been transcribed ? 
C:  Wow ! That 's getting pretty good . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 

C:  Well , if we can have three point one four times as much tr transcribed as we recorded , we really would be doing well . 
C:  Uh , I thought you  you were already using adaptation w on the test set . 
C:  I see . 
C:  Oh , OK . 
C:  Got it . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . Yeah , whatever this is . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Right . <outbreath> Yeah . 
C:  I mean , you could have some parts of it that are disjoint and some that aren't , 
C:  and see what the difference is , you know , on the others . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  You can separate it out and see how  if they 're  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah , so , you know , maybe someone else would do  a lot of the work where probably  your advice 
C:  would be helpful . 
C:  Yeah . Well , we 'd  
C:  We want that for sure . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh , Dave Gelbart . 
C:  Not  right away . 
C:  He 's got prelims 
C:  and  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Um , <mouth> one thing , uh , uh , just a e uh , uh , an announcement of sorts is that , um , <mouth> Chuck is gonna be going to a meeting at NIST , 
C:  in , uh , about a month and a half , I guess . 
C:  They 're still working out the date . 
C:  cuz they want to gather together sort of one person from each site who is involved in the meeting stuff 
C:  since they 're going to be doing <inbreath> a bunch of meeting recordings there . 
C:  And so , uh . 
C:  Somebody  you know , it 's like one person  
C:  at the moment it 's one person from each site . 
C:  So there 'll be somebody from the CMU , and somebody from here , and somebody from , <inbreath> uh , a  a number of places . 
C:  Probably somebody from UW . 
C:  Um . So . 
C:  Yeah , it 's possible they 'll open it up to more people . 
C:  But  but I think , you know , the main thing is just to , 
C:  uh  uh  uh  uh , it 's not a  it 's not a conference . 
C:  It 's not a workshop , really . 
C:  It 's just connecting with them . 
C:  So . 
C:  Um . So , then if they start a bunch of recordings then ultimately they 'll  they 'll have training sets and test sets , 
C:  and  <inbreath> and all that  all that stuff , 
C:  and  
C:  But . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I 
C:  Well , again the hope is <outbreath> that , uh  I mean , it 's  it 's looking  I mean , I have to ask these folks 
C:  but , uh , my impression is that the , um , IBM path is looking , you know , more promising . 
C:  And if that 's the case and if it turns out that , uh , it 's really a relatively small amount of time 
C:  for our transcribers to process things before and after , 
C:  if they really have taken out enough of the  of the , uh , uh , work that  that it 's f feasible , then maybe we can do it with a smaller staff next year . 
C:  I mean , <inbreath> next  next year , uh , in which he 's  you 're referring to is , uh , next year we  we don't have a whole lot of guaranteed funding for this  <inbreath> this work . 
C:  Um , other funding may come . 
C:  You know that 's  But  but if we wanna just count on , uh , <inbreath> uh , what we know about , it 's  it 's more modest than this year . 
C:  Uh , it 's still  there 'll still be money , 
C:  but it 's just more modest . 
C:  So  
C:  um , so I would see us as probably not doing more recordings 
C:  at least for  for  for meetings or  or digits or anything . 
C:  But , uh , if  if we feel that we need to , probably still doing some recordings for SmartKom or something . 
C:  Um , but otherwise just , you know , stop that 
C:  and just  take whatever comes from the other places , 
C:  which , 
C:  uh , 
C:  I guess we have an u unknown rate . 
C:  If it  if it starts being  if they 're generating this huge amount and we can't handle it then , you know , we 'll tell them . 
C:  But . 
C:  Uh , although it would have been nice if that  their stuff had come earlier , 
C:  it it 's in some ways a good thing , 
C:  because we 've been <laugh-sniff> ironing out this  path . 
C:  So . 
C:  Well , it 's just if that they 're sending it to us , then we have to have the disk space to do it too . 
C:  That would be the hope . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  d Are they  doing some nice integer multiple 
C:  or  ? 
C:  Are they doing some nice integer multiple of th of sixteen ? 
C:  Oh , forty - four point one . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh , so that 's  
C:  Well , you know , we record here at for at forty - eight or something 
C:  and then we downsample . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well you can do it . 
C:  Oh , absolutely you can do it . 
C:  Yeah . You can do  you can go from anything to anything else . 
C:  But  but it 's  it 's just  it 's  it 's just a little more complicated . 
C:  It 's just like  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  So  u u u 
C:  Yeah . I mean , it 's just slightly more complicated , 
C:  but it 's  but i you can  you can go from any frequency to anyth any other frequency . 
C:  So it 's  
C:  A and , so I gue 
C:  Well , I would suspect it 's because it 's what the hardware does . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I  I <inbreath> I think it 's the sort of thing that 's deserving of discussion with them . 
C:  I d I don't think it 's like , i uh , they 'll ask us , we 'll give a simple answer 
C:  and come back . 
C:  It needs some back and forth 
C:  because it 's  <inbreath> it it 's a little gnarly to have parts of the database with different things . 
C:  And it 's , 
C:  um , 
C:  i 
C:  You know , part of the arguments for the higher sampling rate is that maybe there 's something , you know , say , in six to ten kilohertz that <inbreath> you might use for  for some purposes somewhere . 
C:  If people are doing a wide range of things , 
C:  doing location , 
C:  uh , you know , doing a bunch of things , 
C:  maybe , you know , why  why throw it away if you don't need to ? 
C:  Um , on the other hand , 
C:  um , I mean , 
C:  it 's @ @  <laugh> sixty kilohertz is plenty . 
C:  So  <laugh> so  
C:  So , uh , I th I  I think it 's  it 's , uh  
C:  And they are gonna be using up a lot of disk , 
C:  both for th them and for us when we 're pr processing their stuff , 
C:  uh , if they 
C:  Well , i w wa if  if they 're going at forty - four , they won't even creep . 
C:  They 'll just pounce . 
C:  Well , that might help a bit . 
C:  Yeah , actually I think at NIST they were ta there were  there was some discussion of fairly high sampling rates too , 
C:  so . 
C:  I don't think that 's true . 
C:  They 're recording fifty channels of mikes . 
C:  Yeah , they are . 
C:  They 're recording all of them . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I don't believe so . 
C:  No . I don't think so . 
C:  No . So I think they  they have actually a very large audio data rate . 
C:  I think it is comparable to a video data rate . 
C:  So . 
C:  Uh . 
C:  Interesting question . 
C:  And that 's  and that 's  and that 's no video . 
C:  Sample rate , 
C:  yeah . 
C:  Yeah , not if you have to distribute the video also . 
C:  Well , I think you 'll have some interesting discussions next month when you go out there . 
C:  I mean , how are they gonna  you know , what 's  what 's the distribution plan ? 
C:  If they have something really smart in mind , you know , maybe we can use it . 
C:  I mean  I mean , <mouth> w we talked about sending around a disk or a computer . 
C:  Maybe a compu maybe  
C:  That 's why it 's only fifty gigs . 
C:  Hey , it 's  it 's the first time I 've ever heard you ask for less data . 
C:  Yeah , that 's probably a lot of it . 
C:  And they 're gonna have mikes like that too . 
C:  In fact , their array  their array will be  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Now we bought  a little  not all that long ago we brought three  uh , thirty - six gigabyte disks . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  So I think after that we need another , uh , rack or something . 
C:  Right ? 
C:  Change servers ? 
C:  We should probably do that while  we have the space left on the  on the th the existing thirty - sixes , 
C:  so that we can 
C:  shuffle it around . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  That 's right . 
C:  There are eighty gig drives now that you can get for that ? 
C:  See , and that 's probably what we should send around for these  <laugh> to d for distribution <laugh> of this corpus . 
C:  This s s isn't any  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . That 's what I meant , 
C:  yeah . 
C:  Actually , what  I think what  what , uh  
C:  was it  was it Dave who was suggesting  that , uh , you just get , uh , uh , a  a computer 
C:  that has one of these drives in it 
C:  and just send the computer around to the different sites . 
C:  And you can just <laugh> get it off the computer 
C:  and press the  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Laptop ? Yeah , 
C:  send the laptop . 
C:  And , of course you don't want  y we don't want to trust the shippers necessarily , 
C:  so you send a person too . 
C:  And they just kind of go from site to site , 
C:  and 
C:  download their data kind of  Johnny Appleseed . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  What ? 
C:  Does it ? 
C:  Yeah . There 's a  there 's a  they really need it in Novosibirsk . 
C:  R r 
C:  I 'm probably pr mispronouncing it . Well . 
C:  Yeah . Mm - hmm . That  that needs a month , 
C:  yeah , 
C:  to download . 
C:  Things are slower there . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
C:  So . OK , so that 's the meeting stuff . 
C:  Uh , transcrip 
C:  So you 're  we 're  you said it was almost half , 
C:  so that means that we have , like , eighty or so hours 
C:  and out of that maybe thirty - five or something are  transcribed ? 
C:  He 's tethered , yeah . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I see . 
C:  Oh , that 's  
C:  Yeah , that 's not half . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  A couple weeks ago . Yeah . 
C:  But about how much do we have that 's sort of , uh  ? 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 

C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Uh . Alright . So we still have a long  ways to go 
C:  but maybe the , uh  the IBM thing will  will help push through the  the rest of it somewhat quicker . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Yeah . It might  it might partly just be  European summer vacation issues . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  Right . Hmm . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Uh ,  www .  What else is going on ? 
C:  Why don't we just go around , 
C:  cuz we only have a few minutes . 
C:  What new hardware ? 
C:  Oh . 
C:  So , wha what 's your question ? 
C:  So what 's your question ? 
C:  Well , there 's a point when a bunch of us are off at Eurospeech . 
C:  Um . 
C:  OK . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Right . 
C:  OK . 
C:  So , I was just thinking maybe just go around and just brief briefly look what 's other things that are going on , 
C:  maybe , since we don't  don't have much of a set a set agenda 
C:  and we don't have much time . 
C:  Uh . 
C:  Well , why don't we d we  we deliberately pick two people to  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I 'll  I 'll  I 'll keep saying " uh - huh " . Yeah . 
C:  This is absolutely natural meetings . 
C:  We have <laugh> absolutely no effect from our preconceptions . 
C:  With my backchannel ? 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Which one it is ? 
C:  Well , has anybody done anything ? 
C:  Come on . 
C:  What are we doing ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Well , wait a minute , 
C:  what  ? 
C:  What 's , uh , the original Transcriber written in ? 
C:  I see . 
C:  So . 
C:  Yeah , yeah . Right . 
C:  Beep . 
C:  Not answering your calls , huh ? 
C:  " War and Peace . " 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I 'll  I 'll take that role anytime you want . 
C:  I like saying it . 
C:  So . 
C:  OK . 
C:  OK . Any sense about how  how it does on  ? 
C:  Right , but I was just asking if you had a sense yet of  of , uh , whether  
C:  maybe you already did this experiment , 
C:  where there 's this question of  of how much it hurt you or helped you to use segmented versus  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Good . Good . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  So your  so your results are about the same as Bush 's , 
C:  basically . His  
C:  Bush 's . 
C:  Yeah , you 're both , you know , sort of  He 's  he 's coming back to the heartland 
C:  and  
C:  Right . <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . I  I think he 's b he 's been  he will have been off , like , two months out of his first seven  in office . 
C:  That 's a pretty good deal . 
C:  Anyway . 
C:  Who are you talking about , 
C:  Bush or Don ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Based on Hub - five , or like  like your  ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh ! 
C:  Yeah , I mean we 're doing , uh  
C:  So I should mention , Dave and I have sort of been  pushing through  thinking in terms of an ASRU paper . 
C:  But I 'm still  
C:  I think early next week we 'll decide whether we 'll  <inbreath> we 'll do one or not . 
C:  Um . But  because , you know , the results are  are still confusing enough that  <breath-laugh> that , um , 
C:  we we gotta be convinced we understand what 's going on . 
C:  But it 's starting to look like it  it 's almost the opposite of the usual th situation <inbreath> where , um , <mouth> you get some really nice result with , uh  <cough> with digits , say , 
C:  and then you go to a large corpus and the result goes away . 
C:  Um , we had what looked like a good result in digits but th but then when we went to more training data that kind of went away . 
C:  So , uh , the digits result right now is kind of equivocal . 
C:  Um , but the conversational speech one , while not huge , is in sort of Hub - five or Meeting kind of terms , 
C:  actually it 's  it 's  it 's not bad . 
C:  You know ? 
C:  So  <breath-laugh> So it 's  it 's  you know , it 's like , 
C:  i i w 
C:  after he did some adjustments , more like a percent or so that  that i th absolute , that it goes  <inbreath> goes down 
C:  and  
C:  Sometimes . Yeah . 
C:  No , I 'm talking about with the adaptation . 
C:  Without the adapt without the adaptation is a much bigger effect . 
C:  So it so it 's  it 's very reasonable to think of as an alternative way  of getting this kind o kind of improvement . 
C:  But I think what w ultimately what we have to face with it is that , um  
C:  I mean , he gets incredibly good results <inbreath> if you artificially reverberate clean  you know , close  close - miked data . 
C:  So I think the thing we really have to face is that our model <inbreath> for what 's going on is  is wrong 
C:  or incomplete , 
C:  and that in this situation in particular there 's a lot of noise . 
C:  And noise plus reverberation is not at all the same as just reverberation . 
C:  So , um , uh , there 's that one thing that  @ @  been thinking of doing , is there 's a whole lot of work that 's been going on in noise suppression in the  in the Aurora , uh , team . 
C:  And so , uh , they 've got some software 
C:  and I 'm think of  of just having us integrate that in , 
C:  uh , cuz it  
C:  Yeah . Cuz it just  I mean , it just subtracts it out . 
C:  In fact  in fact you can run it in sort of enhancement mode where you get speech out 
C:  and  and  and , uh , then just run it through the rest of your recognizer . 
C:  So  So , uh  um . 
C:  So we 're working on that . 
C:  I mean , people have done that for a long time . 
C:  Right ? 
C:  Yeah , I don I don't remember the paper . 
C:  But I mean , that  th that 's certainly one of the common techniques is to do that . 
C:  Uh , and in all th the stuff that our team is doing they certainly look at <inbreath> regions that you think are <breath-laugh> nonspeech in order to get noise statistics . 
C:  But , <inbreath> uh , 
C:  I mean , there 's a host of thing different things you could do . 
C:  In the Aurora thing , we have  we have a little bit of a handicap in that they  they don't let you , <inbreath> uh , adjust the tis  the statistical models . 
C:  So y you have to  you have to do everything at the feature level . 
C:  Um . But , um , um  
C:  but there 's , uh , you know , Wiener filtering and spectral subtraction 
C:  which are , uh , sort of  i can be looked at as m minor modifications of one another . 
C:  Um . 
C:  And they they 've now built up a nice piece of software that does  
C:  u um  
C:  has this sort of general framework for a  for it 
C:  so that you can adjust it to sort of an any  any  any one of a dozen ways that people have done this kind of thing 
C:  and 
C:  they found a particular set of parameters they liked  this week . 
C:  And  we 're running with that for a while . 
C:  But . 
C:  Anything else ? 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  What kind of emotions do you label ? 
C:  So , there 's just two categories , frustrated and not , 
C:  or  ? No . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  That reminds me of something . 
C:  We  we talked about something a ways back and I sort of lost track of it , 
C:  about having a synthesizer driven with  
C:  Yeah , cuz you have this AS - ASRU deadline . 
C:  But that seemed like it would be fairly straight - forward , that if you take the  take the pitch from the real data , feed it into the synthesizer , and then process the output with a gain box that you also had energy from the  from the real data . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Well , I 'll have to hear what he 's using , f given different suggestions he 's gotten . 
C:  But  
C:  OK . 
C:  I mean , wh what  <clears throat> specifically , what you wanna do is remove the  the  the  the average , uh , speaker  tilt in some sense ? 
C:  You don't know it . 
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I mean , 
C:  m maybe  maybe this is too obvious to be right , 
C:  but I mean , the  the  the  the normal thing for C - one would be to  to , uh , get rid of the mean and th and the variance . 
C:  Right ? 
C:  Does that  ? <inbreath> The mean and variance . Have it be zero mean and unity variance . 
C:  And then  
C:  Right . 
C:  Well , the answer 's yeah . 
C:  I mean , you want  you want it for every place that 's voiced . 
C:  No , ev everything for that speaker . 
C:  Yeah ? 
C:  Yeah . I mean , but  but the main  I think the main thing is that  
C:  the  You 're right . I mean , the main distinction is whether it 's voiced or  or  voiced or not . 
C:  If it 's  if it 's  if it 's silence or  or unvoiced regions , then you  you  you don't really want that in there , uh , if you can help it . 
C:  But actually , I mean , just to first order ,  suppose you just didn't do anything smart at all 
C:  and just did  you know , did that , it wouldn't be that bad . 
C:  Because you 'd get some number that would be skewed by  be skewed by that  
C:  You know , uh , uh , X - X  X  X - X  X minus mu over sigma . Yeah . 
C:  It  it  it 's  it 's sort of the first - order thing to do . 
C:  There 's , uh , you know , uh , obviously much  much more arcane things to do and complicated things to do . 
C:  But that 's  th that 's the first thing to do . 
C:  And then  you know , then <inbreath> the next thing is , " well , let 's just look at the voiced regions " , 
C:  you know , and that would be a reasonable thing to do . 
C:  And then if it 's really  when you look at what y i i i 
C:  Since you 're looking at something that 's sort of in log domain , cepstral is like log d linearly transformed of a log domain ,  <inbreath> it 's probably not that terrible an assumption to pretend it 's Gaussian anyway . 
C:  And so the other things that get more  more tricky are , <inbreath> uh , to handle the fact that it 's not  not really Gaussian . 
C:  And  and y you may  you may not really need that for this . 
C:  Yeah . So I think that would be  that would be the obvious thing to do . 
C:  No , I understand . 
C:  It 's just  it  it  
C:  No , it 's more that  that if you felt something wasn't Gaussian and you were trying to  normalize for some kind of , uh , bias of some sort , you might use a non - parametric <inbreath> measure , 
C:  like you might use a median , 
C:  you know , 
C:  and rank statistics , and all that sort of stuff . 
C:  But I mean , you shouldn't bother with it if it 's roughly Gaussian . 
C:  Just  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Sure . 
C:  Uh , and I already  I already said what  I was doing , 
C:  which is  mostly trying to give advice to Dave when he  he  <laugh> he actually does the real <inbreath> work on this , uh , reverberation thing . 
C:  But I think it 's  it 's  it 's a real , uh  <inbreath> it 's a real learning experience for both of us . 
C:  And  and , uh , I think it 's  it 's a problem  ar  problem area that people really haven't dealt with that much , as we know . 
C:  So , <inbreath> uh , w h he kind of did  he started off with what was <inbreath> in some sense sort of the first obvious thing to do , 
C:  although  hardly anybody had done it yet . 
C:  And , uh , it  it does work very well under some conditions 
C:  and other conditions it doesn't .
