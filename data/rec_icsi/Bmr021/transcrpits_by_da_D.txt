D:  that 's not a bad idea . 
D:  If you 're popular . 
D:  Yeah right . 
D:  Me too . 
D:  Th - those are intimidating . 
D:  Are they more directional , 
D:  the microphones , as far as  
D:  OK . 
D:  Which ones are those ? 
D:  The one I 'm wearing ? 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  For one of these ? 
D:  God . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  The other thing I could do to relieve some of the pressure um is just move everything to my eighteen gig disk , which is local . 
D:  Well , I mean , I don't know  
D:  Yeah , it is kind of a temporary solution . 
D:  To shorten everything . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  OK . 
D:  To be OK . 
D:  And segment on the fly . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  But I think  kind of  We 've had  There was a big disk crash when you were gone 
D:  and  
D:  Oh was that the day you left ? 
D:  That 's suspicious . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Leave to Japan the day the disk crashes . 
D:  But , um  
D:  Yeah so , Chuck helped me out in , uh , r regenerating all the cha the different channel files for like a few meetings  
D:  for like six meetings . 
D:  So I think they 're split up even further . 
D:  It 's kind of even more disorganized now 
D:  since we moved some of the meetings to different directories . 
D:  They 're on a different disk even , 
D:  right ? 
D:  I think  you  didn't you expand them to XE on Abbott ? 
D:  No , you  the ones that You  the ones that you put them on when you put them on XE . 
D:  I think you put them on XE . 
D:  So . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Wow . 
D:  No . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I 'm  
D:  Right . 
D:  Well , 
D:  I mean , it should probably be  eventually should probably be consistent with what you 're doing 
D:  but , 
D:  yeah , I kind of agree with Andreas , 
D:  like I 'm a little bit  
D:  I looked at the naming conventions 
D:  and they look fine to me , 
D:  but at the same time it was just like you know to rename everything would be  
D:  No but I think just to be consistent we should also , I mean , have the same conventions , just in case you want  
D:  Yeah . Yeah . I mean , it 's only gonna affect my work . 
D:  So . 
D:  Yeah , it 's not gonna  
D:  I assume you 're not gonna go , like , into , you know , my directories and change my file names . 
D:  So . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , 
D:  that 'd be great . 
D:  Really enjoy that . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Hmm . Mmm , OK . 
D:  It  it can beep if one of the channels dies while recording . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Never mind . 
D:  Wow , 
D:  that 's not a bad idea .
