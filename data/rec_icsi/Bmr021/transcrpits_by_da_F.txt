F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Pre - crashed . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  I do . 
F:  Yeah , I do too . 
F:  Interesting . 
F:  I have a question about this . 
F:  Are the auditory quality  Is it , uh , much different between this kind and the  the fancy ones ? 
F:  They are . 
F:  OK . 
F:  The other thing is , is it just a few people who don't like them in the EDU group ? 
F:  Cuz  
F:  Gosh , 
F:  cuz I much prefer them , 
F:  I think they 're a whole lot , multiple levels , better . 
F:  It seems a shame t to discard  discard them if  if they 're better auditory quality and there 're only a few people who dis who object . 
F:  And  
F:  I hate it 
F:  because it 's hard to adjust the microphone . 
F:  I mean , I spend all this time fumbling around with it 
F:  and still not reasonable , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  OK , n now may maybe I just don't know this 
F:  but , um , are the only two possibilities from Sony the two that we 've tried ? 
F:  Or is there another  
F:  I see . OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Oh , I see . 
F:  Isn't that something . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Oh . I see . OK . 
F:  Huh , I remember that now . 
F:  OK . 
F:  It might be good to double check at the end of the meeting too , 
F:  cuz that would be an easy place for , uh , an error in the data . 
F:  For it to be forgotten . 
F:  OK , it 's just  I 'm just thinking that if  
F:  it 'd be  
F:  yeah , but I know  but I mean to have the user fill it out wouldn't be as reliable as have the  
F:  Good , OK . 
F:  Perfect . 
F:  Perfect , OK . 
F:  Is that more or less than you thought ? 
F:  Oh , OK . 
F:  We should keep a list of things we 're gonna bleep out and the conditions under which  
F:  It was over here sometimes . 
F:  Should we close the door ? 
F:  Oh , I 'm thinking  I don't know about the acoustics . 
F:  That 's  that 's all I was wondering about . 
F:  Yeah that 's right , we gotta get the obligatory door - slam . 
F:  I guess , 
F:  right , the door - slam phone . 
F:  That 's an idea . 
F:  Wow , wow ! 
F:  Wow . 
F:  That must have been suspenseful . 
F:  XF . 
F:  Oh , different ones ? 
F:  Well what we  what we found out was that um the disk that crashed was  it  w with a  with a meta disk allocation , you had both c t transcripts and the shortened files and the expanded files were all on XE  were on the same  
F:  sorry , 
F:  different partitions of the same physical disk . 
F:  And it 's conceivable 
F:  I mean , I  I don't  
F:  I mean , so um , I was told that it 's possible that that might have , uh , caused additional wear on it . Maybe caused it to  to go bad sooner . 
F:  Oh . Uh - huh . 
F:  Well , why not ? 
F:  Oh sure it does . 
F:  Except that  
F:  Well , I mean , so the wavefiles , or  or anything at all , because the transcripts are there as well . 
F:  Oh , gigabytes . I see . 
F:  Yeah , that 's right . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Is that right . 
F:  That 's very strange . 
F:  I didn't realize that . 
F:  OK . 
F:  And I  and I 'd like , in terms of the conventions , to also , uh , you know , s send a bit to Dan Ellis to see if it 's  if there 's any  get his input on it . 
F:  I don't think  I don't think that 'll be  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah sure . I 'd like to  
F:  OK , now  and you 're just  you 're not talking about the s the X disks  the X uh partitions , 
F:  just the backed up space , 
F:  or  ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  I haven't either . 
F:  Sorry . 
F:  I will by next week , though . 
F:  You 're talking about different files . 
F:  This  
F:  With no  with no advance warning . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Oh no , oh no . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  one  one can imagine that that might be problematic . 
F:  But this  this name change affects a subset , 
F:  doesn't need to reflect everything , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  Isn't that great ? 
F:  And this is not  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And this is not just the Transcriber , 
F:  this is the Channeltrans , 
F:  right ? 
F:  Yeah , excellent . 
F:  Excellent . 
F:  Well , I mean , as it stands , I  I guess  
F:  yeah I see what you mean . 
F:  It 'll  it 'll be on the  on the UNIX side 
F:  but accessible through the H - drive . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Huh . Yeah . 
F:  Wi - without what ? Without VTL . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Do you wanna say that one again ? 
F:  That last one ? 
F:  Or did  did you correct the whole one ? 
F:  Oh he did ? 
F:  Never mind . 
F:  OK good . 
F:  Alright . 
F:  So . 
F:  I think they sh 
F:  It should give the electric shock to the person recording the meeting . 
F:  Yeah .
