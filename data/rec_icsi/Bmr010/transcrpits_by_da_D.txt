D:  OK . 
D:  Number four . 
D:  We talk about the  <laugh> the results of 
D:  use  
D:  IRAM . 
D:  Bi - Bigram . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Nnn , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Jose . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  OK . What  what are the different , uh , classes to  to code , uh , the  the overlap , you will use ? 
D:  What you  you  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Look like , uh , you t you explaining in the blackboard ? 
D:  The  ? 
D:  Yeah ? Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Huh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  We hope . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mmm , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Huh . 
D:  I  I think it 's frequent in  in the meeting . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  No . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Speech research . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  OK . What do you want ? 
D:  Yeah . Sure . 
D:  Yeah . It 's  it 's prepared . 
D:  I  I think it 's  it 's fast , 
D:  because , uh , I have the results , eh , of the study of different energy without the law length . 
D:  Eh , um , eh , 
D:  in the  in the measurement , uh , the average , uh , dividing by the  by the , um , variance . 
D:  Um , I  th i 
D:  the other , uh  the  the last w uh , meeting  
D:  eh , I don't know if you remain 
D:  we have problem to  with the  <mouth> with  with the parameter  
D:  with the representations of parameter , 
D:  because the  the valleys and the peaks in the signal , eh , look like , eh , it doesn't follow to the  to the energy in the signal . 
D:  And it was a problem , uh , with the scale . 
D:  Eh , the scale . 
D:  Eh , and I  I change the scale and we can see the  the variance . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  The distribution  the distribution is  is similar . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mmm , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I  I  I think that , eh , the possibility , eh , can be that , eh , 
D:  Thilo , eh , working , eh , with a new class , 
D:  not only , eh , nonspeech and speech , but , eh , in  in  in the speech class , 
D:  dividing , eh , speech , eh , of  from a speaker and overlapping , 
D:  to try  to  to do , eh , eh , a fast  a fast , eh , <inbreath> experiment to  to prove that , nnn , this fea eh , general feature , <inbreath> eh , can solve the  the  the problem , 
D:  and wh what  
D:  nnn , how far is  
D:  And , I  I have prepared the  the pitch tracker now . 
D:  And I hope the  the next week I will have , eh , some results and we  we will show  we will see , eh , the  the parameter  the pitch , <inbreath> eh , tracking in  with the program . 
D:  And , nnn , nnn  
D:  No . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mmm , yeah . 
D:  Ah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mmm , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Javier  
D:  You mean Ja - eh , eh , Javier program ? 
D:  No , Javier di doesn't worked with , uh , a Markov  
D:  He on only train  
D:  Yeah . It was only Gaussian . 
D:  This is the idea . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  To overrule , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  One . 
D:  But , eh , what did you think about the possibility of using the Javier software ? 
D:  Eh , I mean , the , uh  the , uh  the BIC criterion , 
D:  the  the  t to train the  the Gaussian , 
D:  eh , using the  the mark , eh , by hand , eh , eh , to distinguish be mmm , to train overlapping zone and speech zone . I mean , 
D:  eh , <mouth> I  I  I think that an interesting , eh , experiment , eh , could be , th eh , to prove that , mmm , if s 
D:  we suppose that , eh , the  the first step  <inbreath> I mean , the  the classifier 
D:  what 
D:  were the classifier from Javier or classifier from Thilo ? 
D:  W What happen with the second step ? 
D:  I  I mean , what  what happen with the , eh  the , uh , clu the , uh  the clu the clustering process ? 
D:  Using the  the Gaussian . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I  I mean , that is  is enough  is enough , eh , to work well , eh , to , eh , separate or to distinguish , eh , between overlapping zone and , eh , speaker zone ? 
D:  Because th <inbreath> if  if we  if we , eh , nnn , develop an classifier  and the second step doesn't work  well , eh , we have  another problem . 
D:  N 
D:  Nnn , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Yeah . But is  is  if  
D:  But it 's possible with my segmentation by hand  that we have information about the  the overlapping , 
D:  uh  Yeah . 
D:  The  
D:  N n Yeah . 
D:  No . 
D:  The demonstration by hand . Segmentation by hand I  I  I think is the fast experiment . 
D:  Uh , we can prove that the  
D:  this kind o emph emphasises parameter and Gaussian  
D:  I yeah have . I have . 

D:  OK .
