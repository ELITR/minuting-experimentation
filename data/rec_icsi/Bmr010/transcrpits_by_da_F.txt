F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Well , I 'm  I sent a couple of items . They 're  they 're sort of practical . 
F:  I don't know if you 're  
F:  if  if that 's too practical for what we 're  focused on . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Well , um , I can  give you an update on the  transcription effort . 
F:  Uh , maybe <mike spike> raise the issue of microphone , uh , um procedures 
F:  with reference to the  cleanliness of the recordings . 
F:  And then maybe <mike spike during "be"> ask , th uh , these guys . 
F:  The  we have great  great , uh , p steps forward in terms of the nonspeech - speech pre - segmenting of the signal . 
F:  Well , it 's a  it 's a big improvement . 
F:  I beg your pardon ? 
F:  I beg your pardon ? 
F:  I think that would be a good thing to start with . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Do  I  I hear  you  you didn't  
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Uh , they  they think it 's a terrific improvement . 
F:  And , um , it real it just makes a  a world of difference . 
F:  And , um , y you also did some something in addition 
F:  which was , um , for those in which there <spike during "there"> was , uh , quiet speakers in the mix . 
F:  And you also provided me with several different versions , 
F:  which I compared . 
F:  And so you change <spike in "change"> parameters . 
F:  What  
F:  do you wanna say something about the parameters <spike on /p/> that you change ? 
F:  Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . 
F:  That 's true . 
F:  But <spike on "but"> it  it saves so much time  the  the <spike> transcribers 
F:  just enormous , enormous savings . 
F:  Fantastic . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  OK . But then there 's another thing that also Thilo 's involved with , 
F:  which is , um  
F:  OK , and  and also Da - Dave Gelbart . 
F:  So there 's this  this problem of  
F:  and w and  so we had this meeting . 
F:  Th - the <spike>  also Adam , before the  the  before you went away . 
F:  Uh we , um  regarding the representation <spike on /p/ of "representation"> of overlaps , 
F:  because at present , <spike on /p/> <inbreath> um , because <spike on /b/> of the limitations of <inbreath> th the interface we 're using , 
F:  overlaps are , uh , not being <spike on /b/> encoded by <spike on /b/> the transcribers in as complete <spike on /p/> and , uh , detailed a way as it might be , 
F:  and as might be desired  I think would be desired in the corpus ultimately . 
F:  So we don't have start and end points <spike on /p/> at each point where there 's an overlap . 
F:  We just have the  the <spike on "the"> overlaps <spike on /p/> encoded in a simple bin . 
F:  Well , OK . So <spike> @ @ the limits of the <spike on "the"> over of  of the interface are <inbreath> such that we were  at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand <spike on /p/> the  the <inbreath> interface or find other tools which already  do what would be useful . 
F:  Because what would ultimately be , um , ideal in my  my view 
F:  and I think  I mean , I had the sense that it was consensus , 
F:  is that , um , a thorough - going musical score notation would be <spike on /b/> the best way to go . 
F:  Because <spike on /b/> you can have multiple channels , 
F:  there 's a single time - line , 
F:  it 's very clear , flexible , and all those nice things . 
F:  OK . So , um , 
F:  um , I spoke  I had a meeting with Dave Gelbart on  on  and he had , uh , excellent ideas on how  the interface could be  modified to  to do this kind of representation . 
F:  But , um , he  in the meantime you were checking into the existence of already , um , existing interfaces which might already have these properties . 
F:  So , do you wanna say something about that ? 
F:  Under Windows . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . We could  uh , potentially <spikes on /p/ and /t/> so . 
F:  I also wanted to be sure  
F:  I mean , I 've  I 've seen the  
F:  this  this is called Praat , PRAAT , <spike on /p/> which I guess means spee speech in Dutch or something . 
F:  But  
F:  In terms <spike on /t/> of it being <spike on /b/> Windows <spike on /d/> versus  
F:  But I 'm just wondering , is  ? 
F:  Oh ! I see . 
F:  Oh , I see . 
F:  So Praat may not be  
F:  It 's a different one . 
F:  I see . 
F:  Oh , I see . 
F:  OK . OK . Alright . 
F:  Mmm , yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And  and I was just thinking that , um , <inbreath> if it were possible to bring that in , like , <breath> you know , this week , 
F:  then <spike on /th/> when they 're encoding the overlaps <spike on /p/> it would be nice for them to be able to specify when  you know , the start points and end points of overlaps . 
F:  uh Th - they 're <spike> making really quick progress . 
F:  And , um , so my  my goal was  w m my charge was to get eleven hours by the end of the month . 
F:  And it 'll be  I 'm  I 'm  I 'm clear that we 'll be able to do that . 
F:  I sent <spike on /t/> it to , 
F:  um  
F:  who did I send that to ? 
F:  I sent it to a list 
F:  and I thought <spike on /t/> I sent it to <spike on /t/> the <spike on "the">  e to the local list . 
F:  You saw that ? 
F:  So Brian did tell <spike on /t/> me that <spike on /th/> in fact what you said , that , <spike> uh  that <spike on /th/> our  
F:  that they are  making progress 
F:  and that he 's going  that <spike on /th/> they 're <spike on /th/> going  he 's gonna check the f the output of the first transcription 
F:  and  
F:  and  
F:  Oh , that 's  
F:  this is a new development . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Super . 
F:  Super . 
F:  OK . Great . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Isn't that great ? 
F:  Yes . That 's true . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Good . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah , exactly . 
F:  And just keep those <spike on /th/> things separate . 
F:  And  and , um , Dan Ellis 's hack already allows them to be <spike on /b/> able to display <inbreath> different <spikes on /d/ and /t/> waveforms to clarify overlaps and things , 
F:  so that 's already  
F:  Oh , yes , but  
F:  Well , <breath-laugh> uh , yes , but <spike on /b/> what I mean is  that , uh , from the transcriber 's <spike on /t/> perspective , uh , those <spike on /th/> two functions are separate . 
F:  And Dan Ellis 's hack handles the , <inbreath> um , choice <spike on /ch/>  the ability to choose different waveforms <inbreath> from moment to moment . 
F:  Um  
F:  That 's true . 
F:  Yeah , 
F:  but <spike on /b/> that 's  that 's OK , 
F:  cuz they 're  they 're , 
F:  you know , they 're focused on the ear anyway . 
F:  And then  and then 
F:  the hack to <inbreath> preserve the overlaps <spikes> better would be one which creates different output files for each channel , 
F:  which then <spike on /th/> would also serve Liz 's request  of having , 
F:  you know , a single channel , 
F:  separable , uh , cleanly , easily separable , 
F:  uh , transcript tied to a single channel , uh , audio . 
F:  Not directly . 
F:  I 'm trying to think if  if I could have gotten it over a list . 
F:  I don't  I don't think so . 
F:  Oh ! This was from before December . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  OK . OK . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  OK . 
F:  I 'm keeping the conventions  absolutely  as simple <spike on /p/> as possible . 
F:  Yeah . Yeah . 
F:  N there was also this , <spike on /th/> uh , email from Dan regarding the  speech - non nonspeech segmentation thing . 
F:  I don't know if , 
F:  uh , 
F:  uh , we wanna , 
F:  uh  
F:  and Dan Gel - and Dave Gelbart is interested in pursuing the aspect <spike on /p/> of using amplitude <spike on /t/> as a  a  a  as a basis for the separation . 
F:  Cross 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Fantastic . 
F:  Cuz there is one thing that we don't have right now and that is the automatic , um , channel identifier . 
F:  That  that , you know , that would g help in terms of encoding of overlaps . 
F:  The  the transcribers would have less , uh , disentangling to do  if that were available . 
F:  But . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Um , to code d 
F:  so types of overlap ? 
F:  Um , so <spikes during "so"> at a meeting that wasn't transcribed , we worked up a  a typology . 
F:  And , um  
F:  Yes , exactly . 
F:  That hasn't changed . 
F:  So 
F:  it <spike on /t/> i the  it 's basically a two - tiered structure where the first one is whether <spike on /th/> the person who 's interrupted continues or not . 
F:  And then below that there 're <spike on /th/> subcategories , uh , that have more to do with , <spike on /th/> you know , is it , <inbreath> uh , simply <spike on first syllable> backchannel 
F:  or is <spike> it , um , someone completing someone else 's thought , 
F:  or is it someone in introducing a new thought . 
F:  Mm - hmm . Well , <inbreath> one would  
F:  That 'd be  that 'd be nice . 
F:  I mean , <inbreath> I  I  I  I 've  
F:  This is wonderful <spike on /d/> to have a direct contact like that . 
F:  uh Well , th lemme ask <spike on /k/> you this . 
F:  It occurs to me  <inbreath> one of my transcribers t <spike on /t/> told <spike on /t/> me today that she 'll <spike on "she'll"> be finished with one meeting , <inbreath> um , by  
F:  well , she said tomorrow 
F:  but then she said <spike on "said">  you know , 
F:  but <spike on "but">  the , you know  let 's  let 's just , uh , say 
F:  maybe the day after just to be s on the safe side . 
F:  I could send Brian the , <spike on "the"> um  the <spike on "the"> transcript . 
F:  I know these <spike on "these"> are  
F:  er , uh , I could send him that <spike on /th/> if <spike on /f/> it would be possible , <spike on /p/> or a good idea or not , to <spike on /t/> try <spike on /t/> to do a s forced alignment on what we 're  on the way we 're encoding overlaps now . 
F:  Good . 
F:  Yeah ! 
F:  Super . Super . 
F:  Yeah , yeah . 
F:  Oh ! 
F:  Yeah . I  I  I don't know for sure . 
F:  That would be <spike on /b/> like  that 'd be like him . 
F:  He 's great . 
F:  Yeah . That 'd be great . 
F:  And there 's no adaptor for it ? 
F:  Seems like there 'd be a  
F:  OK . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  Wow . 
F:  Is  
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  That 's interesting . 
F:  Well , what I wondered is whether it 's possible to have  <inbreath> to maybe use the display at the beginning 
F:  to be able to  to judge how  how correctly  
F:  I mean , have someone do some routine whatever , 
F:  and  and then see if when they 're breathing it 's showing . 
F:  I don't know if the  if it 's  
F:  Can you see the breathing ? 
F:  Cuz I  
F:  Oh . 
F:  Yeah . Uh - huh . 
F:  Good . 
F:  Yeah , i 
F:  That 's true . 
F:  It just seems like i if something l simple like that can be tweaked <inbreath> and the quality goes , you know , uh , dramatically up , then it might be worth  doing . 
F:  But  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  My  my feedback from the transcribers is he is always close to crystal clear and  and just fan fantastic to  
F:  Well , I mean , you  Yeah , of course . You 're  you 're also  
F:  uh , your volume is  is greater . 
F:  But  but still , I mean , they  they say  
F:  I it makes their  their job extremely easy . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I could say something about  about the  
F:  Well , I don't know what you wanna do . Yeah . 
F:  About the transcribers or anything or  ? 
F:  I don't know . 
F:  They are . 
F:  They 're putting  Eh , so in curly brackets they put " inhale " or " breath " . 
F:  It  they  and then in curly brackets they say " laughter " . 
F:  Now they 're  <inbreath> they 're not being  awfully precise , 
F:  uh , m So they 're two types of laughter that are not being distinguished . 
F:  One is <inbreath> when sometimes s someone will start laughing when they 're in the middle of a sentence . 
F:  And  and then the other one is when they finish the sentence and then they laugh . 
F:  So , um , I  I did s I did some double checking to look through  
F:  I mean , <laugh> you 'd need to have extra 

F:  e extra complications , like time tags indicating the beginning and ending of  <inbreath> of the laughing through the utterance . 
F:  And that  and what they 're doing is in both cases just saying " curly brackets laughing " a after the unit . 
F:  Good . 
F:  Oh ! 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Then  
F:  And let me ask y 
F:  and I gotta ask you one thing about that . 
F:  So , um , 
F:  if they laugh between two words , you  you 'd get it in between the two words . 
F:  But if they laugh across three or four words you  you get it after those four words . 
F:  Does that matter ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  I think he 's right . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Good . 
F:  You  you did get me to thinking about  
F:  I  I 'm not really sure which is more frequent , 
F:  whether f f laughing  
F:  I think it may be an individual thing . Some people are more prone to laughing when they 're speaking . 
F:  But I can't  
F:  Yeah . OK . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Um , um , the  I  I 'm really very for I 'm extremely fortunate with the people who , uh , applied and who are transcribing for us . 
F:  They <inbreath> are , um , um , uh really perceptive and very , um  
F:  and I 'm not just saying that cuz they might be hearing this . 
F:  No , they 're super . They 're  the they  very quick . 
F:  Yeah , I know . I am  I 'm serious . 
F:  They 're just super . 
F:  So I , um , e you know , I  I brought them in and , um , trained them in pairs 
F:  because I think people can raise questions  
F:  you know , i i the they think about different things 
F:  and they think of different  
F:  and um , 
F:  I trained them to , uh , f on about a minute or two of the one that was already transcribed . 
F:  This also gives me a sense of  
F:  You know , I can  I can use that later , with reference to inter - coder reliability kind of issues . 
F:  But the main thing was to get them used to the conventions 
F:  and , <inbreath> you know , the idea of the  th th the size of the unit versus how long it takes to play it back 
F:  so these  th sort of calibration issues . 
F:  And then , um , I just set them loose 
F:  and they 're  
F:  they all have e a already background in using computers . 
F:  They 're , um  they 're trained in linguistics . 
F:  They got  
F:  Well , they they 're very perce 
F:  they 'll  So one of them said " well , you know , he really said " n " , 
F:  not really " and " , 
F:  so what <laugh>  what should I do with that ? " 
F:  And I said , " well for our purposes , 
F:  I do have a convention . If it 's an  a noncanonical p " 
F:  That one , I think we  you know , with Eric 's work , I sort of figure we  we can just treat that as a variant . 
F:  But I told them if  if there 's an obvious speech error , uh , like I said in one thing , 
F:  and I gave my  my example , like I said , " microfon "  in instead of " microphone " . 
F:  Didn't bother  
F:  I knew it when I said it . 
F:  I remember s thinking " oh , that 's not correctly pronounced " . 
F:  But it  but I thought <laugh> it 's not worth fixing 
F:  cuz often when you 're speaking everybody knows what  what you mean . 
F:  But I have a convention that if it 's obviously a noncanonical pronunciation  a speech error with  you know , wi within the realm of resolution that you can tell in this native English  American English speaker , you know that I didn't mean to say " microfon . " 
F:  Then you 'd put a little tick at the beginning of the word , 
F:  and that just signals that , um , this is not standard , 
F:  and then in curly brackets " pron <spike on /p/> error " . 
F:  And , um , and other than that , it 's w word level . 
F:  But , you know , the fact that they noticed , you know , the " nnn " . " He said " nnn " , not " and " . 
F:  What shall I do with that ? " 
F:  I mean , they 're very perceptive . 
F:  And  and s several of them are trained in IPA . 
F:  C they really could do phonetic transcription if  if we wanted them to . 
F:  I think  
F:  And I 'm also thinking these people are a terrific pool . 
F:  I mean , if , uh  so I  I told them that , um , we don't know if this will continue past the end of the month 
F:  and I also  
F:  m I 
F:  think they know that the data p source is limited 
F:  and I may not be able to keep them employed till the end of the month 
F:  even , although I hope to . 
F:  And  
F:  Oh , that 'd be so super . 
F:  They would be so  s so terrific . 
F:  Mm - hmm , that 's right . 
F:  And with the right in interface  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  That 'd be great . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Oh , wonderful . 
F:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
F:  Wonderful . 
F:  And then school will start in  in the sixt on the sixteenth . 
F:  Some of them will have to cut back their hours at that point . 
F:  But  <spike on /b/> <inbreath> Some of them are . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Well , why do I wouldn't say forty - hour weeks . 
F:  No . 
F:  But what I mean is  
F:  Oh , I shouldn't say it that way 
F:  because <spike on /b/> that does sound like forty - hour weeks . 
F:  No . 
F:  I th I  I would say they 're probably <spike on /p/>  they don't have o they don't have other things that are taking away their time . 
F:  But <spike on /b/> it 's  
F:  you can't . 
F:  No . You 're right . 
F:  It 's  i it would be too taxing . 
F:  But , um , they 're putting <spike on /p/> in a lot of  
F:  And  and I checked them over . 
F:  I  I  I haven't checked them all , 
F:  but  just spot - checking . 
F:  They 're fantastic . 
F:  Yeah . Yeah . 
F:  Well , you know , and I also thought , y Liz has this , eh , you know , and I do also , this  this interest in the types of overlaps that are involved . 
F:  These people would be <spike on /b/> great choices for doing coding of that type if we wanted , 
F:  or 
F:  whatever . So , um . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Th - that 'd be  I think that 's a  a good idea . 
F:  You know , there 's also , the e In my mind , 
F:  I think A An - Andreas was  leading to this topic , 
F:  the idea that , um , <inbreath> we haven't yet seen the  the type of transcript that we get from IBM , 
F:  and it may just be , you know , pristine . 
F:  But on the other hand , given the lesser interface  
F:  Cuz this is , you know  we 've got a good interface , 
F:  we 've got great headphones , m 
F:  um  
F:  Something like that . 
F:  That 's  that 's true . 
F:  Al - although you have to s Don't you have to start with a close enough approximation <spike on /p/> of the  of the verbal part <spike on /p/> to be able to  ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Oh , excellent . 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Excellent . 
F:  I guess there 's another aspect , too , 
F:  and I don't know  
F:  uh , this  this is  very possibly a different , uh , topic . 
F:  But , <spike on /b/> uh , just let me say  with reference to this idea of , um , <inbreath> higher - order organization within meetings . 
F:  So like in a  
F:  you know , the topics that are covered during a meeting with reference to the other , uh , uses of the data , 
F:  so being able to  find where so - and - so talked about such - and - such , 
F:  then , um , um  
F:  e I mean , I  I  I did sort of a  <inbreath> a rough  pass <spike on /p/> on encoding , like , episode - like level things on the , uh , transcribed meeting  
F:  already transcribed meeting . 
F:  And I don't know if , um  
F:  where <spike on /wh/> that  i if that 's something that we wanna do with each meeting , 
F:  sort of like a , um  
F:  it 's like a manifest , when you get a box full of stuff , 
F:  or  or if that 's , um  
F:  I mean , i I  I don't know what uh , level of detail would be most useful . 
F:  I don't know i if that 's something that  I should do when I look over it , or if we want someone else to do , or whatever . 
F:  But this issue of the contents of the meeting 
F:  in an outline form . 
F:  OK . 
F:  OK . 
F:  That 's fine . 
F:  I 'm finished . 
F:  Oh , yeah . 
F:  Oh , yes . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Oh , k Sorry . 
F:  Scale . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  He has this on his board actually . 
F:  Don't you have , like those  those several different <laugh> categories on the board ? 
F:  Mm - hmm .
