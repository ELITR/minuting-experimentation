D:  Yeah . 
D:  Transcript  Uh . OK , OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh - huh . Yeah . 
D:  To 
D:  right . 
D:  Yeah , interesting . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Well -  <inbreath> OK . 
D:  I  I remind that me  my first objective eh , in the project is to  to study difference parameters 
D:  to  to find a  a good solution to detect eh , the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded . 
D:  But eh , <mouth> tsk ,  <inbreath> ehhh  In that way  I  <mouth> I  <mouth> I begin to  to study and to analyze the ehn  the recorded speech eh the different session 
D:  to  to find and to locate and to mark eh the  the different overlapping zone . 
D:  And eh so eh I was eh  I am transcribing the  the first session 
D:  and I  I have found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events , 
D:  eh besides the overlapping zones , eh I  I  I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh , eh , talk eh , eh , clap , 
D:  eh   I don't know what is the different names eh you use to  to name the  the  n speech 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Eh , <mouth> I  I  I do I don't need to  to  to mmm <mouth>  to m to label the  the different acoustic , 
D:  but I prefer because eh I would like to  to study if eh , I  I will find eh , eh , a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping 
D:  I would like to  to  to test these parameters eh with the  another eh , eh acoustic events , 
D:  to nnn  <mouth> to eh  to find what is the ehm  the false  eh , the false eh hypothesis eh , nnn , which eh are produced when we use the  the ehm  this eh parameter  eh I mean pitch eh , eh , difference eh , feature  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Ye 
D:  I  I  I  I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general , 
D:  but eh my  my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone . 
D:  Eh ?  n Eh in twelve minutes I found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events . 
D:  How many ? 
D:  Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session 
D:  in five  eh in forty - five minutes . 
D:  Alm - Three hundred overlapping zone . 
D:  With the overlapping zone , overlapping speech  speech what eh different duration . 
D:  Yeah , three people , two people . 
D:  Eh , um I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background , 
D:  be 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I consider one event eh for th for that eh for all the zone . 
D:  This  th I  I  I con I consider  I consider eh an acoustic event , the overlapping zone , the period where three speaker or eh  are talking together . 
D:  So - I don't understand . 
D:  Yeah ? 
D:  Eh no . No no . 
D:  For me is the overlapping zone , 
D:  because  because you  you have s you have more one  eh , more one voice eh , eh produced in a  in  in a moment . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  If 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I consider the  the , nnn  the nnn , nnn  eh , the entirety 
D:  eh , eh , all  all the time there were  the voice has overlapped . 
D:  This is the idea . 
D:  But eh I  I don't distinguish between the  the numbers of eh speaker . 
D:  Uh , I 'm not considering <mouth> eh the  the  ehm <mouth> eh , the fact of eh , eh , for example , what did you say ? 
D:  Eh at first eh , eh two talkers are uh , eh speaking , 
D:  and eh , eh a third person eh join to  to that . 
D:  For me , it 's eh  it 's eh , all overlap zone , with eh several numbers of speakers is eh , eh the same acoustic event . 
D:  Wi - but  uh , without any mark between the zone  of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together , 
D:  and the zone with the three speakers . 
D:  It  One . One . 
D:  Eh , with eh , a beginning mark and the ending mark . 
D:  Because eh <mouth> for me , is the  is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral . 
D:  I don't mind  By the moment , by the moment . 
D:  I  I don't  
D:  Yeah , but eh  but eh I have to study .  What will happen in a general way , 
D:  I  <laugh> I don't know what eh will  will happen with the  
D:  Yeah ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah ,  but  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  But  
D:  General . 
D:  I  I con I consider  I consider acoustic events eh , the silent too . 
D:  Yeah , silent , ground 
D:  to  bec to detect  eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech . 
D:  In ge in  in  in a general point of view . 
D:  in the per 
D:  Too much speech . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh silent , 
D:  I  I  I  I don't  I  I haven't the  
D:  eh I  I would like to  to do a stylistic study 
D:  and give you eh with the report eh from eh the  the study from the  the  the session  one session . 
D:  And I  I found that eh another thing . 
D:  When eh <mouth> eh I w I  <mouth> I was eh look at eh nnn , the difference speech file , 
D:  um , for example , eh if eh we use the ehm  the mixed file , to  to transcribe , the  the events and the words , I  I saw that eh the eh speech signal , collected by the eh this kind of mike  eh of this kind of mike , eh are different from the eh mixed signal eh , we eh  collected by headphone . 
D:  And  It 's right . 
D:  But the problem is <laugh> the following . 
D:  The  the  the  
D:  I  I  I knew that eh the signal eh , eh would be different , 
D:  but eh the  the problem is eh , eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by  by that mike uh qui compared with the mixed file . 
D:  And so if  when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn  the mixed file , it 's possible  eh if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system , 
D:  it 's possible you eh  in the eh 
D:  i and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh fet mike , to eh  to nnn  to do the experiments  with the  the system , 
D:  its possible to evaluate eh , eh  or to consider eh acoustic events that  which you marked eh in the mixed file , but eh they don't appear in the eh speech signal eh collected by the  by the mike . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Oh , it 's a good idea . 
D:  It 's a good idea I think . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So and I  I  <mouth> I say eh that eh , eh , or this eh only because eh I c I  I  <mouth> in my opinion , it 's necessary to eh  to eh  to put the transcription on the speech file , collected by the objective signal . 
D:  I mean the  the  the signal collected by the  eh , the real mike in the future , in the prototype to  to eh correct the initial eh segmentation eh with the eh real speech 
D:  you have to  to analyze  
D:  you have to  to process . 
D:  Because I  I found a difference . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I  I  I think eh 
D:  I saw the nnn  the  eh 
D:  but eh I eh  I have eh any results . 
D:  I  I  I saw the  the speech file collected by eh the fet mike , 
D:  and eh eh signal eh to eh  to noise eh relation is eh low . 
D:  It 's low . 
D:  It 's very low . You would comp if we compare it with eh the headphone . 
D:  And 
D:  I  I found that nnn  that eh , <mouth> ehm , pr probably , 
D:  I 'm not sure eh by the moment , 
D:  but it 's  it 's probably that eh a lot of eh , <mouth> eh 
D:  for example , in the overlapping zone , on eh  in  in several eh parts of the files where you  you can find eh , eh <mouth> eh , smooth eh eh speech eh from eh one eh eh talker in the  in the meeting , 
D:  it 's probably in  in that eh  in  in those files you  you can not find  you can not process 
D:  because eh it 's confused with  with noise . 
D:  And there are <mouth> a lot of 
D:  I think . 
D:  But I have to study with more detail . 
D:  But eh my idea is to  to process only  nnn , this eh  nnn , this kind of s of eh speech . 
D:  Because I think it 's more realistic . 
D:  I 'm not sure it 's a good idea , but eh  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . Yeah . 
D:  With  By Jane . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  The  the transcription by Jane , t eh i eh , I  I  I want to use to  to nnn , <mouth> eh to put  
D:  i i it 's a reference for me . 
D:  But eh the transcription  eh for example , I  I don't  I  I 'm not interested in the  in the  in the words , transcription words , eh transcribed eh eh in  eh follow in the  <mouth> in the  in the speech file , but eh eh Jane eh for example eh put a mark eh at the beginning eh of each eh talker , 
D:  in the  in the meeting , 
D:  um eh she  she nnn includes information about the zone where eh there are eh  there is an overlapping zone . 
D:  But eh there isn't any  any mark , time  temporal mark , to  to c eh  to mmm <mouth>  e - heh , to label  the beginning and the end of the  of the 
D:  ta I 'm  I  I  I think eh we need this information to 
D:  Twelve minutes . 
D:  Twelve minutes . 
D:  Twelve . 
D:  No , forty - five minutes is the  is the session , 
D:  all the session . 
D:  Yeah , 
D:  all is the <laugh> the session . 
D:  Tw - twelve hours of work to  <laugh> to segment eh and label eh twelve minutes from a session of part  of f 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  No no no . 
D:  I  I consider all the  all the session because eh I  I count the nnn  the nnn  the overlappings marked by  by Jane , 
D:  in  in  in  in the  fin in  in the  forty - five minutes . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  But , by  by the moment , I  I don't compare , my  my temporal mark with eh Jane , but eh I  I want to do it . 
D:  Because eh eh i per perhaps I have eh errors in the  in the marks , 
D:  I  and if I  I compare with eh Jane , it 's probably I  I  I can correct and  and  and  to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well  
D:  No , it 's  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  I  I  I think  It 's  it 's a good eh work , 
D:  but eh I think we need eh eh more information . 
D:  No , no . I  I have to go to  
D:  I want eh  I wanted to eh compare the  the transcription . 
D:  Only . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK . I  I  I  I w I  I wanted to  
D:  nnn , I don't understand very . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh , yeah , yeah . 
D:  On - only to mark  only to mark overlapping zone , but  
D:  Oh , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  Sure . 
D:  Yeah sure . 
D:  Sure sure . 
D:  Sure , 
D:  because I  I need a lot of time to  to put the label or to do that . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Sure . 
D:  Sure . 
D:  More than ? 
D:  How many ? 
D:  Eh , not @ @ I 
D:  Onl - only I  I transcribe eh only twelve minutes from the 
D:  but eh I  I don't co eh  I don't count eh the  the overlap . 
D:  I consider I  I  The  the nnn  The  the three hundred is eh considered only you  your transcription . 
D:  I have to  <mouth> to finish transcribing . 
D:  So . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah .
