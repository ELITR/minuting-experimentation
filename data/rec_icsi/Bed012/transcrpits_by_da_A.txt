A:  Bandw - Yeah , so you can't do better than something . 
A:  The Crown ? 
A:  Is that the actual name ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yes . 
A:  Indeed . 
A:  Yes , 
A:  I have . 
A:  And , I do . 
A:  Yeah , alright . 
A:  s So where are we ? 
A:  I don't think it can handle French , 
A:  but anyway . 
A:  No . 
A:  I 'm not drinking tea . 
A:  What are you talking about ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Excuse me . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  You should probably  make them out of  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  The different decision nodes , you mean ? 
A:  Well , d yeah , this is making the assumption . 
A:  Yes . 
A:  But I mean , why do we  
A:  If we trusted the Go - there node more th much more than we trusted the other ones , then we would conclude , even in this situation , that he wanted to go there . 
A:  So , in that sense , we weight them equally 
A:  right now . 
A:  Yeah , so , the final d decision is the combination of these three . 
A:  So again , it 's  it 's some kind of , uh  
A:  Yeah , sure . 
A:  A decision node for every possible question , you mean ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So is  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Um , I mean , are you saying that , what happens if you try to scale this up to the situation , or are we just dealing with arbitrary language ? 
A:  Is that your point ? 
A:  For every question ? 
A:  Like  
A:  Hmm . 
A:  I don't  Not necessarily , I would think . 
A:  I mean , it 's not based on constructions , 
A:  it 's based on things like , uh , there 's gonna be a node for Go - there or not , and there 's gonna be a node for Enter , View , Approach . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I mean , in general , like , we won't just have those three , 
A:  right ? 
A:  We 'll have , uh , like , many , many nodes . 
A:  So we have to , like  So that it 's no longer possible to just look at the nodes themselves and figure out what the person is trying to say . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I think that 's true . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Ge 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK , right . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yes , I mean . 
A:  Sure . 
A:  You do need to know  I mean , to have that kind of information . 
A:  Right . 
A:  I guess the other thing is that um , yeah . 
A:  I mean , when you 're asked a specific question and you don't even  
A:  Like , if you 're asked a Where - Is question , you may not even look  like , ask for the posterior probability of the , uh , EVA node , 
A:  right ? 
A:  Cuz , that 's what  I mean , in the Bayes - net you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node . 
A:  So , I mean , 
A:  you may not even bother to compute things you don't need . 
A:  No . 
A:  You can compute , uh , the posterior probability of one subset of the nodes , given some other nodes , 
A:  but totally ignore some other nodes , also . 
A:  Basically , things you ignore get marginalized over . 
A:  Yeah . So you have to make  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yes . 
A:  But I would think that 's what you want to do . 
A:  Right ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I don't know if it would necessarily be that , uh , complicated . 
A:  But , uh  
A:  I mean , it w 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  That 's true , I guess . 
A:  Yeah , <laugh> so , in a way you would have that . 
A:  OK , why 's that ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Alright . 
A:  Well , hopefully it 's  fixable . 
A:  It 's  there 's a  
A:  OK . 
A:  So we can figure this out . 
A:  They should come when they 're done their stuff , basically , whenever that is . 
A:  So . 
A:  Um , 
A:  I guess , Jerry needs to enter marks , 
A:  but I don't know if he 's gonna do that now or later . 
A:  But , uh , if he 's gonna enter marks , it 's gonna take him awhile , I guess , 
A:  and he won't be here . 
A:  Nancy ? 
A:  Um , she was sorta finishing up the , uh , calculation of marks and assigning of grades , 
A:  but I don't know if she should be here . 
A:  Well  or , she should be free after that , 
A:  so  
A:  assuming she 's coming to this meeting . 
A:  I don't know if she knows about it . 
A:  Is she ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Four inputs . 
A:  Those are  The bottom things are inputs , also . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Alarm in the dog ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Sorry . Yeah , I 'm confusing two . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Maybe . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  We 'll meet next Tuesday , I guess . 
A:  Which Friday ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Is he  How long is he gone for ? 
A:  Italy , huh ? 
A:  What 's , uh  what 's there ? 
A:  Pasta . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Just visiting . 
A:  It 's a pretty nice place , 
A:  in my brief , uh , encounter with it . 
A:  Yes . 
A:  h What ? 
A:  Which  
A:  Which ones ? 
A:  Um , what do you mean ? If the Go - there says No , then the Go - there is  
A:  I don't u understand . 
A:  Like , the Go - there depends on all those four things . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , it depends on the situation . 
A:  If the discourse is strongly indicating that  
A:  Oh , I see . The d See , uh , specifically in our situation , D and O are gonna be , uh  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Sure . 
A:  So , whatever . 
A:  Johno ? 
A:  Yeah . People have the same problem with my name . 
A:  Oops . 
A:  Oh , in my name ? 
A:  Before the A . 
A:  People have the inverse problem with my name . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  That 's good . 
A:  I appreciate that . 
A:  " Basman " ? 
A:  Yeah , it 's because of the chessplayer named Michael Basman , 
A:  who is my hero . 
A:  Not Eva ? 
A:  Yeah . It doesn't matter what those nodes are , anyway , 
A:  because we 'll just make the weights " zero " for now . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Sure . 
A:  I mean  
A:  Well  
A:  But how many constructions do  could we possibly have  nodes for ? 
A:  No , we . 
A:  Like , when people do this kind of thing . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Is it considered to be like in  are they considered to be like very , uh , sort of s abstract things ? 
A:  OK , so it 's like in the  thousands . 
A:  OK . 
A:  S 
A:  Discourse - level  constructions . 
A:  Yes . 
A:  How 's that ? <mike noise> How it can be finite , again ? 
A:  But , I mean , in the <mike noise> practical sense , it 's impossible . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , two to the power of the number of neurons . 
A:  Um , yeah , but there 's , like , a certain level of  
A:  Bandw - Yeah , so you can't do better than something .
