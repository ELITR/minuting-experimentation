D:  Yeah . 
D:  No , I w <breath> I begin to play <laugh> with Matlab and to found some parameter robust for voiced - unvoiced decision . 
D:  But only to play . 
D:  And we  <breath> they  we found that maybe w is a classical parameter , the <breath> sq the variance <breath> between the um FFT of the signal and the small spectrum of time <breath> we  after the um mel filter bank . 
D:  And , well , is more or less robust . 
D:  Is good for clean speech . 
D:  Is quite good <laugh> for noisy speech . 
D:  but um we must to have bigger statistic with TIMIT , 
D:  and is not ready yet to use on , 
D:  well , I don't know . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  I have here . 
D:  I have here for one signal , for one frame . 
D:  The  the mix of the two , noise and unnoise , and the signal is this . 
D:  Clean , and this noise . 
D:  These are the two  
D:  the mixed , the big signal is for clean . 
D:  Uh this is uh  this axis is <breath> nnn , " frame " . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Uh , this is uh energy , log - energy of the spectrum . 
D:  Of the 
D:  this is the variance , 
D:  the difference <noise> between the spectrum of the signal and FFT of each frame of the signal 
D:  and this mouth spectrum of time after the f may fit for the two , 
D:  this big , to here , they are to signal . 
D:  This is for clean and this is for noise . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  I  I think that I have d another graph , 
D:  but I 'm not sure . 
D:  The lower is noise and the height is clean . 
D:  It 's height . 
D:  Oh . I must to have . 
D:  Pity , but I don't have two different 
D:  Yeah , it is the height is voiced portion . 
D:  And this is the noise portion . 
D:  And this is more or less like this . 
D:  But I meant to have see @ @ two  two the picture . 
D:  This is , for example , for one frame . 
D:  the  the spectrum of the signal . 
D:  And this is the small version of the spectrum after ML mel filter bank . 
D:  And this is 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  This is not the different . 
D:  This is trying to obtain <breath> with LPC model the spectrum 
D:  but using Matlab without going factor and s 
D:  Not pre - emphasis . 
D:  Nothing . 
D:  And the  
D:  I think that this is good . 
D:  This is quite similar . 
D:  this is  <breath> this is another frame . 
D:  ho how I obtained the <mouth> envelope , <mike noise> this envelope , with the mel filter bank . 
D:  Yeah because when did noise clear <pages turning> in these section is clear 
D:  if s @ @ <noise> val value is indicative that is a voice frame and it 's low values 
D:  you have read up and  you have a paper , <breath> the paper that you s give me yesterday . 
D:  they say that yesterday <breath> they are some <noise> problem 
D:  and the  
D:  Is another problem . 
D:  Yeah like this . 
D:  Of kind like this . 
D:  Yeah .
