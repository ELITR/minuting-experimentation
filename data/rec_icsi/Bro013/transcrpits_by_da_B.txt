B:  Oh , no ! 
B:  OK . 
B:  Thanks . 
B:  Oh . 
B:  Thanks . 
B:  Huh . 
B:  Um <breath> our t I went to <breath> talk with uh Mike Jordan this  this week 
B:  um <noise> and uh <breath> shared with him the ideas about um <breath> extending the Larry Saul work 
B:  and um I asked him some questions about factorial H M 
B:  so like later down the line when <breath> we 've come up with these  these feature detectors , how do we  <breath> how do we uh <breath> you know , uh model the time series that  that happens 
B:  um <breath> <mouth> and <breath> and we talked a little bit about <breath> factorial H M Ms and how <breath> um when you 're doing inference  or w when you 're doing recognition , there 's like simple Viterbi stuff that you can do for  <breath> for these H M 
B:  and <breath> the uh  <breath> the great advantages that um a lot of times the factorial H M Ms don't <breath> um <breath> don't over - alert the problem 
B:  there they have a limited number of parameters and they focus directly on  <breath> on uh the sub - problems at hand 
B:  so <breath> you can imagine <breath> um <mouth> five or so parallel <breath> um features um transitioning independently 
B:  and then <breath> at the end you  you uh couple these factorial H M Ms with uh  <breath> with uh undirected links um based on  <breath> based on some more data . 
B:  So he  he seemed  he seemed like really interested in  <breath> in um  in this 
B:  and said  said this is  this is something very do - able and can learn a lot 
B:  and um 
B:  yeah , I 've just been <breath> continue reading um about certain things . 
B:  um 
B:  thinking of maybe using um <breath> um m modulation spectrum stuff to <breath> um  as features um also in the  in the sub - bands 
B:  because <breath> it seems like <breath> the modulation um spectrum tells you a lot about the intelligibility of  of certain um words and stuff 
B:  So , um . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Just 
B:  that 's about it . 
B:  Ha ! 
B:  Yeah I normally say " O " cuz it 's easier to say . 
B:  " O " 
B:  Oh , no !
