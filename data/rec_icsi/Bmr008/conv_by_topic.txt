E:  <static noise> 
A:  Yeah , I do it 
D:  Or , I like it , also , like this .  
B:  OK 
E:  Yeah I  
D:  So you see the  
B:  Yeah . 
E:  I just tried it . I think my  head is too big . 
D:  So . 
F:  <inbreath> 
A:  My head 's too big , also . <laugh> It 's too ba 
F:  And there is a problem that you can hear it come and go , 
F:  cuz when you turn your head , then 
F:   you drift away from the microphone . 
E:  Oh yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh , that 's true . 
topic_description:	opening


B:  OK  
E:  The distance isn't  
B:  so  let 's uh 
A:  course that 's true of a lapel as well . 
B:  Let 's discuss agenda items .  What did we have ? 
D:  I should have brought more  
F:  Yes . 
B:  uh  You  you were 
D:  I have a  couple things about speaker form  
B:  announce some things 
D:  about forms in general . 
B:  OK , forms 
B:   is one thing  uh , there 's 
B:  status on  on the uh 
B:  <breathing> transcription 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  discussion   which will take us about thirty seconds 
D:  Stuff . 
B:  <breath>  uh  
E:  <laugh> 
B:  and then uh Jose  as usual  
B:  uh , the one among us who 's actually doing a bunch of things on this 
B:  <breath> uh 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  He has  this and I think we can have some  
B:  I was just glancing through it , so I think we 
B:  have something to discuss  about . 
B:  <breath> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  um 
B:  and 
B:  um 
B:  We just sent in that uh 
B:  NSF pre - proposal but I don't think there 's much to say about that except 
B:  we 've sent it in and 
B:  we 'll see what happens  
B:  um 
B:  Anybody ? Anything ? 
F:  That 's it .  
B:  Anything else  going on ? No . OK . 
B:  So 
B:  Why don't we do it in that order ?  Go ahead . 
D:  OK . 
topic_description:	summary of meeting agenda items


D:  I uh  probably should have printed out more of these . 
D:  So one of the things that I 've been doing with the digits forms is I 've been adding more and more speaker specific information to them and it 's getting pretty crowded and you have to fill it out each time . 
D:  <breath> 
topic_description:	forms


D:  So , what I thought was , it would be nice to have a single speaker form that you fill out once . 
D:  And then , on the digits form you just have to put your name down 
D:  and you can look it up from the speaker form . 
D:  so , I had a first pass of it , 
D:  and I 
D:   spoke with Jane a bit about how to specify 
D:  what language and education and that sort of stuff and so I have a first pass at it . 
D:  And I was uh just wondering if people had any comments on information that should or shouldn't be on it . 
D:  And I  only did one copy which was really stupid of me . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  um 
D:  So I 'll just sort of say what it 's on and then I can hand it around . 
D:  So the top of it is  
D:  uh , Name , Sex 
D:  Email or Other Contact Information . 
D:  And I put the contact information just in case we have people with the same name , 
D:  so that you can distinguish them , 
D:  and then also just to have a separate contact from the consent form . 
D:  And then , uh , we talked a little bit about whether to do  
D:  how we get at the background . 
D:  And then uh , as Jane said , the last question is " List other language influences , bilingual dialects , et cetera . " And that 's just and open - ended 
A:  Oh . Mm - hmm . 
D:  place for them to  do . 
A:  Sounds good . 
F:  That 's to handle that unusual percent  
D:  And then  
F:  or two . Yeah . 
D:  And then the bottom of the form is for  
D:  not for them to fill out , but for us to fill out , 
D:  for um 
D:  the aliases and database  speaker database that the person is in , 
D:  since we 'll eventually anonymize and this will be a form a place for us to 
D:  connect the two . And then the meetings that they attended , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  because there 'll be one form for each person . 
A:  Sounds good . 
F:  It 's very efficient . 
D:  OK . So . 
D:  Yeah , I guess I 'll fiddle around yet again with the language stuff . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  I don't think you really have to do all that much . 
B:  d I yeah . 
F:  <inbreath> Well , you  
A:  It  it gets into a can of worms . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  I mean , the more you ask , the more you realize that 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  you 're not getting great answers to what you 're asking and  
E:  N Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  <inbreath> 
topic_description:	speaker form


D:  And we could do profession , but 
D:  it 's so uniform 
D:  that we figured what was more important 
D:  was  actually the education level . 
D:  <breath> 
D:  um 
D:  At least that would get at some idea of their background . So I have a  
F:  <inbreath> Well  
F:  and it 's also relevant to status . 
F:  I c I can insert that . 
D:  And s and relevant to status . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  So that  what I have is 
D:  uh 
E:  Status ? 
F:  Which might in af affect the discourse aspects . 
F:  So , go ahead . 
E:  Oh  oh , stats kind of status , OK . 
F:  His  Uh - huh . Yeah . 
D:  So  uh , I have uh , 
F:  Categories .  
D:  five things that you can circle , 
D:  Undergrad , Grad , 
D:  Post - doc , Professor , and then Other , with a colon and a place where you can fill in if there 's some Other . 
D:  So I think the problem with that is that there 's not a necessarily easy equivalent for our visitors , 
D:  who are  not used to the  
D:  US education levels . 
D:  and  may need some  
D:  help to translate what that means . 
B:  <breath> 
B:  How fine a resolution do you need on that 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  for this ? 
C:  Is the question . 
B:  I mean  
D:  <inbreath> 
B:  maybe not so much . 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Student , Non - student . 
F:  Oh  I think undergrad  is useful . 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Can you just write something like " position " ? 
A:  and people can fill in their own  you know , 
B:  P prone . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  " Post - doc " or  " visitor " or whatever . 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Sitting . 
C:  <laugh> @ @ 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  Well , the problem with that is 
D:  um , I think the same as the problem of profession . 
D:  That it  it will be  there will be a tendency all  for everyone to put down " speech researcher " or  
D:  or something at that granularity . 
A:  oh . 
D:  So 
D:  I don't think there 's a problem asking the education level , I th 
D:  At least I don't feel like there is . 
D:  um 
D:  I think the only question is whether the  what categories should there be . 
F:  Yeah .  
F:  I think that  so 
F:  Uh  did  are  were you suggesting that it should be more fine grained than this ? 
B:  No , no . Less . 
D:  Less . 
F:  Less ? What would you suggest as a  as a change ? 
B:  Um , 
B:  Hmm 
B:  um 
B:  well , do you think there 's  
B:  I don't really know . 
B:  I mean , were you thinking , uh , that it 
B:  would be useful for some research later 
B:  to know say , you said undergrad for instance , so , undergrad versus grad , do you think that 's important ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  I do , and the reason is because I think that 
B:  OK . 
F:  um , well having been a grad  student as , yeah , 
D:  <clear throat> 
F:  a as others here , 
F:  at  at Berkeley , 
F:  that , um , 
F:  I think there 's almost like a quantum leap from undergrad to grad 
F:  in terms of like the status . 
F:  I mean , I mean you notice it in various ways , like 
F:  simply  trying to meet with a professor during office hours . 
F:  You know , in  in my department it was always the case grad students had a huge  
F:  amount of different priority , and were treated as equals , g and  
F:  and help helpers , you know , in  in 
F:  research , uh 
F:  uh c uh  
F:  roles and things that they  
F:  that they  In terms of like the s the social dynamics of interactions , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I would expect them to be 
F:  less deferent . 
F:  and  um 
B:  I see . 
F:  maybe  less assertive of their own views and things like that . 
F:  I don't  think that we 're going to have a lot of undergrads , 
D:  Right . 
F:  unless we  branch out to different types of meetings , but  
E:  How about  
E:  You could say , if you 're giving a talk , how likely are you to be challenged ? 
F:  This is the dimension . 
C:  <hiccup> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  Well , this is the dimension . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Well , one of the  one of the criteria 
F:  Yeah , but  
F:  One  one dimension . 
D:  I had for designing this form , is that I didn't want a separate instruction sheet . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  And so we 'll get to that in a moment when we talk about language also . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Is I did not want to have to , you know come down and quiz each person and have a 
D:  uh 
D:  social dynamics expert 
D:  being the one who 's filling out the answers . I want it to be self - evaluating . You 
D:  can give it to them and they can understand what you 're asking . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And it 's non - threatening , I mean , this  this compared to , you know , 
D:  Yep . 
F:  wh exactly what level of professorship , and  <laugh> and   
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Well , sounds like you really need to know something kind of like that . You need to know sort of 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  <2 uncodeable fragments> 
E:  Bas - in in this meeting , 
E:  sort of what is your social status ? 
D:  That 's a separate question . 
D:   So , we 'll  
D:  We 'll 
F:  Well , I agree with him , though . I  Yeah . 
D:  get to that in a moment . 
F:  But I  I agree that this is 
F:  that w 
F:  the rea the motivation was 
F:  things that could affect social dynamics in ways that are relevant to the research 
F:  without being threatening to the person . 
E:  But  but  but it 's gonna depend on who 's  
D:  And this particular form  
D:  I know . So , this particular form 
D:  is speaker  
D:  is dependent only on the speaker , not on the meeting . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  You could imagine then having another form 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  that you might want to do during a meeting 
D:  to get out the relationships  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  But then that 's interfering with the meeting . 
D:  So , what I like about this information is you give it to them once , 
D:  and they fill it out once , 
D:  and  and then you have that information . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  well , 
F:  and we  also discussed the idea of having 
E:  I g 
B:  I 
F:  the separate D T Ds would handle 
F:  maybe , s specific  meeting - specific things that might be relevant . 
B:  DTD ? 
F:  uh , the data , so that , you know , his XML thing ? 
F:  You got 
B:  Oh . 
F:  the Data Type Definition  
F:  the Document Type Definition p part 
B:  Oh , OK . 
C:  Ah . 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  that it 's  can s be used for relational things , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  DTD . 
E:  I guess  
B:  See - 
E:  I guess it seems to me like you know I  trying to 
E:  deduce information about the person 's status 
E:  from the meeting independent form  will be useless because  
D:  Not at all . I mean , the fact that 
D:  one person 's an undergrad and the other 's a full professor is interesting . 
D:  So , the question is how much of this information 
D:  um , 
E:  But , that will depend on what the meeting 's about , 
D:  can y 
E:  right ? Let 's say the undergrad was an expert in physics , and  
D:  Well , absolutely ! 
C:  @ @ 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  But  but you want to have that information . 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  Right ? So , if you don't have that information , 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  how are you gonna do anything ? 
E:  I guess I 'm wondering how can you make a conclusion 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  yeah 
F:  Where 'd  
E:  based on that , 
F:  This is just  
E:  if you don't know about the meeting ? 
F:  Well , you know , we 're  we 're talking at  at a general level of description . You can always get more specific . 
B:  yeah 
F:  And , it may be  
D:  I mean , so what would you suggest ? 
E:  I don't know . I 'm just  
D:  <laugh> 
E:  That 's why I was  wondering about if you can put something about the d 
B:  Right . 
A:  @ @  
A:  <clear throat> 
A:  Can you repeat the categories you had ? Maybe they 're fine . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Undergrad , Grad , Post - doc , Professor , Other 
A:  So that , yeah , I think that 's fine 
A:  except the one  
A:  thing is there are a lot of ICSI v like I don't know what I would be here , just 
A:  I 'm not a professor  I 'm not a  
F:  <inbreath> 
D:  <inbreath> 
A:  So  so anything that , like a Visitor r ICSI Visitor or , ICSI y I mean a 
D:  oh , that 's right , you know I was saying " Professor " . 
D:  <inbreath> 
F:  <inbreath> 
D:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Visiting S 
D:  Yeah , when I said " Professor " , I guess what I was thinking in my mind was more 
A:  Researcher or whatever . 
D:  " PHD but not Post - doc " . 
B:  How about  
A:  So if  
B:  Yeah , how about 
D:  and  
A:  if we can put something  
B:  Post - PHD researcher or something 
A:  Yeah , that  then  
A:  then I think what you have is great . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  for  for that purpose and  
F:  So , change  
B:  Right ? 
F:  Would we change " Post - doc " to  
F:  " Post - PHD Researcher " ? 
A:  or just  
D:  Or maybe Post - doc  
D:  change " Post - doc " to " PHD " ? 
A:  You could say  
D:  Because I think PHD and Professor are d are 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  distinct aren't they ? 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Wait , what 's a PHD ? 
C:  It 's possible . 
A:  Like , if you have a PHD 
D:  Someone who has a PHD . 
A:  and you 're  hanging around here , and you 're not a professor 
A:  and you 're not a post - doc , then that 's like what we are <breathing> 
A:  so 
B:  Yeah so for  for me there 's  there 's a  
A:  There 's a bunch of people like that . 
B:  There are people  
B:  Um , this got very tricky in fact when we got involved with the Spanish program 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  actually because  
B:  uh , when we said , in our original forms , " post - doc " 
B:  what we were used to , from the German program and from the US standard , 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  when you say " post - doc " it meant somebody who had just gotten a PHD 
A:  Right . 
B:  who was doing one year someplace . 
B:  But when we did the Spanish call , 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  many people said " oh I want to be 
B:  uh  have a post - doc slot " and they were 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  twenty years out 
A:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  because they were " post " 
A:  Right . 
B:  their  " doc " <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> so 
A:  So , you can say Post - PHD Researcher or 
C:  Sure . 
B:  I  I  I think that  
A:  what if there 's one more category that 's sort of 
C:  Right . 
A:  general like that . 
B:  It might be hard to do a finer thing than that because whether somebody is going to be dominant in a meeting 
B:  is really 
B:  I think it 's going to be so clouded by everything else  Someone who 's 
B:  just gotten their PHD 
B:  uh , could be very very 
B:  uh , strongly opinionated about something and somebody who 's been twenty years out 
B:  could be shy , you know , s 
D:  So , maybe Undergrad , Grad , 
F:  Mm - hmm . That 's true . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  Post - PHD and Other ? 
B:  What 's  " Other " ? 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
D:  um , other  
E:  For the European  
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  It 's just to allow . 
D:  If i 
A:  You - I think you could keep Professor , but you could say Post PHD Researcher or something . 
C:  Yep . 
F:  It could be st It could be  
D:  Instead of   
D:  instead of   
D:  instead of Professor or instead of Post - doc ? 
A:  No , instead of Post  Post - doc or Post - PHD , 
A:  just wrap all the people that are post PHD 
A:  and non - professors together . 
B:  so you want Professor to be in a separate category , you think  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  you think uh  
D:  So , 
B:  think  think we  
D:  as I said Undergrad  
A:  I think professors probably want it <laugh> I don't <laugh> care . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Undergrad , Grad , Post - PHD , Professor , Other ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , yeah the Post - PHD one is the one that can be , like 
A:  Post - 
A:  Post - doc or Post - PHD Researcher or 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  whatever . Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> 
D:  Right . 
A:  Then it 'd be fine . 
A:  I think it 's fine . 
topic_description:	educational/professional background field


B:  So , I 'm te I 'm tending to push toward simpler even though I know that more detailed means 
B:  more  potential information for someone later who 's doing research  in  in this area 
B:  I  uh  The  the  the thing  
B:  making me lean toward simpler where possible is that 
B:  uh  the more a thing  <breath> 
B:  Many of the meetings that we record 
B:  uh , may be the kind where we just record somebody once 
B:  even though  we want to get a lot of data that has 
B:  uh , many meetings with the same people . 
C:  <cough> 
B:  And so the more forms we have and the more lines in the forms 
B:  that 's th the more overhead for that one time thing makes it harder to do . 
F:  That 's true . 
D:  Well , the whole reason that I 'm doing it this way is  is uh  my experience so far has been the exact reverse . 
B:  <breath> Right .  That 's what we 've done so far . 
D:  That  
D:  Right . 
B:  Right . And so I 'm saying I expect us to do both kinds . 
D:  I guess we could have another type of form  for 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  Well , one thing , so you understand he  
D:  less frequent . 
F:  he d he wants you to do this only once for each person ? 
B:  Yes . 
F:  OK , OK . 
B:  So I 'm saying there are going to be  
F:  So .  
B:  What I imagine once we 've collected a lot of data , 
B:  a chunk of it will be 
B:  uh , the same people many times 
B:  and another chunk of it will be people  random meetings that we got with 
F:  Mm - hmm .  
F:  Mm - hmm .  
C:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  from different people and I think it 's use We 've talked about this before , it 's useful to have both kinds of data . 
B:  I think . 
D:  Well I think that if  if we 're planning to do that , 
D:  then we should probably have another set of forms . 
B:  OK . 
D:  You know , a single form that 's the consent form 
D:  and the speaker information form and not have them do digits . 
B:  OK . 
E:  <breath> No , I like the idea of putting down the  
E:  the status information because I think you probably can get a lot of 
F:  Mm - hmm .  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  interest there can be a lot of interesting research on that . 
E:  I 'm wondering 
E:  could we add something to the form that gets filled out at each meeting 
E:  that would somehow  
D:  <breath> 
D:  This is a topic I want to bring up  after I get through this . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
D:  So , that  that  that 's another form that I want to discuss . 
D:  um , 
D:  with the digits forms . So , s can we get  
E:  <inbreath> Well  
E:  I guess I was thinking 
E:  maybe , you know how you were taking information off of the digits and putting it onto that ? Could we 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  put one more thing on here maybe ? 
D:  That 's what I want to talk about in a  
D:  Yeah , I 'm  I have that as a topic , also . 
E:  OK . 
D:  So , let 's finish with the speaker form  
E:  Cuz you said separate forms so I thought maybe  
D:  speaker form and then we 'll get over  o get over to that one . 
E:  OK . 
C:  <cough> 
D:  So , Education Level , Undergrad , Grad , Post - PHD , Professor , Other . 
D:  OK ? <laugh> 
C:  OK . 
topic_description:	more versus less detail


D:  um 
D:  and then I put " Optional " 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  with a big " Optional " in parentheses , Age . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Wait , why is that optional ? 
D:  Because I think a lot of people are sensitive to it and won't want to write it down . 
F:  Yeah .  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  So I don't want to make them feel like they have to . 
A:  I don't know . 
A:  It  it would be very good to get age for a lot of purposes . 
C:  <clear throat> 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  I mean 
D:  Uh , sure . But if someone doesn't want to write it down I don't want them to say you can't record me  
A:  a lot of corpora  
B:  <inbreath> 
A:  yeah , so we ca we have these age ranges or something ? <laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> 
F:  <inbreath> 
E:  Oh , right . 
F:  Well it  
B:  Well , wait  wait  wait  wait a minute , um , 
A:  You know , like  
B:  It 's not illegal or anything right , it 's not pushing on anything unethical or illegal , whatever , to ask for their age , right ? 
A:  No , not at all , every  most corpora have that , you know , 
B:  So  
B:  I suggest you ask for their age 
A:  information . 
B:  and if they say I don't want to give it say OK . 
F:  <inbreath> In  in like the London - Lund  they  
D:  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  they  the researchers themselves estimate the age afterw after the fact . So they say , you know , uh 
F:  middle thirties , 
F:  you know  fifties or sixties , and they  
C:  Yeah . 
F:  and they just  they estimate for the person 
D:  Well , I think that just having on the form  
F:  But  
D:  saying Optional , Age , 
D:  again means I don't have to be sitting here and explaining the form every time we do this . 
A:  yeah , that 's OK . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  And it isn't  it isn't that boldf 
D:  And having a little instruction sheet and say 
D:  " If you 're in this age range do this , and if you 're in this rage do that . " 
B:  I see . 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  And it 's  and it isn't really that prominent . It 's  you know his " Optional " is not really boldface , but  
D:  So . 
E:  How about  
E:  How about " optional but highly desirable " ? 
C:  <laugh> Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Please , please ! <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Age or Approximate Age . 
A:  So somebody can say " thirties " if they 're thirty - nine . 
F:  Actually , " approximate " ? 
B:  <inbreath> O 
B:  opt age is optional but those who don't give it will be given the uncomfortable microphones ? 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> That 's right . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , right . 
A:  Well , those who don't give it we will be estimating your age for you 
F:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Mm - hmm . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah , <laugh> If not given we will estimate . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> so maybe you 'll prefer to  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh>  
C:  I  I think is not  
E:  <laugh> 
B:  The  the mean of the estimates from the  group will be used <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  I think it 's not necessary to put uh " Optional " . 
A:  Yeah , people can leave it blank if they  
C:  I think people 
C:  decide uh , in that moment . 
A:  I  I think people in Speech are gonna wanna 
C:  Because if you put " Optional , " 
E:  They 're very strong - willed . 
E:  You know ? 
C:  I think you  you give eh  
E:  People  <inbreath> 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  Well , I think 
D:  maybe that 's because no one here is sensitive about their age . 
A:  They can always lie . 
D:  But , I would rather let them leave it blank than lie . 
A:  OK , in some sense you could say that 
D:  So that 's why I want to put  
A:  " Please leave blank but  
D:  That 's why I want to put s " Optional , Age " , 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
E:  He - 
A:  but don't lie . " 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  so that if they don't want to put it , 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  they leave it blank . 
B:  They might lie anyway . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  But if you put " Optional " , won't they just leave it blank rather than lie ? 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  I don't know . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  OK . 
E:  I think  I think  you can put " optional " it 's not gonna  
F:  <inbreath> 
B:  I mean  I mean the peop the people I 've known who 've lied about it I think 
B:  would just lie about it . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Right . 
D:  You don't think they 'd just leave it blank if it says  has a big " Optional " right next to it ? 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  You know people who lie about it ? 
B:  Oh yeah . 
A:  Well they might leave it blank if they didn't care about their age being known 
A:  but it says " optional " they might 
B:  Hey , Jack Benny was thirty - nine for forty years . 
A:  not . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Anyway , it 's fine 
A:  I don't know . 
F:  <inbreath> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Well , the thing abou 
F:  the reason , uh , one reason for putting " Optional " might be if  it  
F:  uh , made the form seem gentler and k and 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  not as intrusive kind of thing . 
B:  kinder and gentler . <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , I noticed , I was afraid you 'd  I  shouldn't say that . 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  They uh  that , you know , i if you 
F:  say " Optional " then it 's sort of  
F:  if people who  get nervous about the age question then they 
F:  realize that 
F:  " Oh well , but they 're not trying to  ask me lots of  things . " 
E:  Yeah , I think it 's OK . People will put it , I  I  
B:  I don't think it matters . 
B:  I  I don't think it matters . If it makes you more comfortable , put Optional I  
D:  It  
B:  I don't think it 's  
D:  It  
C:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  I think it 's better to put " Optional " . I mean , that 's why I put it there , s but 
A:  OK . 
B:  Then   
E:  OK . 
C:  OK . 
D:  it seems like  maybe you disagree . 
C:  OK . 
F:  I like it . I think it 's softening .  
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  I  I  I don't think it 's important but I also don't think it 's 
B:  an important point the other way and I don't 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> want to make you do it some different way than you want to do it . So . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , it 's OK . 
B:  <inbreath> 
C:  Hmm . 
F:  OK .  
A:  As long as we put it high enough up that it doesn't sort of get lost in the optional , if there are a lot of other optional things on the form . 
D:  Well I didn't mark anything else as specifically optional , 
A:  That 's  
F:  Let 's see . 
A:  that 's the only optional thing , OK . 
F:  That 's the only other one . That 's the only one . 
topic_description:	age field


D:  So . 
D:  Um , and then the next are two sections 
D:  One 
D:  indented separately . So , one 's for native English speakers and one for non - native English speakers . 
D:  OK , so for the native English speaker it asks for a variety of English 
D:  with three circle boxes American , British , Indian and Other , for write - in . 
B:  <breath> Now what was this thing that  
B:  who was telling  was it Steve ? Somebody was telling us about 
B:  asking about uh , 
D:  <inbreath> Yep . 
E:  Where you lived between the ages of  
D:  Jane and I discussed this , and it was  it was again the same problem 
D:  that  it 's gonna be a self - evaluation anyway , 
D:  and so I don't want 
D:  to have to be standing over the person and asking them 
D:  " Well , do you mean that your native an l an language was 
D:  British when you were born , and then it changed to American when you were two , and then it changed to  " 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  Well also , 
F:  you  you  you  
D:  and so on . 
F:  he has a sep separate subject for Region . 
B:  Uh - huh 
F:  and so it 's a self - assessment of what you think your closest variety is of English . And then 
F:  following that , a characterization of  
F:  of region . Now , we discussed maybe indicating a t a time frame . So , 
F:  " Where did you live during your ,  you know , childhood and adolescence ? " 
D:  Right . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  which would be  
E:  Which is more objective . 
E:  than somebody evalu saying , I think I speak this or that . 
F:  Yes . Mm - hmm . Although you know I mean a lot of people there won't be , e much 
B:  <inbreath> 
F:  difference , but  
D:  I mean ,  th there 's room on the form to put 
B:  I  I  I 'm sorry , so you 're saying 
D:  al a a line of instruction , but I 'm just not sure what it re should really be . 
F:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  uh I  I  I just missed something , though . Are you saying that you have both ? 
F:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  that you 're saying , uh what is your  
F:  Mm - hmm .  
D:  So the  the  for  
D:  the non - na for the native English speakers we have Variety of English and Region . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  And that 's it . <breath> 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And that 's partly to pick up  Yeah . 
D:  And then  we have another form later down which is 
D:  um , list other language influences . 
F:  S Mm - hmm 
topic_description:	native English speaker field


A:  So what does Region mean  
E:  Yeah , I was just gonna ask the same thing . 
A:  and like 
A:  if I see this form I wouldn't be quite sure what you mean by  
A:  Region . 
E:  Region  
D:  Right , neither would I . 
A:  Do you want to have  give choices and have them circle one , or , I mean 
F:  Well , we  
D:  Um ,  I don't think we can do that because it would be different for  
E:  Does that mean region of  
F:  When we  when we discussed it it was  it was 
F:  where  where you lived during your childhood and adolescence . 
E:  Region of the US , or region of the world  
F:  Well  
D:  If you 're American English it would be region of the US . 
F:  It 's  
E:  OK . 
F:  W it 's where you lived . 
D:  That  that  so that 's why I didn't have circle forms . Because 
A:  but I mean . 
D:  it would be different depending on 
D:  what your language is . So  
C:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  <breath> 
E:  Do you mean state , <static or something> or do you mean more broad than the state level ? 
A:  <clear throat> 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  You mean like you know 
E:  southern US , or northeastern or 
D:  It - I think it would be however you would identify 
D:  your own . And , as I said I don't really see a way of doing a circle 
D:  fill in , because there would be  
D:  there would have to be one for American English , one for British English , one for 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <inbreath> 
E:  If you wanted to get regions for American English you could copy what they did in TIMIT . 
D:  you know , one for each type . 
F:  Well , and also  
E:  They had divided things up into 
D:  But  but  that would mean I would have to do  generate a different form 
E:  regions . 
D:  for circles , if you 're American English or British English or Indian English . 
E:  No , no . It would only be f 
E:  if you said American English 
A:  <clear throat> 
A:  yeah maybe not for the others , because there aren't going to be enough 
E:  then you 'd put the regions . For the others , you would just leave it . 
A:  people to really group them 
E:  Yeah . We wouldn't have enough to really make them  
E:  difference on those . 
A:  and you know when you talk about dialects in England , I mean , that 's really  
F:  Well  
A:  Every block of  London has a different  
C:  Hmm . 
A:  so . 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  I haven't seen what  what they did in TIMIT . 
A:  My Fair Lady 's  
F:  Are you s Do they have a bunch of options like uh  
E:  Oh , it 's like six regions of the country or something . Very  just a limited number and then 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  I see . 
F:  OK .  
B:  Yeah . 
E:  if you 're American you would just circle 
F:  Well , that 's the concept , yeah . 
E:  the region 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <inbreath> Well  
B:  Yeah , and Henry Higgins could say which block you were from . 
E:  where  
B:  Right ? So that 's  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> That 's right . 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  Well that  you know that was the concept of having the region thing , I  
F:  It would be no problem to change it to options if um  if that were desirable . Although for different 
D:  Yeah , I just don't know what to do about the other 
F:  <inbreath> 
D:  varieties of English . 
F:  Well , that 's true .  I mean , Indian English I wouldn't know f 
E:  You 'd just leave them . 
E:  You don't even ask . 
A:  I  I  there are huge differences 
F:  what <laugh>  
A:  you know 
D:  Well , that 's why I wanted to just leave it something that you could write it down . 
A:  in the others so it might be 
D:  <breath> 
A:  better to just do it for the 
A:  yeah you could leave region for  
A:  for the others but have  circled choice for the American  English . 
E:  One  one good reason to use the TIMIT ones is if anybody asks you 
E:  you know , about the data later on you can say " well I chose these 
E:  based on TIMIT " , 
A:  Right . 
F:  That is kind of nice . 
B:  What  what about 
E:  And  
B:  just doing 
B:  the  the sort of the Steve suggestion , 
B:  uh , as  as an add - on to it , right ? Rather than saying Region , 
B:  <breath> 
B:  just say 
B:  " Where did you live between the ages of 
B:  here and here ? " 
F:  That was the concept of region . 
E:  And that would apply to everybody then ? 
B:  Just  
F:  and  
E:  Yeah . And then you could map those to the TIMIT regions later , if people wanted to . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  It 's just the wording of it . 
B:  And then they  they could s 
B:  Right  yeah , they could say it different ways .  They could say Cincinnati or they could say Midwest or  
E:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's more general . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's true . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Actually 
A:  that is true for them but it means that you 're gonna get a bunch of different level  
A:  levels of resolution in your survey , it  it 'll be more of a pain later , so . 
F:  <inbreath> 
B:  Somebody 's gonna have to do some data  
D:  Well , there could be a circle one . 
A:  It  depends . 
F:  <inbreath> <mouth> 
F:  I guess there 's a 
D:  Right ? So , you could say  " What region did you grow up in from these years ? " and have a set of circ of six or seven circles  
A:  Yeah , that  that 's good but if you  have it totally free - form 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  First of all some people take  you 
E:  A lot of post - processing . 
A:  Well , and some people would give you more specific 
A:  information than others and that 's a waste because you can only use 
A:  the least common denominator of specificity and 
B:  Yeah but that  
B:  but the good thing about it is it  is it frees you from coming up with exactly what the right 
A:  generally . 
B:  categories are . 
B:  um , 
B:  Right ? 
A:  I don't know later on , if  if somebody just says Midwest , now all these other people who said 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  you know area then 
A:  that 'll have to become your category . 
A:  and it 's  
F:  <inbreath> 
A:  It 's harder later on , i I  
B:  I see . 
F:  There is another problem . 
A:  It 's easier for the person but it 's harder for the r it 
A:  actually less informative for us because you can't enforce 
A:  any minimum level of specificity . 
B:  But I think that if you 're going to have it be general 
A:  so it 's  
B:  uh , so the idea again was , you know , you might wanna also know if  
B:  if they grew up in Germany or if they grew up  <breath> 
B:  and so  uh , I think  you wanna  
B:  The idea  the motivation I think for this being suggested before was that it did cover a range of these cases that might 
B:  um  
B:  you know , if you say your native 
B:  language was  was English but uh  you  
B:  you grew up in Germany , uh 
E:  Yeah , y there is actu  you made me think about another wrinkle 
B:  I think this  
E:  in this whole thing , which is that  just asking them where they grew up 
E:  between certain ages isn't enough , because 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  somebody could grow up in Germany but live on an army base 
E:  speaking English . 
F:  Yeah .  Or someone could in Geor - in  in New York and have , I mean , any number of different types of  speech patterns . 
A:  Or their parents live  yeah . 
E:  Yeah , so you sort of have to say what languages were spoken in the home between the ages of  
A:  and their parents  
C:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  Well , we have this  We hafta  So . He hasn't given you the overview , 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  but you have , like , the Native Speaker category , the Non - native Speaker  category , and then you have 
F:  Other Language Influences , for example bilingual dialects , th things like that .  
E:  Oh that 's nice , OK . 
F:  Now there 's this issue of 
F:  not wa like you 're saying , 
F:  you don't want the forms to be hugely complicated and take half the meeting to complete . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So , 
F:  it 's trying to  e there 's this  trying to  trying to hold this balance between the amount of information needed and 
F:  uh , you know , not taking too much meeting time , and then in addition , add to it the third level of the balance , uh , um this  this issue of not being too intrusive , 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  asking in a way that they don't mind . 
A:  If we release this corpus , what do we want , I mean 
A:  if you do this free form um  the free form solution where some questions are very open - ended 
A:  then you need  someone needs to enter that , and they 'll be notes and it will be very difficult for somebody later actually use 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  Well , I think rea I think that 
A:  that without mapping it . It 's OK . But it 's  
F:  we need to remember that we have  
F:  First of all , it 's not all free form . We have several  categories that are specifically constrained ,  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And in terms of the  more open ones , we have the  we 're in the enviable position of having the contact information and also knowing most of the people who 
F:  will be participating in the meeting data . We can 
F:  find it  We can resolve certain issues later , if  
A:  Mmm . 
B:  Yeah , and the question is how 
A:  I mean , I guess what you really want , is if 
B:  extensive this gets . 
A:  there 's some information you wanna know  So we want some rough idea of their dialect , basically . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  That 's it . 
A:  then we should have some question where it 's not free form , except for these people who are 
A:  who have 
A:  non - American English accents . There we probably have to have a category " Non - American English " and then a few choices . 
A:  And we should have something 
A:  that 's simple , that people can circle , 
A:  like 
A:  these TIMIT regions or something , so that we have something 
A:  that minimally you can  cuz a lot of times if you give the data out that 's what people are gonna use . They 're gonna want some small set of 
A:  places , and then , but anything additional people can fill out , and we can put it in as a note or something , but if we don't have that , someone 's gotta sit there and figure out 
A:  you know , I 've got twenty people who said 
A:  Midwest , and I 've got a few people who said something else and these don't overlap or these 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  Well - 
F:  Isn't it  I mean , I think  that  
C:  <breathes> 
F:  we 're going a little bit in a circle , 
F:  because I like the TIMIT suggestion very much , 
F:  and I think it 's a question of how to ge incorporate it , 
F:  and  and we 've already suggested  I mean , 
F:  it 's come up in this discussion , that  the suggestion 
F:  that 
F:  we could have  um the TIMIT categories for the American , 
F:  and  and then make the choice  or not , 
A:  Oh , OK , so  yeah as long as you have  
F:  as to whether we do it for British , 
F:  I mean , w we sort of discussed one way or the other , and it 
F:  doesn't matter to me . 
F:  I don't know if  Adam has  has a preference , 
B:  <inbreath> But  but  
F:  but we could have  you know , a sub a sub - categorization for American , 
F:  We could even use the TIMIT subcategorization . I don't know if it has one for British , or whatever , 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  But you know , just have it  you know , a short simple form that you can categorize yourself 
F:  in a  in a systematic way . 
B:  What about 
B:  the  the phrasing that 
B:  um 
B:  Chuck used , uh  which was 
B:  in  in relation to the question I was trying to 
B:  formulate of uh 
B:  Where  
B:  where did you  what  what was that  what w how did you phrase it ? 
D:  What language was spoken in the home ? 
B:  " What language was spok " , yeah , so it 's not where did you grow up , but what language was spoken in the home between the ages of , what would it be , five and twelve or something like that ? 
C:  Mmm . Yeah . 
F:  It 's a good idea .  
D:  <laugh> 
D:  Depends of who you ask , what the age range is . 
A:  Well , in the home , the influence of the home is much lower age than that , I mean once you go beyond the age five or six 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  then it 's the  
A:  the school influence as well and  
F:  And the peers .  
A:  and yeah , so  In the home it 's sort of your phonetic first level , 
F:  That 's one part though .  
A:  um  a - 
D:  Yeah , so this is why I  
A:  So it 's  you know it starts to get sort of complicated . 
F:  Well ,  
D:  So  so th 
F:  It 's  that 's not a problem though , I mean . 
F:  That would be a good question to ask , and then you could add a question . You know , 
F:  would  uh 
F:  " among your peers " . 
F:  You know .  
B:  cuz he does make a good point about the region not necessarily again , if you 're on the army base or  
F:  Specify the age range . 
A:  Right . 
D:  Well , the way it 's phrased right now , 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  it 's clearly asking about language . 
D:  And so , what it 's trying to get at is what you think you speak . Now , I think that 
A:  Right . 
D:  the point is well taken that sometimes people are wrong about what they think they speak . 
D:  But , other than having a trained linguist 
D:  interview them  and ask these very specific questions , I don't see a way around it . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <inbreath> 
D:  Because as you said , what you 're gonna have to stay  say is " Well , list the languages that your parents spoke when you were in home and how good they were at it and how long they spoke it , 
D:  and now list the ones in preschool and now list the ones in first grade and now list the ones your friends speak  " 
E:  Sort of like as soon as you get to the  cases on the edge , the complexity just shoots up . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  Yeah , that 's right . 
D:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  So I want to try to keep the complexity so someone can fill out this form 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  and we 're  
D:  at the beginning of a meeting without taking f uh forty - five minutes . 
F:  and then we  like I said , we have the enviable benefit of knowing most of these people . 
F:  and being able to ask them follow - ups if we need to . 
B:  For now , right so it 's  I mean , again , we are hoping to expand this out , yeah . 
F:  For now . 
F:  That 's true . 
F:  Washington and stuff , 
F:  yeah . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  That 's true . 
D:  So I think that adding the  the TIMIT 
D:  categories is a good idea , because that 's very easy for a person to fill out . 
D:  But I think we still have this problem of 
D:  is it gonna be a self - evaluation ? 
D:  or are we gonna ask them 
D:  " what was it when you were four years old , or what was it when you were six years old , or what wher " w 
D:  What 's the best way of phrasing the question ? 
E:  Well , you know the other thing , too , is that 
E:  it seems like th one of the reasons you would gather 
E:  real detailed information about their 
E:  native language is if you were gonna do fine - grained phonetic analysis or something . 
E:  and  
F:  Well , it 's  
E:  I don't  
B:  And somebody might . 
D:  Or adapta or adaptation . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  Most of  
E:  Well that 's what I was gonna ask , is that  
A:  but most of those people don't rely on the self - evaluations , anyway . They 'll probably listen to the speech , so 
F:  Well , I  you know , I w 
F:  I was thinking of it as  
F:  e 
F:  that 's a good point , 
F:  but I was thinking uh , you know , with reference to 
F:  the  language model issue , which 
F:  uh 
F:  and I guess it could be done inductively , 
F:  but if you have a bunch of , say , R - less dialects and 
F:  uh you know , if they  
A:  But even you know in Switchboard , I  
A:  I remember looking really carefully at  
A:  They have information sort of like TIMIT I don't know it 's  how well they categorized , 
A:  but they had North Atlantic , Mid - Atlantic , and  
A:  You know , Texas was definitely out on  
A:  I mean 
A:  most of the people from cer certain places in the South were 
A:  from 
A:  specific Texas locations , but 
A:   other than that 
A:  you had a huge range of  
A:  You know , people would say Boston , and they had nothing like what I would call a Boston accent . So it was  
F:  Mm - hmm . Interesting . 
E:  Were they putting down where they lived 
C:  <cough> 
E:   at the moment they m recordings were made ? Is that why ? 
A:  Um 
E:  Rather than where they grew up ? 
A:  No , the question was really 
A:  geared towards trying to get people 's self - evaluation of their 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  dialect 
E:  Mmm . 
A:  region . 
F:  But you have a lot of stratification in  
A:  and you know , for instance , you know , Minnesota Midwest is totally different than Michigan Midwest which is totally   these were all settled by very different  type people , so 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  any region . 
B:  Right . 
F:  Interesting . 
A:  it  it 's sort of a general help 
A:  but I think that anyone who 's doing phonetics wouldn't rely on that , they would probably use it as a first pass or something , 
E:  So , then we probably don't need the fine - grained information . 
D:  Well maybe should we just  
D:  Then maybe we shouldn't  just shouldn't ask . 
A:  Well , I think we do need to make sure about the f the non - native accents because those are , you know  
E:  Yeah . 
A:  but we don't need to ha be really really specific about the others , because it won't be very w helpful anyway . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Well , maybe for the native English speakers we shouldn't even ask the region if it 's that unreliable . 
A:  I think we should , because other databases do . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  It 's sort of a political thing . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  And there are some general  like , you will find more New Yorkers in the New York category . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  but it 's not 
E:  It can't be relied on only . 
A:  Right . 
D:  The other thing also is that I 'm asking for the variety of English , and I did just put American , British , Indian and other . 
D:  So , I didn't put Canadian , Australian , and all the other varieties . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  But Other is there , and people will fill that out . They 'll see by example .  Yeah that 's  I think that 's fine , they 'll say oh , I 'm not one of these , I 'm 
D:  e 
D:  But do you think those three are OK ? 
E:  Yeah , I think those are good . 
D:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Canadian , or 
B:  So internally , we have Texas and other . 
C:  Hmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  So that for the Eng - native English speakers , we 'll do variety of English , 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  Right . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  regions from the TIMIT labels , and another field . 
A:  I mean , even like Cal - LA is totally different than  I mean , you really can't um  
D:  And then 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  Well  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  We could ask them for more information , but I don't think it 's  
D:  I thought this was  be fast .  
E:  Yeah . 
F:  Well that 's what 
A:   necessary and it 's not going to solve this problem . 
F:  the  final  the fin the third category was designed to do , 
F:  because  I mean , you have a bunch of different types of accents in New York 
F:  You know . Native - speaking New Yorkers , as a  as a function of their social uh groups and their ethnic identifications and their  
A:  Oh yeah . 
B:  mm - hmm 
F:  You know . There are lots of things that are 
F:  very identifiable as 
F:   um  
F:  you know , 
F:  other  other aspects , 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  which is why we have this third category . So 
F:  we wanted to  
F:  certainly distinguish American versus British , 
F:  and other types at that level , 
F:  and then allow people to self - identify if there are other specific things , 
F:  and then in addition , this issue of regions 
F:  with  some sort of 
F:  time frame for the re region because I think that if you live 
F:   in Massachusetts now versus 
F:  you know , in childhood and as adolescence  
F:  So if you lis 
F:  if  if you  You know . So , region with respect to a time frame is what I would suggest . 
D:  Air conditioning . 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  " Where did you live ? " I mean . What you said . 
F:  you know , 
F:  " where  where  wh where did you live ? " , or 
F:  uh , what you were saying , " Languages in the home " . 
F:  But I think that 
F:  uh a time frame on the region would be useful instead of 
F:   " Region now " , say . 
F:  It 's a little bit  unbounded . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  um  
B:  so are you suggesting that you put something in about childhood 
B:   in there . 
F:  well , you know , there 's this issue of  
F:  of what age is relevant for the formation of your speech patterns , whatever they are . 
B:  Well you could distinguish between pre - five and five t five to twelve , right ? So depending on what someone 's interest was in the formation of the phonetic kinds of  categories or whether  or whether you 're talking more about their 
F:   And  
C:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  linguistic speech patterns , you know 
F:  Oh , that 's interesting . 
B:  uh  
B:  so  
B:  But , again , 
B:  it depends how fine we wanna get , but we could say uh 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  " where did you live before you were five ? " , " where did you live after you were five ? " , I don't know . 
F:  Oh that 's interesting . 
F:  from five to  
F:  fifteen or something , 
B:  yeah 
F:  is a  
A:  I mean , I think the question on regions is really 
A:  to ask people 
A:  how did they define their dialect region now , di the whether they picked it up 
A:  at  the  one age or another . 
A:  pretty much , I mean , most people will know whether they have a southern 
A:  accent or not . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  um , but they may  have lived 
A:  you know , in other places , too . So if we ask the question about dialect regions , it makes no sense to say where do you live now .  
D:  Right . 
A:  Right ? 
A:  You ask how would you best define your 
B:  Right . 
A:  your accent or your dialect style . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Right , the way  the way the form reads now , I think it 's pretty clear that 's what we 're asking  cuz it says " Native English speakers , Variety of English , American , British , Indian , Other , Region " . 
A:  OK 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And then we 'll have Southern English , you know , whatever  
D:  whatever the TIMIT categories are . So I think 
A:  Or you could say to somebody , how do you define your  your  the accent 
D:  i if you  look at this fr 
A:  that you have . 
D:  Right . 
A:  um 
A:  And then you can ask these other questions as well , but what we don't want them to think is that they 're living in a certain place 
A:  and that therefore they 're  I mean , nowadays  hardly anybody 
B:  Right . 
F:  <inbreath> 
A:  from California <laugh> has a  native Californian accent , so . 
F:  Yeah .  
C:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  Well I  I g 
F:  OK .  
F:  I don't think it was ever the intent to  talk about the region now , because 
D:  Right , so I  it seems to me that  if you read this form , 
F:  It 's  
A:  OK , as long as it 's clear . 
F:  It 's a sub - categorization . 
D:  i w it 's pretty obvious that it 's a subcategory of the language 
D:   that you think you speak ,  not where you live . I mean , I don't say anything about where you live 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . 
F:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
D:  on the form . 
B:  OK . 
D:  So it 's just in the section talking about language . 
A:  OK . 
B:  Why don't we try it out . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  and see  <laugh> see what kind of responses we get from people . Anyway . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , 
topic_description:	region field, concerns regarding dialect differences


F:  Well , y you didn't really talk about the non - English speaker categories . 
A:  So . 
D:  Right . 
D:  So , there 's another area which is non - native English speakers which asks for Native language , 
D:  Region , and Variety of English . 
D:  And that 's it . 
F:  Because it used to be that Germans would learn British English , and now I think there 's , you know , is a certain percentage of them who  
E:  N detec 
A:  What about proficiency in English ? as well ? 
F:  who 've 
F:  @ @ 
F:  to tend toward American English . 
D:  Proficiency . That 's a good idea . 
B:  Uh , 
F:  That 's hard though , for self - identification  
A:  I  
B:  I  
A:  You don't want to do it for political reasons , I mean  I 'm no 
C:  Hmm . 
A:  I wasn't thinking about that , I was just thinking , " Gee , I 'd 
B:  I wasn't thinking  
A:  like to know actually  " 
B:  oh 
B:  No , no . I wasn't thinking political at all . I was just saying , looking at 
A:  Oh , OK . 
B:   applications of people over the years for post - docs here . They 're r 
B:  generally not very good at assessing their own abilities . 
D:  Well , do you think that 's  
B:  but  
A:  OK . 
F:  I agree . 
D:  That 's also because they know that 
D:  it 's a re 
D:  important for them to be good at it . So , don't  
B:  That could be . 
D:  don't you think they overrate 
D:  rather than underrate ? 
B:  That could be . 
B:  Yes . 
A:  Well , so maybe that 's  
D:  So , but no , I think proficiency is actually a good thing to have on this sort of form . 
A:  Maybe we  maybe we shouldn't ask it , I don't know . 
F:  <inbreath> 
D:  The  the question are  
F:  Well , <inbreath> e <outbreath> 
D:  what are  what would the categories be ? 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  I 'd  I 'd have to  I  I 'd wanna relate it back to training . " How many years did you study English " , or , 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  Good , Bad . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  you know , " have you lived in the America  in a c an English 
F:  country before " . But it seems like that 's so  
F:  I mean , I think that 
F:  you know , if a person who  
A:  What about something like " How comfortable are you 
A:  in a meeting conducted in English ? " , or " How easy is it for you ? " , or something like that where it 's  
B:  How b 
B:  How  About " How long have you been 
B:  uh  in  
B:  in an English speaking country ? " 
A:  Yeah , that 's a good one . 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  That 'd be OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Something  wha what do you think , what 's it  I mean  
C:  Is better . 
C:  I think it 's better . 
A:  How  yeah ? How long have you been in an English speaking country . OK . 
C:  @ @ 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , I like that . 
F:  I like that . 
F:  That 's  that 's non - threatening , 
F:  and it 's also an i 
B:  Yeah 
F:  a good indicator . And there are people who  haven't ever lived in an English speaking country and who are superb . However , 
F:  um , 
C:  Mmm . 
F:  that 's  
F:  you know 
E:  And then there will be people who  live in an English speaking country , but all their meetings are held in another language . 
F:  I do think it 's a pretty good indicator . 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  That 's true too . 
F:  Or even , 
E:  So , 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  you know , I mean , 
F:  some people who just don't change much in their  
D:  Yeah , I 'm  I don't know . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Yochai 's company is like that . 
D:  Being totally monolingual , I 'm not the right person to ask , 
E:  Everybody speaks Hebrew . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Really ? 
D:  to talk about this but it just seems to me that that doesn't  
D:  the length of time doesn't really get at what we 're asking . 
D:  Right ? It seems to be that asking about the proficiency , even if it 's self - rated , 
D:  is what we wanna know . 
F:  Except that you have some many biasing factors , you have  you have people who are highly confident when they really  should be a little bit less confident , and then you have , 
B:  Yeah . 
F:   uh  
F:  other people who are just the reverse , and  and it  so many things that vary  I  
B:  Yes . 
F:  And also we wanna keep it simple and non - evaluative . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  OK . 
B:  <breath> 
B:  We done ? 
D:  With that form . <laugh>  
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	non-native English speaker field, assessing proficiency


B:  Yeah . Oh , there 's another form . 
D:  Shall we wait for other forms later , or you  
D:  Keep going more form  
B:  No , you got  what 's the other form ? 
F:  <inbreath> 
D:  Uh , the other form is a modified digits form . 
D:  uh 
D:  and  it 's pretty sim this one 's pretty simple , it 's  it 's very much what like the digits forms in front of us , except it doesn't ha ask for sex or native language . 
D:  Um , so it 's Name , Email , Time , Date , Seat , Session , 
D:  Mike number , Channel , Mike type . 
F:  <inbreath> 
topic_description:	modified digits form


F:  Why do we need that much information , why do we need the email address , for example ? 
D:  Uh , in case people have the same name . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  Oh , I see . 
F:  How often would that happen ? 
B:  In case people what ? 
D:  So I wanted  
D:  Have the same name . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Oh . 
D:  Yeah , I 'm particularly sensitive to this cuz a good friend of mine in S in Seattle was named Scott Smith and there were fourteen of them in  
D:  at Boeing . 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  I see . 
D:  So  
C:  <laugh> 
F:  So the only  
F:  so  
D:  We could drop email . I mean that 's not a big deal , it 's just uh  
F:  Well , it 's an  it 's an interesting identifier , I  
F:  I  now that I realize the und the reason for it . 
F:  The  
B:  Well the other thing is that potentially if this is done over a period of time , someone 's email could change . 
D:  Right . 
F:  That 's true too . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Well , the other way I was thinking about it was assigning them an ID 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  but I hate it when people do that to me , when they say , here 's you ID , don't forget it . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh yeah , that 's bad . Thanks 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  So , I  I wanted just something that would give us a hint of  
D:  who the person is if the name field isn't readable or it 's a duplicate . 
F:  That 's interesting . 
A:  How about their birthday ?  I don't know . 
F:  Good idea . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> It 's the age question again . 
A:  I mean , not  not the year  not the year  not the year but just their birthday . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Your mother 's maiden name  
B:  Oh , I see . Then , you don't hafta ask the age . 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Not the year . 
D:  mother 's maiden name <laugh> 
A:  I don't know , what are the chances of people having the same name . 
D:  social security number , 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , that 's right . And a bank where you frequent . 
F:  <laugh> Yeah . <laugh>  
E:  PIN .  
A:  They  
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> The PIN ! <laugh> 
B:  Social  social security number . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  So , although the email  email will change , I think that 's a good way of doing it . We 'll be able to backtrack from email . 
F:  Yeah . <laugh> 
F:  I like that . 
F:  I never thought of that as an identifier . 
F:  That makes sense . 
D:  <inbreath> 
topic_description:	email address field


D:  Um , and then the other thing I was thinking about 
D:  and it probably wouldn't be on the digits form , but it  it is something that 
D:  some form about the individual meeting . 
F:  Yeah . 
D:  Now , the problem I have with that is I don't know who would be filling it out . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  Well , that I think , someone internal to the meeting could do after the fact . 
F:   And this would  and  and we discussed this , this is with reference to like the DTD , 
F:  what you would put in the DTD that 's meeting - specific . So . And it could be something like , 
F:  " oh by the way , 
F:  the guy giving the presentation today 
F:  is the student of the professor who 
F:  you know , whatever " . 
F:  So , speaker A is his professor and they  and he 's preparing for his quals or some such thing like that . 
F:  Or it could be you know , " so - and - so and so - and - so are married " . 
C:  Hmm . 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> So - and - so and so  <laugh> 
D:  Just to pick up an arbitrary an  example . 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  We  this wouldn't be relevant all the time but you know , if there 's a big discussion on 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
F:   you know , the  the  um , best way to move house , 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  then  and these people are talking a whole lot , 
F:  then it might be interesting information to say oh by the way they 're married , or  
D:  <inbreath> 
F:  I  I don't mean , uh , you know . 
D:  Right . 
D:  So th so the sorts of questions I had were one 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Who 's gonna fill it out , and who 's gonna take responsibility for filling it out 
D:   in each meeting , I mean , will we re will we require it . 
F:  I would tend to leave that 
F:  e spontaneous , I think that 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  e at the stage of uh 
F:  Uh , sc scanning the 
F:   transcripts after they 've been produced by  
F:  by our  
F:   by IBM , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  At that point , I think that some of these dynamics will appear to be important , and you could  you could spend a lot of time enumerating all the different relationships that people have . 
topic_description:	meeting description form


D:  And that was my other question , which is  um  
F:  Yeah . 
D:  what sort of information do we want to record ? I mean , so I think pairwise relationships are pretty easy . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  You know , source , destination , relation . 
D:  Are there other sorts of things that might  we might want to record ? 
F:  <inbreath> 
D:  <inbreath> 
F:  Well , I ju I was just thinking , with reference to 
F:  uh , things that have  that bear on the content or the status relations , 
F:  would be the things  
F:  Without being exhaustive , by any means , 
F:  but just like I said , if there 's a k a certain topic that comes up in the meeting , and  
F:   that knowing their relationship will clarify it , 
F:  or  if there 's a certain dynamic that comes up  
F:  So , I mean , a person 
F:  is asked a whole bunch of questions , more than you 'd usually think they 'd be asked , and it turns out it 's because he 's being prepared for a job interview or something like that , 
D:  Right . 
F:  then it 's useful to know that  that relationship . 
D:  I think that fits in well with the whole meeting map  
F:  But , not to be exhaustive . 
D:  mapping meetings concept is that 's another way of looking at  
F:  Interesting . 
D:  looking at it . So , 
D:  are there anything other than pairwise ? 
F:  Oh , well yeah , you could have people who are all part of the same football league , or  
D:  Oh yeah , OK . 
F:  uh 
F:  or chess club , or  
A:  So thi 
A:  Isn't this an open - ended , 
A:  like 
A:  basically a notes column ? I mean you can imagine wanting 
D:  <inbreath> 
A:  you should be able always to attach some 
D:  Yes , shirt  certainly . 
A:  notes to  is this the  the place where we would do that , or is there another 
D:  <breath> 
D:  I 've been thi I  it seems to be that there is  
A:  place . 
D:  We could attach more structure if we wanted to . Especially because a lot of these relationships are pairwise power relationships . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  I Maybe I was missing something maybe , but 
B:  I mean  
B:  this is something one would try to infer , but how do  how would you 
B:  How would you freeze that information about what , uh , I mean , we already have these things about someone 's a professor and someone 's a student , or something , but 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
B:  would you  would you  
B:  Some person would be writing OK this person was leading the meeting and that was or  or  is that what you mean , or  
D:  <inbreath> 
B:  What  what  what  uh , 
D:  Um , just as an example , it would be , " Source , Adam Janin " , " Destination , Morgan " , " Relationship , Advisor " . 
B:  Oh , so you 're just putting 
B:  preexisting 
B:  relationships that are 
A:  I think that starts to  
D:  that are relevant .  
B:  I see . 
A:  There 's definitely some clear cases , 
B:  <breaths> 
A:  but there are a lot of gray areas , where  
B:  yeah .  
D:  Yep . 
A:  the context 
A:  happens 
A:  just in that meeting , or , I mean , where you don't wanna sort of 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah , I m 
A:  have to 
A:  make a distinction between a pre - existing 
F:  Well , realize , w this was  
A:  relationship , or 
F:  the idea was that this would be meeting specific . 
F:  Otherwise , they would  
F:  it would be possible to have a 
A:  But I mean , there are some that generalize 
F:  higher level thing . 
B:  Right , but that example was not  
A:  over many meetings and there are some that don't , and there are some 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  <inbreath> 
F:  That 's true . 
D:  Right , so my example was not a good one , 
F:  That 's true . 
A:  things that happen in between meetings , 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  because that 's  
B:  So , I mean , for  
A:  and  
B:  today , for instance , this is the second meeting recorded today . 
B:  The first meeting was a  was a front - end meeting , and in that one , the basic form of that was uh , I was the leader , 
B:  and I was saying uh , " what are the results you 've gotten in the last week ? " 
B:  And they were  and uh one person was sort of taking the lead , 
B:  in describing what the results were , 
B:  and then uh , Chuck was taking the role of saying , " well , what did you mean by that ? " , so he was sort of like the out s semi - outsider , asking curiosity questions . 
B:  And then it would come back to me with saying " well , you know , you showed me that but you know , I think you should do this in the future , " 
B:  so it was very much sort of 
B:  " Leader " and  and  and  and " Led " sort of relationship . 
B:  And um  
C:  <microphone noise> 
B:  the guy I was primarily doing this with uh is  is a visiting researcher , 
B:  uh , in this l meeting , 
B:  uh , you are my graduate student , 
B:  but uh it 's not taking that kind of role at all , 
B:  right ? You 're  you 're  you 're actually leading the meeting for the most part , most of this meeting , so it 's  
D:  Right . 
D:  Well , it 's just cuz it 's my turn . <laugh> 
B:   Yeah , well , whatever . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  So  
B:  Uh  
B:  Yeah , so I  I don't know , so you 're suggesting  
A:  I think this one needs to be open - ended , completely open - ended , and 
A:  the only concern I would have is if there 's something we wanna be able to say and we can't put it in that field . 
F:  Well , the there 's  
D:  <inbreath> 
F:  @ @ 
F:  I mean . 
F:  I  g you  
F:  You 're the expert on the D T Ds , 
D:  Well , the D T Ds mean we can 
F:  but  
D:  do whatever  
F:  Yeah . 
D:  however we want it . 
D:   But what I  what I was thinking uh  
D:  the reason that I didn't want to make it completely open - ended is that it does seems like there is some structure which is common . 
D:  Especially with these pairwise ones , where you can describe them and pairwise . And you might want a tool 
A:  So you mean like  
D:  that used that information . 
D:  <inhale> 
F:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
A:  Is there a way that we can add keywords or sub 
A:  I don't know what you would call them , but little labels 
A:  for things that we decide are useful things to have 
D:  Sure , absolutely . 
A:  but 
A:  You know , as long as we have this one 
A:  place where it can all be stored , then we 're fine , I think . 
B:  Right , cuz it seems like it 's sort of a  
A:   and those 'll probably occur  I mean , to us , we 'll think of a few of them , some other researcher will think of 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Right . 
A:  some totally different 
B:  Exactly . It 's sort of a research question , you  you 're analyzing the meeting and you 're deciding , " ah , there 's this kind of structure to it . " 
A:  keyword . 
A:  Y Yeah , it 's  it 's  
A:  it 's gonna change  
A:  It 's gonna change , and maybe we wanna regroup things under different labels later , if we figure out that these pairwise things are  
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Interesting . 
D:  Right  
D:  Well I think   
F:  <mouth> <inbreath> Well  
D:  being  being in a common organization was one I hadn't thought of , that  
D:  So you 're football league was a good one . 
D:  So the ones I 've been thinking of are all sort of 
D:  uh , power , responsibility . 
D:  I guess husband - wife is yet another one . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And so , you know , in discourse  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  analysis you get things like 
D:  Ach ! 
F:  @ @ 
F:  the role . 
F:  You have  you have a role in relationships and it has to do with your negotiating your  
D:  Hmm . 
C:  Role , yeah . 
F:  how you 're perceived and how y and how the other @ @  
C:  Yeah . 
F:  You know , and so there are various things you negotiate . 
F:  And  I 'm  I 'm wondering if we might be able to do it s in sort of a loose way , but 
F:  e with  by having a searchable field like " role " 
F:  <laugh> 
F:  and then you know " within this context this person has the following roles " , 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  and it could be very loose , but then it would be possible to 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  do something as simple as a grep across a database and if you 're interested in 
F:  you know which  which  which ones this person serves as an advisor in and versus 
F:  you know a l uh s uh 
F:  whatever , a leader , speaker , whatever , 
F:   you could just grep for " role " 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  and  and 
F:  you know , some  some particular value . 
B:  So it sounds like having the facility is great , and then over a period of time as the research happens on this we might develop  some of these categories that would be 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Some more .  
B:  generally useful and it  it sounds like a good thing to do . 
F:  And  
D:  OK . 
F:  Interesting . Good . 
F:  And systematize also maybe the encoding of it if  as we find some are useful and some are not so useful . 
D:  Nope . 
D:  Yeah , so what I have right now is all pairwise , so that 's probably not sufficient . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  I think you don't need to have that much structure built in , and that would 
D:  Yeah , maybe not . 
F:  be less time - consuming to do it this way first , and then find out what structure 's needed . 
D:  Yep . 
E:  what about all of the meetings that have been recorded so far that  without this ? 
D:  OK . 
E:  Will  
E:  Will somebody go back and fill that in , or we just won't have it , or  
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Well , I think that in a lot of the meetings people won't be filling this out anyway . 
A:  <cough> 
D:  So really what I want to have is a place that if a researcher wants that information , they can add it . 
E:  Mmm . 
B:  Almost all of the meetings 
B:  that we have 
B:  are recorded with roughly this group  uh and uh  you know and  
D:  Right . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  a fair minority with the group that we have in the morning , so this is not a lot of people . We could easily  There 's just a couple other meetings that 
D:  Right . 
D:  So it  
E:  So it wouldn't be that hard to go back and  
D:  We can regenerate a lot of this information . 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  But  
D:  Even if we can't , 
D:  generate it , I think it 's alright to have some of the sections in your 
D:  database blank , 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  that this information was not collected for this meeting . 
D:  And there 's just not gonna be a way around that . 
D:  That 's just gonna happen 
D:  like the N S A meeting , 
D:  the 
D:  networks meeting . 
D:  I don't think they 're gonna want to fill out that information . 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  So . 
D:  OK , enough on forms . 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
topic_description:	assessing relationships between speakers


B:  OK , so we 're running kind of late , so we 'll probably wanna zip through some other things , maybe 
C:  <inbreath> OK . 
B:  do some more time on  on Jose 's stuff later , um  uh Status of Transcription , 
B:  Uh , I guess , you know , we  we recently woke up um our friends and uh 
B:  so I  I guess  you 've sent off this  the uh 
B:  CD - ROMs  and you got some response from  
B:  from uh IBM about  
D:  They haven't received them yet , 
D:  but I did get a response from them saying 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  " Yes we 're still alive , we haven't done anything yet . " basically . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  And uh  
B:  Was there some suggestion that they might soon , or  
D:  Yeah . So  so , they 've 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  transferred the responsibility to someone else . I  can't remember his name 
B:  McCoond 
D:  McCoond ? 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Something like that , but uh  
D:  And so he sent me email and said he 's gonna be starting to work on it , and I haven't received anything else . 
B:  Great , OK . Well , that was that one . 
D:  So . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Um , 
D:  So tomorrow I 'll send a email and just ask if he received it , he should be getting it today . 
D:  Actually he should have gotten it yesterday . But . 
D:  Give him a day . 
topic_description:	status of transcription


B:  um , and I think we should just sort of look at this thing from you , off - line Jose cuz it 's getting kind of late but I mean I think the bottom line just glancing through it is that there 's  there 's a lot of overlap , 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  <clear throat> 
B:  in just energy related things and so you need something else . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  I mean , that 's sort of  <laugh> right ? 
C:  <laugh> OK . 
B:  And uh what  the  so I 'd  
E:  What about that error that  
E:  that uh  the  
B:  The residual error ? 
E:  the supposed lub no , the supposed bug  that was  
E:  that we were  We were guessing you had a bug before because  you went through and you concatenated all of these things together  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Ah , yeah yeah . I  I found the error , 
C:  and I repeated the experiments eh and here , eh  you can find the new results 
E:  Ah . 
C:  eh  with  Yeah , yeah .  
B:  OK , so this is post bug fix .  Good , OK . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  OK ? 
topic_description:	Jose's work on speaker overlap


B:  So um  so I had two thought just glancing through this . So , one is  one is that um 
B:  that uh  
B:  we might wanna talk about normalization . 
B:  I mean , I don't know what normalizations you use . Sometimes things have more overlap before you 've done 
B:  some kind of normalization  and we might think about what different kinds of normalizations are possible . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  And the other thing is that , if that isn't @ @ uh so much of the issue , then probably  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  I mean , residual LPC energy and just plain energy are very closely related , even though they 're different and um so 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  um  you really may need to go to something that looks at i in some sense harmonicity , or um  
B:  um 
B:  <pages turning> 
D:  Hmm . 
B:  relationship to or  fit  fit to pitch tracks on uh  on either side of  of it , for instance ? 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  You know , so if  if there 's uh a really bad fit between 
B:  where the pitch is going in this suppose  uh hypothesized region of overlap , 
B:  and the  the  and one or the other uh side , 
C:  Another side . 
B:  you know , then this  this  this might 
B:  uh , suggest a  
C:  an alteration in th in the tracking way . 
B:  Excuse me ?  
C:  You mean that eh you ehm  mmm  
C:  I understand that eh you  you mean eh to  to study the alteration 
C:  between the  the tracking of the pitch eh if we compare the overlapping zone with a speaker zone . 
B:  I if you have two  if you have two  if you have  uh  
C:  in the co in the context . 
B:  two 
B:  people speaking 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  uh  and 
B:  there 's an overlap , then  I mean the first thing is that there should be a mixture of harmonics 
B:   uh during overlapped voice sections anyway . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  And um 
B:  the  any  a measure that you have of how much of the energy is due to your best guess at a particular harmonic sequence , 
B:  it 's also going to be a smaller fraction . This is , you know , related to the harmonicity sort of thing . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
B:   And then the other thing I 'm saying is that if you look at the temporal evolution  of the pitch 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  there should be something like a discontinuity there . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:   Now , there 's other places where you 'll have discontinuities in pitch and speech , but  
B:  but  maybe it 'll have something to  have a different character . 
B:   But it seems like energy  energy tells you something , but uh 
B:  if  unless this is a normalization problem , it looks from your results like there 's so much overlap that  certainly you need something that isn't energy - like , in addition to it , at least . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  OK . 
E:  Are  
E:  Are the things in the  
C:  I don't normalicized eh in these er experiments . 
C:  by the moment . I don't normalicize . 
B:  OK , so the question is  is  would some kind of normalization  help . 
C:  Yeah ? 
B:  You know , uh , i i it could be that if you normalized uh by the overall 
B:  um  energy uh for uh you know some  some longer period of time or something , uh  that  that there would be more of a distinction . 
C:  Nnn . Yeah . 
C:  <turning page> 
C:  The different zone . 
B:  uh , I  I don't know . 
E:  <inbreath> 
E:  So , uh , from  
E:  from these charts , 
E:  are  hmm , I 'm just trying to remember where we were , but uh , were  you were interested in finding out if you can tell the difference between  overlap and single speakers by looking at the e energy , like say , for example , the mean of the energy . Was that the idea ? OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  <paper shuffling> 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  So , if you look at  
A:  <paper shuffling> 
E:  on this page that has uh frame energy , you look at the mean for the overlap , that 's forty - four point sixty - two versus the mean for the speakers , thirty - nine point sixty - two , so there seems to be more energy when there 's overlapping which 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Which is the intuition , un unfortunately there 's a standard deviation of like ten , so 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  makes sense , but  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , different than standard deviation . 
F:  Oh . 
B:   <clear throat> For each one , yeah . 
C:  The product of the deviation is the vari is the variance . 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  But are we assuming 
A:  that you could 
A:  know the energy for a speaker when there 's no overlap ? I mean 
A:  I can imagine a model where you say , OK , you know 
D:  <inbreath> And  
A:  I 'm  I 'm gonna give myself  it 's cheating , but 
A:  not completely if they 're 
A:  often not overlapping 
A:  and normalized for the speaker 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  or is that 
A:  not allowed . I mean , what 's the  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Well , that 's what I was suggesting , that y you wanna do some kind of longer time normalization eh with the  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  But  
B:  even if you make a mistake occasionally , that  that i is roughly 
A:  right 
B:  i is there some 
B:  corresponding to that speaker , so that if you , if  if uh   if you 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  because that  that 's gonna spread out these distributions really a lot , to not do any kind of normalization , and so that  that could mask the effect somewhat . 
A:  right 
D:  <inbreath> 
E:  so the um  just one more clarifying question  On the overlap category ,  is that 
E:  overlapping of speakers 
C:  <inbreath> 
E:  only ? 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  It doesn't include some of the other sounds ?  OK . 
C:  No . 
D:  <inbreath> 
B:  So that 's why it doesn't add up down  
C:  It 's a pu pure overlapping zone . I mean that eh overlapping between two , three , four eh eh speaker . 
E:  OK . 
D:  And  
E:  OK . 
D:  And did  is this from the mixed signal ? 
C:  Th - 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  OK , so there is some normalization already , in that they 've been volume equalized 
A:  Right , 
A:  right . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  uh over the entire signal . 
A:  Right . 
A:  That 's what makes it  seem difficult , because you 're already left with 
C:  Because they  they 're  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  a high standard deviation and they 're already roughly 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  so that each person 's hearable , right ?  so sort of equally loud , perceptually anyway . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
B:  <breathes> 
F:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
F:  What about doing it with just the single channels ? 
C:  Sorry ? 
F:  What about , 
F:  uh 
C:  Say 
C:  this graphic ? 
F:  Well , I  I 'm thinking  so 
F:  they 're raising the question about the fact 
F:  that 
F:  if you use the mixed signal , 
C:  Yeah . I use the mixed signal 
F:  there 's already been a  
C:  without normalization  
C:  without normalization , but  
D:  Well , but the mixed signal already has a normalization in it . 
F:  I  I 'm wo 
F:  Exactly . So what I 'm wondering is what about doing some of this with the 
C:  but 
F:  single channel 
F:  recordings . 
C:  Ah . 
C:  I  I don't study the single channel 
C:  yet 
C:  but eh 
C:  is eh  is an idea . 
D:  Well , I think it 'll be worse , right , I think the mixed  
C:  to  to begin to work with the 
C:   eh  with the one single channel . Now . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  I have another  another thought . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Um , this is  this is frame energy , of course frame  
B:  frames have a lot of 
B:  variance to them because different sounds 
B:  are different 
B:  loudnesses . 
B:  So 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  I mean , what if you took uh one second 
B:  chunks or something like that . Or  or 
B:  maybe not even a second , maybe a quarter of a second or something , so that you would typically have two or three basically syllable kind of length  
A:  Yeah , like two hundred milliseconds or twenty to twenty - five frames , or 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
D:  Or window it  hamming window .  
B:  So then you  you 'll  you know  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Something , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:   So  so I mean , so you know two hundred , three hundred four hundred mill some longer chunk of time , 
B:  and then you looked at the amount of energy in that . 
B:  and how does that vary over these different cases . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
A:  or voiced regions , I mean 
B:  or voiced regions .  
A:  can we tell ? can we  sorry 
F:  Interesting . 
A:  I mean , is it known whether something 's voiced here , or is it roughly estimate  estimateable ? 
B:  Well , I mean , you could do a  
B:  you could first determine that something was voiced or not . 
A:  I mean like if one speaker 's voicing and the other one isn't and they 're overlapping , 
A:  do we know that the first speaker 's voicing , or not ? 
B:  Well , I mean the overlaps are typically more than just a tiny little bit of time and so uh there could be voiced and non - voiced pieces during the overlap . 
C:  Ah . 
D:  Huh . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  But will we be able t to detect the voicing when there 's overlap ? 
A:  That 's what I just wondered . 
B:  I don't know , 
B:   because it 's  
A:   OK . 
C:  <laugh> @ @ 
B:  it 's  
A:  So if we could , or if you could do some of it , 
B:  this  this has to do with these questions of harmonicity , and so forth , right ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  yeah , 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  then um , voiced regions would be , like , probably more informative , 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  for energy because  
B:  Right , so you could do something like , uh 
A:  and pi and pitch for that matter . <laugh> 
B:  but  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Sure . 
B:  But I think what will be easy for him to do would be to do this thing of looking over a large enough region of time . Cuz if you look over a large enough region of time , most of the time you 'll have some voiced  
B:  a fair amount of voiced uh energy in it . 
D:  Right . 
D:  <inbreath> 
B:  And so I think that would be  
D:  And he has on his graph something like forty percent . 
D:  It looked like fifty percent or more are point two seconds or longer 
D:  overlap 
D:  It 's li I think the last page . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Is it ? 
F:  That 'll also lessen the  standard deviation . 
C:  Here in the  yeah it  it 's a new   new  
C:  a new diapositive with information about the context for overlapping zone . 
D:  Nope , not the last page . 
C:  Um . 
D:  Where was it ? 
D:  It was one of the tables . 
B:  What ? 
C:  How define ? 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Are you using a pitch detector in this yet , in your 
B:  experiments ? 
C:  I 
B:  Do you have a pitch detector that you 're 
B:  using ? 
C:  Eh  j my ? 
B:  Do you  
B:  do you have a  a pitch detector 
F:  Pitch . 
B:  that you are using 
C:  eh , I  I 'm  working now with pitch detector . 
B:  in these experiments ? 
A:  Well , it 's the fifth page , I guess . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  I 'm working now , but eh I haven't eh results yet . But eh at this moment I  I  I prepare , I am  I am preparing the  the pitch eh eh tracking . 
D:  Fifth page . 
D:  Oh , it 's seventy - five percent ! 
C:  pitch tracker eh algorithm that I have but eh 
B:  Does  
B:  does it have a voiced , unvoiced uh 
B:  detector in it , uh ? 
C:  No . 
B:  It doesn't . 
B:  it just finds the pi it just finds the pitch even when it 's unvoiced ? 
C:  eh , I  I  
B:  I mean , it must have some  
A:  It has to tell you . 
B:  It has to tell you something , right ? 
A:  It has to give you at least a zero , one , I mean uh d binary  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  It 's based on uh a correlation 
C:  between frame the utterance 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  but eh I don't know what is ehm  eh  
B:  Right . 
C:  because it 's no my  my algorithm . 
B:  Yeah . So ordinarily in these things , it does tell you that it 's  
C:  Is  
B:  it 's voiced with a pitch of such - and - such . 
B:  And it will  i i 
C:  Uh - huh . 
B:  it will say something like zero or you know it 'll have something that it says when it 's  when it can't find a good  
B:  good uh uh period , right ? So it 's looking for some periodic behavior , and if it can't find a period it tells you 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
B:  for  for most things like that . 
C:  For most @ @ . 
B:  So I mean , this is , getting back to what Liz was suggesting which I think actually is good , 
B:  the more I think of it , that  that um 
B:   for normalization you could do something like take 
B:  voiced sections and normalize to equalize the energy in that . 
B:  I 'm just still going back to normalization , that even though it 's roughly normalized , uh , for overall gain , I think it 
B:  it 's  it  it may not be normalized enough . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  For b for both , for eh the frame energy and eh residular LPC eh energy 
C:  too . 
B:  Uh , for both , yeah . 
C:  For both . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  but eh 
C:  I test different normalization  
C:  I  eh 
C:  What kind of normalization ?  I  I  
B:  OK , so  so I think 
B:  I mean , @ @ this is something to  to experimentally determine , but I mean , 
C:  <laugh> This is  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  if um 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  u as I understand it , you have  you have some 
B:  regions that uh 
B:  um 
B:  are marked , as  You have training data that you 're trying to find a threshold , right ? and so 
C:  Uh - huh . 
B:  um 
B:  um if you take 
B:  um 
B:  all the things  all the uh 
B:  speak things marked " SPK " , 
B:  and uh look for the voiced 
B:  uh energy in them , 
C:  Uh - huh . 
B:  and uh 
B:  well , just in  in each case , take a  take a  take a frame , 
B:   take the uh  uh 
B:  if it 's  if it 's voiced , 
B:  include it ,  
B:  Just separate out from the  from the normal things , separate out voiced . 
A:  Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . 
B:   Right ? Then you 're gonna end up 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  with uh a  a uh  a mean uh standard devia deviation , and so forth . And then do your normalization based on that . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  And once you do that 
B:  just for voiced , um 
B:  um 
B:  I guess you 'd  
A:  You can also look at just the voiced regions 
A:  later . I mean , that would be the most sensitive measure . 
A:  because 
A:  you know , if you 're normalizing for voiced , and then you look at regions that are voiced with the same robustness in estimation of what voicing is , um , 
A:  you should be much more sensitive to the  
A:  to the overlaps then if you  you know if you normalize but you look everywhere at  at  
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  at fricatives or something you won't really know anything . 
A:  So 
A:  I mean assuming if it 's true that the overlap regions are sort of 
B:  Right . 
A:  long enough 
A:  that there 's some voicing in each of them , by each of the speakers , then you should do very well if you do this . But you 'll only know that in the re voiced regions but those are close enough to the  
B:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
C:  Hmm . 
A:  You know , there 's enough voicing going on and off uh that if you can capture the voicing 
C:  Uh - huh . 
A:  and if you can capture it when there 's overlap 
A:  then you should do quite well 
C:  Mmm . 
A:  there . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  I 'm wondering about 
F:  um if there  I suppose this is still just that one  
F:  that one data sample , right , that one meeting ? 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  But 
F:  it seems like 
F:  to have  
F:  it  it seems like a very hard test to have it be looking at the energy of all the speakers combined 
F:  rather than 
F:  taking s you know , maybe two extreme speakers out of the mix and seeing if 
F:  if it 's promising with respect to  
F:  that type of analysis . If you take like a target speaker , and  maybe 
B:  w 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  well , I mean , if there 's enough data , maybe two  
F:  two target speakers and then compare that to the mixture of all the speakers . 
B:  You could do that , yeah . 
B:  I mean , be  i And if they still overlapped , i i the  
F:  That 's hard . 
B:  But  but I  I think that  this is a good first thing , 
B:  to just sort of see . 
B:  And  and what this says is that  th that 
B:  without any special normalization at least , this is  there 's a lot of overlap here . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  And so  
F:  OK . 
B:  I mean 
B:  coming back to Jose 's question , I mean there 's still this issue of  of  of how much time  I mean  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  What do you look at in order to normalize ? I mean , dur you  you get some data in , you don't know which it is , 
B:  how do you  how do you  
B:  W w what period of time do you look over to normalize it 
B:  by ? 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  And  and uh , 
B:   that 's  that 's something to think about and experiment with . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  I think 
A:  also the 
A:  harmonics would be very important . 
A:  So if you can find voiced regions and  You know , if you have two speakers and they 're both voicing 
B:  Yes . 
A:  unless they have very similar , you know , pitch , you should be able to see the  difference in harmonics pretty clearly 
D:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
B:  Right , so that 's what we were talking about before with harmo with harmonicity measure . Yeah . So . 
D:  Um  
A:  just by counting them , I mean  yeah , so even if you 're not exactly sure when the overlap starts and ends because there 's some  non - voiced regions , at least you can  have these islands of reliability where you 're pretty sure . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  And  
D:  the length  
C:  Yeah . 
D:  It seems like with 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  the overlaps being fairly long , 
D:  that should make it easier . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Right , 
D:  That r that was an interesting statistic . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  and you could put an estimate  estimate , you know , a fuzzy start and end 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  That they 're much longer than I expected . 
C:  But this is very short . 
A:  time . 
D:  Ninety percent of them are over 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  two m two hundred milliseconds . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Is a problem to detect . 
A:  Well , it 's sort of good , though , if you 're  <laugh>  for  for your accuracy . Uh , Gives you a little more time to try to detect them . 
C:  But  
D:  It is good , but it 's uh  
C:  It 's a problem to  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  but it surprised me . 
C:  It 's a problem to identify and to detect , <laugh> too , 
C:  with eh the Javier system , for example . 
D:  Yes . 
D:  <laugh> For example . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> For example . 
C:  It 's a problem . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Uh , well . 
C:  Uh  
C:  Eh , what   sorry . 
B:  Good . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  What  what happened with the different contexts because eh  eh  you are talking about eh 
C:  the period or the  the duration of the  the window to eh the  the long 
C:  of the window to  to consider normalization  no ? 
B:  Yeah , and I  I  
C:  But eh we have different contexts . 
C:  The  the  the  the period  the  the  the length of the window to  to normalize eh the energy is eh in the context of the overlapping zone ? 
C:  Is eh in the  in the  left context as in th in the right context , considering eh the  these frames ? 
C:  You mean ? 
B:  I don't know . 
B:  I  I wanna think about it and you should think about it . I  I  I didn't want to just pop out an answer because I realized I  I hadn't thought about it enough . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
D:  Two hundred milliseconds , hamming window . 
C:  Because  because the  the  the problem is that we have different contexts . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , something  
C:  Different situation , and  
A:  somethin something like that 
F:  That 's true . 
F:  That 's complicated . 
A:  too .

E:  Just out of curiosity , what was the bug ? 
B:  I 'm not sure . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  What was the bug that you found ? 
C:  What the bu 
E:  The bug from last uh meeting ? 
C:  Ah , the bug . 
C:  The bug of  was the  the F - seek function in C . 
C:  because doesn't work uh when you eh  
C:  you try to  to  to ass n n to do an  a dated access 
C:  to  to a file , a big file , eh eh moving the  the head of the  in the hard disk , eh e forward and backward 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  a lot of time eh 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  in a moment 
C:  <laugh> F - seek function doesn't work . 
D:  Hmm . 
C:  and I had an problem . 
F:  Ah , that 's interesting , and it didn't give you good error messages . 
C:  Yes , this is  this is  
C:  it 's incredible . 
F:  Huh . 
E:  Hmm ! 
C:  I  I  I do the same in  in another  in another way and I haven't problem . 
E:  So it was positioning randomly ? 
D:  Did you 
D:  typecast to long ? 
D:  or 
D:  size - T or whatever it is ? I don't remember what it is . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  One of the problems , if the file is large , 
D:  um , and you 're cast to the wrong type . 
C:  I  
C:  I  I don't know , but uh I  I think the  the position in the file 
C:  eh 
C:  doesn't work 
C:  eh eh in long file , 
C:  a very long file . 
B:  Well , what he 's saying is that the typecasting could be the issue , 
D:  Right , if you 're sending at  an integer instead of a long . 
B:  for F - seek . 
C:  The typecast . 
D:  Typecast from integer , " int " 
D:  INT 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  or  long 
D:  or unsigned long . 
C:  eh it 's ehm  
D:  I think it 's  
C:  No , no , it 's unsigned . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , 
D:  It 's one possibility . 
C:  Signed . 
B:  Yeah , cuz I think in  I mean , in general F - seek works , so it 's 
C:  I  I  I don't know 
D:  Yep . 
C:  I don't know but eh I  I solved the problem with eh 
B:  Yeah , 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  a similar way and <laugh> I haven't problem 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  but eh I  I  I don't know because eh 
C:  eh it doesn't eh happen to me before . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  but eh  
B:  Anyway , 
C:  I  I  I have the same codes in different parts , 
C:  and uh I  I had to  to  to change all  all the points in the  in the code , 
C:  eh to substitute eh for another way , but 
D:  Yep . 
C:  eh  is
