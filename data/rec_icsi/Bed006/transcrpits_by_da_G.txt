G:  OK . 
G:  Time . 
G:  Are you Fey ? 
G:  Oh . 
G:  Hi . 
G:  I think we 've met before , 
G:  like , I remember talking to you about Aspect or something like that at some point or other . 
G:  So . 
G:  Oh that 's right . 
G:  Well . 
G:  No offense . 
G:  Like . 
G:  Oh , OK 
G:  sorry . 
G:  Getting ahead of myself . 
G:  Yay ! 
G:  " One of us . " 
G:  Me ? 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  What ? 
G:  You did ? 
G:  When ? 
G:  Oh . 
G:  About me or you ? 
G:  OK . <laugh> OK . 
G:  Well I didn't know . 
G:  I didn't mean to be humor copying , 
G:  but OK , 
G:  sorry . 
G:  Yes , I know myself . 
G:  It 's OK . 
G:  It 's a  
G:  Of Oz . 
G:  Not witch - like . 
G:  OK . 
G:  OK . 
G:  Didn't take a vote ? 
G:  OK . 
G:  More than three of us . 
G:  The department has many mayors . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Did Jerry talk to you about maybe using our class ? 
G:  the students in the undergrad class that he 's teaching ? 
G:  e 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  OK , but th I guess it 's that um people in his class cover a different set 
G:  so  
G:  than the c 
G:  is the CogSci department that you were talking about ? 
G:  uh reaching out to ? 
G:  Cuz we have you know people from other areas 
G:  advertise in their classes as well . 
G:  Cuz I mean I  I know how to contact our students , 
G:  so if there 's something that you 're sending out you can also s um send me a copy , 
G:  me or Bhaskara could  either of us could post it to 
G:  uh 
G:  is it  
G:  if it 's a general solicitation that you know is just contact you then we can totally pro post it to the news group 
G:  so . 
G:  OK , 
G:  so you 'll send it 
G:  or something 
G:  so . 
G:  You can send it to me . 
G:  OK . 
G:  Don't worry , 
G:  we  this doesn't concern you anymore , Robert . 
G:  It 's fine . 
G:  Oops . 
G:  Already ? 
G:  Really ? 
G:  Oops . 
G:  I don't remember getting anything . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  so um y you 'll have those say somewhere what their intention was  
G:  so you still have the  the nice thing about having data where you know what the actual intention was ? 
G:  But they will um  
G:  There 's nothing that says you know " these are the things you want to do " 
G:  so they 'll say " well these are the things I want to do " 
G:  and  
G:  Right , 
G:  so they 'll have a little bit more natural interaction ? 
G:  OK . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  It w it doesn't have like streets on it that would allow them to figure out their way  
G:  OK . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  I didn't know he was the founder . 
G:  That 's  
G:  OK . 
G:  Using this new  new um plan , 
G:  OK . 
G:  So what 's the s this is what you made , Fey ? 
G:  Like so  So it 's just based on like the materials you had about Heidelberg . 
G:  Oh OK 
G:  there 's a web site 
G:  and then you could like um figure out what the cate 
G:  OK . 
G:  OK . 
G:  Hmm . 
G:  Um , are you worried about being able to identify  
G:  Um . 
G:  The  The goals that we 've d you guys have been talking about are this  these you know identifying which of three modes um their question uh concerns . 
G:  So it 's like the Enter versus View  
G:  Uh - huh . 
G:  Uh - huh . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  So the interaction beforehand will give them hints about how specific or how whatever though the kinds of questions that are going to ask during the actual session ? 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  OK , that 's what I mean 
G:  so like those tasks are all gonna be um unambiguous about which of the three modes . 
G:  Right . OK . 
G:  So . 
G:  t <sniff> <sniff> <sniff> <sniff> <sniff> <sniff> <laugh> <laugh> <laugh> <laugh> <sniff> <sniff> That they 'll be here ? 
G:  Yeah w it doesn't really have much meaning to grad students 
G:  but final projects might . 
G:  That  
G:  Ye 
G:  So , no sample generator output yet ? 
G:  OK . 
G:  This is being sent , 
G:  mm - hmm . 
G:  OK . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  So that was like one of the first l You know , the first task was getting it working for English . 
G:  So that 's basically over now . 
G:  Is that right ? 
G:  So the basic requirement fulfilled . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  So the speech recognizer also works . 
G:  Uh - huh . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  If  and they 're kind of correct . 
G:  And they kind of are  are correct . 
G:  It 's not just like anything . 
G:  And they 're mostly in English . 
G:  So . 
G:  Are they  is it using the database ? 
G:  the German TV movie . 
G:  OK . 
G:  So <laugh> all the actual data might be German names ? 
G:  Or are they all like American TV programs ? 
G:  Mm - hmm , 
G:  mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Hmm . 
G:  Right . 
G:  But they 're shown like on a screen . 
G:  It 's a  I mean so would the generator , 
G:  like the English language sentence of it is  " these are the follow you know the following films are being shown " or something like that ? 
G:  S 
G:  Right . 
G:  So it 'll just display  
G:  OK . 
G:  So we don't have to worry about um  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  OK . 
G:  OK . 
G:  OK . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Forced motion and caused action for instance , 
G:  OK . 
G:  Yeah . It 's the shadow . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  This is the uh  what the action planner uses ? 
G:  This is  
G:  OK . 
G:  And is that  and tha that 's changeable ? 
G:  or not ? 
G:  Like are we adapting to it ? 
G:  Or  
G:  Oh , yeah . 
G:  Uh - huh . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  What did you think he was doing ? 
G:  OK , sorry . 
G:  You look up here . 
G:  OK . 
G:  So it 's just an additional information  
G:  Right ? 
G:  that doesn't hurt the current way . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Good . 
G:  Hmm . 
G:  Hmm . 
G:  Hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Yeah can you go back to that one ? 
G:  So the fillers of the role source . 
G:  OK . 
G:  OK , so th 
G:  sorry I just don't kn 
G:  um um um  
G:  This is just uh XML mo notational 
G:  but um the fact that it 's action schema and then sort of slash action schema 
G:  that 's a whole entit 
G:  That 's a block , 
G:  whereas source is just an attribute ? 
G:  Is that  
G:  Oh , OK , OK . 
G:  Uh - huh , uh - huh . 
G:  OK could it  it could also be blocked out then as  
G:  OK . 
G:  OK . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  OK . 
G:  OK . 
G:  So I guess the question is when you actually fill one of these out , it 'll be under action schema ? 
G:  Those are  
G:  It 's gonna be one  y you 'll pick one of those for  
G:  OK these are  this is just a layout of the possible that could go  play that role . 
G:  OK , go it . 
G:  Uh - huh . 
G:  OK . 
G:  OK . 
G:  S S 
G:  OK , so one question . 
G:  This was  in this case it 's all um clear , sort of obvious , 
G:  but you can think of the Enter , View and Approach as each having their roles , 
G:  right ? 
G:  the  I mean it 's  it 's implicit that the person that 's moving is doing entering viewing and approaching , 
G:  but you know the usual thing is we have bindings between sort of  
G:  they 're sort of like action specific roles and the more general Source - Path - Goal specific roles . 
G:  So are we worrying about that or not for now ? 
G:  OK . 
G:  OK . 
G:  What 's that ? 
G:  Oh I guess it  
G:  I  I may be just um reading this and interpreting it into my head in the way that I 've always viewed things 
G:  and <laugh> that  that may or may not be what you guys intended . 
G:  But if it is , then the top block is sort of like 
G:  um , you know , you have to list exactly what X - schema 
G:  or in this action schema , 
G:  there 'll be a certain one , that has its own s structure 
G:  and maybe it has stuff about that specific to entering or viewing or approaching , 
G:  but those could include roles like the thing that you 're viewing , the thing that you 're entering , the thing that you 're 
G:  whatever , 
G:  you know , that  which are  
G:  think  think of enter , view and approach as frames 
G:  and they have frame - specific parameters and  and roles 
G:  and you can also describe them in a general way as Source - Path - Goal schema 
G:  and maybe there 's other image schemas that you could you know add after this that you know , how do they work in terms of you know a force dynamics 
G:  or how do they work in f terms of other things . 
G:  So all of those have um basically f either specific  frame specific roles or more general frame specific roles that might have binding . 
G:  So the question is are um  how to represent when things are linked in a certain way . 
G:  So we know for Enter that there 's Container potentially involved 
G:  and it 's not  
G:  uh I don't know if you wanna have in the same level as the action schema SPG schema 
G:  it  it 's somewhere in there that you need to represent that there is some container 
G:  and the interior of it corresponds to some part of the Source - Path - Goal um you know goal  uh goal I guess in this case . 
G:  So uh is there an easy way in this notation to show when there 's identity basically between things 
G:  and I di don't know if that 's something we need to invent 
G:  or you know just  
G:  It 's OK . 
G:  Hmm . 
G:  Exactly . 
G:  Right , right . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Oh great . 
G:  s Uh - huh . 
G:  Great . 
G:  That 's exactly what is necessary . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  OK . 
G:  So you know  happen to know how  what  what " sooner or later " means like in practice ? 
G:  Or estimated . 
G:  OK , OK . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  So a pointer  a way to really say pointers . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  OK , yeah . 
G:  OK . 
G:  Uh - huh . 
G:  Right . 
G:  So you have constraints that are dependent on the c actual s specific filler , uh , of some attribute . 
G:  Uh - huh . 
G:  Tsk . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Or the Gateway Arch in St . 
G:  Louis . 
G:  So . 
G:  Whi - which is not bad , 
G:  because I mean , that there 's multiple sens 
G:  I mean that particular case , there 's mult there  there 's a forced side of  of that verb as well . 
G:  Would they both be listed here in  
G:  OK . 
G:  Under so o under action schema there 's a list that can include both  both things . 
G:  That 's interesting . 
G:  What ? 
G:  Oop . 
G:  I <laugh> d f 
G:  Yeah I  I  
G:  I see . 
G:  Uh - huh . 
G:  Uh - huh . 
G:  Interesting . 
G:  Would you say that the  like  
G:  I mean you could have a flat structure and just say these are two independent things , 
G:  but there 's also this sort of like causal , 
G:  well , so one is really facilitating the other and it 's part of a compound action of some kind , which has structure . 
G:  uh I  I think that 's nicer for a lot of reasons 
G:  but might be a pain 
G:  so uh  
G:  I mean there are truly times when you have two totally independent goals that they might express at once , 
G:  but in this case it 's really like there 's a purpo means that you know f for achieving some other purpose . 
G:  Uh - huh . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  See that  that bothers me that they 're the same thing . 
G:  Yeah 
G:  because they 're two different things 
G:  one of which is l 
G:  you could think of one a sub you know pru whatever pre - condition for the second . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Yeah , yeah . 
G:  So . So . OK . 
G:  So there 's like levels of granularity . 
G:  So uh there 's  there 's um a single event of which they are both a part . 
G:  And they 're  independently they  they are events which have very different characters as far as Source - Path - Goal whatever . 
G:  So when you identify Source - Path - Goal and whatever , there 's gonna to be a desire , whatever , eating , hunger , 
G:  whatever other frames you have involved , they have to match up in  in nice ways . 
G:  So it seems like each of them has its own internal structure and mapping to these schemas 
G:  you know from the other  
G:  But you know that 's just  That 's just me . 
G:  Like  <laugh> I  I  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Between you guys 
G:  uh 
G:  OK . 
G:  yeah that would be  that would be nice . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Mayb - yeah . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Right . 
G:  M Th 
G:  The other thing that I just thought of is that you could want to go to the bakery because you 're supposed to meet your friend there or som 
G:  you know so you  like being able to infer the second thing is very useful and probably often right . 
G:  But having them separate  
G:  Well maybe their friend said they were going to meet them in a bakery around the area . 
G:  And I 'm , yeah  I 'm  I 'm inventing contexts which are maybe unlikely , 
G:  but yeah I mean like  
G:  but it 's still the case that um you could  you could override that default by giving extra information 
G:  which is to me a reason why you would keep the inference of that separate from the knowledge of " OK they really want to know if there 's a bakery around here " , 
G:  which is direct . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Exactly . 
G:  It 's  I met someone at the bakery you know in the Victoria Station t you know <laugh> train station London before , 
G:  yeah . 
G:  It 's like  
G:  J Do you mean within the Source - Path - Goal actions ? 
G:  Those three ? 
G:  Hmm . 
G:  So there 's a bit a redundancy , 
G:  right ? 
G:  in  in which the things that go into a particular  You have categories at the top under action schema 
G:  and the things that go under a particular category are um supposed to have a corresponding schema definition for that type . 
G:  So I guess what 's the function of having it up there too ? 
G:  I mean I guess I 'm wondering whether  You could just have 
G:  under action schema you could just sort of say whatever you know it 's gonna be Enter , View or Approach or whatever number of things 
G:  and pos partly because you need to know somewhere that those things fall into some categories . 
G:  And it may be multiple categories as you say which is um the reason why it gets a little messy 
G:  um but if it has  if it 's supposed to be categorized in category X then the corresponding schema X will be among the structures that  that follow . 
G:  That 's like  
G:  OK , 
G:  sorry . 
G:  You didn't tell me to  
G:  Uh - huh . 
G:  But now you guys have seen the light . 
G:  So . 
G:  I it 's easy to go back and forth 
G:  isn't it ? 
G:  Uh - huh . 
G:  I agree . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Which is why I would think you would say Enter 
G:  and then just say all the things that are relevant specifically to Enter . 
G:  And then the things that are abstract will be in the abstract things as well . 
G:  And that 's why the bindings become useful . 
G:  Um Ye - I see what you mean by that , 
G:  but I  I don't if I would  I would need to have t have that . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Uh - huh . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  I in fact what you could say is for Enter , 
G:  you could say " here , list all the kinds of schemas that  on the category that  
G:  you know i 
G:  list all the parent categories " . 
G:  It 's just like a frame hierarchy , 
G:  right ? 
G:  like you have these blended frames . 
G:  So you would say enter and you 'd say my parent frames are such - and - such , 
G:  h and then those are the ones that actually you then actually define and say how the roles bind to your specific roles 
G:  which will probably be f richer and fuller and have other stuff in there . 
G:  Yeah it could <laugh> be not a coincidence . 
G:  Like I said , I 'm sure I 'm just hitting everything with a hammer that I developed , 
G:  but I mean you know uh it 's  
G:  I 'm just telling you what I think , 
G:  you just hit the button and it 's like  
G:  Metacomment . 
G:  " Damn this project . " 
G:  No just kidding . 
G:  Hmm . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  OK . 
G:  " Approach and then enter . " 
G:  Run like this 
G:  uh  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  No , this is the useful , 
G:  you know , don don't worry . 
G:  Yeah , 
G:  I can guarantee that . 
G:  And you could have also indicated that by saying " Enter , what are the kinds of action I am ? " 
G:  Right ? 
G:  So there 's just like sort of reverse organization , 
G:  right ? 
G:  So like unless @ @  Are there reasons why one is better than the other I mean that come from other sources ? 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  uh 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  OK , so it 's just like a pain to have to send it . 
G:  OK , I understand . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Be great . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Oh ! 
G:  Uh yeah wait  
G:  R Yeah , yeah . That 's fine . 
G:  Uh that 's true . 
G:  Although um roles  
G:  Yeah I  I  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  I was going to  
G:  Bread rolls ? 
G:  Pastry 
G:  oh ba oh the bak bakery example . 
G:  I see . 
G:  Right . OK . 
G:  I guess I 'll agree to that , then . 
G:  I n Didn't you say something about Friday , 
G:  or  ? 
G:  Hmm . 
G:  So do I . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  That would be good . 
G:  So three is  sounds good ? 
G:  I 'll be free by then . 
G:  " That 's the right answer . " 
G:  And you guys will argue some more ? 
G:  and have some ? 
G:  probably . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  And we 'll get the summary 
G:  like , this  the c you know , short version , 
G:  like  
G:  S 
G:  Like have it  we 'll have it in writing . 
G:  So . 
G:  or , better , speech . 
G:  So . 
G:  Oh yeah 
G:  uh 
G:  OK . 
G:  let 's uh yeah they 're  
G:  I have several in my head , 
G:  yeah . 
G:  Always thinking about binding . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  So , in general they 'll be bindings across both intentions and the actions . 
G:  So  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  So it 's gen it 's general across all of these things 
G:  it 's like  I mean Shastri would say you know binding is like <laugh> an essential cognitive uh process . 
G:  So . <sniff> Um . 
G:  So I don't think it will be isolated to one or the two , 
G:  but you can definitely figure out where  
G:  Yeah , sometimes things belong and  
G:  So actually I 'm not sure  
G:  I would be curious to see how separate the intention part and the action part are in the system . 
G:  Like I know the whole thing is like intention lattice , or something like that , 
G:  right ? 
G:  So is the ri right now are the ideas the rich  rich the RAD or whatever is one you know potential block inside intention . 
G:  It 's still  it 's still mainly intention hypothesis 
G:  and then that 's just one way to describe the  the action part of it . 
G:  OK . 
G:  OK , great uh - huh . 
G:  Not just that you want to go from here to here , 
G:  it 's that the action is what you intend 
G:  and this action consists of all com complicated modules and image schemas and whatever . 
G:  So . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  which is , 
G:  yeah , It 's fine 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mmm . We know the things that make use of this thing so that we can just change them so that they make use of RAD . 
G:  I can't believe we 're using this term . 
G:  So I 'm like RAD ! 
G:  Like every time I say it , it 's horrible . 
G:  OK . 
G:  I see what you mean . 
G:  Is the  
G:  But what is the " why " ? 
G:  Why ? 
G:  Yeah . That 's  doesn't make it a great term . 
G:  It 's just like those jokes where you have to work on both levels . 
G:  Do you see what I mean ? 
G:  Like 
G:  Oh . 
G:  Oh . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Oh . 
G:  Yeah . OK . 
G:  But what if it 's not an action ? 
G:  And intentions will be " RID " ? 
G:  Like , 
G:  " OK " . 
G:  Um are the  are the sample data that you guys showed sometime ago  
G:  like the things  
G:  maybe  maybe you 're gonna run a trial tomorrow . 
G:  I mean , I 'm just wondering whether the ac some the actual sentences from this domain will be available . 
G:  Cuz it 'd be nice for me to like look if I 'm thinking about examples 
G:  I 'm mostly looking at child language which you know will have some overlap but not total with the kinds of things that you guys are getting . 
G:  So you showed some in this  here before 
G:  and maybe you 've posted it before 
G:  but where would I look if I want to see ? 
G:  You know . 
G:  No just  just transcript . 
G:  Sorry . 
G:  Oh , OK . 
G:  I take that back then . 
G:  OK , well don't  don't make it a high priority  
G:  I  In fact if you just tell me like you know like two examples 
G:  I mean , y 
G:  The  the  the representational problems are  I 'm sure , will be there , 
G:  like enough for me to think about . 
G:  So . 
G:  OK . 
G:  Here . 
G:  OK .
