A:  OK . 
A:  Well . 
A:  u That 's pretty good , I think . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Thanks . 
A:  You could do it about you . 
A:  Well , so the idea is to try to get the actual phrasing that they might use and try to interfere as little as possible with their choice of words . 
A:  uh uh 
A:  Well , u u the one experiment th that  that  that I 've read somewhere , it was  they u used pictures . 
A:  So to  to uh actually um uh specify the  the tasks . 
A:  Uh , but you know i i 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  I mean , I I 'm  I 'm not saying it 's necessary 
A:  but  but uh i uh uh i <inbreath> you might be able to combine you know text uh and  and some sort of picture 
A:  and also uh I think it  it will be a good idea to show them the text and kind of chew the task 
A:  and then take the test away  the  the  the  the  the text away 
A:  so that they are not uh guided by  by by what you wrote , 
A:  but can come up with their  with their own  
A:  Right . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Well  well you have to be careful with that uh uh thing 
A:  because uh <inbreath> I mean many actions presuppose some  um almost <mouth> infinitely many other actions . 
A:  So if you go to a bakery  you have a general intention of uh not being hungry . 
A:  You have a specific intentions to cross the traffic light to get there . 
A:  You have a further specific intentions to left  to lift your right foot 
A:  and so uh uh I mean y you really have to focus on on  on 
A:  and decide the level of  of abstraction that  that you aim at it kind of zero in on that , 
A:  and more or less ignore the rest , unless there is some implications that  that you want to constant draw from  from sub - tasks um that are relevant 
A:  uh I mean but very difficult . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Well . 
A:  I have a question about the slot of the SPG action . 
A:  So <inbreath> the Enter - View - Approach the  the  the EVA um , those are fixed slots in this particular action . 
A:  Every action of this kind will have a choice . 
A:  Or  or  or  or will it just 
A:  um uh  
A:  is it change  
A:  Right , right . 
A:  So  so I  I mean for  for each particular action that you may want to characterize you would have some number of slots that define uh uh uh you know in some way what this action is all about . 
A:  It can be either A , B or C . 
A:  Um . So is it a fixed number or  or do you leave it open  it could be between one and fifteen 
A:  uh  
A:  it 's  it 's  it 's flexible . 
A:  uh <inbreath> ye uh uh b I uh I  u I understand 
A:  uh 
A:  but  
A:  No , no . 
A:  There  a a actually by I think my question is simpler than that , 
A:  um <inbreath> is  
A:  OK , so you have an SPG action 
A:  and  and it has three different um uh aspects 
A:  um 
A:  because you can either enter a building or view it or  or approach it and touch it or something . 
A:  Um now you define uh another action , 
A:  it 's  it 's called um uh s S P G - one 
A:  action 

A:  a different action . Um and this  uh action - two would have various variable possibilities of interpreting what you would like to do . And  i in  in a way similar to either Enter - View - Approach you may want to send a letter , read a letter , or dictate a letter , let 's say . 
A:  So , h 
A:  Right . 
A:  Oh , s so it 's sort of automatic derived fr from the structure that  that is built elsewhere . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Oh , uh 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right , right . 
A:  Promote them , 
A:  yeah . 
A:  uh Friday 
A:  uh Yeah , that 's fine . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So it 's at Friday at three ? 
A:  there that 's 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  An - and I would like to second Keith 's request . 
A:  An example wo would be nice 
A:  t to have kind of a detailed example . 
A:  OK .
