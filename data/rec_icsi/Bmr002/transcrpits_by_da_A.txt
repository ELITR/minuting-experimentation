A:  OK , this is Eric  on microphone number one , uh channel zero 
A:  Channel one . 
A:  off by one . 
A:  Right . 
A:  So go ahead . 
A:  Can  So we can do them again ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I 'm on channel one  
A:  Mike one , 
A:  channel zero , probably . 
A:  Channel zero . 
A:  Head restraint system ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  This is PZM two . 
A:  And this is PZM one . 
A:  Which  
A:  Huh - uh . 
A:  He 's ? 
A:  Right . 
A:  Wait a second . 
A:  No , I was looking for the ones  
A:  Oh . OK . 
A:  Well , then , fine . 
A:  See if we care . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Right . 
A:  But before w before we  
A:  Before that . 
A:  Do you wanna read next , 
A:  or d ? 
A:  uh 
A:  OK . 
A:  Um , this is Eric on <cough> mike one , 
A:  the wireless lapel , 
A:  channel zero . 
A:  um , 
A:  Right . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Sure . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  It 's fine . 
A:  So , I 'm just curious how  how  h how exactly you got roped into this . 
A:  I mean  
A:  OK . 
A:  Good . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Yeah . That would be m That would be my fault . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Uh right . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Oh ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . So you 're gonna do the actual transcription yourself . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , one th 
A:  The other thing is is that we might be  
A:  Oh . 
A:  Well , that 's what I was gonna say , is that Adam has foot pedals that we could probably try and rig something up to  
A:  Except for the fact that we would have to unplug it and pow and change  it w 
A:  Does it lose the memory once you 've unpowered it ? 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right , this is the pilot data . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Awesome . 
A:  Well , OK . So what happened with Switchboard was at least , I mean , the output was that they had speaker turns 
A:  and they um analyzed it in terms of , you know , " this is where this speaker change came in " 
A:  and of course that gets really difficult when you 're talking about  
A:  I mean , this is some of the stuff that you were talking about in uh your lunch talk , 
A:  is that  is that you know , you get backchannels and stuff like that , that that , you know , disrupt the um the segment you know the segmentation . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  So . So  
A:  So we  maybe we should look at the um  the tools that Mississippi State has . 
A:  Because , I d I  I know that they published um i  annotation tools , 
A:  you know , for their ins 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Sure . 
A:  We can hear all your conversations along the way . 
A:  Right , but we can do automated alignment . 
A:  That 's not a problem 
A:  I think 
A:  I th 
A:  Well , to get  to get the r to get the actual transcript , I think we 'll do OK 
A:  because of  because of the separate channels . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Well I know that  I know that um the Mississippi State tools , at least th what the produce does not come out in STM format . 
A:  They  they basically give 
A:  um They subdivide into WAVE files 
A:  and then they give  for each , they give a one  oh , you know , a WAVE file that g indicates where the start and stop times are , 
A:  and then  um and then give the uh whatever  the sentence information . 
A:  But I mean Ni - i i i it  as you said , it was easy to convert back and forth between um that file and STM format , 
A:  in fact what I did is I took the Mississippi State data , and just made STM files out of it . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh , looks like  Looks like uh work packages . 
A:  Must be  a European  project . 
A:  Oh , so they 're using the Alembic Workbench , from Mitre . 
A:  I guess . 
A:  I don't know . 
A:  Oh , 
A:  this is , 
A:  I see . 
A:  They 're reviewing , and  
A:  I see . 
A:  Mitre , 
A:  But that kind of thing I think we would probably want to extract automatically . 
A:  I mean , e this is , the  this is a conversation that we should have with Liz . 
A:  Right , 
A:  I think , 
A:  because she 's going to be  She 's going to be the one who 's the most concerned about this kind of thing . 
A:  And so she may have some ideas . on  on that particular issue . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Can I see that ? 
A:  Right . 
A:  Oh , so this 'd  this w is probably what the L D C uses . 
A:  I mean they do a lot of transcription at the L D 
A:  I could ask my contacts at the LDC what  what it is they actually use . 
A:  I mean , I know , I mean I 've got  I 've got contacts up there , 
A:  so . 
A:  So . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  No . 
A:  Right . 
A:  We 're very good at time alignments . 
A:  Right . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Uses what ? 
A:  So it 's very interest I mean , it 's interesting that one of the coordinators on that is Mark Liberman from the LDC 
A:  Which means that  I don't know what " coordinator " means in  in terms of that . 
A:  I mean 
A:  What  what is  what is  what is this web page from ? 
A:  Sure . 
A:  I see . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Actually what I would have come up with was w w " What was the web address of that <laugh> thing " , 
A:  which we didn't  
A:  we didn't record that . 
A:  Right . 
A:  slash  slash  capital CTA  slash , l 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  I see . 
A:  Right . 
A:  No , right , I didn't mean to imply that that we  that  that we shouldn't discuss this now , 
A:  but I 'm  I 'm just saying that  
A:  Right . 
A:  Sure , sure . 
A:  Well ,  I mean , they 're coming in April . 
A:  Right . 
A:  But , um 
A:  You know , we  we may or may not talk before then on that . 
A:  Um . I  I think we won't probably talk until we have more data , 
A:  I would think . 
A:  Right ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Oh ! 
A:  Yeah , cuz you 'd get you get  
A:  Right ! 
A:  Wow . 
A:  Well , you would  you would  sound like you 'd have like in this e big big head . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Well , part 
A:  I 
A:  W We also need to d do this in terms of SmartKom , 
A:  I mean , we 're collecting this as  to build general English acoustic models . 
A:  that can be that they can say " OK here 's the vocabulary 
A:  and here 's the  you know , here are the pronunciations . And go to it . " 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  No . 
A:  Well , Dan 's got an open notebook , too . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Are you certain ? 
A:  Well , I hear what you 're saying . 
A:  I asked if somebody else wanted the lapel mike . 
A:  Somebody else can take it next time . 
A:  That 's it ! 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yes . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  How much space do we have left ? 
A:  Oh really . 
A:  Oh ! 
A:  OK , this is Eric  on microphone number one , uh channel zero
