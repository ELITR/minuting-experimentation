E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Is it on ? 
E:  What meeting ? 
E:  Who 's coming ? 
E:  Wha 
E:  What about , uh , is there anything new with the speech , nonspeech stuff ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Can we get these , wireless ? 
E:  Is it because  
E:  You  you 're saying the  for dialogue purposes , 
E:  so that means that the transcribers are having trouble with those mikes ? 
E:  Is that what you mean ? 
E:  Or  ? 
E:  Especially for people with big heads . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  That would be cool . 
E:  That would be really neat . 
E:  That  that reminds me , I had a  a thought of an interesting project that somebody could try to do with  the data from here , 
E:  either using , you know , the  the mikes on the table or using signal energies from the head worn mikes , 
E:  and that is to try to construct a map of where people were sitting , 
E:  uh , based on  
E:  Oh , did he ? 
E:  Oh , that 's interesting . 
E:  And so you could plot out who was sitting next to who 
E:  and  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Well I was just thinking , you know , as I was sitting here next to Thilo that um , when he 's talking , my mike probably picks it up better than  your guys 's mikes . 
E:  So if you just looked at  
E:  yeah ,  looked at  the energy on my mike and you could get an idea about who 's closest to who . 
E:  And  
E:  Are they going to do video as well ? 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  So there 's no like portable array of mikes ? 
E:  Wow . 
E:  I 've seen demonstrations of the microphone arrays . It 's amazing how  how they can cut out noise . 
E:  Huh . 
E:  So to save that data you  You have to have one channel recording per mike in the array ? 
E:  Is that  
E:  What you save , I mean , if you 're going to do research with it . yeah 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Uh , oh , OK , I see . 
E:  Sort of saving the result of the beam - forming . 
E:  Is there an interest in getting video recordings for these meetings ? 

E:  I mean 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  So there 's not enough interest to overcome all of  
E:  Mmm . 
E:  You were here at a meeting before . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Usually . 
E:  How big is the data set ? 
E:  Ah , OK . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Wow . 
E:  Is this the project that 's sort of , uh , between , uh , NIST and  and , uh , a couple of other places ? 
E:  The  the  
E:  Yeah , 
E:  y right , 
E:  OK . 
E:  The p the people  
E:  The  the folks that they 're , uh , subcontracting out the transcription to , are they like court reporters 
E:  or  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Like medical transcriptionist type people  
E:  But aren't  they 're  
E:  Oh , so they 're hiring them , they 're coming . It 's not a service they send the tapes out to . 
E:  Ah ! 
E:  Oh . OK . 
E:  I gotcha . 
E:  I see . 
E:  I see . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Oh . 
E:  So each person gets one of these channels  
E:  OK . 
E:  But there could be problems , right ? with that . 
E:  Well if you 're tran if you got that channel right there  
E:  Yeah , 
E:  that 's  
E:  Right . 
E:  Just out of curiosity , I mean  
E:  Given all of the effort that is going on here in transcribing why do we have I B M doing it ? 
E:  Why not just do it all ourselves ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  I 'm just wondering now  
E:  Well , I 'm  I 'm wondering now if it 's  
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Well you would need to  like a forced alignment before you did the chopping , 
E:  right ? 
E:  Why not do a  a  a forced alignment ? 
E:  That would be really valuable I think . 
E:  You 're saying r sort of remove the high level constraints 
E:  and go bottom - up . 
E:  Then just say  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Acoustic features versus psychological categories . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
E:  Just a source of data ? 
E:  You mean in terms of the topic  topics ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Does  does John Ohala have weekly phonetics lab meetings ? 
E:  Well , and  and the other thing too is when they originally said " no " they didn't know about this post - editing capability thing . 
E:  So . 
E:  Did he mean , uh  did he mean and non - British ? 
E:  He said British was OK ? 
E:  Knowing the application  
E:  A any department that calls itself science 
E:  So the problem is like , uh , on the microphone of somebody who 's not talking they 're picking up signals from other people  and that 's <breath> causing problems ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  What about increasing the flexibility of the alignment ? 
E:  Do you remember that thing that Michael Finka did ? 
E:  that experiment he did a while back ? 
E:  Oh , so that 's the problem , is the  the signal - to - noise ratio . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Or even words inserted that weren't  weren't there . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm .
