B:  Are we on ? 
B:  We 're on . OK . 
E:  Is it on ? 
B:  <breath> Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <breath> OK , so , uh ,  we haven't sent around the agenda . <laugh> So , 
D:  One , two  
F:  <mike noise> 
D:  u OK . 
A:  Why is it so cold in here ?  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  <clears throat> 
topic_description:	opening


B:  i 
B:  uh , any agenda items anybody has , wants to talk about , what 's going on ? 
H:  <breath> 
E:  <sniff> 
G:  I c I could talk about the meeting . 
H:  Does everyone  has everyone met Don ? 
G:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah ? OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
C:  Now , yeah . <laugh> 
B:  It 's on ? 
F:  Hello . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  OK , agenda item one , introduce Don . OK , we did that . <breath> Uh  
D:  We went  
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <breath> 
D:  <breath> 
A:  Well , I had a  just a quick question but I know there was discussion of it at a previous meeting that I missed , but just about the  
D:  <breath> 
F:  <mike noise> 
A:  the wish list item of getting good quality close - talking mikes on every speaker . 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  OK , so let 's  let 's  So let 's just do agenda  building right now . OK , so let 's talk about that a bit . 
A:  I mean , that was  
B:  Uh , @ @ tuss close talking mikes , better quality . OK , <breath> uh , we can talk about that . You were gonna  starting to say something ? 
G:  Well , you  you , um , already know about the meeting  that 's coming up and I don't know if  if 
G:  this is appropriate for this .  I don't know . I mean , maybe  maybe it 's something we should handle outside of the meeting .  
E:  What meeting ? 
B:  No , no , that 's OK . We can  so  we can ta so n NIST is  NIST folks are coming by next week and so we can talk about that . <breath> 
G:  OK . 
G:  Yeah .  
E:  Who 's coming ? 
B:  I think 
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  Uh , uh , John Fiscus and , uh , I think George Doddington will be 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  around as well . 
B:  <mouth> Uh , OK , so we can talk about that . Uh , I guess just hear about how things are going with , uh , uh , the transcriptions . That 's right . That would sorta be an obvious thing to discuss . 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  Sure . Mm - hmm . 
B:  Um , 
B:  An - anything else , uh , 
B:  strike anybody ? 
A:  Uh , we started  running recognition on  one conversation but it 's the r  isn't working yet . <laugh> So , 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> OK . 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <mike noise> 
A:  <clears throat> But if anyone has  
E:  Wha - 
A:  uh , the main thing would be if anyone has , um , knowledge about ways to , uh , post - process the wave forms that would give us better recognition , that would be helpful to know about . 
B:  Um , 
H:  Dome yeah , it sounds like a topic of conversation . 
B:  Yeah , so , uh  
E:  What about , uh , is there anything new with the speech , nonspeech 
C:  Yeah , we 're working more on it but , <laugh> it 's not finished . <laugh> 
E:  stuff ? 
B:  OK . 
B:  <breath> Alright , that seems like a  a good collection of things . And we 'll undoubtedly think of  other things . 
G:  I had thought under my topic that I would mention the , uh , four items that I  I , uh , put out for being on the agenda f on that meeting , which includes like the pre - segmentation and the  and the developments in multitrans . 
E:  <breath> <sniff> 
B:  Oh , under the NIST meeting . 
G:  Yeah , under the NIST thing . Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  <breath> Alright , why don't we start off with this , 
B:  u u 
B:  I guess the order we brought them up seems fine . Um , 
G:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	summary of meeting agenda items


B:  so , better quality close talking mikes . So the one issue was that the  the , uh , lapel mike , uh , isn't as good as you would like . And so , 
B:  uh , it  it 'd be better if we had close talking mikes for everybody . Right ? 
D:  <cough> 
B:  Is that  is that basically the point ? 
A:  Ri - um , 
A:  yeah , the  
A:  And actually in addition to that , that the  
A:  the close talking mikes are worn in such a way as to best capture the signal . 
A:  And the reason here is just that for the people doing work not on microphones but on sort of like dialogue and so forth , 
A:  uh  or and even on prosody , which Don is gonna be working on soon , 
A:  it adds this extra , you know , vari variable for each speaker to  to deal with when the microphones aren't similar . 
H:  Right . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  So  And I also talked to Mari this morning and she also had a strong preference for doing that . And in fact she said that 
A:  that 's useful for them to know in starting to collect their data too . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <breath> Right , so one th 
H:  Well , so  
B:  uh , well one thing I was gonna say was that , um , 
B:  i 
B:  we could get more , uh , of the head mounted microphones even beyond the number of radio channels we have because 
B:  I think whether it 's radio or wire is probably second - order . And the main thing is having the microphone close to you , u although , not too close . <laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  Right , so , uh , actually the way Jose is wearing his is  is c  correct . The good way . So you want to  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Is  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  I it 's not cor it 's correct ? 
B:  Is . 
H:  Yeah , th that 's good . So it 's towards the corner of your mouth so that breath sounds don't get on it . And then just sort of 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <mike noise> 
B:  Yes . 
D:  Yeah . <cough> 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <mike noise> 
D:  Yeah . 
H:  about , uh , a thumb or  a thumb and a half away from your  from your mouth . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh , yeah . 
B:  Right . 
A:  But we have more than one type of  I mean , for instance , you 're  
B:  How am I d 
C:  Yeah . 
H:  And this one isn't very adjustable , so this about as good as I can get cuz it 's a fixed boom . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Is fixed . Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  But if we could actually standardize , you know , the  the microphones , uh , as much as possible that would be really helpful . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <mike noise> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <breath> 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Well , I mean it doesn't hurt to have a few extra microphones around , so why don't we just go out and  and get an order of  of if this microphone seems OK to people , 
D:  Yeah . 
H:  <mouth> <inbreath>  
B:  uh , I 'd just get a half dozen of these things . 
H:  Well the onl the only problem with that is right now , um , some of the Jimlets aren't working . 
H:  The little  the boxes under the table .  
B:  Yeah .  
H:  And so , w Uh , I 've only been able to find three jacks that are working . 
B:  Yeah .  
G:  <mike noise> 
E:  Can we get these , wireless ? 
H:  So  
B:  No , but my point is  
A:  But y we could just record these signals separately and time align them with the start of the meeting . 
B:  R r right  
H:  I  I 'm not sure I 'm follow .  Say that again ? 
B:  Right now , 
B:  we 've got , uh , two microphones in the room , 
B:  that are not quote - unquote standard . So why don't we replace those  
H:  OK , just two . 
A:  <mike noise> 
B:  Well , however many we can plug in . You know , if we can plug in three , let 's plug in three . Also what we 've talked before about getting another , uh , radio , 
H:  OK . 
D:  Mm - yeah . 
H:  Right . 
B:  and so then that would be , you know , three  more . 
H:  Right . OK . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  So , uh  so we should go out to our full complement of whatever we can do , 
E:  <breath> 
B:  <breath> but have them all be the same mike . I think the original reason 
B:  that it was done the other way was because , it w it was sort of an experimental thing and I don't think anybody knew whether people would rather have more variety or  
A:  Right . 
B:  <breath> or , uh , more uniformity , but  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  @ @  
B:  but uh , 
B:  sounds  sounds fine . 
H:  Sounds like uniformity wins .  
D:  Right . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> Yeah . 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  Well , for short term research it 's just  there 's just so much 
H:  <breath> 
A:  effort that would have to be done up front n uh , so  yeah , uniformity would be great . 
H:  Well  
H:  Yeah . 
E:  Is it because  
E:  You  you 're saying the  for dialogue purposes , so that means that the transcribers are having trouble with those 
E:  mikes ? Is that what you mean ? Or  ?  
A:  Well Jane would know more about the transcribers . 
G:  <breath> And that 's true . I mean , I  we did discuss this . Uh , and  and  
H:  Yep . 
H:  Couple times . 
G:  a couple times ,  so , um , yeah , the transcribers notice  And in fact there 're some where , um  
G:  ugh  well , I mean there 's  it 's the double thing . It 's the equipment and also how it 's worn . 
G:  And he 's always  they always  they just rave about how wonderful Adam 's  Adam 's channel is . 
A:  Right . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  What can I say . <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  And then , <laugh> 
A:  So does the recognizer . <laugh> 
H:  <breath> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  Oh , really ? Yeah , I 'm not surprised . I mean , " Baaah ! "  <laugh> 
G:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  Yeah , but I mean it 's not just that , it 's also you know you 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  Even if  if you 're talking on someone else 's mike it 's still  you w  
B:  Yeah . 
G:  It 's also like n no breathing , no   You know , it 's like it 's  
H:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  it 's um , it 's really  <mike noise> it makes a big difference from the transcribers ' point of view and also from the research s point of view . 
B:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah , it 's an advantage when you don't breath . 
B:  <sniff> 
B:  When we 're doing  
H:  Yeah , I think that the point of doing the close talking mike is to get a good quality signal . We 're not doing research on close talking mikes . 
A:  Right . 
G:  Yeah . 
H:  So we might as well get it as uniform as we can . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  <breath> 
A:  Right . 
B:  Now , this is 
B:  locking the barn door after the horse was stolen . We do have thirty hours , of  of speech , which is done this way . But  
H:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  That 's OK . 
B:  but , uh , yeah , for future ones we can get it a bit more uniform . 
A:  Great , great . 
H:  So I think just do a field trip at some point . 
B:  Yeah , probably  yeah , to the store we talked about and that  
H:  Yep . 
G:  And there was some talk about , uh , maybe the h headphones that are uncomfortable for people , to  
F:  <mike noise> 
H:  Yep . 
H:  So , as  as I said , we 'll do a field trip and see if we can get all of the same mike that 's more comfortable than  than these things , which I think are horrible . 
G:  OK . 
H:  <mouth> 
H:  <breath> So . 
G:  Good .  
A:  Great , thank you very much . <laugh> It 's makes our job a lot easier . 
E:  Especially for people with big heads .  
B:  <laugh> OK . 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  And , you know , we 're researchers , so we all have big heads . 
B:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
D:  <breath> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  <laugh>

topic_description:	close talking microphones, quality issues


B:  Uh , <laugh> 
B:  OK , second item was the , uh , 
A:  <breath> 
B:  NIST visit , and what 's going on there . 
G:  Yeah .  
G:  OK , so , um , uh , 
E:  <breath> 
G:  Jonathan Fiscus is coming on the second of February and I 've spoken with , uh ,  u u a lot of people here , not everyone . Um , and , um , 
G:  he expressed an interest in seeing the room and in , um , seeing a demonstration of the modified multitrans , which I 'll mention in a second , 
G:  and also , um , he was interested in the pre - segmentation and then he 's also interested in the transcription conventions . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  And , um  So , um , it seems to me in terms of like , um , 
B:  <breath> 
G:  i i it wou 
G:  You know , OK . So the room , it 's things like the audio and c and audi audio and acoustic  acoustic properties of the room and how it  how the recordings are done , and that kind of thing . 
G:  And , um . OK , in terms of the multi - trans , well that  that 's being modified by Dave Gelbart to , uh , handle multi - channel recording . 
H:  Oh , I should 've  
H:  I was just thinking I should have invited him to this meeting . I forgot to do it . 
G:  <mike noise> Yeah , OK . 
H:  So . 
C:  Yeah . 
H:  Sorry . 
G:  Yeah . Well that 's OK , I mean we 'll  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  Yeah , and it 's t and it looks really great . He  he has a prototype . I  I , uh , 
G:  @ @  
G:  didn't  didn't see it , uh , yesterday but I 'm going to see it today . 
G:  And , uh , that 's  that will enable us to do  nice 
G:  um , tight time marking of the beginning and ending of overlapping segments . At present it 's not possible with limitations of  
G:  of the , uh , original  design of the software . 
G:  And um . 
G:  So , I don't know .  
G:  In terms of , like , pre - segmentation , that  that continues to be , um , a terrific asset to the  to the transcribers . 
G:  Do you  I know that you 're al also supplementing it further . Do you want to mention something about that c Thilo , or  ?  
C:  Um , yeah . What  what I 'm doing right now is I 'm trying to 
C:  include some information about which channel , uh , there 's some speech 
C:  in . But that 's not working at the moment . I 'm just trying to do this by comparing energies , uh  
G:  OK . 
C:  normalizing energies and comparing energies of the different channels . And 
C:  so to  to give the transcribers some information in which channel there 's  there 's speech in addition to  to the thing we  we did 
C:  now which is just , uh , speech - nonspeech detection on the mixed file . 
G:  This is good . Mm - hmm . 
C:  So I 'm  I 'm relying on  on the segmentation of the mixed file but I 'm  I 'm trying to 
C:  subdivide the speech portions into 
C:  different portions if there is some activity in  in different channels . 
G:  Excellent , so this 'd be like w e providing also speaker ID  potentially . Wonderful . 
C:  But  
C:  Yeah . Yeah . 
G:  Wonderful .  <mike noise> <breath> 
topic_description:	upcoming NIST visit


B:  Um , something I guess I didn't put in the list but , uh , 
B:  on that , uh , same day later on in  or maybe it 's  
B:  No , actually  it 's this week ,  
E:  <breath> 
B:  uh , Dave Gelbart and I will be , uh , visiting with John Canny who i you know , is a CS professor , 
G:  <mouth noise> Oh . 
H:  HCC . 
B:  who 's interested in ar in array microphones . 
H:  Oh , he 's doing array mikes . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  And so we wanna see what commonality there is here . You know , maybe they 'd wanna 
B:  stick an array mike here when we 're doing things  or  or maybe 
E:  That would be cool . 
H:  Yeah , that would be neat . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  That would be really neat . 
B:  it 's  it 's not a specific array microphone they want but they might wanna just ,  uh , you know , you could imagine them taking the four signals from these  these table mikes and trying to do something with them   
B:  Um , I also had a discussion  So , w uh , we 'll be over  over there talking with him , um , after class on Friday . Um , 
B:  we 'll let you know what  what goes with that . Also had a completely unrelated thing . I had a , uh , discussion today with , uh , Birger Kollmeier who 's a , 
B:  uh , a German , uh , scientist who 's got a fair sized group <clears throat> doing a range of things . It 's sort of auditory related , largely for hearing aids and so on . But  
B:  but , uh , he does stuff with auditory models and he 's very interested in directionality , and location , and  
E:  <breath> 
B:  and , uh , head models and  
H:  <laugh> 
B:  microphone things . And so , uh , he 's  he and possibly a student , there w there 's , uh , a student of his who gave a talk here 
B:  last year , uh , may come here , uh , in the fall for , uh , sort of a five month , uh , sabbatical . So he might be around . 
B:  Get him to give some talks and so on . But anyway , he might be interested in  this stuff . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <breath> 
topic_description:	other upcoming visits


E:  That  that reminds me , I had a  a thought of an interesting project that 
E:  somebody could try to do with  the data from here , either using , you know , the  the mikes on the table or 
B:  <clears throat> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  using signal energies from the head worn mikes , and that is to try to construct a map of where people were sitting , 
B:  Right . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
H:  Well Dan  Dan had worked on that . Dan Ellis , yeah . 
E:  uh , based on  
D:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Oh , did he ? Oh , that 's interesting . 
B:  <inbreath>  
H:  So that  that 's the cross - correlation stuff , was  
D:  Yeah . 
H:  was doing b beam - forming . 
E:  And so you could plot out who was sitting next to who and  
B:  <breath> 
B:  A little bit , I mean , he didn't do a very extreme thing but just  it was just sort of 
D:  Yeah , yeah . 
H:  No , he did start on it . 
B:  e e given that , the  the  the block of wood with the  the  the two mikes  on either side , 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  if I 'm speaking , or if you 're speaking , or someone over there is speaking , it  if you look at cross - correlation functions , you end up with a  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  if  if someone who was on the axis between the two is talking , then you  you get a big peak there . And if  if someone 's talking on  on  on , uh , one side or the other , it goes the other way . And then , 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <breath> 
B:  uh , it  it  it even looks different if th t if the two  two people on either side are talking than if one in the middle . It  it actually looks somewhat different , so . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Well I was just thinking , you know , as I was sitting here next to Thilo that 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  um , 
E:  when he 's talking , 
E:  my mike probably picks it up better than  your guys 's mikes . So if you just looked at  
D:  Yeah . 
H:  Oh , that 's another cl cue , that 's true . 
E:  yeah ,  looked at  the energy on my mike and you could get an idea about who 's closest to who . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  And  
H:  Or who talks the loudest .  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <breath> 
B:  Yeah , well you have to  the appropriate normalizations are tricky , and  and  and are probably the key . 
A:  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  You just search for Adam 's voice on each individual microphone , you pretty much know where everybody 's sitting .  <breath> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah .

topic_description:	cross-correlation of microphone channels


B:  OK . 
B:  So those are just a little couple of news items . 
G:  Can I ask one thing ? Uh , so , um , 
G:  Jonathan Fiscus expressed an interest in , uh , microphone arrays . 
B:  Yes . 
G:  Um , is there  I mean  b And I also want to say , his  he can't stay all day . He needs to 
G:  uh , leave for  uh , from here to make a two forty - five flight 
H:  Oh , so just morning . 
G:  from  from Oakland . 
B:  Right . 
G:  So it makes the scheduling a little bit tight but do you think that , um  that , uh , i John Canny should be involved in this somehow or not . I have no idea . 
B:  Probably not but I  I 'll  I 'll  I 'll know better after I see him this Friday what  what kind of level he wants to get involved . 
G:  It 's premature . 
G:  Fine . 
E:  <breath> 
G:  Good . 
B:  Uh , he might be excited to and it might be very appropriate for him to , uh , or he might have no interest whatsoever . I  I just really don't know . 
G:  OK . 
H:  Is he involved in  Ach !  I 'm blanking on the name of the project . 
H:  NIST has  has done a big meeting room  instrumented meeting room with video and microphone arrays , and 
H:  very elaborate software . Is  is he the one working on that ? 
B:  Well that 's what they 're starting up . 
H:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . No , I mean , that 's what all this is about . They  they haven't done it yet . 
H:  OK . I had read some papers that looked like they had already done some work . 
B:  They wanted to do it  
B:  Uh , well I think they 've instrumented a room but I don't  think they  they haven't started recordings yet . They don't have the t the transcription standards . They don't have the   
E:  Are they going to do video as well ? 
H:  Hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  Hmm . 
B:  I think . I think they are . 
H:  Oh , cuz what  what I had read was , uh , they had a uh 
H:  very large amount of software infrastructure for coordinating all this , both 
H:  in terms of recording and also live room where you 're interacting  the participants are interacting with the computer , and with the video , and lots of other stuff . 
B:  Well , I 'm  I 'm  I 'm not sure . All  all I know is that they 've been talking to me about a project that they 're going to start up 
H:  So . 
H:  OK . Well  
B:  recording people meet in meetings . And , uh , it is related to ours . They were interested in ours . They wanted to get some uniformity with us , uh , about the transcriptions and so on .  
H:  Alright . 
E:  <breath> 
B:  And one  one notable difference  u u actually I can't remember whether they were going to routinely collect video or not ,  but one  
B:  one , uh , difference from the audio side was that they are interested in using array mikes . 
B:  So , um , I mean , I 'll just tell you the party line on that . The reason I didn't go for that here 
B:  was because , uh , the focus , uh , both of my interest and of Adam 's interest was 
E:  <breath> 
B:  uh , in impromptu situations . And 
B:  we 're not recording a bunch of impromptu situations but that 's because it 's different to get data for research than to 
B:  actually apply it . And so , uh , for scientific reasons we thought it was good to instrument this room as we wanted it . 
D:  Hmm . 
B:  But the thing we ultimately wanted to aim at was a situation where 
B:  you were talking with , uh , one or more other people 
B:  i uh , in  in an p impromptu way , where you didn't  didn't actually know what the situation was going to be . And therefore it would not  it 'd be highly unlikely that room would be outfitted with  with some very carefully designed array of microphones . 
B:  Um , so it was only for that reason . It was just , you know , yet another piece of research and it seemed like we had enough troubles just  
E:  So there 's no like portable array of mikes ? 
B:  No . So there 's  there 's  
D:  Hmm . 
B:  uh , there 's a whole range of things  there 's a whole array of things , <laugh> that people do on this . So , um , 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  the , uh  the big arrays , uh , places , uh , like 
E:  <breath> 
B:  uh , Rutgers , and Brown , and other  other places , 
B:  uh , they have , uh , big arrays with , I don't know , a hundred  hundred mikes or something . And so there 's a wall of mikes . And you get 
H:  Xerox . 
E:  Wow . 
B:  really , really good beam - forming  with that sort of thing . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <breath> 
B:  And it 's  and , um , 
B:  in fact at one point we had a  a proposal in with Rutgers where we were gonna do some of the 
B:  sort of per channel signal - processing and they were gonna do the multi - channel stuff , but  it d it d we ended up not doing it . But  
E:  I 've seen demonstrations of the microphone arrays . It 's amazing 
B:  Yeah , it 's r 
E:  how  how they can cut out noise . 
H:  <breath> 
H:  And then they have little ones too but I mean  but they don't have our block of wood , right ? 
B:  It 's really neat stuff . And then they had the little ones , yeah . 
B:  Yeah , our block of wood is unique . But the <laugh> But the <laugh> No , there are these commercial things now you can buy that have four mikes or something and  and , uh , 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <breath> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  um  
B:  So , yeah , there 's  there 's  there 's a range of things that people do . 
E:  Huh . 
B:  Um , so if we connected up with somebody who was interested in doing that sort of thing that 's  that 's a good thing to do . I mean , whenever I 've described this to other people who are interested on the  with the acoustic side 
B:  that 's invariably the question they ask . Just like someone who is interested in the general dialogue thing will always ask 
B:  <sniff> 
B:  " um , are you recording video ? " 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Um , right ? And  and the acoustic people will always say , " well are you doing , uh , uh , array microphones ? " So it 's  
A:  Right , right . 
B:  it 's a good thing to do , 
B:  but it doesn't solve the problem of how do you solve things when there 's one mike or at best two mikes in  in this imagined PDA that we have . 
E:  <breath> 
B:  So maybe  maybe we 'll do some more of it . 
G:  Well one thing I  I mean , I don't know . I mean , I know that having an array of  I mean , I would imagine it would be more expensive to have a  
B:  <breath> 
G:  an array of microphones . But couldn't you kind of approximate the natural sis situation by just shutting off 
G:  uh , channels when you 're  later on ? I mean , it seems like if the microphones don't effect each other then couldn't you just , 
G:  you know , record them with an array and then just not use all the data ? 
H:  It 's  it 's just a lot of infrastructure that 
G:  I see . Fine . 
H:  for our particular purpose we felt we didn't need to set up . 
A:  Yeah . 
G:  OK . 
B:  Yeah , if ninety - nine percent of what you 're doing is c is shutting off most of the mikes , then going through the  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  But if you get somebody who 's  who  who has that as a primary interest then that put  then that drives it in that direction . 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  That 's right , I mean if someone  if someone came in and said we really want to do it ,  
A:  Right . 
H:  I mean , we don't care . That would be fine , <laugh> Buy more disk space . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  So to save that data you  
E:  You have to have one channel recording per mike in the array ? 
E:  Is that  
B:  Well , uh , at some level  at some level . But then , you know , there 's  it  
H:  I usually do a mix . 
B:  there 's  
E:  What you save , I mean , if you 're going to do research with it . yeah 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  There 's  I  I don't know what they 're going to do and I don't know how big their array is . Obviously if you were gonna save all of those channels for later research you 'd use up a lot of space . 
E:  Yeah . Hmm . 
H:  Well their software infrastructure had a very elaborate design for plugging in filters , and mixers , and all sorts of processing . 
B:  And , th 
H:  So that they can do stuff in real time and not save out each channel individually . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  Mmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
H:  So it was , uh  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  But I mean , uh , 
B:  for optimum flexibility later you 'd want to save each channel . But I think in practical situations 
B:  you would have some engine of some sort doing some processing to reduce this to some  to the equivalent of a single microphone that was very directional . 
E:  Uh , oh , OK , I see . 
B:  Right ? 
B:  So  
A:  I mean , it seems  
E:  Sort of saving the result of the beam - forming . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  it seems to me that there 's  
A:  you know , there are good political reasons for  
A:  for doing this , just getting the data , because there 's 
A:  a number of sites  like right now SRI is probably gonna invest a lot of internal funding into recording meetings also , which is good , 
B:  <breath> 
A:  um , but they 'll be recording with video and they 'll be  
A:  You know , it 'd be nice if we can have at least , 
A:  uh , make use of the data that we 're recording as we go since it 's sort of  this is the first site that has really collected these really impromptu meetings , 
A:  um , and just have this other information available . So , 
A:  if we can get the investment in just for the infra infrastructure and then , 
A:  I don't know , save it out or have whoever 's interested 
A:  save that data out , transfer it there , it 'd be g it 'd be good to have  have the recording . 
H:  You mean to  to actually get a microphone array and 
A:  I think . 
A:  Well , if  
H:  do that ? And video and   
A:  Even if we 're not  I 'm not sure about video . That 's sort of an  video has a little different nature since 
B:  <breath> 
A:  right n right now we 're all being recorded but we 're not being taped . 
B:  <breath> 
A:  Um , but it  definitely in the case of microphone arrays , since if there was a community interested in this , 
E:  <breath> 
A:  then  
H:  Well , but I think we need a researcher here who 's interested in it . 
B:  <breath> 
H:  To push it along . 
B:  See the problem is it  it took , uh , 
D:  <breath> 
B:  uh , it took at least six months for Dan 
B:  to get together the hardware and the software , and debug stuff in  in the microphones , and in the boxes . And it was a really big deal . 
B:  And so I think we could get 
B:  a microphone array in here pretty easily and , uh , have it mixed to  to one channel of some sort . But , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  e 
B:  I think for @ @  I mean , how we 're gonna decide  
B:  For  for maximum flexibility later you really don't want to end up with just one channel that 's pointed in the direction of the  the  the p 
B:  the person with the maximum energy or something like that . I mean , you  you want actually to  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  you want actually to have multiple channels being recorded so that you can   
B:  And to do that , it  we 're going to end up greatly increasing the disk space that we use up , 
B:  we also only have boards that will take up to sixteen channels and in  this meeting , 
B:  we 've got eight people and  and six mikes . And there we 're already using fourteen .  
H:  And we actually only have fifteen . One of them 's  
B:  E 
E:  <breath> 
D:  Yeah . 
H:  Details . But fifteen , not sixteen . <laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Well if there 's a way to say time  to sort of solve each of these f those  
A:  So suppose you can get an array in because there 's some person at Berkeley who 's interested and has some  
B:  <breath> 
A:  equipment , uh , and suppose we can  
A:  as we save it we can , you know , transfer it off to some other place that  that holds this  this data ,  
A:  who 's interested , 
A:  and even if ICSI it itself isn't . 
A:  Um , and it  it seems like as long as we can time align the beginning , do we need to mix it with the rest ? I don't know . 
A:  You know ? The - So  
B:  Yeah . So I think you 'd need a separate  a separate set up and the assumption that you could time align the two . 
A:  Yeah . 
H:  And y it 'd certainly gets skew . 
A:  I mean it 's just  it 's worth considering as sort of 
A:  once you make the up front investment  and can sort of save it out each time , and  and 
A:  not have to worry about the disk space factor , then it mi it might be worth having the data . 
B:  I 'm not so much worried about disk space actually . I mentioned that , b as a practical matter , but the real issue is 
H:  Just  
B:  that , uh , there is no way to do a recording extended to what we have now with low skew . 
B:  So  you would have a t completely separate set up , which would mean that the sampling times and so forth would be all over the place compared to this . 
A:  Right . 
B:  So it would depend on the level of pr processing you were doing later , 
B:  but if you 're d i the kind of person who 's doing array processing you actually care about funny little times . 
B:  And  and so you actually wou would want to have a completely different set up than we have , one that would go up to thirty - two channels or something . 
A:  I see . 
A:  Mmm . 
B:  So basically  or a hun Yeah . So , 
H:  Or a hundred thirty - two .  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  I 'm kinda skeptical , but um I think that  
A:  Mmm . 
B:  So , uh , I don't think we can share the resource in that way . But what we could do is if there was someone else who 's interested they could have a separate set up which they wouldn't be trying to synch with ours which might be useful for  for them . 
A:  Right , I mean at least they 'd have the data and the transcripts , and  
B:  And then we can offer up the room , <laugh>  
B:  Yeah , we can o offer the meetings , and the physical space , and  and  yeah , the transcripts , and so on . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Right . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Right , I mean , just  it 'd be nice if we have more information on the same 
G:  <mike noise> 
A:  data . You know , 
A:  and  
B:  Yeah . 
A:  But it 's  if it 's impossible or if it 's a lot of effort then you have to just balance the two , 
B:  Well I thi yeah , the thing will be , u u in  in  again , in talking to these other people to see what  you know , what  what we can do . 
A:  so  
A:  Right . 
B:  Uh , we 'll see .

E:  Is there an interest in getting video recordings for these meetings ? 
B:  <breath> Right , so we have  we  <breath-laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  I mean 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  t 
H:  Yes , absolutely . But it 's exactly the same problem , 
D:  <breath> 
H:  that 
H:  you have an infrastructure problem , you have a problem with people not wanting to be video taped , and you have the problem that no one who 's currently involved in the project is really hot to do it . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  <breath> 
E:  So there 's not enough interest to overcome all of  
H:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <breath> 
A:  Right . Internally , but I know there is interest from other 
A:  places that are interested in looking at meeting data and having the video . So it 's just  
B:  <breath> 
D:  <mouth> <breath> 
G:  Yeah , w although I  m <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  I  I have to u u mention the human subjects problems ,  that i increase with video . 
A:  Right , that 's true . 
B:  Yeah , so it 's , uh , people  people getting shy about it . There 's this human subjects problem . 
G:  Yeah . 
B:  There 's the fact that then um , 
B:  if  i I I 've heard comments about this before , " why don't you just put on a video camera ? " But 
E:  <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
B:  you know , it 's sort of like saying , " uh , well we 're primarily interested in  in some dialogue things , 
B:  uh , but , uh , why don't we just throw a microphone out there . " I mean , 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  the thing is , 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  once you actually have serious interest in any of these things then you actually have to put a lot of effort in . 
E:  Mmm .  
B:  And , uh , you really want to do it right . So I think 
E:  <breath> 
H:  I know . Yep . 
B:  NIST or LDC , or somebody like that I think is much better shape to do all that . We  there will be other meeting recordings . We won't be the only place doing meeting recordings . We are doing what we 're doing . 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
E:  <breath> 
B:  And , uh , hopefully it 'll be useful .

B:  OK . 
D:  <breath> 
B:  Uh , transcriptions . 
G:  Transcriptions , OK . Um , I thought about  there are maybe three 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  aspects of this . So first of all , um , I 've got eight transcribers . 
B:  <loud outbreath>  
G:  Uh , seven of them are linguists . 
G:  One of them is a graduate student in psychology . 
B:  <sniff> 
B:  <breath> 
G:  Um , 
F:  <mike noise> 
G:  Each  I gave each of them , uh , their own data set . Two of them have already finished the data sets . 
G:  And  the meetings run , you know , let 's say an hour . Sometimes as man much as an hour and a half . 
E:  How big is the data set ? 
G:  Oh , it 's  what I mean is one meeting . Each  each person got their own meeting . I didn't want to have any conflicts of , you know , of  of 
E:  Ah , OK . 
G:  when to stop transcribing this one or  So I wanted to keep it 
G:  clear whose data were whose , and  and  
G:  and so  And , uh , meetings , you know , I think that they 're  they go as long as a  
E:  Uh - huh . 
G:  almost two hours in some  in some cases . So , you know , that means  you know , if we 've got two already finished and they 're working on  
G:  Uh , right now all eight of them have differe uh , uh , additional data sets . That means potentially as many as ten might be finished by the end of the month . 
G:  Hope so . But the pre - segmentation really helps a huge amount . And , uh , also Dan Ellis 's innovation of the , uh  the multi - channel to here really helped a r a lot 
E:  Wow . 
C:  OK . 
G:  in terms of clearing  clearing up h hearings that involve overlaps . But , um , 
G:  just out of curiosity I asked one of them how long  it was taking her , one of these two who has already finished her data set . She said it takes about , 
G:  uh , sixty minutes transcription for every five minutes of real time . So it 's about twelve to one , which is what we were thinking . 
H:  or Yep . It 's pretty good . 
G:  It 's well in the range . 
G:  OK . Uh , these still , when they 're finished , um , that means that they 're finished with their pass through . They still need to be edited and all but  
topic_description:	update on transcriptions


G:  But it 's word level , speaker change , the things that were mentioned . OK , now I wanted to mention the , um , 
G:  teleconference I had with , uh , Jonathan Fiscus . We spoke for an hour and a half 
H:  Hmm . 
G:  and , um , had an awful lot of things in common . He , um , 
C:  <mike noise> 
G:  um , he in indicated to me that they 've  that he 's been , 
C:  <breath> 
G:  uh , looking , uh , uh , spending a lot of time with  I 'm not quite sure the connection ,  but spending a lot of time with the ATLAS system . 
G:  And I guess that  I mean , I  I need to read up on that . And there 's a web site that has lots of papers . But it looks to me like that 's 
G:  the name that has developed for the system that Bird and Liberman developed  for the annotated  graphs approach . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  So what he wants me to do and what we  what we 
G:  will do and  uh , is to provide them with the u already transcribed meeting 
G:  for him to be able to experiment with in this ATLAS 
G:  System . And they do have some sort of software , at least that 's my impression , related to ATLAS and that he wants to experiment with taking our data and putting them in that format , and see how that works out . 
G:  I  I  I explained to him in  in detail the , uh , conventions that we 're using here in this  
G:  in this word level transcript . And , um , 
G:  you know , I  I explained , you know , the reasons that  that we were not 
G:  coding more elaborately and  and the focus on reliability . 
G:  He expressed a lot of interest in reliability . It 's like he 's  he 's really up on these things . He 's  he 's very  
G:  Um , independently he asked , " well what about reliability ? " So , <breath> he 's interested in the consistency of the encoding and that sort of thing . OK , um  
A:  Sorry , can you explain what the ATLAS  I 'm not familiar with this ATLAS system . 
G:  Well , you know , at this point I think  
G:  Uh , well Adam 's read more  in more detail than I have on this . I need to acquaint myself more with it . But , um , 
G:  there  there is a way of viewing  Uh , whenever you have coding categories , um , and you 're dealing with 
G:  uh , a taxonomy , then you can have branches that  that have 
G:  alternative , uh , choices that you could use for each  
G:  each of them . And it just ends up looking like a graphical representation . 
H:  Is  is  
H:  Is ATLAS the  his annotated transcription 
H:  graph stuff ? 
G:  <inbreath>  
H:  I don't remember the acronym . The  the one  the  what I think you 're referring to , they  they have this concept of an an annotated transcription graph representation . 
G:  Yeah . 
H:  And that 's basically what I based the format that I did  
A:  Oh . Oh . 
H:  I based it on their work almost directly , in combination with the TEI stuff . And so it 's very , very similar . And so it 's  it 's a 
H:  data representation and a set of tools for manipulating transcription graphs of various types . 
E:  Is this the project that 's sort of , uh , between , uh , NIST and  and , uh , a couple of other places ? The  the  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Including LDC .  I think so . 
H:  Yep . 
E:  Yeah , y right , OK . 
G:  Mm - hmm . Then there 's their web site that has lots of papers . And I looked through them and they mainly had to do with this , um , 
G:  this , uh , tree structure , uh , annotated tree diagram thing . 
A:  Mmm . 
G:  So , um , um  and , you know , in terms of like the conventions that I 'm a that I 've adopted , 
G:  it  there  there 's no conflict at all . 
H:  Right . 
G:  And he was , you know , very interested . And , " oh , and how 'd you handle this ? " And I said , " well , you know , this way " and  
E:  <breath> 
G:  And  and we had a really nice conversation . 
topic_description:	teleconference with John Fiscus, ATLAS system


G:  Um , OK , now I also wanted to say in a different  a different 
G:  direction is , 
G:  Brian Kingsbury . So , um , I corresponded briefly with him . I , 
G:  uh , c I  He still has an account here . I told him he could SSH on and use multi - trans , and have a look at the already done , uh , transcription . And he  and he did . 
G:  And what he said was that , um , what they 'll be providing is  
G:  will not be as fine grained in terms of the time information . 
G:  And , um , that 's , uh  You know , I need to get back to him and  and , uh , you know , explore that a little bit more and see what they 'll be giving us in specific , but I just haven't had time yet . 
A:  Hmm . 
E:  The p the people  
G:  Sorry , what ? 
E:  The  the folks that they 're , uh , subcontracting out the transcription to , are they like court reporters or  
G:  Yes . 
G:  <breath> Apparently  Well , I get the sense they 're kind of like that . Like it 's like a pool of  of somewhat uh , secretarial  
G:  I don't think that they 're court reporters . I don't think they have the special keyboards and that  and that type of training . I  I get the sense they 're more secretarial . And that , um , 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Hmm . 
G:  uh , what they 're doing is giving them  
E:  Like medical transcriptionist type people  
H:  Nu - it 's mostly  it 's for their speech recognition 
E:  <breath> 
H:  products , 
G:  Yep . 
E:  But aren't  they 're  
H:  that they 've hired these people to do . 
E:  Oh , so they 're hiring them , they 're coming . It 's not a service they send the tapes out to . 
H:  Well they  they do send it out but my understanding is that that 's all this company does is transcriptions for IBM for their speech product . 
B:  <breath> 
E:  Ah ! Oh . OK . 
E:  I gotcha . 
H:  So most of it 's ViaVoice , people reading their training material for that . 
E:  I see . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  I see . 
G:  Up to now it 's been monologues , uh , as far my understood . And  and what they 're doing is Brian himself downloaded  So  
H:  Yep , exactly . Yep . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <breath> 
G:  So , um , Adam sent them a CD and Brian himself downloaded  
G:  uh , cuz , you know , I mean , we wanted to have it so that they were in familiar f terms with what they wanted to do .  
D:  <mike noise> 
D:  <breath> 
G:  He downloaded  
G:  from the CD onto audio tapes . And apparently he did it 
G:  one channel per audio tape . So each of these people is  transcribing from one channel . 
H:  Right . 
G:  And then what he 's going to do is check it , 
E:  Oh . 
G:  a before they go be beyond the first one . 
B:  <breath> 
G:  Check it and , you know , adjust it , and all that . 
G:  It 's very  a real benefit having Brian involved because of his knowledge of what the  how the data need to be used and so what 's useful to have in the format . 
H:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	correspondence with Brian Kingsbury, checking transcriptions


E:  So each person gets one of these channels  
H:  Right . 
B:  So if they hear something off in the distance they don't  they just go  
E:  OK . 
H:  Well , but that 's OK , because , you know , you 'll do all them and then combine them .

A:  Yeah . 
E:  Well if you 're tran if you got that channel right there  
H:  No , no . We 're talking about close talking , not the  not the desktop . 
C:  Yeah . 
D:  No , close talk . 
B:  Are you ? 
G:  Yes . 
H:  I sure hope so . It 'd be really foolish to do otherwise . 
G:  Well I th I think so . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  Yeah , I  I would think that it would be kind of hard to come out with  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  I  I think it 's sort of hard just playing the  you know , just having played the individual 
A:  files . And I  I mean , I know you . I know what your voice sounds like . I 'm sort of familiar with  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh , it 's pretty hard to follow , especially 
H:  One side .  
G:  I agree . 
A:  there are a lot of words that are so reduced phonetically that make sense when you know what the person was saying before . 
E:  Yeah , that 's  
C:  Yeah . 
G:  And especially since a lot of these  
A:  Uh , it sort of depends where you are in  
D:  Yeah . 
H:  But I mean we had this  we 've had this discussion many times . And the answer is we don't actually know the answer because we haven't tried both ways . 
G:  Yeah , we have . 
G:  Well , except I can say that my transcribers use the mixed signal mostly 
H:  <breath> So . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  unless there 's a huge disparity in terms of the volume on  on the mix . 
E:  Right . 
G:  In which case , you know , they  they wouldn't be able to catch anything except the prominent  channel , then they 'll switch between .  But  but really  
C:  <laugh> 
H:  Right . 
H:  Well I think that  that might change if you wanted really fine time markings . 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  <breath> Well , OK . Yeah , well  
H:  So . 
B:  But they 're not giving f really fine time markings . 
H:  Right . 
A:  Actually , are th so <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  are they giving any time markings ? In other words , if  
G:  Well , I have to ask him . And that 's  that 's my email to him . That needs to be forthcoming . But  but the , uh  I did want to say that 
A:  Yeah . Cuz  OK . 
E:  <breath> 
G:  it 's hard to follow one channel of a conversation even if you know the people , 
G:  and if you 're dealing furthermore with highly abstract network concepts you 've never heard of  So , you know , one of these people was  was 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  transcribing the , uh , networks group talk and she said , 
G:  " I don't really know what a lot of these abbreviations are , "  <laugh> " but I just put them in parentheses cuz that 's the  that 's the convention and I just "  Cuz you know , if you don't know  
H:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <inbreath> 
H:  Oh , I 'd be curious to  to look at that . 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  Just out of curiosity , I mean  
H:  They also all have h heavy accents . The networks group meetings are all  
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah .

E:  Given all of the effort that 
E:  is going on here in transcribing why do we have I B M doing it ? 
H:  <laugh> 
E:  Why not just do it all ourselves ? 
B:  Um , it 's historical . I mean , <laugh> uh , some point ago we thought that

H:  <laugh>

B:  So , that was a contribution they could make . Uh 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  in terms of time , money , you know ? And it still might be a good thing but

B:  Yeah , so . 
E:  Hmm . 
B:  We 'll see . I mean , I think , th you know , they  they  they 've proceeded along a bit . Let 's see what comes out of it , and  and , uh , you know , have some more discussions with them . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
topic_description:	outsourcing transcriptions to IBM


H:  So , um , Liz , with  with the SRI recognizer ,  can it make use of 
H:  some time marks ? 
A:  OK , so this is a , um , 
H:  I  I guess I don't know what that means . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  and actually I should say this is what Don has b uh , he 's already been really helpful in , uh , chopping up these  So  so first of all you  
A:  um , I mean , for the SRI front - end , 
H:  <mike noise> 
A:  we really need to chop things up into pieces that are f not too huge . Um , but second of all , uh  
B:  <breath> 
A:  in general because some of these channels ,  I 'd say , like , 
A:  I don't know , at least half of them probably  on average are g are ha are  
B:  <breath> 
A:  have a lot of cross - ta sorry , some of the segments have a lot of cross - talk . 
E:  <breath> 
A:  <breath> Um , it 's good to get sort of short 
A:  segments if you 're gonna do recognition , especially forced alignment . So , 
A:  uh , Don has been taking a first stab actually using Jane 's 
A:  first  the fir the meeting that Jane transcribed which we did have some problems with , and Thilo , uh , I think 
A:  told me why this was , but that people were switching microphones around  in the very beginning ,  so  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  the SRI re 
C:  No , th 
C:  Yeah . No . They  they were not switching them but what they were  they were adjusting them , so . 
A:  and they  
A:  They were not  
F:  Mmm . 
A:  @ @ 
H:  Adjusting . Oh . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  And aft after a minute or so it 's  it 's way better . So  
A:  So we have to sort of normalize  the front - end and so forth , and have these small segments . So 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yep . 
E:  <breath> 
B:  <breath> 
A:  we 've taken that and chopped it into pieces based always on your  
A:  your , um , cuts that you made on the mixed signal . 
G:  <4 taps on mike> 
A:  And so that every  every speaker has the same cuts . And if they have speech in it we run it through . And if they don't have speech in it we don't run it through . And we base 
A:  that knowledge on the transcription . 
H:  On  Just on the marks . Right ? 
E:  <long breath> 
A:  Um , the problem is if we have no time marks , 
A:  then for forced alignment we actually don't know where  
A:  you know , in the signal the transcriber heard that word . And so  
H:  Oh , I see , it 's for the length . I see . 
A:  I mean , if  if it 's a whole conversation and we get a long , uh , you know , 
A:  par paragraph of  of talk , uh , I don't know how they do this . Um , we actually don't know which piece goes 
A:  where . And , um , I think with  
H:  I understand . 
E:  Well you would need to  like a forced alignment before you did the chopping , right ? 
G:  <mike spikes> 
G:  <mouth> <breath>  
A:  <breath> No , we used the fact that  So when Jane transcribes them the way she has transcribers doing this , whether it 's with the pre - segmentation or not , 
D:  <breath> 
H:  It 's already chunked .  
A:  they have a chunk and then they transcribes  the words in the chunk . And maybe they choose the chunk or now they use a 
A:  pre - segmentation and then correct it if necessary . But there 's first a chunk and then a transcription . Then a chunk , then a transcription . That 's great , 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  cuz the recognizer can  
H:  Uh , it 's all pretty good sized for the recognizer also . 
A:  Right , and it  it helps that it 's made based on 
G:  Good . Oh good . 
A:  sort of heuristics and human ear I think . 
A:  Th - but there 's going to be a real problem , uh , even if we chop up based on speech silence these , 
A:  uh , the transcripts from I B M , we don't actually know where the words were , which segment they belonged to . So that 's sort of what I 'm  worried about 
H:  Right . 
E:  Why not do a  
E:  a  a forced alignment ? 
A:  right now . 
H:  That 's what she 's saying , is that you can't . 
A:  <breath> If you do a forced alignment on something really  well even if you do it on something really long you need to know  
H:  Got uh six sixty minutes of  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  you can always chop it up but you need to have a reference of which words went with which , uh , chop . <laugh> So  
G:  Now wasn't  I thought that one of the proposals was that IBM was going to do an initial forced alignment , after they  
H:  Yeah , but  
B:  I  I think that they are , um , 
H:  We 'll have to talk to Brian . 
B:  yeah , I 'm sure they will and so we  we have to have a dialogue with them about it . I mean , it sounds like 
A:  Yeah . Maybe they have some  you know , maybe actually there is some , even if they 're not fine grained , maybe the transcribers  
G:  OK . 
B:  Liz has some concerns and  
A:  uh , I don't know , maybe it 's saved out in pieces or  or something . That would help . But , 
G:  Yeah . 
A:  uh , it 's just an unknown right now . 
G:  Yeah . I  I need to  to write to him . I just  you know , it 's like I got over - taxed with the timing . 
A:  So . 
A:  Right . But the  it is true that the segments  I haven't tried the segments that Thilo gave you  but the segments that in your first meeting are great . I mean , that 's  that 's a good length . 
G:  <mike spikes> 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  A good size . Good . 
A:  Right , cuz  y yeah . 
G:  Well , I  I was thinking it would be fun to  to  uh , uh , if  if you  wouldn't mind ,  <laugh> to give us a pre - segmentation .  Uh , maybe you have one already of that first m of the meeting that 
C:  Yeah . 
G:  uh , the first transcribed meeting ,  the one that I transcribed .  Do you have a  could you generate a pre - segmentation ? 
C:  Um , I 'm sure I have some but  but that 's the one where we 're , um , trai training on , so that 's a little bit  
H:  February sixteenth I think . 
H:  Oh . <laugh> 
G:  Oh , I see . Oh , darn . Of course , of course , of course . Yeah , OK . 
C:  It 's a little bit at odd to  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  And actually as you get transcripts just , um , for new meetings ,  
G:  Uh - huh . 
A:  um , we can try  I mean , 
A:  the  the more data we have to try the  the alignments on , um , the better . So it 'd be 
A:  good for  just to know as transcriptions are coming through the pipeline from the transcribers , just to sort of  we 're playing around with sort of 
B:  <breath> 
A:  uh , parameters f on the recognizer , cuz that would be helpful . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Excellent , good . 
A:  Especially as you get , en more voices . The first meeting had I think just four people , yeah . 
C:  Four speakers , yeah . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <breath> Yeah , Liz and I spoke d w at some length on Tuesday and  and I  and I was planning to do just a  a preliminary look over of the two that are finished and then give them to you . 
A:  Oh , great , great . 
G:  Yeah . 
A:  So . 
B:  That 's great . 
topic_description:	pre-segmentation issues


B:  <breath> I guess the other thing , I  I can't remember if we discussed this in the meeting but , uh , I know you and I talked about this a little bit , 
A:  <breath> 
B:  there was an issue of , uh , suppose we get in the , uh , I guess it 's enviable position although maybe it 's just saying where the weak link is in the chain , 
E:  <breath> 
B:  uh , where we  we , uh  
B:  uh , 
B:  we have all the data transcribed and we have these transcribers and we were  we 're  the  
B:  we 're still a bit slow on feeding  at that point we 've caught up and the  the  the , uh , the weak link is  is recording meetings . <laugh> OK , um , 
A:  <breath> 
B:  two questions come , is you know what  how  how do we  
B:  uh , it 's not really a problem at the moment cuz we haven't reached that point but how do we step out the recorded meetings ? 
B:  And the other one is , um , uh , is there some good use that we can make of the transcribers to do other things ? 
B:  So , um , I  I can't remember how much we talked about this in this meeting but there was  
G:  <inbreath>  
H:  We had spoken with them about it .  
G:  And there is one use that  that also we discussed which was when , uh , Dave finishes the  and maybe it 's already finished  the  the 
B:  <breath> 
G:  modification to multi - trans which will allow fine grained encoding of overlaps . 
G:  Uh , then it would be very  these people would be very good to shift over to finer grain encoding of overlaps . It 's just a matter of , you know , providing   So if right now you have 
G:  two overlapping segments in the same time bin , well with  with the improvement in the database  in  in the , uh , sorry , in the interface , it 'd be possible to , um , 
G:  you know , just do a click and drag thing , and get the  uh , the specific place of each of those , the time tag associated with the beginning and end of  of each segment . 
B:  Right , so I think we talking about three level  three things . One  one was 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Yeah . 
B:  uh , we had s had some discussion in the past about some very high level 
G:  The types of overlaps  
B:  labelings , types of overlaps , and so forth that  that someone could do . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
topic_description:	assigning additional tasks to transcriber pool


B:  Second was , uh , somewhat lower level just doing these more precise timings . And the third one is  is , uh , just a completely wild hair brained idea that I have which is that , um , if , uh  
B:  if we have time and people are able to do it , 
B:  to take some subset of the data and do some very fine grained analysis of the speech . For instance , uh , marking in some overlapping  
B:  potentially overlapping fashion , uh , the value of , uh , ar articulatory features . 
H:  <breath> 
G:  Yeah .  
B:  You know , just sort of say , OK , it 's voiced from here to here , there 's  it 's nasal from here to here , and so forth . Um , as opposed to doing 
H:  Hmm ! 
B:  phonetic  uh , you know , phonemic and the phonetic analysis , and , uh , assuming , uh , articulatory feature values for those  
C:  <breath-laugh> 
H:  <breath> 
B:  those things . Um , obviously that 's extremely time - consuming . Uh  
E:  That would be really valuable I think . 
B:  but , uh , we could do it on some small subset . 
G:  Also if you 're dealing with consonants that would be easier than vowels , wouldn't it ? I mean , I would think that  
G:  that , uh , being able to code that there 's a  a fricative extending from here to here would be a lot easier than classifying precisely which vowel that was . 
H:  Which one . 
A:  Mmm . 
G:  I think vowels  vowels are I think harder . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Well , yeah , but I think also it 's just the issue that  that when you look at the  u w u u when you look at Switchboard for instance 
E:  <breath> 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  very close up there are places where whether it 's a consonant or a vowel you still have trouble calling it a particular phone 
G:  Mm - hmm , OK . Yeah , I 'm sure . Uh , yeah , I  I know . 
H:  Yeah , but  but just saying what the  
B:  at that point because it 's  you know , there 's this movement from here to here and  and  and it 's  
A:  Right . 
E:  You 're saying r sort of remove the high level constraints and go bottom - up . 
B:  so I 
H:  Yep , just features . 
B:  <breath> Yeah , describe  describe it . Now I 'm suggesting articulatory features . Maybe there 's  there 's even a better way to do it but it  but  
E:  Then just say  
A:  Mmm . 
B:  but that 's , you know , sort of a traditional way of describing these things , 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  um , and  
B:  uh , I mean , actually this might be a g neat thing to talk to  
G:  That 's nice .  
E:  Acoustic features versus psychological categories . Yeah . 
B:  Sort of . I mean , it 's still  
G:  Yeah . 
B:  some sort of categories but  but something that allows for overlapping 
A:  <breath> 
H:  <breath> 
B:  change of these things and then this would give some more 
H:  <breath> 
B:  ground work for people who were building statistical models that allowed for overlapping changes , different timing changes as opposed to just 
B:  " click , you 're now in this state , which corresponds to this speech sound " and so on . 
E:  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
A:  So this is like gestural  uh , these g Right . 
D:  <breath> 
B:  Yeah , something like that . I mean , actually if we get into that it might be good to , uh , uh , haul 
A:  OK . 
B:  John Ohala into this and ask his  his views on it I think . 
H:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  But is  is the goal there to have this on meeting data , like 
G:  Excellent . 
A:  so that you can do far field studies  of those gestures or  
A:  um , 
B:  <breath> 
A:  or is it because you think there 's a different kind of actual production in meetings  that people use ? Or  ?  
B:  <breath> No , I think  I think it 's  for  for  for that purpose I 'm just 
B:  viewing meetings as being a  a neat way to get people talking naturally . 
B:  And then you have i and then  and then it 's natural in all senses , in the sense that you have microphones that are at a distance that 
E:  Just a source of data ? 
A:  I see . 
B:  you know , one might have , and you have the close mikes , and you have people talking naturally . And the overlap is just indicative of the fact that people are talking naturally , right ? So  
A:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  so I think that given that it 's that kind of corpus , if it 's gonna be a very useful corpus 
H:  <breath> 
B:  um , if you say w OK , we 've limited the use by some of our , uh , uh , censored choices , 
E:  <breath> 
B:  we don't have the video , we don't  and so forth ,  
B:  but there 's a lot of use that we could make of it by expanding the annotation choices . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  And , uh , most of the things we 've talked about have been fairly high level , and 
B:  being kind of a bottom - up person I thought maybe we 'd , <laugh> do some of the others . Yeah . 
H:  Hmm . 
G:  It 's a nice balance . That would be really nice to offer those things with that wide range . Really nice . 
A:  Right . Yeah , that would be good . 
B:  <breath> 
A:  Right . 
B:  Yeah and hopefully someone would make use of it . I mean , people didn't  
G:  Yeah . 
B:  uh , I mean , people have made a lot of use of  of TIMIT and , uh w due to its markings , and then  the Switchboard transcription thing , well I think has been very useful for a lot of people . So  
H:  Right . 
A:  That 's true . 
topic_description:	fine-grained acoustic tagging


A:  I guess I wanted to , um , 
G:  Cool . 
D:  <breath> 
A:  sort of make a pitch for trying to collect more meetings .  Um , 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  <breath> I actually I talked to Chuck Fillmore and I think they 've 
B:  <breath> 
A:  what , vehemently said no before but this time he wasn't vehement and he said 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  you know , " well , Liz , come to the meeting tomorrow and try to convince people " . So I 'm gonna  try . Go to their meeting tomorrow and see 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  if we can try , uh , to convince them because they have  
G:  Good .  
B:  <breath> Cuz they have something like three or four different meetings , right ? 
A:  And they have very interesting meetings from the point of view of 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <breath> 
A:  a very different type of  of talk than we have here and definitely than the front end meeting , probably . 
E:  <clears throat> <breath> 
D:  Talk  
G:  <mike spikes> 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  Um  
E:  You mean in terms of the topic  topics ? 
A:  Well , yes and in terms of the  
A:  the fact that they 're describing abstract things  and , uh , just dialogue - wise , right . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Um , so I 'll try . And then the other thing is , 
E:  <breath> 
B:  <breath> 
A:  I don't know if this is at all useful , but I asked Lila if I can 
E:  <breath> 
A:  maybe go around and talk to the different 
G:  <mike spikes> 
A:  departments in this building  
B:  Yes . 
A:  to see if there 's any groups that , for a free lunch , if we can still offer that ,  might be willing  
E:  <breath> 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  You mean non - ICSI ? 
B:  Great . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  non - ICSI , non - academic , you know , like government people , I don't know . So . 
H:  Yeah , I guess you  you can try but  
D:  <laugh> 
H:  The problem is so much of their stuff is confidential . 
H:  It would be very hard for them . 
G:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  Also it does seem like it takes us way out of the demographic . I mean , it seems like we  we had this idea before of having like linguistics students brought down for free lunches and that 's a nice idea . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Is  is it in these departments ? 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  Well , tha I think that 's her point . 
A:  Right , and then we could also  we might try advertising again because I think it 'd be good if  if we can get a few different 
E:  <breath> 
G:  Yeah . 
A:  sort of non - internal types of meetings and just also more data . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <breath> 
H:  And I think , uh , if we could get  
E:  <breath> Does  does John Ohala have weekly phonetics lab meetings ? 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <inbreath>  
A:  So . 
A:  So I actually wrote to him and he answered , " great , that sounds really interesting " . But I never heard back because we didn't actually advertise openly . We a 
A:  I mean w 
A:  I told  I d asked him privately . 
A:  Um , and it is a little bit of a trek for campus  folks . 
H:  Yeah . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  <breath> 
H:  You might give them a free lunch . But , um , 
A:  Um , so it 's still worthwhile . 
H:  it would be nice if we got someone other than me who knew how to set it up and could do the recording so u I didn't have to 
A:  So  
A:  Exactly , and  and  
C:  <laugh> 
G:  Yeah . That 's right . 
H:  do it each time . 
A:  and I was thinking  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  He - he 's supposed  he 's supposed to be trained <laugh> to do it . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah .  
C:  <laugh>

A:  Plus we could also get 
H:  OK , next week  you 're going to do it all . 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  you know , a s a student . And I 'm willing to try to learn . I mean , I 'm  
D:  <breath> 
A:  I would do my best . <laugh> 
G:  <mike noise> 
A:  Um , the other thing is that  
H:  It 's not that hard . 
A:  there was a number of things at the transcription side 
A:  that , um , 
A:  transcribers can do , like dialogue act tagging ,  disfluency tagging , um , 
B:  <breath> 
A:  things that are in the speech that are actually 
A:  something we 're y  working on for language modeling . And Mari 's also interested in it , Andreas as well . So if you wanna 
G:  <mike spikes> 
A:  process a utterance and the first thing they say is , " well " , and that " well " is coded as some kind of interrupt 
A:  u 
A:  tag . Uh , and things like that , um , 
G:  Of course some of that can be li done lexically . And I also  they are doing disfluency tagging 
A:  th 
A:  A lot of it can be done  
G:  to some degree already . Yeah . 
A:  Great . So a  a lot of this kind of

G:  They 'd be really good . They 're  they 're very  they 're very consistent . Uh , I wanted to  whi while we 're  Uh , so , to return just briefly to this question of more meeting data , um  
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  That 'd be great . 
D:  <breath> 
G:  I have two questions . One of them is , um , Jerry Feldman 's group , they  they , uh , are they  
G:  I know that they recorded one meeting . Are they willing ? 
B:  I think they 're open to it . I think , you know , all these things are  I think there 's  
A:  Oh , yeah . 
B:  we should go beyond , uh , ICSI but , I mean , there 's a lot of stuff happening at ICSI that we 're not getting now that we could . 
B:  So it 's just  Yeah . So the  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh , that we could . OK . I thought that all these people had sort of said " no " twice already . If that 's not the case then  
B:  No , no . No . So th there was the thing in Fillmore 's group but even there he hadn't  
B:  <breath> What he 'd said " no " to was for the main meeting . But they have several smaller meetings a week , 
E:  <breath> 
H:  So . 
B:  and , uh , the notion was raised before that that could happen . And it just , you know  it just didn't come together but  
E:  <breath> 
A:  Just  OK . 
E:  Well , and  and the other thing too is when they originally said " no " they didn't know about this post - editing 
A:  <breath> 
E:  capability thing . 
G:  Oh .  
A:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . <breath> Yeah . 
G:  That 's important .  
A:  Right . That was a big 
E:  So . 
B:  <breath> 
A:  fear . 
B:  Yeah , so I mean there 's possibilities there .  I think Jerry 's group , yes . Uh , there 's  there 's , uh , the networks group , uh , I don't  Do they still meeting regularly or  ?  
A:  OK . 
H:  Well , I don't know if they meet regularly or not but they are no longer recording . <laugh> 
B:  <breath> But I mean , ha ha have they said they don't want to anymore or  ?  
H:  Um , ugh , what was his name ? 
B:  Uh , i i 
G:  Joe Sokol ? 
H:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
H:  When  with him gone , 
H:  it sorta trickled off . They  and they stopped  
B:  <breath> OK , so they 're down to three or four people but the thing is three or four people is OK . 
H:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Yep . 
G:  We might be able to get the administration  
H:  Well he was sort of my contact , so I just need to find out who 's running it now . So . 
B:  OK . 
G:  I see that Lila has a luncheon meeting in here periodically . I don't know  
A:  Yeah , I mean , it  One thing that would be nice and this  it sounds bizarre but , 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  I 'd really like to look at  to get some meetings where there 's a little bit of heated discussion , like ar arguments and  or emotion , and things like that .  
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  And so I was thinking if there 's any like Berkeley political groups or something . I mean , that 'd be perfect . Some group , " yes , we must  " <laugh> 
F:  <breath> 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  Who 's willing to get recorded and distributed ? 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Well , you know , something  Um  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , I don't think the more political argumentative ones would be willing to  
C:  Yeah . <laugh>

D:  Is  
H:  <laugh>

G:  Well there was this K P F A idea , but  
A:  pursuing . 
H:  No that 's  
B:  <mouth> <breath> Yeah , th there 's a problem there in terms of , uh , the 
G:  OK . 
H:  Legal . 
B:  um 
B:  commercial value of  of st uh , it  it  it  it turned out to be a bit of a problem . 
G:  OK , OK . 
B:  <laugh> It 's pretty tough , uh , this group . Yeah . So , uh , what about  what about people who involved in some artistic endeavor ? I mean , film - making or something like that . You 'd think like they would be  
F:  <laugh> God .  
A:  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . 
C:  Mmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  <mike spikes> 
D:  <laugh> A film - maker . 
A:  Exactly , that 's what I was  something where there  there is actually discussion where there 's no right or wrong answer but  
A:  but it 's a matter of opinion kind of thing .  
H:  <breath> 
G:  It 's be fun .

H:  Got a ticket .  
B:  Yeah , I know you are . 
H:  <breath>

D:  Yeah . 
G:  <breath> 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  if you know any groups that are m you know , 
H:  Well I had asked some  some of the students at the business school . I could  
D:  Yeah . 
F:  <breath> I know

H:  The Business school . 
B:  <laugh> 
H:  Uh , the business school might be good . I actually spoke with some students up there and they  they  they expressed willingness back when they thought they would be doing more stuff with speech . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh , OK . 
G:  <mike spikes> 
F:  <sigh> 
A:  Really . 
H:  But when they lost interest in speech they also  
E:  <breath> 
H:  stopped answering my email about other stuff , so .  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Hmm . 
F:  I  
B:  They could have a discussion about te

topic_description:	collecting more meeting data


G:  <breath> And I had one other  one other aspect of this which is , um , uh , uh , Jonathan Fiscus expressed 
A:  Or  
G:  primar uh y a major interest in having 
G:  meetings which were all English speakers . Now he wasn't trying to shape us in terms of what we gather but 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  that 's what he wanted me to show him . 
G:  So I 'm giving him our , um  our initial meeting because he asked for all English . And I think we don't have a lot of all English meetings right now . 
E:  Did he mean , uh  did he mean and non - British ? 
B:  Of all  all nat all native speakers . 
H:  Well  
C:  The all native . 
G:  That 's what I mean , yeah . 
H:  Well if he meant and non - British I think we have zero . 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  He doesn't care . No . Eh , well , British is OK . 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  But  but  
E:  He said British was OK ? 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  Sure , sure , sure . Yeah . 
H:  British is English ?  <laugh> 
B:  Why ? 
G:  Different varieties of English . 
C:  Ooo , ooo .  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Well , I don't  I don't  I don't think  if he didn't say that  
D:  <laugh> 
G:  Native speaking . Native speaking English . 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  I bet he meant native speaking American . 
G:  Yes . 
B:  I bet he did . 
C:  American English ? 
G:  Oh , really . 
B:  <breath> 
H:  So , why would he care ? 
E:  Knowing the application  <laugh> 
B:  I remember wh I I remember a study  
A:  That 's  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> English , <laugh> 
A:  I was thinking , knowing the , uh , n National Institute of Standards , it is all  
B:  I remember a study that BBN did where they trained on  this was in Wall Street Journal days or something ,  they trained on American English and then they tested on , uh , different native speakers from different areas . 
B:  And , uh , 
B:  uh , the worst match was people whose native tongue was Mandarin Chinese . 
B:  The second worst was British English . <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> That 's funny . <breath> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  So h it 's , you know , t 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  Alright . And so that would make sense . I didn't have the context of that . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  the  the  the  German was much better , it was Swiss w <laugh> Yeah , so it 's  so I think , you know , if he 's  if he 's thinking in terms of recognition kind of technology I  I  I think he would probably want , uh 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <breath> Ooo , ooo .  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath> American English , yeah . It  it  yeah , unless we 're gonna train with a whole bunch of  
H:  I wonder if we have any . 
G:  All America , OK . 
G:  <inbreath> 
G:  I think that the  Feldman 's meetings tend to be more that way , aren't they ? I mean , I sort of feel like they have  
H:  Maybe . Maybe . 
B:  I think so , yeah . 
A:  Yeah , mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Mmm . 
H:  And maybe there are a few of  with us where it was  you know , Dan wasn't there and before Jose started coming , and

B:  I had as my fourth thing here processing of wave forms . What did we mean by that ? Remember @ @ ? 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  Yeah . 
H:  Uh , Liz wanted to talk about 
G:  Pre - processing . 
H:  methods of improving accuracy by doing pre - processing . 
A:  Well I think that  that was just sort of  I I already asked Thilo but 
B:  Oh , you already did that . 
A:  that , um , it would be helpful if I can stay in the loop somehow with , 
A:  um , people who are doing any kind of post - processing , whether it 's 
B:  <breath> 
A:  to separate speakers or to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , or both , 
A:  um , that we can sort of try out as we 're running recognition . 
A:  Um , so , i is that  Who else is work I guess Dan Ellis and you 
C:  Dan , yeah . 
H:  Yep . 
topic_description:	post-processing of wave forms


B:  Yeah , and Dave uh  Gel - Gelbart again , he 's  he 's interested in  in fact we 're look starting to look at some echo cancellation kind of things . 
A:  and Dave . 
C:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . Right . 
B:  Which uh  
H:  I am not sure how much that 's 
H:  an issue with the close talking mikes , but who knows ?  
B:  Hmm ? 
B:  Well , let 's  w i isn't that what  what you want  
B:  t 
A:  I don't know . I 'm bad  <laugh> It 's like   <laugh> like   
D:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  No , so  No , i w wha what you  what you want  when you 're saying improving the wave form you want the close talking microphone to be better . Right ? 
H:  Right . 
B:  And the question is to w to what extent is it getting hurt 
B:  by , uh  by any room acoustics or is it just  uh , given that it 's close it 's not a problem ? 
B:  Uh  
A:  It doesn't seem like big room acoustics problems to my ear but I 'm not an expert . It seems like a problem with cross - talk . 
B:  OK , so it 's  
H:  e I bet with the lapel mike there 's plenty , uh , room acoustic but I 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  That  that may be true . But I don't know how good it can get either by those  the  those methods   That 's true . 
H:  I think the rest is cross - talk . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  So I  I think it 's just , 
B:  OK . 
A:  Oh , I don't know . 
H:  yeah , what you said , cross - talk . 
A:  All I meant is just that as sort of  
B:  <breath> 
A:  as this pipeline of research is going on we 're also experimenting with different 
A:  ASR , uh , techniques . And so it 'd be w good to know about it . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <breath> So the problem is like , uh , on the microphone of somebody who 's not talking they 're picking up 
G:  <breath> 
E:  signals from other people  and that 's 
E:  <breath> 
A:  R right , although if they 're not talking , using the  
E:  causing problems ? 
A:  the inhouse transcriptions , were sort of O K because 
A:  the t no one transcribed any words there and we throw it out . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  But if they 're talking at all and they 're not talking the whole time ,  so you get some speech and then a " mm - hmm " , and some more speech , so that whole thing is one chunk . 
A:  And the person in the middle who said only a little bit is picking up the speech around it , 
B:  <mike noise> 
A:  that 's where it 's a big problem . 
topic_description:	echo cancellation, close talking microphones


G:  <breath> You know , this does like seem like it would relate to some of what Jose 's been working on as well , the encoding of the   And  and he also , he was  
D:  Yeah . 
A:  The energy , right . Exactly . 
D:  Yeah , energy . 
G:  I was t I was trying to remember , you have this interface where you  i you ha you showed us one time on your laptop that you  you had different visual displays as speech and nonspeech events . 
D:  Yeah , c Yeah . May  I  I only display the different colors for the different situation . 
E:  <breath> 
D:  <breath> But , eh , for me and for my problems , is uh  is enough . 
D:  Because , eh , it 's possible , eh , 
E:  <yawn> 
D:  eh , in a simp sample view , uh , to , nnn , to compare with c with the segment , the  the kind of assessment 
D:  what happened with the  the different parameters . And 
D:  only with a different bands of color for the , 
D:  uh , few situation , eh , I consider for acoustic event is enough to @ @ . I  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  I  <mouth> I see that , eh , 
D:  you are considering now , eh , a very sophisticated , eh , ehm , eh , 
D:  @ @  
D:  set of , eh , graphic s eh , eh , ehm , si symbols to  to transcribe . No ? 
G:  Oh , I w Uh - huh . 
D:  Because , uh , before , you  you are talking about the  the possibility to include in the Transcriber program eh , um , a set of symbols , of graphic symbol to  
D:  t to mark the different situations during the transcription - during the transcription . No ? 
G:  Well , you 're saying  So , uh , symbols for differences between laugh , and sigh , and  and  and slam the door and stuff ? Or some other kind of thing ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  Yeah , yeah . The s the symbols , you  you talk of before . No ? To  to mark  
G:  Well , I wouldn't say <outbreath> symbols so much .  The  the main change that I  that I see in the interface is  is just that we 'll be able to more finely c uh , 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  time things . But I  I also st there was another aspect of your work that I was thinking about when I was talking to you which is that it sounded 
D:  Yeah . 
H:  <breath> 
B:  <mike noise> 
A:  Hmm . 
G:  to me , Liz , as though you  and , uh , maybe I didn't q understand this ,  but it sounded to me as though part of the analysis that you 're doing involves taking segments which are of a particular type and putting them together . 
G:  And th so if you have like a p a s you know , speech from one speaker ,  then you cut out the part that 's not that speaker , and you 
D:  Yeah . 
H:  <breath> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  combine segments from  that same speaker to   and run them through the recognizer . Is that  right ? 
A:  Well we try to find as close 
E:  <breath> 
A:  of start and end time of  as we can to the speech from an individual speaker , 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <breath> 
A:  because then we  we 're more guaranteed that the recognizer will  for the forced alignment which is just to give us the time boundaries , 
A:  because from those time boundaries then the plan is to compute prosodic features . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  And the sort of more space you have that isn't the thing you 're trying to align the more 
A:  errors we have . <laugh> 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Um , so , you know , that  that  it would help to have 
G:  Cuz i OK . 
A:  either pre - processing of a signal that creates very good signal - to - noise ratio , which I don't know how possible this is for the lapel ,  
E:  <breath> 
A:  um , or to have very  
A:  to have closer , <breath> um , 
B:  <breath> 
A:  time  you know , synch times , basically , around the speech that gets transcribed in it , or both . And it 's just sort of a open world right now of 
A:  exploring that . So I just wanted to  see , you know , on the transcribing end from here things look good . 
G:  <mike noise> 
A:  Uh , the IBM one is more  it 's an open question right now . And then the issue of 
A:  like global processing of some signal and then , 
A:  you know , before we chop it up is  is yet another way we can improve things in that . 
E:  What about increasing the flexibility of the alignment ? 
G:  OK . 
E:  Do you remember that thing that Michael Finka did ? that experiment he did a while back ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <inbreath> Right . You can , um  
A:  Hhh .  
A:  The problem is just that the acoustic  when the signal - to - noise ratio is too low , um , 
A:  you  you 'll get , a uh  an alignment with the wrong duration pattern or it  
E:  Oh , so that 's the problem , is the  the signal - to - noise ratio . 
A:  Yeah . It 's not the fact that you have like  I mean , what he did is allow you to have , 
A:  uh , words that were in another segment move over to the  at the edges of  of segmentations . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Or even words inserted that weren't  weren't there . 
A:  Right , things  things near the boundaries where if you got your alignment wrong  cuz what they had done there is align and then chop . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Um , and this problem is a little bit j more global . It 's that there are problems even in inside the alignments ,  
A:  uh , because of the fact that there 's enough acoustic 
A:  signal there t for the recognizer to  to eat , <laugh> as part of a word . And it tends to do that . S 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  So , uh , 
A:  but we probably will have to do something like that in addition . 
A:  Anyway . So , yeah , bottom  bottom line is just I wanted to make sure I can 
B:  <breath> 
A:  be aware of whoever 's working on these signal - processing techniques for , 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  uh , detecting energies , because that  that 'll really help us .
