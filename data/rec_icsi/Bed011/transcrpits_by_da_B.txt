B:  Thanks . 
B:  Uh , Robert , do you uh have any way to turn off your uh screensaver on there so that it 's not going off every  uh , 
B:  it seems to have about at two minute  
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Got it . 
B:  Yeah , OK . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  This is a fictional system obviously , 
B:  huh . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  So I don't exactly understand  
B:  like I I  I guess we 're trying to  limit the detail of our ontology or types of places that someone could go , 
B:  right ? 
B:  But who is it that has to care about this , 
B:  or what component of the system ? 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  So we would rather just ask  uh have a bunch of people talk about the zoo , 
B:  uh and assume that that will  that the constructions that they use there will give us everything we need to know about these sort of zoo , castle , whatever type things , these bigger places . 
B:  And that way you get the speech data of people saying " zoo " over and over again or whatever too . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Well , um it seems that  
B:  Yeah , I mean , 
B:  off the top of my head it kinda seems like you would probably just want , you know , richer data , 
B:  more complex stuff going on , 
B:  people trying to do more complex sets of things . 
B:  I mean  you know , if our goal is to really sort of be able to handle a whole bunch of different stuff , then throwing harder situations at people will get them to do more linguistic  more interesting linguistic stuff . 
B:  But I mean  I 'm  I 'm not really sure 
B:  Uh , because I don't fully understand like what our choices are of ways to do this here yet . 
B:  I started to listen to one and it was just like , um , uh , sort of depressing . 
B:  I thought I 'd just sort of listen to the beginning part and the person was just sort of reading off her script or something . 
B:  And . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  So um , I  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  It  In fact , um , I am just you know  today , next couple days gonna start really diving into this data . 
B:  I 've basically looked at one of the files  
B:  you know one of these  
B:  l y y y you gave me those dozens of files 
B:  and I looked at one of them which was about ten sentences , found fifteen , twenty different construction types that we would have to look for and so on 
B:  and like , " alright , well , let 's start here . " 
B:  Um . So I haven't really gone into the , you know  looked at all of the stuff that 's going on . 
B:  So I don't really  
B:  Right , I mean , once I start doing that I 'll have more to say about this kind of thing . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , Yeah . 
B:  I um  I did sort of scan it at first and noticed that , and then looked in detail at one of them . 
B:  But yeah , yeah I noticed that , too . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  So rather than having zoo and castle . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Good luck . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  That 's right . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  What 's this idea of " next tour " ? 
B:  I mean  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Or  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  So  so this tour is sort of just like th the idea of current s round of  of touristness or whatever , 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Got it . 
B:  Got it . 
B:  Sure , sure , sure . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Just to be totally clear . 
B:  OK . 
B:  You just spend the whole time at U Fleku or something , 
B:  ri 
B:  Keine Ahnung 
B:  OK . 
B:  Not that I know of actually . 
B:  So , business is supposed to uh , be sort of  it  like professional type stuff , 
B:  right , 
B:  or something like that ? 
B:  OK . 
B:  Um . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , I mean like for example my  my father is about to travel to Prague . 
B:  He 'll be there for two weeks . 
B:  He is going to uh  
B:  He 's there to teach a course at the business school but he also is touring around 
B:  and so he may have some mixture of these things . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  So  I mean , does this capture , like , where do you put  
B:  " Exchange money " is an errand , 
B:  right ? 
B:  But what about uh  
B:  So , like " Go to a movie " is now entertainment , 
B:  " Dine out " is  
B:  So I mean  
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  " Tourist needs food , badly " 
B:  H How much of Heidelberg can you get around by public transport ? 
B:  I mean in terms of the interesting bits . 
B:  There 's lots of bits where you don't really 
B:  I 've only ev was there ten years ago , for a day , so I don't remember , but . 
B:  I mean , like the  sort of the tourist - y bits  
B:  is it like  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I would  I would lump it with " walk " because hills matter . 
B:  Right ? 
B:  You know . 
B:  Things like that . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Wow  
B:  It seems like this would be really hard to guess . 
B:  I mean , on the part of the system . 
B:  It seems like it  
B:  I mean you 're  you 're talking about rather than having the user decide this you 're supposed t we 're supposed to figure it out ? 
B:  Overrider 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  You could say " some " in there . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Dinner . 
B:  OK . So  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Money is no object . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I mean y 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  I mean  th so there 's a couple of different ways you can interpret these things 
B:  right ? 
B:  You know  " I want to go there and I don't care if it 's really hard . " 
B:  Or if you 're an extreme sport person , you know . 
B:  " I wanna go there and I insist on it being the hard way . " 
B:  Right ? 
B:  you know , so I assume we 're going for the first interpretation , 
B:  right ? 
B:  Something like  
B:  I 'll go th 
B:  I mean  
B:  I 'd li 
B:  I dunno . 
B:  It 's different from thing to  
B:  Yeah ? 
B:  I  I  
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  D Do you mean  Do you mean eliciting particular constructions ? 
B:  Or do you mean like what kinds of things we want to get people talking about ? Semantically speaking , eh ? 
B:  OK . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Sure . 
B:  I mean from my point of view I 'm  I 'm trying to care about the syntax , so you know  
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Got it . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Uh Yeah . OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Is that roughly the equivalent of  of what I 've seen in English or is it  
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Same  
B:  OK , that . 
B:  Got it . 
B:  Like what  What have I got now ? 
B:  I mean I have uh what  what I 'm loo what I  
B:  Those files that you sent me are the user side of some interaction with Fey ? 
B:  Is that what it is ? Or  ? 
B:  Just talking into a box and not hearing anything back . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right , Right . 
B:  By the end of the summer , too . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Still , pretty formidable actually . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Right , Right . 
B:  Existence proof , you know . 
B:  Set up the infrastructure , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Um sometime , I have to talk to some subset of the people in this group , at least about um what sort of constructions I 'm looking for . 
B:  I mean , you know obviously like just again , looking at this one uh thing , you know , I saw y things from  sort of as general as argument structure constructions . 
B:  Oh , you know , I have to do Verb Phrase . 
B:  I have to do uh  uh  unbounded dependencies , 
B:  you know , which have a variety of constructions in  uh  uh  
B:  instantiate that . 
B:  On the other hand I have to have , you know , 
B:  there 's particular uh , fixed expressions , or semi - fixed expressions like " Get " plus path expression for , you know , " how d ho how do I get there ? " , 
B:  " How do I get in ? " , 
B:  " How do I get away ? " 
B:  and all that kind of stuff . 
B:  Um , so there 's a variety of sort of different sorts of constructions 
B:  and it  you know it 's  it 's sort of like anything goes . 
B:  Like  
B:  OK . 
B:  er  that 's what 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  Of course . 
B:  Right , exactly . 
B:  Now it  w we talked about this before , 
B:  right . 
B:  And I  I me it would it would be completely out of the question to really do more than , say , like , oh I don't know , ten , over the summer , 
B:  but uh , but you know obviously we need to get sort of a general view of what things look like , 
B:  so 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Sure . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Sure . 
B:  OK . 
B:  But I mean in terms of the s th sort of level of uh  of analysis , 
B:  you know , these don't necessarily have to be more complex than like the " Out of " construction in the BCP paper where it 's just like , you know , half a page on each one or something . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  For the first cut , that should be fine , yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  That 's about six times in this little one here , so uh , <laugh> yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  How much does it cost ? 
B:  I haven't planned to go . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Sure . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Thanks .
