D:  I don't think so . 
D:  Yeah . It 's more segments ? 
D:  Or  ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah . Th - that 's what I did for  for my talk . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Huh . 
D:  Yep . Yep . 
D:  Yeah . Just  Yeah . Just smooth the  the output of the  of the detector . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Or you can  Yeah . You can use the one with one second or whatever . 
D:  I  I  I  There 's no  not much difference between the  the one - second and the two - second one . 
D:  And I think  wouldn't it be better to  to have a little longer sequences for the recognizer ? 
D:  B eh because of the language model ? As sometimes it happens that  that it cuts off within a s 
D:  Yeah . But , we can be sure that as  Or we can be  er not  not totally sure , 
D:  but we can be somehow sure that there is nothing  not  no speech between those . 
D:  So , it  it  
D:  I think i it doesn't  
D:  It 's the same as in the  the smoother for the  <mouth> IBM thing . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So . Yeah . 
D:  So . 
D:  But  Yeah . But  but the  the chunks are already sh i in general , are short . 
D:  So  I  I t I think it would be better to have  to have more of them concatenated together , in order to have better language model 
D:  or language modeling . 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Do that . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . But  but y there 's  there 's really not much difference between the one - second and the two - second . 
D:  So just  take the one  the one - second one . 
D:  I  I 'm not too afraid ab about that as 
D:  w when there  when there would be something  some background speech or something  there wo there would be a  a chunk in another <breath> channel , 
D:  and when there is s something in between , I con I  I do not concatenate them . 
D:  It 's just when there is  when they are sequentially and  
D:  So . I wou I would use th 
D:  Yep . 
D:  No . 
D:  We could  
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Oops ! 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  But d 
D:  do you have gender - dependent models ? 
D:  A Are the models gender - dependent ? 
D:  So 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Some of these  things are captured by  Yeah . Um , by looking at  at the minimum and maximum and whatever 
D:  you find in the channels , 
D:  and  
D:  But  
D:  Yep . Yep . Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Sometimes you  you capture that when you mix it together , 
D:  and  
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  I don't think so .
