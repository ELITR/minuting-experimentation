D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  It 's  it 's  it 's  it was updated yesterday , 
D:  right ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Uh , I don't think  I don't think  
D:  Yeah , I I don't think anybody up there is like  working on it right now . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So right now nobody 's working on Aurora there . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I  can actually do it 
D:  today . I mean , I can just log into  
D:  No , I didn't . 
D:  So I I 'll try it today . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Second . 

D:  And th the ranking actually didn't change after the German and Danish . 
D:  So , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Their  their first system is fifty - four point something . 
D:  And , uh , we are fifty - three point something . 
D:  And their second system is also fifty - three point something . 
D:  Yeah , one percent . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , it  it  it  it  so it actually makes it dependent on the overall energy of the  uh , the frame . 
D:  If yo if you don't normalize and  if  if you don't normalize . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  No , I guess the VAD has its own set of features . 
D:  I mean , which could be this  one of these streams , or it can be something derived from  these streams . 
D:  Yeah , that 's also  
D:  Well , it has t I mean the  th 
D:  Yeah , if it has to fit the delays and all this stuff . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So , I 'll , um  I 'll actually  after the meeting I 'll add the second stream to the VAD and maybe I 'll start with the feature net in that case . 
D:  It 's like , you 're looking at the VAD , 
D:  right ? 
D:  I 'll  
D:  For the VAD ? 
D:  Oh , you already have it ? 
D:  OK , so just figure how to take the features from the final  
D:  OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  Yeah , th I  I guess it 's almost ready . 
D:  So  
D:  That 's what  
D:  So they have released their , uh , document , describing the system . 
D:  Sure . 
D:  It - no , it 's just downloadable from their  from their web site . 
D:  So I 'll point you to the web site and the mails corresponding . 
D:  So I 
D:  Uh , I  I think they are still , uh , tuning something on that . 
D:  So they 're like , d they 're varying different parameters like the insertion penalty and other stuff , and then seeing what 's the performance . 
D:  Uh , w I guess there is , uh , time during which people are gonna make suggestions . 
D:  After that . 
D:  Yeah , I guess . 
D:  So these sugges these  this , uh , period during which people are gonna make suggestions is to know whether it is actually biased towards any set of features or  
D:  b 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  The Wall Street ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  It 's , uh  It 's like a medium  medium - mismatch condition , sort of . 
D:  Um , I guess  I guess one  some preliminary version is already there . 
D:  Yeah , it 's already there . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  But they 're actually parallel - y doing some modifications also , I think . 
D:  So I guess the f final system will be frozen by middle of , like , one more week maybe . 
D:  Yeah , that 's just one more . 
D:  No , it 's just a straightforward HMM . 
D:  It 's just a HMM , Gaussian mixture model . 
D:  Yeah , this is a g 
D:  yeah , this i 
D:  yeah . 
D:  I  I  I think  yeah , I  I guess something like that . 
D:  It 's like <breath>  as painless as possible , 
D:  is what  Do they provide all the scripts , everything , and then  Just , 
D:  ju Yeah , I th I think . 
D:  So sh shall we , like , add Chuck also to the mailing lists ? 
D:  It may be better , I mean , in that case if he 's going to  
D:  Because there 's a mailing list for this . 
D:  Yeah , I guess maybe Hari or Hynek , one of them , has to  send a mail to Joe . 
D:  Or maybe if you  
D:  Well , yeah , to add or maybe wh 
D:  Yeah , so that 's just fine . 
D:  So  
D:  So  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And there is an , uh , archive of all the mails that has been <mouth> gon that has gone , uh , between these people  among these people . 
D:  So just you can see all this  mails in the ISIP web site  
D:  Mississippi web site . 
D:  Yeah , it 's password protected . 
D:  So , like  like , it 's , like  
D:  Yeah .
