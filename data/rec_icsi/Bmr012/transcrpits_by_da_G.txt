G:  OK . 
G:  OK . 
G:  Yeah , on your upper lip . 
G:  Yeah , I think we 're supposed to  
G:  that 's right . 
G:  I could  can this be adjuste like this ? 
G:  Is that @ @ ? OK , 
G:  thank you . 
G:  Hello . 
G:  Channel eight , eight . 
G:  Although on  
G:  course on the other  on the other hand you could  you view it as the age at the time of the  
G:  Yes , but what we care about is the age at  at the recording date rather than the  
G:  Yes . <laugh> Unless we wanna send them a card . 
G:  Yeah , that 's true . 
G:  Mmm . 
G:  I 'm puzzled by that . 
G:  I  oh  oh , I see . 
G:  Oh there was a glitch somewhere . 
G:  I forgot about that . 
G:  Well , I mean , they  
G:  but I was able to can transcribe 
G:  Wow . 
G:  Oh . 
G:  That 's not good . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  And the only glitch  
G:  yeah . 
G:  The  the  well  wait 
G:  we should say something about the glitch . 
G:  He  he can say something about the glitch . 
G:  Cuz it 's  it 's  it 's  h it 's  it 's very small  
G:  very small . 
G:  Yep . 
G:  S 
G:  and it  
G:  I agree . 
G:  I agree . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  It  it had no effect on my transcription , 
G:  you know , I mean I  I had no trouble hearing it and  and having time bins 
G:  but there was a  
G:  Oh . 
G:  Oh . 
G:  Oh , interesting . 
G:  Oh . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Right . 
G:  That 's amazing . 
G:  That 's amazing . 
G:  Oh that 's  I 'm glad . 
G:  That makes a lot of sense , 
G:  yeah . 
G:  Very possible . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Congratulations 
G:  is really great . 
G:  I need t Hmm . I need to ask one question . 
G:  Which is um so this issue <laugh> of the uh legalistic aspects of the pre - sent you know pre - adapted  
G:  Yeah , well , so what I mean is 
G:  um 
G:  the  uh the data that you take into SRI , first  first question , 
G:  you 're maintaining it in  in a place that wouldn't be publicly readable that  that kind of stuff , 
G:  right ? 
G:  By uh people uh who are not associated with this project . 
G:  Exactly . 
G:  Mm - hmm , exactly . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Great . 
G:  Yeah , we had to get them to approve em 
G:  and then i cuz  cuz the other question I was gonna ask is if we 're having um you know it 's 
G:  but this  this meeting that you have , no problem 
G:  cuz I  I well I mean I  I speak for myself 
G:  but  but I think that we didn't do anything that but 
G:  well anyway so <laugh> uh I wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that 
G:  although we should clear it with Eric and Dan of course 
G:  but these results are based on data which haven't had the uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects 
G:  and I don't know how that stands , 
G:  I mean if you  if you get fantastic results and it 's involving  data which  which later end up being lessened by , you know certain elisions , then I don't know 
G:  but I wanted to raise that issue , 
G:  that 's all . 
G:  Great . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Just  Mm - hmm . 
G:  One  one question which is I  I had the impression  from this  from this meeting that w that I transcribed that um that there was already automatic downsampling occurring , 
G:  is that 
G:  I thought that in order to 
G:  so it was  so it 's like there 's already down 
G:  OK . 
G:  OK . 
G:  Oh OK . 
G:  That 's exactly , and that 's how I know it . 
G:  The cross pads ? 
G:  Mmm . 
G:  I  I thought of some extra  a couple of extra things I 'd like to mention . 
G:  One of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far . 
G:  So um as of last night um I 'd assigned twelve hours and they 'd finished nine 
G:  and my goal was to have eleven done by the end of the month , 
G:  I think that by tomorrow we 'll have ten . 
G:  So they 're still working . 
G:  It 's working out , thanks . 
G:  Thanks . 
G:  And then um also an idea for another meeting , which would be to have the transcribers talk about the data 
G:  It 's sort of a  a little bit  a little bit 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah , exa <laugh> exactly 
G:  I guess  nested several layers , 
G:  but 
G:  Well that 's what I 'm thinking , 
G:  yeah . 
G:  Have them talk about the data and they  and they 've made observations to me 
G:  like they say uh you know this meeting that we think has so much overlap , in fact it does 
G:  but there are other groups of similar size that have very little , 
G:  you know it 's part of it 's  it 's the norm of the group and all that 
G:  and they have various observations that would be fun , I think . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  OK . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Oh good . 
G:  OK . 
G:  What  what 
G:  yeah that 's right . 
G:  Yeah exactly , 
G:  yeah . 
G:  Great . 
G:  Great . 
G:  And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John  John Fiscus visit tomorrow . 
G:  And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one 
G:  that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization  allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes 
G:  but to be basically in three parts , 
G:  the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects 
G:  um other things 
G:  and he 'll be also presenting what NIST is doing 
G:  and  and uh then uh 
G:  number two would be sort of a the  the transcription process 
G:  so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the  the multitrans interface 
G:  which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments 
G:  which uh Dave Gelbart 's been doing 
G:  and then um uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo 's been doing 
G:  and then um the third part would  
G:  and again he has some stuff that 's i relevant with respect to NIST 
G:  and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards 
G:  so at NIST he 's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say 
G:  and I want it , 
G:  you know k 
G:  yeah 
G:  see what they 're doing and also present what  what we 've chosen as ours and  and discuss that kind of thing . 
G:  And so but he 's only here until until one 
G:  and actually we 're thinking of noon being uh lunch time 
G:  so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon . 
G:  S 
G:  And everybody who wants to attend is welcome . 
G:  So 
G:  yeah . 
G:  Here mostly 
G:  but I 've also reserved the BARCO room um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Oh I think that would be hard , yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Thank you though , 
G:  uh - huh . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  When we do this in the key  in the key  in the key it has to indicate that channel change , 
G:  right ? 
G:  Well i have a time mark . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Then you  then you go back to Norway , 
G:  that 's 
G:  OK .
