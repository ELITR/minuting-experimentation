A:  OK . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Ah , the messages . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  " Alumni " . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  It is . 
A:  So there are some gaps . 
A:  Yeah , so there are some gaps left 
A:  and , 
A:  I don't know , 
A:  you  Maybe you can also read through the  all the text which is on the web pages 
A:  cuz I 'd like to change the text a bit 
A:  cuz sometimes it 's too long , 
A:  sometimes it 's too short , 
A:  maybe the English is not that good , 
A:  so 
A:  um , 
A:  but anyways  
A:  So I tried to do this today 
A:  and if you could do it afterwards it would be really nice 
A:  cuz I 'm quite sure that I can't find every , like , orthographic mistake in it or something . 
A:  Good . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah , 
A:  the graphics are too bad . 
A:  I know . 
A:  I can't change something with a logo . 
A:  Yeah , 
A:  OK . 
A:  Good , 
A:  yeah I ju 
A:  an 
A:  another thing is I 'd want to get a link on the logo so that you can come from the logo to the  ICSI web p home page  back . 
A:  So . 
A:  That 's  these are th some things I have to do . 
A:  Yeah , 
A:  and if you have something which I should put on the web page for you , 
A:  so 
A:  yeah , some pictures will be nice , 
A:  a few sentences will be nice , 
A:  and 
A:  yeah , it depends on how much time you have . 
A:  And then the page for inf about  
A:  So , some information for people who are new comers or , 
A:  I don't know a good word for it , 
A:  should we use uh " new comers " 
A:  or  
A:  So , with somebody who is new , arriving here , or <inbreath> wants to  to , uh , send an application ? 
A:  S 
A:  Huh ? 
A:  Newbies ? 
A:  Yeah , OK . 
A:  So , there I have to add some information , 
A:  I don't know , I t I tried to set up everything by today for this page 
A:  cuz I 've started with this , 
A:  um , if you have any kind of ideas what was important for you then just let m 
A:  cuz I have some <inbreath> points like um  I don't know f yeah , like Pacific Bell , 
A:  like uh , long - distance carriers , 
A:  then like uh , cars and car insurances , 
A:  health insurances  
A:  So , health insurance is k something I can only say for German people . 
A:  So maybe 
A:  I don't know if this is different in Spain . 
A:  That would be fine too , to have some information , or in D nnn <inbreath> Holland . 
A:  I don't know . 
A:  Yeah , 
A:  so how  maybe how you did it or whatsoever . 
A:  So 
A:  yeah , 
A:  then what else did I have ? 
A:  Then 
A:  another point 's like , uh , what about the bank , 
A:  uh , so , transferring your money from Europe t over here , what is the cheapest way or what could you recommend or something . 
A:  um 
A:  another point 
A:  yeah , and then there 's  there 's another point like going out in Berkeley or what to do in Berkeley or in the neighborhood . 
A:  No , 
A:  I know . 
A:  I know . 
A:  But there 's nothing like this on the  on the ICSI page as far as I know . 
A:  Yeah , but it 's not in the  
A:  This is not on the web . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I don't know , 
A:  maybe I talk with Jane about this . 
A:  If we can use this information , I don't know , somewhere on the ICSI home page too . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Maybe . 
A:  Yeah , I talk to Jane about this . 
A:  No , 
A:  this is why I have to talk to Jane . 
A:  Yeah , but this is not a problem at all , 
A:  I  I mean , if y you are coming from Germany and you know that there is something changed with the health insurance , then you send Jane an email like " Could you please change this , blah - blah - blah . " 
A:  Yeah , OK . 
A:  Yes . 
A:  Yes , also fine . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Another point is I want  I want to  would like to add a another button , something which is called like " events " or , I don't know , yeah , I guess I call it " events " 
A:  like <inbreath> where we could s uh , announce talks which are , you know , future  talks for the future , 
A:  or  and where we could also have a link on  <inbreath> for instance the two workshops which have going on , uh , last summer , 
A:  so , Hannes ' workshop and then the workshop from Oliver , 
A:  that there might be a link behind these workshops and  or former talks we have , 
A:  so like from people who have been here before 
A:  and he wants to , uh , publish their slides , or an article , or whatsoever , behind there . 
A:  So , that we have like a button for events which are  where <inbreath> workshops can be announced or old workshops could  could be , um , shown or whatever . 
A:  No , it 's easy to  to add it , 
A:  I mean . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah , OK . 
A:  Yeah but this will be then down on the button of the page anyways . 
A:  Yep . 
A:  Yep . 
A:  Huh ! 
A:  OK . 
A:  See for me it 's the same 
A:  I can also say , uh , 
A:  for me everything has completely changed , 
A:  so now I go back and I don't anything what to do , 
A:  so it 's like I have to sort everything out when I 'm back in Germany 
A:  but I won't go back to the university 
A:  so 
A:  I don't think so . 
A:  Then it 's like 
A:  yeah . 
A:  Yeah , 
A:  No , no , no . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  " Lost " is maybe a bit like  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  That must be three weeks ago , 
A:  cuz I r I  just met him when I arrived . 
A:  Oh , again ? 
A:  I don't know .
