E:  No . 
E:  Did the networks have internet connectivity ? 
E:  But normally you should have access to th all the internet , r to outside . 
E:  Full . 
E:  A restricted in . 
E:  Not . 
E:  Huh . 
E:  Not a  no FTP . 
E:  H 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  Newbies . 
E:  Newbies . 
E:  This  a lot of this stuff is not networking group  NSA , uh , restricted . 
E:  M 
E:  Yeah , but a at least then it should be  mmm , I think be , uh , ICSI part ,  and not network restricted . 
E:  M move it on the normal ICSI , ICSI . 
E:  Maybe every group has somewhere hidden , uh  a gro uh deep  outgoing  
E:  Yeah , but eh  but my point is that it should not be under the networking group thing . 
E:  eh  But  
E:  OK . 
E:  But  
E:  b 
E:  But that could still be applicable if you put it under the ICSI site if you take the responsibility for that . 
E:  Uh , 
E:  So I think th I think both arguments are not an ar are arguments against having this under the normal ICSI page . 
E:  Or only the networking , uh , page . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yes , 
E:  yeah . 
E:  No , 
E:  no . 
E:  Pending .

E:  And oh , also  also 
E:  Well , 
E:  b but I think even  also K P N . i is lost for the , uh , for the I C 
E:  There 's a lot of , uh , z budget cuts going on 
E:  and nothing is possible anymore , 
E:  so . 
E:  Yes . 
E:  Absolutely . 
E:  I it  It will be different thing . 
E:  It will be a  it will be a start - up . 
E:  And I know they 're  they 're working on a w a few of them in this area , 
E:  but it 's  ou outside of ICSI . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  u 
E:  Th 
E:  Um , I am working now on  on something , 
E:  uh an open source router . 
E:  No , 
E:  in  
E:  well , it 's a little bit u out of Mark . 
E:  I 'm  
E:  Right now I 'm interested and I 'm looking into it 
E:  and I 'm working  started yesterday , actually working on it , 
E:  to do the , uh  u to do an implementation of the protocol that was designed by Mark , <inbreath> um , on an open - source router that 's different from the one that  of Mark 's project . 
E:  S s 
E:  I hope so . 
E:  I 
E:  That would be cool . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  It 's 
E:  hard work .

E:  Lectures . 
E:  You can change that . 
E:  M uh , maybe you sh 
E:  I think it 's pretty healthy for a student to  <inbreath> to have a project , eh , where you have to write actually some part of research 
E:  or . 
E:  Sure . 
E:  OK . 
E:  O 
E:  Of course . 
E:  January , 
E:  yes .

E:  Right . 
E:  Who is that ? 
E:  Oh , he was here one day . 
E:  Yeah , I do remember him , 
E:  but I didn't talk with him about , uh   about the research topic . 
E:  So I didn't know what he was going to do . 
E:  We have to do that ? 
E:  Oh ! 
E:  Did you get that ? 
E:  No , it wasn't . 
E:  I  I  I saw it already standing there  when I was here  so then I started laughing ,
