G:  I was just thinking that  
B:  <breath> <mike noise> 
G:  in the meeting you could like  
G:  have this secret thing that would play music if you 're  <laugh> if you got bored . Give you stock quotes @ @ . Nobody would know , right ?  
F:  <laugh> Yeah , that 's right ! 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <mike noise> 
F:  Thanks .  
G:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
G:  No , I mean , just like no one would know if something 's actually 
F:  <long whistle>  
B:  <mike noise> 
C:  <mike noise> 
G:   coming through if you got bored or something , cuz  
G:  <laugh> 
B:  Ch - ch - ch , ch - ch - ch , ch - ch - ch , ch - ch - ch  
C:  Well , it 's being recorded anyway , right ? Why listen to the guy ? 
G:  Right . <laugh> 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah , right .  
G:  Right . <laugh> You sit at the meeting but you just  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah , that 's right . 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  <mike noise> 
C:  @ @ If you need it you may record it .  
G:  Yeah , you just say , " Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm " . 
B:  You need me , yeah . 
C:  Then we can get Liz 's X marks later to see if there are any important things . 
H:  <mike noise> <mouth> 
F:  <mike noise> 
B:  <bird-like whistles>  
G:  <laugh> 
B:  <mike noise>  
G:  Right . <laugh> 
G:  Right . <laugh> 
H:  Oh , so , 
F:  So . 
B:  I really count . 
H:  you have to turn those things on if they 're not on already . Are they  
F:  <laugh> 
E:   
B:  <breath> <mike noise> 
C:  Mine is on . 
H:  <breath> 
E:  <glottal click, twice>  
G:  <mike noise> 
C:  Where am I ? 
H:  There 's a switch on top . 
C:  Which one ? 
F:  There 's a switch on top . So . " On - off " . 
E:  <sp-sp-sp, during horn-like sound with vocal tract>  
B:  <mike noise> <breath> 
G:  <whistles>  
D:   
C:  Which one ? 
G:  <whistles>  
D:  Hello ? 
E:  <glottal click>  
A:  This is on . 
H:  <mouth> OK , <mike noise> Looks good . 
G:  <mike noise> 
A:  Hi , hi , hi . 
B:  <blows into mike> 
C:  Channel  Oh , I 'm on two . Good . 
B:  <blows into mike> 
E:  <glottal click, three times>  
F:  <laugh> 
A:  Hello ? Hello ? I 'm  I 'm on zero ! Yes ! 
B:  <blows into mike> 
C:  You are on zero . 
A:  Oh , uh I 'm being recorded by the wire . 
E:  Hello ? 
F:  The  the wireless ones are actually labeled . 
G:  Hello ? 
H:  Yeah . 
D:  I 'm on channel four ? Channel four , channel four , channel four ? 
B:  <breath> 
C:  Oh , they 're already labeled ? 
F:  They have a little piece of tape . 
E:  <long whistle>  
C:  Yeah , that 's what I figured out . No ? I 'm , uh  
D:  Why ? That was good . 
B:  And is that the channel number or the microphone number ? 
C:  Well , I mean , you 're counting maybe from one instead of zero , so . 
D:  <mike noise> 
E:  <long whistle>  
F:  That 's r exactly the problem . <laugh> 
D:  Hey . 
D:  <mike noise> 
F:  Subtract one from the mike number to get the channel number . 
D:  Hey . 
D:  Hey . 
D:  You know , I have a feeling we 're on reversed . Does yours say " three " ? 
B:  Right . 
E:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
H:  Yeah . 
G:  And what about these ? 
A:  @ @ and Mike are coming on my channel . 
F:  Or maybe add one . 
H:  No , no , no , no , no , no . 
G:  <mike noise> 
G:  Where 's the  <mike noise> 
E:  No , no . You subtract  He was just saying trap subtract one . 
G:  Is it labeled ? 
H:  But you have to  the channel  uh the number on the mike is the number on the screen plus one , of course . <laugh> 
D:  No ? 
G:  <mike noise> 
D:  Oh , thank you . Sss - this is the problem . 
A:  <coughs twice> 
E:  <breath> 
C:  Right . 
D:  Good . OK , good , good , good . 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  Of course . <laugh> 
E:  <horn-like sound with vocal tract> 
D:  Thank you . 
H:  Cuz , uh , otherwise we would 've  
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <mike noise> 
E:  <glottal click>  
F:  So I guess I am channel eight .  
E:  Hmm . 
D:  Whoa !  I guess so . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  Am I nine ? OK . <laugh> 
D:  <mike noise> 
F:  You look ni You look nine . 
D:  Hello ?  
D:  Yeah , I 'm number three . That 's right . OK . 
C:  So , yeah . 
F:  Funny , you don't look a day over seven . <laugh> 
B:  <blows into mike> 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  <blows into mike in various ways> 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  Well , thank you . 
G:  This is kinda fun . 
A:  So I guess now we have a lot of censors self - censorship going on .  
E:  <clears throat> 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> No , 
F:  <breath> 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
E:  <buzzes lips>  
G:  But it won't last long . 
C:  No ! 
H:  That 's right . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  This is  
F:  Yeah , so it 's r it 's remarkable how quickly people forget . 
A:  No , we got to relax and let go . <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> It probably  
E:  Ch - ch .  
H:  <clears throat> 
G:  Right . 
B:  These are disturbing . Being just in front of your ears , it  
F:  So far , e 
B:  you can  you can hear the shadow it creates . 
B:  There was this like little acoustic shadow 
E:  Oh ! Really ?  
H:  <mouth> Oh , god . 
B:  from having this in front , yeah . 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah ? Uh - huh . 
G:  You can hear it . <laugh> 
E:  Uh . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Well , I can  I can feel it . 
G:  The rest of us  
F:  You h you must have much better ear . <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> 
A:  <breath> 
F:  And so far every meeting I 've recorded someone has at one point or another said , " Oh , I probably shouldn't have said that . "  
G:  That 's amazing . 
B:  There 's too much  
E:  <clears throat> <breath> 
G:  <mike noise> 
E:  <breath> 
F:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  So I think they 're  they 're  
C:  So , Harry , we should maybe record some of your clicks and , you know . 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  I 've been clicking plenty . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  He  he 's a  
E:  But they don't show up . 
A:  the sound effect man . 
E:  <glottal click>  
D:  Wow ! That 's great !  
A:  Yeah . Alright .  
E:  They don't show up on that thing . 
B:  <breath> 
F:  Well , I  I bet they 're recorded 
E:  <glottal click, three times>  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  They 'll be  they 'll be deaf deafening the transcriber . <laugh> 
H:  Oh , yeah . 
E:  Yeah , I 'm sure  I 'm sure they 're recorded . <laugh> 
F:  quite loudly . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath> 
F:  Yeah , so it  
E:  <laugh> 
A:  They want to do something serious with this research . <laugh> 
E:  They tend to clip . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  That 's a nice user interface , Dan . Very  what does " solo " mean ? 
D:  <breath> That 's  that 's really something . 
H:  Uh , it means I was trying to think of things they put on real mixers that I should have on mine . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Ah ! <laugh, "ha-ha-ha-ha"> 
D:  Oh . <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  But it it 's really good . The solo actually  
B:  So you can feed it to the  
A:  Solo means you just  
E:  Ahh . 
B:  feed it through the headphones , for example . 
H:  cuz it 's actually  you know , it 's  it 's how to  it 's what can I  what application can I have for a  for a , uh , 
A:  can  
B:  <breath> 
H:  a class method rather  or a class  you know , a class procedure . So the solo by sa satellite . Then if you click on one of the other ones , it clears that one . 
E:  <pop, made by finger from side of mouth>  
B:  Hmm . 
F:  Oh , but it doesn't actually do anything else ? 
A:  OK . 
H:  Doesn't do anything , no , no . But I mean , it 's  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  So you 've implemented radio buttons . 
D:  It looks pretty slick though . That 's great . 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . 
D:  Ca - can  can we fast forward through this conversation ? 
A:  So  
F:  <laugh> Oh , yeah , that 's right . 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh>

G:  <laugh> 
A:  Wait , you you 're going to be  you 're going to be saying , you know , funnier things , so leave it on . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> This is a very sensual thing . 
G:  <mike noise> <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <mike noise> 
F:  Yeah , I think a lot o a lot of us ended up wearing it around your neck and then facing up . 
B:  Hmm . 
F:  I kn and , uh , just because there doesn't seem to be a good way to mount it . 
E:  <unusual rhythmic mouth or tongue noise>  
C:  Maybe this is a little better . 
D:  <mike noise> 
A:  Yeah , I mean  
D:  That 's really nice . 
C:  Boy ! 
E:  <whistle> 
A:  Clearly  I mean , my impression is i if I have to wear this thing , 
A:  you know , more than five minutes , uh , uh , uh , I mean , I  I will be completely affected by it somehow . 
D:  <mike noise> Huh . <mike noise> 
A:  So . 
A:  I wouldn't be  Yeah . Oh . That  that one . The one I tried . I 'd  
F:  This  this thing ? Or  or just that one ? Yeah . 
B:  <breath> 
D:  I mean , on  on the temple 's the pressure ? 
A:  They really press my temples , otherwise my ear channels , otherwise my joints here . I mean , depending where I put it ,  it press different things , 
D:  Uh - huh . 
C:  <mike noise> 
G:  Oh yeah . That would give you a headache . 
E:  What happened ? 
D:  <mike noise> 
E:  <clears throat> 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  but that 's a @ @ fine . I mean  
F:  <inbreath> <mouth> 
D:  I think we have to add that to the  to the form they sign . <laugh> 
E:  <clears throat> 
F:  So  so the  
E:  <clears throat> 
A:  Yeah . So , I mean , this  this thing of course is 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  Yes , that 's right . The medical . 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  I think  
F:  Yeah . 
A:  probably , you know , acoustically more challenging but I like this .  
F:  Oh , yeah . But this is very comfortable . I mean , I  I could wear this without any difficulty . 
A:  Th - 
A:  Is it ? 
G:  Can you convert these ear ones to something comfortable ? I mean , just by 
E:  They have so much pressure at th it 's  
G:  putting little  
A:  But  but there  there I think , is a t you know , 
F:  I  
C:  Yeah , this is just m bad design . This , um , this is  
F:  We c we 'd  we 'd have to buy new ones . 
B:  Mmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
G:  Or j 
E:  <clears throat> 
G:  Yeah , I mean , you can just use the microphone and take the headband off . 
F:  The  the other wa 
D:  <mike noise> 
E:  <clears throat> 
F:  the other way I had it , which might work , is you put one over an ear 
E:  <clears throat> 
C:  <mike noise> 
F:  and then you can adjust the other one . 
D:  Uh - oh . 
F:  And that didn't  that seemed to be pretty  
C:  Ouch . <laugh> 
F:  That doesn't work for you ? 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  No . 
A:  A Anything which is distracting or painful , <laugh> is going to impact negatively with this . 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  Mmm . 
C:  <mike noise> 
G:  But maybe the  
F:  So  so you see how Jane 's wearing it ? 
B:  Mmm . 
F:  That seems to work OK too . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  <mike noise> 
H:  Yeah . 
D:  It 's very comfortable . 
A:  But I mean , but at that point  at that point it wouldn't be much different to  to wear this or that .  
F:  And you just have to bring it up . 
C:  Yeah , go to that . 
B:  <breath> 
E:  <sniff> 
H:  Right , right . 
F:  Well , except you can bring it quite a bit closer to your mouth . 
B:  <breath> 
A:  Hhh .  OK . 
F:  So . 
H:  <mouth> But , uh , yeah , but it 's not such a  it 's not such a directional microphone probably . 
B:  <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
A:  I mean , but probably this is designed in such a way that it should be closer . And this , eh , eh  but this is designed to be worn like this  to be worn like this . 
H:  Yeah . Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . So . 
D:  <mike noise> 
F:  Yeah , we  maybe we should look into  if we can buy a replacement . If they 're eighty bucks , 
D:  Sure . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <breath> 
F:  that might be worth doing cuz they 're very uncomfortable . 
A:  I mean , I really like this . Uh I  I mean , if I have to design the thing , uh I  I would rather , you know , use this type of thing than the other ones . 
C:  <breath> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <mouth> Well , I mean , what you 'd rather do is nothing at all , 
A:  And also i is  
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Wow . 
E:  Just trying to give you a hard transcription task . <laugh> No . I 'm sorry . 
F:  of course , 
F:  but to get  to get a good quality  I mean , if  if you were listening to it downstairs , that one 's quite a bit lower quality . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Hey , whi what  where are @ @ ? <mouth>  
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <breath> 
C:  What are you doing ? <laugh> 
B:  <breath> 
G:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , I noticed that . I noticed that . 
D:  Do you s do you know  Have you studied a click language ? 
F:  So . 
A:  But , you know , that  that might be the challenging part . I mean , because otherwise you are  
D:  I don't @ @  
E:  No , I wish . No . 
D:  Wow . 
E:  No . Just studied phonetics in general . 
F:  Yeah . 
G:  If it didn't  if it didn't hurt , you know , if it was comfortable but you knew it was there , would it bother you ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  I 'll just take   
B:  <breath> 
A:  If it was comfortable  
F:  Yeah . Well  well try this one on . <mike noise>  
A:  OK . 
G:  Because I actually think it sort of makes everybody act a little more professional . 
F:  Because I find this one doesn't bother me at all . 
D:  I didn't know that you could whistle that  You 're a very soft whistler , you 're mostly able to do that without much air at all , aren't you ? 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  OK . 
C:  Actually , I use something like this on  on the telephone and it 's very comfortable . 
G:  Yeah . 
A:  I , uh , 
A:  I , uh , 
F:  I think you forget pretty quick . 
E:  <very high vocal tract whistle>  Yeah , it 's weird . It 's kind of , uh , 
G:  Your telephone , and people use it for cell phones and . 
A:  I mean , no . 
A:  I mean , no . 
H:  Yeah . 
A:  Still , I  I  I mean , I 'm kind of more deaf on this ear , whatever this is on . Uh , I could wear it this way . 
A:  Still , I  I  I mean , I 'm kind of more deaf on this ear , whatever this is on . Uh , I could wear it this way . 
E:  apical - alveolar kind of thing . I don't know . It 's   You know ? 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Right , cuz you 've got  
D:  OK . OK . 
E:  <very high vocal tract whistle>  
D:  Wow , that 's amazing !  
A:  I don't know , I feel distracted . 
A:  I don't know , I feel distracted . 
E:  Get a very high pitch that way too . And you get dogs to d cock their heads and stuff . It 's really good . <laugh> Cuz you can get really high . <laugh> 
H:  Yeah it is , yeah . 
A:  I mean , it 's my impression . I mean , of course there is a lot more work to do with this one but  
A:  I mean , it 's my impression . I mean , of course there is a lot more work to do with this one but  
D:  Oh , how fun ! 
D:  Can you project it pretty well ? I mean  
E:  No . Not too well . Yeah . 
D:  OK . OK . 
F:  <mike noise as [mn038] gives mike back to [me011]>  
D:  But they 're just very , very sensitive . 
F:  Um , I guess the other reason is I used  
A:  I mean if  if you want something really  really nonintrusive , really nonintrusive , really something that  
E:  But it 's that you get enough of the high frequencies . Yeah , that you really get  you really get animals like    <mock gasp> <mock gasp>  
D:  Fascinating ! Wow .  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah .  
B:  <breath> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  Well , I guess my feeling is that this is for collecting a corpus not for an actual end - user application .  
D:  Huh . 
E:  <clears throat very quietly> 
F:  And so I think a little bit of intrusion is not  ridiculous . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
C:  Not for this , for sure . No . I mean , it 's just  But talking in general , yeah , that 's , uh  
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  So  
A:  OK . 
G:  I think you can't do any research otherwise . 
B:  <inbreath> 
A:  Well  
B:  <outbreath> 
B:  <inbreath> What exactly is the purpose of the corpus ? What 's the purpose of the  
F:  Yeah , I agree . 
G:  It 's just  
A:  I mean , you think  you think if you  
F:  Training s Training speech recognition systems . 
G:  It 's too hard . 
G:  It 's too hard without  
A:  Do you think this is going to be too f too  
B:  Right . But it will train them to the microphone characteristics of this c 
G:  I think you should collect both simultaneously . 
E:  <clears throat very quietly> 
F:  We wanna do both . So  so the  the point is that 
H:  <clears throat> 
G:  And  
B:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  if you  if we try , 
G:  It 's gonna be too hard to do it without a  
F:  from the get go , to do it off the PZM , we won't get anything . 
G:  Yeah , forget it . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . Absolutely . I agree . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
H:  <mouth> So  no , I mean , the  
F:  You won't be able to align . You won't be able to segment . You won't be able to do anything . 
A:  Yeah . 
G:  You won't be able to get grants . 
G:  You won't be able to get funding . 
A:  So  
E:  <laugh> 
F:  Right ! <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  No , I 'm serious . 
B:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> Hang on , hang on ! <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
G:  I mean , you won't be able to show any results . 
D:  <mike noise> 
B:  Mmm . 
G:  So . 
H:  Oh , right , right , right . <laugh> 
A:  And with this  with this you 're saying , you are also in that situation ?  
H:  I mean th 
D:  <mike noise> 
E:  <clears throat> 
F:  <mouth> 
B:  <breath> 
F:  Well , I mean , we haven't done the  the detail experiment but just from listening to it , it 's pretty bad , 
D:  <mike noise> 
G:  It was pretty bad . 
D:  <mike noise> 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . 
G:  It takes off quite a lot . 
F:  whereas these are m are 
C:  <breath> 
F:  very good . I mean , that 's why  
B:  <breath> 
C:  Well , yeah , I mean , that 's really like having one of these almost , so . 
H:  <mouth> 
F:  That 's why if you  if you use DragonDictate or  or ViaVoice , or any of those others to do dictation you need to use these . There 's just no other way around it . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
G:  <mouth> Somebody will design a comfortable 
G:  close talking mike . I mean it 's  
G:  there are too many applications to  for them not  to not do that . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Well , and as I said , I find this one  
G:  I mean , it may not look like this but . 
F:  I find this one is no problem at all . The only thing is <mike noise> 
G:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah it 's y 
F:  a little bit of audio  a  a little bit of audio 
G:  Yeah , this one 's fine . 
F:  degradation in one ear , 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
G:  Right . 
F:  and I get a little bit of peripheral vision , but other than that , 
C:  <breath> 
H:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
F:  it 's not bad at all . 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  We could  
F:  Those , on the other hand , are very uncomfortable . 
G:  I 
G:  Yeah , those are pretty bad .  
A:  Yeah , those are really 
F:  So . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Can  can't we buy an expander that you just  <laugh> 
B:  Uh  
A:  bad . 
B:  I 'm actually finding this quite comfortable now that I 've got it  I 've got it just right . It 's just  
F:  That 's right . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  I 'm surviving . Yeah , I uh  
H:  It depends , yeah I 've  
G:  <laugh> 
A:  I think you have , you know , he would . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  I think he 's about to pass out . That 's why  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  U i 
E:  You guys gave up too soon . I think you just get used to it after five minutes . <laugh> 
B:  It must have numbed the areas . 
F:  So I  I guess  
F:  you know , maybe the problem is we got the kid 's version . 
G:  Yeah . 
D:  <mike noise> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  <mike noise> 
H:  No , we got a Japanese version , you know that 's  that 's it , yeah . 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  Sorry . 
A:  And so  and what about this one ? I mean , this thing wearing sideway that  that can ? 
D:  <mike noise> 
H:  Uh the  
D:  <mike noise> 
F:  It 's wired . 
H:  <mouth> It 's funny , I li I kind of like this . So it actually gets most of its strength from   
H:  from you know , the fact this thing 's stuck in your ear . 
G:  Oh , this would drive me crazy . I absolutely  people are very picky about this . 
B:  Mmm . 
H:  And , yeah , uh I  and originally  
A:  Oh . 
E:  <clears throat> 
A:  D uh does it have a speaker ? Does it have a speaker or  ?  
E:  Mmm . 
H:  Oh yeah , it does . 
H:  When I bought those things I originally got this version , cuz Plantronics makes uh you know , an in - the - ear one . 
A:  Uh  Uh - huh . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  And I really liked it but , other people didn't . So it just depends . I guess , you know , I 've 
H:  been using in - the - ear Walkman headphones , for you know , a long time , so I 'm kind of used to that weird sensation having something stuck in my ear . 
B:  <breath> 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <mike noise> 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
H:  But if , uh ,  
G:  But that 's painful . I can't  
F:  Whereas I used speech recognition for about four years using one of these , so I 'm used to this . 
H:  If you 're not used  
H:  <laugh> 
H:  <mike noise> 
A:  You do . 
F:  I don't use it anymore . Uh , my hands got better so I stopped using it . But , uh . 
A:  Y 
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  OK . 
F:  So , for about four years I used DragonDictate and NaturallySpeaking 
A:  OK . 
C:  Really ? So you could actually produce like code or  ?  
F:  to do all my work . 
A:  Oh , you 're a  
F:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah ? 
F:  It was really a pain . 
B:  Code ! Right . 
F:  Yeah , but I didn't have a choice . I mean , I couldn't type . So , 
C:  Wow . 
B:  That 's an interesting language model I 'm sure . 
C:  Uh . 
A:  So  
C:  Huh . 
F:  uh . 
H:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  The market is a captive market .  
F:  Yeah . 
H:  Right . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Mmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm , yeah . 
F:  In fact , when I first came back to grad school that was a project I wanted to work on , " voice environments for programmers " , but we couldn't get any funding for it and my hands got better . So 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  that 's how I ended up working on this project instead . 
H:  Hmm . 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  Huh . 
A:  Good .

F:  <mouth> Anyway . 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <outbreath> 
H:  So , yeah . I don't know . 
F:  <mouth> So  so what are you guys doing ? What 's your project ? 
H:  Yeah . 
C:  <breath> 
A:  Well , basically , 
A:  the  the  the original project looks a lot like , you know , the  the p your project . I mean , basically we set up with this , uh , 
C:  <breath> 
A:  idea of 
C:  <breath> 
A:  the  the  the meeting  the  the mediated spaces idea in general and then incr incarnated in this room that will be mediated somehow by , you know , a computer to access information , to help along the meeting , and will be like two kind of 
C:  <breath> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <clears throat> 
A:  eh , f main functions . One 
D:  <mike noise> 
A:  is the interaction with the computer which , as you said , you know , is your interaction with the PDA in your case , 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <two mouth-popping sounds>  
A:  where you kind of query it to ask for information , et cetera . At the same time , 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  our process is somehow , 
A:  you know , getting all this multi - channel information , 
E:  <high pitched bird-like whistle>  
A:  doing some sort of , you know , 
A:  cross , eh , channel , you know , cancellation and 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  transcribing the individual streams , 
A:  not necessarily in real time . 
A:  And the idea is y you can eventually after the meeting 
A:  query , you know , previous meetings and  
F:  Right . 
A:  and there is all this work on transcription , 
E:  <two slightly gulp-like sounds>  
A:  similar probably to what we do in Switchboard but with 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  better bandwidth , 
A:  you know , but worse , <laugh> 
A:  you know , environmental conditions . 
F:  Worse acoustics .  Yeah . 
A:  An - and then , 
A:  you know , there is , all  all these issues about 
A:  processing all this information , you know , 
F:  Mmm . 
A:  transcription , but then using , you know , prosody information to better , you know , segment , endpoint . 
B:  <breath> 
B:  <breath> 
A:  Eh , also using topic segmentation to help better classification of information or extraction of information . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  I mean , 
A:  we didn't dare to say it will be just in a PDA you throw in the middle of a meeting . <laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  I 'm beginning to feel my heart beat now . 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . So . Yeah . This is  this is  
B:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  That  that was daring . 
F:  The PDA one is very , very ambitious . And it 's also  it 's depending on 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
F:  not only 
F:  that  Uh , not only does it depend on IRAM 
C:  Hmm . Mmm . 
F:  taping out and working as specified , it also depends on writing vectorized speech recognition algorithms which is non - trivial . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  So . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  But , you know , uh let 's assume somehow the compu 
A:  processor power is going to be there . 
A:  Whatever . I mean , initially you may do a super - computer for the transcription ,  real time and then  
F:  <mouth> Right , I mean , so  so one of our  
B:  Mmm . 
H:  Right . 
F:  our back off policy on that if  if there 's problems with IRAM is it 'll be a wireless link , 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
F:  right ? You 'll dump the  the  dump the audio wirelessly to a network somewhere 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . I  I mean , ou uh we  we kind of set up this concept like 
F:  and you 'll do the recognition . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  a year and a half ago . And at that time I said , 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  you know , we said , 
A:  " don't worry about the  the compute power " . I mean , it will be somewhere ,  you know . 
F:  Hmm . 
H:  Yeah . 
F:  Well , we  we  we 've had a lot of discussions about it and I think 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  maybe  I think t to some extent it comes down to a religious issue . My religion is personal computers are good and terminal mainframes are bad . 
F:  And so if you can get away with it , I don't want to have a terminal in my hand and a mainframe somewhere else . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
F:  Um , the  too many things to cont 
F:  can go wrong and you lack control . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  I think the PC revolution has shown how good it is if you can have the power yourself . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
F:  And so the IRAM project provided us a method of 
F:  having a very powerful thing in your hand . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And so we wanna see what we can do with it but 
F:  we 'd also don't want the project to actually 
F:  completely depend on it . 
F:  So , 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  the project will go forward regardless of whether IRAM works or not . 
A:  I mean , our approach , somehow , I mean , 
E:  <mouth> 
A:  I believe it 's probably , you know , complimentary in many ways , 
A:  is to focus on the actual deep technology 
A:  that we have somehow in speech . And basically , 
F:  Right . 
A:  make progress on , you know , the algorithms . And then , you know , it will run somewhere . I mean , 
E:  <breath> <mouth> 
A:  as you said , to  I mean , we would like the idea to have it there but  
F:  So w 
A:  but our focus is 
A:  basically to develop the algorithms , to 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  push the state of the art 
A:  on this transcription task . 
A:  And , uh , the other task 
C:  <breath> 
A:  probably is also , you know , challenging the comp 
F:  So a 
F:  Right . 
A:  the  the querying , uh , the command , control , or , you know , I mean , doing that in natural language . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <mouth> Right , so the  so for us 
F:  the Meeting Recorder project 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  has a very similar 
A:  Uh - huh . 
F:  uh , approach . 
F:  Me personally , for my P H D thesis , I 'm sorta doing the other way and seeing 
F:  how much speech recognition can I do on this little 
F:  unit . 
A:  Oh . I see . You really are challenged to do that , 
F:  Yep . 
A:  to put as much power as you can in the PDA . 
F:  Yep . 
A:  OK , uh , our approach is , you know , we do whatever is necessary 
A:  to do it 
A:  and , you know , some of it may go into something , 
A:  depending on , you know , your scalable power . 
F:  That 's right . So  so the  
F:  As I said , the Meeting Recorder project , so we have people at UW , people here working on robust algorithms that will be running on work stations . They won't be running on IRAM . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And then what I 'm trying to do is see how much of it I can put on IRAM . 
A:  OK . 
B:  Hmm . 
H:  Mmm . 
A:  Well , you know , is , eventually y you will get all this 
H:  Yeah , it 's not  
A:  you know , sc eh , 
A:  higher and higher , you know , 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  powers in these portable things . 
H:  Yeah . 
A:  So as long as you have 
H:  <clears throat> 
A:  enough 
A:  algorithms and technology to do something better if you have more processing power . 
F:  Right . 
A:  I mean , 
A:  the  the situation now in the speech community is that , 
E:  <mike noise> 
E:  <yawn> 
A:  you know , there is some boundary , some limit in the 
A:  performance . And no matter how much processing you throw in , you don't get 
F:  That 's right , we don't even know what to do with it . We don't need to n 
A:  any better . And so we are trying to push that . 
B:  Mmm . 
F:  Right . 
H:  <mouth> Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  And then you have room to port whatever you can to , you know , smaller devices . 
F:  Yep . 
B:  You get the wrong answer quicker basically , don't you ? Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , we don't even know what to do with their cycles . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <breath> 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  Right .  
A:  Sorry I interrupt you . 
C:  <breath> 
A:  <uncodeable> 
F:  We w 
H:  I was gonna say that , 
H:  um , you know , in terms  So , Adam has a  you know , a particular agenda , 
H:  um , but obviously there are lots of other things . And you know , it 's the way that a project like this works so that 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  a group like this where we have students coming in , you know  It 's  it 's meant to be sort of a long term thing that 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  will get us data and people will be able to come along and look at different aspects of it . So it 's not clear , you know , whether s someone at UW 's gonna look at , um , beam - forming or whatever . 
C:  <breath> 
C:  <breath> 
G:  <mike noise> 
H:  But , you know , 
H:  it 's goo it 's a good property for us that there are a lot of different things you could do with it , and so it 's  We  we haven't thought it through . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  Yeah . Always @ @ . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
H:  But that 's OK , you know , it 's kind of  it 's fair enough . 
F:  Like  
A:  Yeah . 
F:  As an example , we had a visitor who was working on speaker ID , acoustic change detection . 
H:  Yeah . 
A:  Huh . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
F:  And he has a very good system for that and  and he wants to use this corpus . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  Exactly . I mean , it 's one of the areas where Kemal is going to work , like , you know , speaker tracking , and speaker ID . I mean , 
F:  So . 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <breath> 
A:  you want to know . I mean , if you have the people wired individually it probably is easier . 
F:  Oh , it  th what 's nice about  
A:  But  but you know , in  in the other situation , you know . 
B:  <breath> 
H:  Yeah .  
F:  What 's nice about getting this corpus is , i with the people wired you have a excellent baseline . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  Right ? You have a very easy problem and you can get the right answer , 
H:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
H:  You can get the ground truth . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  to ground truth very easily and then you can degrade it by using the P Z Ms , you can degrade it further by using those things . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
F:  And  and really see what you can do with a real system . So . 
C:  Yeah , for example , when you go to your PDA system it 's , uh , really an awful  open problem to determine how many speakers there are and where they change turns , uh . 
F:  That 's right . 
B:  Mmm . 
H:  Yeah . 
F:  That 's right . 
C:  That 's actually being ad That 's one of the problems that 's being addressed at this year 's evaluation , uh , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Oh , really ? They 're doing 
C:  which is taking place right now , actually . 
D:  Mmm . 
F:  an unknown number ? 
C:  Right . You  you do need to figure out the number of speakers in the waveform . 
F:  That 's good . 
H:  Which , uh  Wha - Evaluation of  
B:  Right . 
C:  This is a NIST evaluation . Um . 
H:  Of the speaker ID or something ? 
B:  This i 
C:  Eh , right , speaker verification . 
H:  And what 's the  what  wha So what has the data been ? 
H:  What  what  what data are they using ? What is the  
C:  Uh , Switchboard . 
H:  Oh , OK . 
C:  Switchboard and , uh  
C:  I  I  
C:  We  Well , I mean  <clears throat> 
C:  We will also run so some part of that , uh , evaluation too but probably not that segmentation part . 
B:  <breath> 
C:  But I don't know if they are using a 
C:  different data for that . But I mean , it 's  s 
C:  While I say " Switchboard " , s eh , of course there 's <very short laugh> only two speakers . 
H:  Yeah . 
C:  But , um , I don't know how they , uh , actually went about . Um . 
C:  Cuz they were saying some  some  some  up to eight speakers . Maybe they  
B:  <breath> 
H:  <mouth> 
C:  maybe some other data for that part , you 're right . 
H:  Uh - huh . 
F:  I mean , just mixing it wouldn't work because the channel characteristics are too different . 
C:  No , no . 
B:  Mmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  So , uh , what we  what we were working on here was parts of Broadcast News . 
C:  Right . 
E:  <sniff> 
E:  <clears throat> 
F:  And so that  that 's a slightly strange task because they tend to be long segments . But they were  
F:  they were parts that were interviews 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  that he worked on . And , uh . 
C:  No . We 've also , uh , s done some of that as , uh , eh , 
F:  Right . 
C:  um , I mean , I have a so  small , uh , hacked up system which sort of , for  for the Broadcast News determines the approximate number of speakers and actually assigns some names to them . 
E:  <clears throat> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  This is something we did for the MAESTRO project , uh , for  for Rick . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  But , um , uh , 
C:  yeah , uh , for  for Broadcast News it works much better actually . It 's , uh , 
F:  Yeah , he had  he got very good results . 
C:  you do get eh , like in an interview , uh , nice long segments and  
E:  <yawn> 
F:  Right . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Yeah , so I  I tried his 
E:  <clears throat> 
F:  on  his system on the Meeting Recorder stuff , 
B:  <breath> 
F:  um , but of course we don't have any trained 
F:  neural nets or , uh  
F:  So  so his system was based on our hybrid neural net system 
B:  Hmm . 
F:  that we use for speech recognition . 
F:  And so , uh , I was using the Broadcast News nets on 
F:  this data . 
F:  So of course it didn't do  
A:  Hmm . 
F:  didn't do t tremendously well . 
F:  And then the other problem also was that it doesn't handle overlap very well , his algorithm . 
G:  Yeah , I mean Broadcast News is for this third - party listener , right ? 
F:  Hmm ? 
F:  Right . 
H:  Right . 
G:  So they , you know if you were listening to an interview that sounded like this , you know , you 'd turn off your radio . 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yes . 
F:  That 's right , with all the i interrupts . 
H:  Right . 
G:  So it 's just got a d it 's a lot easier . 
F:  Yes . 
A:  I think there are some programs in TV . I 've been trying to get this from  
A:  something like this from , you know , public 
A:  cast uh w eh eh . 
D:  There are  there are some with a lot of overlap . Yeah . 
A:  Um uh yeah , and they  but they  they do it somehow . 
A:  They clean it up . I notice that they  they s 
A:  they sa have some help with control of 
F:  Mixing , yeah . 
A:  what person to pick up . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  I  I mean there is some program at midnight somewhere . It 's a bunch of , like , four people discussing and they , it 's a lot clean . 
C:  <breath> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  Well  
F:  Like McLaughlin. 
B:  <breath> 
A:  Yeah . I yeah , probably . 
D:  But the  but the worst  the worst case is Politically Incorrect where they don't really make any adjustments at all . And  and it 's hard to even follow what they 're saying . It 's just  it 's truly  totally overlapped . 
F:  But yeah , they  they have  
C:  <breath> 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  Uh - huh .  
E:  <laugh> 
A:  Uh - huh . 
B:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . Uh , yeah . I 've heard that  that  that sometimes . But it 's  it 's OK , though . 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  I think in  in  
B:  It 's still in the forma it 's still in the format which is slightly more formal I think than , you know , 
A:  So you don't think they  they fill it at all with any , you know  
B:  completely informal conversational speech . 
D:  OK . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Oh , I 'm sure they do . They  I 'm sure they have an audio engineer in the back . 
A:  They  I am pretty sure they do . I mean , it 's  
B:  They will do , a bit . Yeah . 
D:  OK , you guys are more in business that I am . 
A:  it 's  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  it 's still , you know , understandable . 
H:  But it @ @  bu 
C:  <breath> 
B:  The host probably gets , uh , you know  gets a little bit more . 
H:  Yeah . 
D:  My feeling is that when I  when I  when I 've seen that show it 's like there  there are sometimes people who totally take over the floor and other people are trying to get in , and they can never  never get access . 
B:  Gets a little boost . <breath> 
E:  <laugh> 
E:  <mike noise> 
E:  <breath> 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
D:  It depends very much on the mix . 
F:  Well , but that that 's different than an audio engineer fiddling with the mixing parameters . 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah , it 's just , I  I know that there are periods where two people are talking in  t at the same time and you 're only able to hear 
F:  Right ? 
A:  At the same time . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
D:  um , parts of the weaker voice . 
D:  And , you know , that 's  It 's a style . It 's a style . Uh , but I  but I 've seen debates where  And you know it 's apparently engaging people . Uh , it 's been going on for a while now . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
B:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
E:  <mike noise> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , in many cultures it 's not bad manners to  
C:  <breath> 
A:  to speak on top of another one .  
C:  <mouth> 
C:  <breath> 
G:  Yeah , I was thinking , if Transcriber were invented in Italy or something ,  
D:  Sure . Absolutely . Yeah . 
A:  I it somehow  
B:  <laugh> 
G:  it would have been handling multiple  in New York . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  Or in New York  or in New York , high involve  high in high involvement style . 
A:  Yeah . I mean , could be reassuring , you know ? Keep going , keep going . 
G:  Right . 
B:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  High involvement . That 's  that 's a 
C:  <breath> 
D:  Yeah . 
F:  good way of saying it . <laugh> 
C:  <breath> 
D:  That 's what it 's called . Yeah . 
topic_description:	group projects, areas of overlap


F:  So what do we do ? 
B:  <breath> 
A:  Well , I mean , 
F:  It seems like there 's a lot of overlap between our projects , so it would be nice to work together . 
A:  I  I belie I believe there is a lot of overlap and would be great to com to  to 
B:  There i yeah , indeed . <laugh> 
C:  <breath> 
A:  basically take advantage of that to  to make a synergy more than an overlap , and , you know , help each other . 
C:  <breath> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  <breath> 
E:  We  
A:  I  I believe each group has , you know , depths 
B:  <breath> 
E:  <clears throat> 
A:  in  in different , uh , areas , so . 
A:  I mean , we clearly 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  c should collaborate 
C:  <breath> 
F:  So is your intention 
A:  for the best of everybody . 
F:  to start collecting some meeting data ? 
E:  <mouth popping sound> 
A:  Uh , 
A:  I , you know  
A:  There are no final  I mean , the official decisions I guess 
C:  <breath> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  have to be made 
A:  in terms of resources to that . My personal opinion , if you ask , is that we should because 
A:  the only way  I mean , if I learn anything on speech in  for the last , you know @ @  
F:  More data is better .   
F:  <laugh> 
A:  No , no , no . Um , you need a task 
F:  Oh . 
C:  <breath> 
A:  to really , you know , improve your system 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
topic_description:	collaboration brainstorm


A:  for that particular environment . So right now we are focusing our research 
A:  on doing evaluation type of , you know , 
C:  <breath> 
A:  in incremental 
B:  <breath> 
A:  you know , improvements . 
A:  So , 
A:  Switchboard , for instance . They have five is kind of  OK , you have two people talking , it 's the closest thing . But 
A:  we really should move into the  you know , data that reflects as much as possible , the real 
A:  scenario . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  And that that 's a way to improve . And then you do improvement on that particular database . 
F:  Right . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <clears throat> 
A:  So even if we don't collect the data to train models , 
A:  we should collect data at least to evaluate progress . 
B:  <breath> 
topic_description:	model evaluation, data training


F:  So what would be nice is if we could , 
B:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
F:  uh , converge on  on formats and conventions , and so on , <mouth> and software . I mean , just  
B:  <breath> 
A:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
G:  And  and software too . I mean , things like rewriting this Transcriber tool and thi that  That shouldn't be re redone . 
B:  I think that 's the op 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
H:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
G:  And the transcription conventions  
F:  I , uh  uh  It shouldn't be done . <laugh> 
E:  You 'd mentioned there was some possibility that somewhere else is going to  you might contract out to do the transcription ? 
F:  Yes . We 're talking about that right now . I 'm not sure how much I should say about it . So that the , uh  
E:  Can y 
G:  <breath> 
E:  Yeah , that 's what I was wondering . OK . 
F:  there 's some possibility that we 're gonna get a third c party company to do the transcription for us 
A:  Uh - huh ? 
F:  in exchange for the corpus . 
B:  Is that in exchange for access to the c 
F:  Right , 
B:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  and  
topic_description:	sharing formats, conventions, tools


A:  So , on one question . I mean , uh , this  this thing is also for you , 
C:  <breath> 
A:  made on internal funding ? Or I mean , I know you 're applying for some DARPA funding . 
E:  <mike noise> 
E:  <mike noise> 
F:  We have a little bit of DARPA . 
E:  <mike noise> 
A:  Oh , you already got some . 
F:  Uh , under the communicator project . 
A:  OK . OK . 
F:  So  so that 's part of it . And then , uh , part of it 's on the IRAM group . 
A:  OK . 
F:  IRAM group is paying for part of it . And then part of it 's just ICSI general funds , 
E:  <mike noise> 
E:  <breath> 
A:  OK . 
F:  is paying for it as well . 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  And you 're saying some of the infrastructure is , um , the A T - andT video conferencing . 
F:  The infrastructure , yeah , they  th they were paid  but they don't expect anything in return . They 're just being very nice and 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  So pi 
B:  A free gift . Yeah . 
F:  good neighbors and  
F:  and so they  they basically wanted stuff anyway . And then they just sort of allowed us to direct the audio portion of it to what we needed . 
A:  OK . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
F:  So .

G:  And then , uh , UW  I don't know if you mentioned this 
G:  at the beginning but , 
G:  the  Mari 's group , 
G:  Mari and Morgan  I th I think what happened historically , um  Oh , I don't know how much I 'm supposed to say if this is being recorded . 
E:  <clears throat> 
B:  <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  Well , anyway , uh . <laugh> 
B:  Should we stop recording ?

D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  Mmm , huh . Um . 
A:  This would never go away ! 
G:  There 's funding , eh . <laugh> 
H:  I  I can pause if you wanna say something that  that 's sensitive . I mean  
A:  <laugh> 
G:  It 's  No , it 's OK . 
H:  OK . 
G:  Um , I 'll tell you later . <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . <laugh>

G:  Sorry , listeners . 
B:  <laugh>

H:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  That 's <inbreath> to the listeners . <laugh> 
G:  Too bad you weren't here . 
A:  You know , maybe thousands of people are listening to us now because it 's in the future , but , you know , sequentially maybe thousands . 
D:  <sigh>  
G:  <laugh> Well , it does sort of make you  
D:  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . 
B:  That 's right . It could be . 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  It 's  
G:  it 's like you 're behind closed doors but you have to  
B:  This could be the most popular corpus . Yeah . 
H:  <laugh> 
H:  That 's right . It 's so funny , like we close the door and it 's  <laugh> 
G:  Normally a note taker would know not to do that . OK . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Ha ! 
D:  What I can do is say , la - la - la - la - la - la - la - la - la . <laugh>  
H:  Yeah . 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  But that 's only on one sp 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  I know , but we can blend it for the public . <laugh> 
G:  Anyway , UW is getting some funding from DARPA on Communicator , 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh . 
G:  uh , with  and that 's sorta how I got involved . I mean , Morgan wanted me to sort of 
E:  <mike noise> 
G:  do something . I guess , I  My interest was sort of in the language and dialogue m modeling , and the turn overlaps , and 
E:  <mike noise> 
G:  how to apply 
G:  you know , a language model , a dialogue act model to actually feed down to do better recognition . So not just  Because I think it will be really difficult 
G:  to do just speech recognition and then try to get some kind of meaning out of it . I think you have to have some kind of structure 
B:  Hmm . 
F:  Feedback .  
G:  from the  I mean  Yeah . 
G:  And  
G:  So knowing that an utterance is really short and low volume , you should be able to figure out it 's a backchannel and things like that . 
G:  Anyway , apparently , and you guys know more than I do , 
G:  there was some talk that you were gonna build a portable version of this 
E:  <air puff, twice>  
G:  so that Mari 's group  
H:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  I  I mean , there 's not a huge amount of funding in the way , 
G:  you know , Mari 
G:  probably won't be able to do a ton of 
G:  collection . But 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  I was thinking if there were sort of prototype 
B:  Hmm . 
H:  Yeah . 
G:  collection devices or standards , then we could 
G:  share data . And we would have like a 
H:  Yeah . 
G:  <mouth> monopoly on that . Mar - I mean , once you get three sites 
H:  Yeah . 
G:  collecting data and each site can demo it , and say it 's at the other two sites . 
H:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
G:  Which was  would be really good for funding purposes . 
F:  Right . 
G:  But that  I don't really know . That 's what I heard from Morgan , so . 
H:  Yeah , I know . That  that 's  
F:  We  we talked about that and  
G:  Is that  
H:  That 's  that  that  that portable thing 's been mentioned . 
F:  It was  
G:  <mouth> And according to Morgan it 's like 
G:  happening and  
F:  Well i w when I spoke with him he  he really just said it was a money issue . 
H:  But that was  
F:  That it 's certainly not any sort of intellectual property issue <laugh> where we 're perfectly willing to give people 
G:  OK . 
H:  Oh , well . <laugh> 
F:  those boxes . The boxes are cheap . 
G:  Right . 
F:  Um , but , you know , can they afford to get 
F:  a six channel Sony wireless and can they afford the P Z Ms , and that sort of stuff . 
G:  And he said something about a portable  You know , that they wouldn't have a dedicated room or something like  like you guys have here . 
F:  Well  
H:  I think  I think 
H:  somebody 's got a unit which is something like the ADAT or something , which , 
H:  you know , it 's a device which will record onto tape , uh , multiple channels . 
F:  Oh . 
H:  And so I think that was  that was gonna be and we were g 
H:  Like someone actually has this knocking around . 
F:  <mouth> 
H:  Some company that we were gonna  uh , was gonna lend it to us , something like this . 
G:  OK . 
F:  This is  
F:  this is the same  same company that may be doing the transcripts for us , may be giving us  
G:  <laugh> 
H:  The same  it might be the same company or it might be a different company . There 's another company which also has a  apparently has purchased a very  
B:  Right . 
F:  may be giving us , uh - huh . 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  a big multi - channel thing . 
H:  Um , and so if we  if they could lend us that , we could imagine doing these kinds of recordings . I mean that you know , that like you said , the fundamental thing is 
C:  <breath> 
H:  it doesn't have to be this hardware . It 's just the idea that you have multiple channels to synchronize data and then the post - processing can be uniform and stuff like that , so . 
G:  Right . 
B:  Mmm . 
G:  Right , and it doesn't have  You know , different sides can do different pieces of it I think . 
H:  Right . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  And it would also  it would be really nice to be able to do it in other rooms , cuz otherwise we 're gonna learn a lot about this air conditioning . <laugh> 
G:  And  
G:  Exactly . Right . 
H:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> That was , w <outbreath> 
G:  And you 'll get different kinds of conversations and different interactions , and 
B:  <breath> 
F:  Yes . 
G:  I think just having three different sites 
B:  <breath> 
F:  That 'd be great . 
G:  would be great 
F:  Yeah , I agree . 
G:  just for sort of diversity , and so . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
topic_description:	collaboration with UW, DARPA, portable version


E:  <breath> Well , <outbreath> one thing that Horacio h hadn't mentioned is , um , 
H:  <mouth> 
H:  <clears throat> 
B:  <breath> 
E:  I mean , y you were talking about 
E:  uh the same  the same sort of idea of just collecting a meeting and  and looking at it afterwards . But the  the thing that I 'm interested in , and I 'm probably the one who 's gonna start doing the collection ,  um , 
B:  <breath> 
E:  <mouth> is e is having this situation where people are talking to each other and talking to 
E:  a computer in the machine  in  in the room .  
H:  Right . 
E:  Um , 
E:  and 
E:  so that 's probably  that 's probably what  
E:  u 
B:  That 's gonna be @ @ .  
E:  that 's certainly what 's gonna come out of , uh , of our group first . 
F:  So  so are you gonna m uh , i is there gonna be some sort of mark for that ? 
E:  Uh um . 
E:  And it  
G:  <inbreath>  
F:  I mean , are they gonna say , " Computer , bring up a web page on  " or  ?  
E:  Well , so , you know , what we 're  we 're basically doing is  is waiting to look at the pilot and see what people wanna do but 
F:  Uh - huh . 
E:  it 's going all be Wizard of Oz at first . So we 're gonna let them do what they wanna do first and then see if we should 
F:  Oh , I see . 
E:  um , you know , subsequent things . Try to  try to constrain them or not constrain them . Or try  try to figure that out . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I 'm just thinking , from a discourse point of view it 'd be very interesting to somehow mark 
H:  Right .  
H:  <laugh> 
F:  " I 'm talking to the computer " . 
H:  No , it has to be  
E:  <mouth> 
H:  has to be error complete . So the computer has to  
G:  Yeah , but you know what ? They don't say when they stop . 
E:  That 's one of them  
F:  Right . 
E:  Pardon ? 
G:  They don't say , 
G:  you know , " I 'm done , Computer " . They only mark the beginnings . 
H:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  Well , there might be a different style of , um  a different , actually , style of interaction . Yeah . 
E:  e 
G:  So , it  uh  there are very  
E:  and it 's all of these things  
F:  " Computer , show me a web page on X , " return . <laugh> 
E:  i i is a g 
E:  It is exactly these things that I mentioned . This is  these are the main things that I 'm interested in . Exactly these . When  when  do you know when you 're starting and when you know you 're ending . 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
G:  <mike sound> 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  Very interesting . <mike sounds> 
G:  And actually Mari 's  
H:  No , but  No but , y 
H:  But it 's like , you know , if it really was an intelligent assistant sitting there you could say , 
E:  <clears throat> 
H:  " Oh , perhaps the computer could show us this . " And you 'd be talking to someone else but the computer 's meant to be listening , and so saying , 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  " Oh , it means me . " You know , " I shou 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  I should  I should do something now . " 
F:  Are you talking to me ? <laugh> Are you talking to me ? <laugh> 
B:  Yes , certainly . 
D:  <mouth> 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  But there might be , uh , neat ways you can do this that are not natural but they become very easy , and that  
D:  So like saying , like " Hal ? " <laugh>  
B:  Mmm . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  So . 
E:  Yeah . So . Right . So we wanna  we wanna look at exactly those sorts of things . 
B:  Mmm ! 
G:  I  I think , yeah . 
A:   
B:   
C:   
D:   
E:   
F:   
G:   
H:   
A:  Erase that part .  
E:  of  of us , at least in the beginning , is gonna have a number of different characteristics . It 's not going to be natural . It 's not gonna be a regular meeting . It 's gonna be an artificial situation cuz we 're gonna have to , you know , mock up some back - end . 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Um . 
E:  So the kinds of , you know  the kinds of speech is  the speech is gonna be slightly different . People are gonna be in an unnatural task . We 're  we 're t gonna be trying to figure out how they 're gonna  
A:  <inbreath>  
G:  But you can still collect the multiple microphones in a similar way and transcribe , and th 
E:  But <breath-laugh>  
E:  But we will have the , you know  We 'll  
B:  Mmm . 
H:  So the  
E:  we 'll have all this  all the m microphones set up all the same . 
G:  That 'd be cool actually . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  I mean , that 's the question . If  if we are collecting these at different sites , different kinds of tasks , different people , 
H:  what is there that 's gonna be uniform about this collection ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Right . 
H:  And part of it will be , well , this combination of close talking and uh , 
B:  Mmm . 
H:  and uh , environmental mikes . 
H:  And  and then part of it will just be the data presentation , you know , maybe if  if we have common transcription standards and , you know , that it 's all transcribed or 
H:  there 's  there 's some integration of the standards thing . 
E:  Right . 
H:  But I mean I u u 
B:  <breath> 
H:  as long as that makes sense , then it 's nice to have a variety of tasks , right ? To have sort of , you know , different  
E:  And  Yeah . And if your task is to just sort of , you know , generally do , um , summary and , uh  
G:  Yeah , I mean , I think the formats would be similar . 
H:  Right . 
E:  and large vocabulary speech recognition over the thing , then it doesn't matter that much which , 
E:  uh , that there 's much a difference . 
H:  Yeah . 
G:  But I think having the  
D:  Hmm . 
G:  the idea of the computer sort of in there forces you to create a  
G:  a log file format that can handle 
G:  these other devices . I mean , you were talking about the Penn  and   
H:  Right . Right . 
G:  So 
G:  I  I think it 's  
G:  the formatting is really one of the biggest  
F:  XML , that solves everything . <laugh> 
G:  issues . You know , not  not the f transcript formatting but the audio formatting and the 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Uh - huh . 
G:  sort of 
G:  figuring out how to synchronize all of these , 
G:  um , pieces . 
F:  That 's right . We 're gonna make  
G:  And what kind of software you can use for post - processing all of them . 
H:  Yeah . 
F:  Right . Someone will make some assumption that 's different than 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  someone else . And then we suddenly won't be able to interoperate . 
G:  Yeah , which i 
B:  Well , just  just the fact that people are making different assumptions is quite an interesting problem . 
F:  Yep . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  You know , it 's quite an interesting issue . 
F:  So that 's something we should try to  
B:  That brings up  Mmm . 
G:  Yeah .

F:  I I 'm not sure what  wh I mean what 's a good solution than that other than trying to keep in touch with each other . 
H:  But  yeah . 
H:  Well , i w if we 're gonna have  if we 're gonna  there 's an opportunity to share tools , right ? The - if we  
F:  Right . 
A:  We could have like , you know , some periodic meetings , and like , uh , 
B:  Mmm . 
G:  Yeah , or phone meetings , or even  
F:  Yeah . 
A:  phone meetings or something . 
G:  Or meetings like this with  about the meetings . You know , with a  
F:  Uh - huh . 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , I mean , meetings like this are good because we can actually record them . 
A:  Yeah . <laugh> At the same time we contribute to the <laugh> database 
G:  with a telephone . 
F:  Yep , 
B:  Yeah , contribute the data . 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  absolutely . 
G:  No , I 'm serious . 
A:  collection ,

F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
H:  That 's right .  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  But it will be all documented . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <breath> 
G:  Sorry . <laugh> 
B:  Yes .  
E:  Yeah , actually we could do that at our site too even though that 's not what I 'm normally gonna be collecting , but there 's no reason we can't collect that , and , uh , then you 'd have a more  
G:  Right . 
F:  Right . 
E:  m your normal kind of meeting . 
topic_description:	arranging between-group meetings


F:  So  
F:  When you 're talking about your artificial meetings , i they are gonna be goal directed , though . So they 're gonna s say , you 're  you 're having a meeting to do this . 
G:  Right . 
B:  <breath> 
E:  They 're going to be goal directed . 
E:  You 're supposed to  Yeah , you know . You 're supposed to  you 're  a budget meeting or something and you have a spreadsheet up there , and everybody has to sort of work out the  you know , some particular goal of where to p allocate money . And they can t ask the computer to 
B:  <breath> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  switch things around in different columns or something like that . But everybody  s 
E:  and acs actually a o another characteristic is that we 're only dealing with three people . 
F:  Oh . <laugh> So that will be different . 
E:  Um . 
E:  Yeah . So . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  How is that ? Three peop total ? 
E:  We 're gonna start with just three people , yeah . 
B:  Is that the channel limitation cutting in ? 
E:  Um , I think it 's mainly  It 's partly channel limitation because we wanna  we wanna double mike everybody . 
B:  Mmm . 
E:  Um , it 's also to a large extent , um  
H:  Oh , right . 
F:  Oh . 
B:  <breath> 
E:  And we have eight channels . Um . 
E:  It 's also I think , uh , e e sort of what came up I think when even Liz was , uh , involved a little while ago with  and Christine I think just in terms of the 
E:  thinking of the subjects and trying to have enough people . We sort of wanted to , you know , encourage like everybody to talk , try to figure out some way that everybody would be able to participate and  
B:  <breath> 
F:  So if  
G:  Yeah . 
F:  You 're double miking everyone , so that 's a close talking and a lapel , and then two environmental mikes , is that right ? 
E:  A g 
B:  Two of @ @ . Yeah . 
E:  Yes , that was  that was the idea . Uh , but 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  M 
E:  I don't know , that was , you know , w 
G:  Hmm . 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  we 're not uh planning to do anything with  with all that like right away . So if there were  is there  you know , we  h we 're happy to take input on that . 
F:  Right . 
H:  Wha - 
D:  Is it the three , I see , mm - hmm . 
F:  Well , if you ha m u eh  
B:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  And also , I very much wanna find out about the , you know , the specs on the board that you have in the ma in the  i in the PCI card cuz I think we might wanna go with that . 
H:  <clears throat> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
D:  I wanna ask one question though . So is  is it the same three people each time or a different three people ? 
E:  Yeah .  
E:  No , no , we 're ho we 're hoping to just bring in different groups of three people apiece . 
D:  OK , OK . That 's good . 
B:  And do you have the same agenda , although there 's a goal ? Is there one goal or several goals ? 
B:  Because that 'll would be more interesting data if there is like  <inbreath> 
E:  Uh . 
E:  In a given  in a given meeting ? <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  I mean , a budget meeting is a classic example , of where every comes in pursuit of a different goal .  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah , yeah . 
E:  What we 're try what we 're trying to do is not make it too  eh  you know , not make it too , um , ar artificial . You know , not like say , " OK , mmm , let 's role play . Your , y " you know , " you do this , you wanna  " but rather give them an actual task . 
B:  Right . 
C:  Well , there can be like a problem solution kind of thing where they would actually , you know  they have to come to one solution . 
E:  So actually have  
E:  Yeah , and they all just have their own  they just happen to have their own opinions . And another possible thing that we 're thinking of is something like , uh , you know , we have these regular Wednesday lunches and you gotta plan a menu , right ? 
B:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
A:  S

A:  So  so , I  One question . 
H:  Yeah . 
A:  I  I mean , I haven't been in these , 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  uh ,  
A:  you know , preliminary de decision meetings , 
A:  but I don't know what 's 
A:  the  
A:  idea for the computer interaction . I mean , it 's going to be a real computer , as in Wizard of Oz ? 
F:  Wizard of Oz .   
E:  OK , so the idea is we wanna start off with a somewhat simple back - end and we 're thinking of , um , agentifying an EXCEL spreadsheet and having s like some kind of spreadsheet  
A:  Uh , what 's  
E:  So basically , what  wh people will see a spreadsheet and they can ask it to move numbers around . So 
E:  we thought that would be a  be a useful kind of task for budget meetings or that kind of thing . So starting off  we would start off definitely with a Wizard of Oz task but it would be something  
A:  And so it will be a real computer recognition . 
A:  Oh , OK . 
F:  So a real computer but a w uh , someone driving it . 
H:  <laugh> 
E:  Uh yes , but it would be something  uh but everything would be an agent . And so it just be  you know , we wouldn't have the recognition grammar to begin with . We wouldn't have the NL grammar to begin with . But these are all components 
A:  <laugh> OK , OK , OK . Uh - huh . 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
E:  that are obvious to us how to build . Nothing  nothing that 's sort of far in the future . It 's just a matter of  of work . 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So somebody will be playing the recognizer and then other agents will be doing their task independently . 
E:  <mouth> Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
E:  So , 
E:  sort of  Right . Something that can be built up , you know , relatively quickly and makes sense how to do . So a fairly simple back - end . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  Um . 
A:  Good . 
topic_description:	computer interaction component, meetings


F:  Yeah , I  I think that 's close enough to what we 're interested in that it would t it 'd be useful for training 
H:  Oh , yeah . Yeah , sure . 
C:  <breath> 
F:  uh , the acoustic models , without any question . 
E:  Uh - huh .

A:  You p 
B:  Mmm .

E:  <clears throat> 
B:  Or , I mean is the intention to do some  som Right . 
H:  I think  
F:  Well , we 'll definitely need to do both . 
C:  <breath> 
H:  No , 
H:  I think the idea is to train on the , uh  on these mikes but use these to get the alignments that we 're gonna train to , right ? 
B:  OK . Understood . Right . 
F:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
topic_description:	training acoustic models


B:  You 're not intending to do any  
B:  You said you weren't gonna  planning to do any beam - forming as such , but you 're not intending to do any signal - processing or , uh  
B:  or , uh , uh , the sort of acoustic modeling of the environment or microphones , or anything else ? 
H:  I don't know . 
F:  It  it really  i 
B:  Cuz that 's actually my interest at the moment , so . 
C:  <breath> <mike sound> 
F:  It will really depend on if we have someone who really wants to do that . So . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Right , right . 
H:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
H:  Well , also , I mean , I  I  I suspect that it may  we may not 
F:  I 
H:  be able to get anywhere without doing something , 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
H:  right ? So . 
E:  <cough> 
F:  Well it 's  
A:  Yeah . 
H:  We may end up having to do that . 
E:  <clears throat> 
F:  just as an example , I I 've done some very simple digits recognitions where , 
F:  uh , I said if I had known we were having this meeting I would have done this before , 
F:  uh . 
F:  Having people read digit strings cuz digits are much easier . 
G:  That was Morgan . 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  Mmm . 
F:  Um . 
E:  Oh , that 's really interesting . 
F:  And just combining  
E:  <laugh> We 're starting off with digit stuff too <laugh> for  for  for our different  for  for this , um , endpointing stuff . 
F:  just doing multis 
B:  Hmm . 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah , of course . 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  Yeah . 
H:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Yeah . <inbreath> 
F:  But , uh , just mixing 
F:  the  
F:  just doing multi - stream on the different mikes helped enormously . 
F:  And I was a little surprised . 
D:  Hmm , hmm . 
B:  Right . 
F:  Yeah , so you  so you  
G:  Why  why is that ? 
B:  So you 're having  
F:  Wh - why ? I have no idea . Because they 're a little different . 
G:  Why ? 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Sorry . When you say multi multi - stream , you mean - r 
H:  <mouth> Hang on . You mean , you ne 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  The microphones are different ? 
H:  You mean , uh , bu to  combining the  
H:  the posteriors on full band recognition 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  like from  from three different or four different mikes . 
F:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
H:  Cool . 
B:  Hmm . 
G:  Hmm . 
F:  And that actually helped . That gave several percent improvement . 
B:  That 's interesting . 
B:  Right , yeah . 
F:  Absolute . So that , uh , 
F:  I think just  just having stereo will help cuz they 're a little different . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  <outbreath> 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  You get a little  slightly different estimators and , uh , 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  <clears throat> 
F:  uh , you combine them together , and you do a little better . 
topic_description:	modelling the acoustic environment


A:  So basically if you 
A:  plan on really training  
A:  collecting a database uh for  database for training , I mean , you are talking about , 
A:  you know , twenty thousand or forty thousand sentences . 
A:  Things like that . 
F:  Right , so that the  
H:  It 's something like tens of hours  tens of hours of data , I think . Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  M 
A:  Tens of hours . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So our initial plan for ICSI was to do forty hours . 
E:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
F:  And then U W is talking about doing an additional sixty to a hundred hours if they have the money . 
E:  <whistling>  
A:  Uh - huh . 
G:  That  
F:  If they can actually do it . 
G:  Yeah , that 's pretty  
H:  Really ? 
B:  Mmm . 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  Mmm . 
F:  I mean , that 's what they had said before but I guess that was more ambitious .

A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Well , the other thing too is , I mean , i if  if you have the equipment then , i i it could be different . Then the recording is easy and maybe  maybe they  
G:  Um . 
A:  But I mean , i i 
F:  Yeah , recording it 's easy . 
G:  Yeah , recording is  Right . 
F:  It 's transcription that 's a pain .

topic_description:	chitchat


A:  So , I mean , clearly i if everybody 's collecting data 
G:  <breath> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Uh . 
A:  to train on , m maybe we should do something  
E:  One thing I should point out , we were n we were not planning on tra doing transcription of the full thing right away , u cuz that 's not  I mean , I was initially interested in just the speech that was directed at the computer . 
G:  <mike noise> 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
E:  And so we were not planning on doing the  transcribing the entire thing . But I mean , that 's something to talk about . 
H:  Right . 
H:  OK . 
G:  <mouth> 
F:  But if you had the data and we had  
G:  But perhaps the company  a company that might , uh . <laugh> <mike sounds> Yeah . There  
E:  If you wanted  if you wanted to transcribe , <laugh> you have the @ @ yes , @ @ you 'll be fine . 
F:  a  a company . 
F:  <laugh> I didn't know whether I should name the company that may be providing us transcription or not . 
A:  Yeah . 
G:  No . 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  If you doubt , don't do it . <laugh> 
H:  Cuz we 're very naturalistic here . 
G:  Yeah . 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  But it , um , <mouth> and there will be a lot of 
G:  people to people talk in those meetings I bet with even three people , so . 
E:  So what is the company ? I heard a " sh " .  Ah ! OK . <laugh> 
A:  So  
F:  IBM . 
G:  Yeah . 
F:  So we 've been  we 've been trying  
H:  <laugh> 
B:  I guessed it from the clue , yeah . 
A:  Ah ! 
F:  we 've been trying to work with them for a while on these projects and they don't  it 's hard for them to give us money 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <clears throat> 
B:  <mike noise> 
F:  but they  they seem to be willing to give us time . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And so one of the po potentials is for them to do transcription in exchange for access to the corpus . 
A:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	transcription, collaboration with IBM


A:  So basically it seems to be like , uh , 
A:  I mean , if everybody 
A:  w e u 
A:  was in the universities collecting data , we are , you are , I mean , 
A:  sharing the data and making a bigger corpus is going to be , 
E:  <cough> 
E:  <clears throat> 
F:  It would be great . 
B:  Mmm , mmm . 
G:  Oh , yeah . 
A:  you know , a benefit for everybody . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yes , absolutely . I think that would be excellent . 
H:  Yeah . 
G:  And , uh , it will really help the design too . It 'll m keep it from being too specific to somebody 's set up or task . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  <mouth> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  Should we  should we interpret what he says ? Morgan says   
A:  Morgan said yes .  
G:  Oh , do we  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> That 's right . 
H:  <clears throat> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  Morgan says thumbs up . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  There we go . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> Right , right . 
B:  <laugh> 
H:  Um , bu but how much  how valuable  Given that you 're interested in this computer - directed data and we 're not gonna have any of that ? 
E:  Well , that 's me personally . Our group in general as Horacio was saying is also interested in some of the same general issues . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  I see . 
H:  Yeah . 
F:  Well , and I think that  
B:  Mmm . 
E:  Um , 
G:  Yeah . 
E:  and I 'm also interested in prosody , um , 
E:  use  you know , u used over person to person stuff like segment and helping for segmentation and stuff . 
F:  <mouth> 
H:  Right . 
G:  Yeah , so we have some ideas there but not enough data to train . So  Harry , and Kemal and I probably  
F:  So al 
F:  Right . 
E:  <mike noise> 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  So actually having different 
G:  kinds of conversations is really helpful too because  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <breath> 
G:  to g to make these models robust . You don't wanna train on just a few people 's voices cuz then you 'll just learn the  
B:  Mmm . Mmm . 
G:  their prosodic patterns . That 's not what we want . 
H:  Right . 
C:  <breath> 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So  so how are you gonna get dra ground truth on that ? 
C:  <breath> 
F:  So  so we should  
G:  That is from the transcription and from the speaker s segmentation . 
E:  <clears throat> 
C:  <breath> 
G:  That 's not hard . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  I think the hard part is getting enough training data and 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  nor you also need normalization data . So you 're sort of 
G:  iteratively normalizing as you go through the  
F:  <mouth> But anyway , what I was gonna say is that although we 're not gonna have speech directed to a computer , my expectation is that the acoustic models will be very similar . 
G:  So . 
F:  The language models probably won't be . 
E:  N the language models c Yeah . 
G:  Actually the acoustic may not be either . 
C:  <breath> 
G:  So , it 's  
E:  Really ? Oh , sure . 
F:  Yeah , I  if it 's Wizard of Oz I think it will be . 
F:  If they know that  
G:  Yeah , if it 's very good , that 's true . <mike sound> 
F:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
G:  If it makes mistakes it 'll be different though I think it  
E:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	issues, benefits of data sharing


E:  On the language model  we 're  
H:  Hmm , <mouth> right . 
B:  Mmm . 
F:  The language model will be  certainly be different but  
E:  uh we 're  we 're gonna be using the same thing that we 've done in the past which is , you know , we need a natural language grammar written anyway . It 's written in unification 
E:  grammar framework . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  um , but with context free grammar , power , and so it 's 
E:  just changed directly into something the recognizer recognizes off of directly with  with no , um , 
F:  And you 're gonna hand  c hand - code that ? 
E:  It 's  it 's  it 's hand - coded . Because we need  we need to write the natural language grammar anyway to understand . 
E:  So it 's  it 's a small , you know , ATIS - sized type task . 
F:  Oh , I  I uh sure , sure , sure , sure . I see . 
B:  Hmm . 
E:  So , yeah , that 's  that 's the way we 've been approaching it . 
F:  Right , if you wanna interpret it you uh need to do  
E:  Eh if we  if we 're ge yeah , we  you know , if we 're gonna be able to 
F:  do that anyway . 
E:  interpret it then  I mean , if we 're not gonna be able to interpret that then it 's not gonna do us much good anyway to recognize it . 
E:  So we might as well go directly from the natural language grammar . 
D:  Is it  is it gonna be like an HPSG kind of grammar ? 
E:  It is a unification base , it 's not  it 's not as  as theoretically bound as HPSG in particular , although the couple of people that we have working on it have HPSG backgrounds . 
D:  I see .

A:  well , indeed . I mean , most people , you know , after this evaluation and conference @ @  should be working 
B:  Mmm . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
A:  on these type of things . 
A:  At least , you know 
G:  Yeah . 
E:  Well I know they 're all working on mediated spaces but there 's a lotta aspects o e to that  to that project . 
B:  Yeah .

A:  but eventually  I mean , 
A:  will be people working on uh kind of recognition aspects and , uh , you know , 
A:  and  and  and in core technology . 
A:  So I mean , recognition technology and also core , 
A:  you know , algorithms , 
A:  et cetera . And for those people to have these data will be , 
A:  you know , the best way to , 
G:  <mouth> 
E:  Right . 
A:  you know , develop the systems to an @ @ . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Well the  the reason I 'm asking is that it 's certainly better to get in early with standards , and data formats , and conventions . 
E:  <clears throat> 
A:  Yeah . 
E:  <mouth> 
A:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah , definitely . 
E:  Yes . 
E:  Yes . 
A:  So probably , uh , on the  
F:  Um . 
E:  Well , so we haven't even  you know , we haven't collected a byte yet so . 
G:  Right . That 's actually why I called this meeting , cuz i I mean , you 're both working on it and with , you know , different sampling rates , and these silly things like that . 
F:  Well , yeah , it 's a  it 's ex excellent , excellent . 
B:  Mmm , mmm . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , that 's right . I mean , just  just  just 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  <breath> 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  So  
F:  agreeing on a sampling rate and a number of bits , and , uh , header formats and all that . 
E:  And we have the same sampling rate . <laugh> One  one thing we do know is that we 're  we 're all producing NIST 
G:  Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  Sampling rate in the end . Yeah . 
G:  What ? 
B:  <breath> 
G:  Oh , 
G:  OK . 
H:  <clears throat> 
E:  Sphere files in  in , uh , eh in the standard format . Sixteen bit , sixteen kilohertz . So at the end we 're all  And the amazing thing is that even  even , you know , the entire way through we 're actually using some very , very similar stuff . 
G:  NIST headers . <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
F:  Sixteen bit , sixteen kilohertz ? Eh , good good . 
B:  Bits , sixteen - K , yeah . 
G:  OK , s 
F:  Big endian , little endian ? <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . 
G:  OK . 
G:  Well I just made that up but , 
E:  And so tha yeah . <laugh> So , @ @  Yeah , it 's coincidence that it 's very fortunate cuz  Yeah . 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  um . <laugh> 
F:  Well , but that 's  that was coincidence , right ? <laugh> 
G:  But that  yeah , yeah . But you have different na you  we 're gonna have different , you know , hardware and  and  
B:  <laugh> Yes , that 's right , not , but  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . 
E:  We actually have , yeah , quite similar hardware as it turns out . 
B:  It 's similar but not quite the same . 
H:  But it  but it  
G:  OK , so  <laugh> so .

topic_description:	aligning recording protocols, conventions


F:  So I  I think probably the biggest thing 
C:  <breath> 
F:  would  Well , no that  that wouldn't be true . If you 're not gonna transcribe it yourself , 
H:  <clears throat> 
F:  then you 're not gonna care too much about our transcription conventions . 
G:  Actually that 's  the transcription conventions  I was talking about this with Jane  it 's really important to people at least like me

B:  <mouth> 
E:  Uh  
E:  <clears throat> 
G:  who wanna know , um , certain 
E:  <clears throat> 
F:  Right of it . 
G:  @ @  uh , who are looking at aspects that are sort of  
G:  they 're not words but they 're structural things you 're trying to recognize . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <breath> 
G:  And also I guess for the speaker . 
G:  People interested in the speaker 
G:  separation because what you call a turn 
E:  <mouth popping sound>  
G:  and the end of a turn , and that  it  it 's 
C:  <breath> 
G:  horribly confused if you don't sort of  
B:  Mmm . 
G:  It 's inherently hard . And so you have to make some 
G:  simplifications and different people make different simplifications , and then you can't compare them at all , which is what the literature is sort of like now . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <breath> 
G:  So , um , and then there 's the issue of recognizer dictionaries , and non - standard forms , and things like that that have to be mapped . 
C:  <breath> 
E:  Yeah . 
G:  So " gonna " versus " going to " and that kind of thing . 
F:  Right . 
E:  I mean , all those issues yeah I 'm sure we  I mean , @ @ like I say . I 'm  I 'm personally not 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
G:  They 're not hard but  
E:  interested in those for my particular aspect of the project but SRI in general is  is the  Yeah .

E:  And s I don't know , maybe we will end up transcribing stu if Hor - if Horacio wants , you know , wants that done , maybe that 'll be  maybe we 'll end up doing that . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  So . 
F:  Well  
G:  And UW is also probably gonna be interested in that too , the dialogue kinds of things . 
F:  <mouth> Well , so it 's a  <laugh> 
G:  So , i 
G:  you know . <laugh> 
F:  so it seems like , um , if you and Jane  
D:  Is  is Morgan nodding his head ? 
F:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  OK . <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  So if you and Jane keep  keep in touch about 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  Yeah . 
F:  transcription conventions , that would be very helpful . 
A:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah , that 's originally  We should thank Jane because that 's how I originally  she showed me some transcripts and I thought , " Wow , 
B:  Right . 
F:  Yeah . 
E:  I mean , it 's kind of amazing too that , you know , the transcription tool we just converged on the same  All these things were very , very similar . It 's  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  this is great " . 
F:  Yep . 
G:  Oh , yeah . 
B:  Yeah , yeah , to study using the same thing . 
H:  Yeah .  
A:  You were also thinking about the same tool ? 
H:  That 's interesting . 
G:  Yeah . 
E:  We  we  we were gonna use the same tool . We  we set up that tool already , yeah . 
A:  Wow ! 
G:  But what if you had like 
G:  written the s the Tcl kluge or something , <laugh> and then both done the same  
A:  Already ! 
E:  <mouth> Yeah .  
F:  Hmm . That 's right . 
H:  Well , the  I mean , and in some ways that does change the , uh , the economics of doing that . 
A:  I mean , it 's  
B:  Can you do that ? 
F:  Right . It 's much more worth while to do if someone else is gonna use it . Although again if this now named company is the one who 's gonna do the transcription , 
H:  But , um . 
B:  Hmm ! Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , that 's right . 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . But we still  yeah . 
F:  I sus I suspect they have in house tools that they 'll end up using . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
G:  But you still need something that can display these channels . 
C:  <mike noise> 
H:  That 's interesting . 
H:  Right , we need  we need some kind of browsing . 
G:  e e better than what 
H:  Yeah . 
G:  it can do , I mean . 
H:  It 's  
G:  And then I guess who is the contact at UW ? Like 
G:  Morgan ? Morgan doesn't have a microphone but is it  
F:  That 's alright . He can talk anyway . 
H:  He 's allowed to speak , he ca yeah . 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  is it  I mean Mari and  
D:  Well , he could be reached  he could be reached by the far field , couldn't he ? 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
I:  Yeah . No , I  it 's just that there 's no @ @ . 
G:  Mari or  or  or Katrin , or Jeff , or  
D:  Yeah . 
I:  Oh , at U W . I 'm sorry . 
H:  <clears throat> 
G:  Yeah . I mean , both  I think both Jeff and Katrin have some time on this . 
I:  On  on the transcription issues ? 
G:  No , on the p on the DARPA project , who would be sort of contacts 
G:  for  
I:  Let 's start off assuming Mari and if  
G:  Mari . 
G:  And if Mari 's too busy then  
I:  if it ends up  
I:  Yeah , then she 'll tell us who to 
B:  Mmm . 
G:  OK , yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
I:  talk to . 
I:  But I think Mari . 
topic_description:	transcription conventions


I:  And the IB  the IBM , 
I:  as long as I 'm talking , lemme  <laugh> 
H:  Hmm , @ @ .  
F:  <laugh> 
I:  The , uh , the IBM thing , uh  i they basically have said " yes " . 
I:  So , just to  
I:  because you were probably talking around it because you were concerned it was secret . 
F:  I was . <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
I:  But it 's not  not really secret . Basically , 
I:  there 's a proposal in to Mari  to uh , tsk  IBM from Mari and us 
I:  uh , for some funding . It 's actually a pretty small amount even if it gets funded . 
I:  Uh , but the most appealing thing in it to us was , in a way , that they 're gonna do this transcription and also potentially give us some equipment . 
I:  Uh or loan us some equipment we could use . 
I:  And it  it occurred to me one day that  that , 
I:  uh , we didn't have to wait for their proposal process to go through because , since they 're interested in supplying this to us , we could just ask them for that since it didn't quote - unquote cost them anything . 
I:  Uh , and , uh , they said uh  Mike Picheny said " sure " . 
I:  So , eh , as far as I know we are 
E:  <cough> 
I:  on to have them do it . It 's just a question of people on our end and people on their end talking about what are the mechanics of it and then it will  it will just happen . 
E:  <clears throat> 
E:  <clears throat> 
I:  So we  we had never mentioned , you know , SRI stuff too , but I think they 're just interested in  as long as everybody 's fine  
E:  <mike noise> 
I:  excuse me for covering things that we might have already talked about , but as  a as long as everybody is fine , 
I:  with the data being basically free to the people involved , 
I:  um , at least , we can talk about being far more open than that , which we probably should be , but 
I:  at  at the very least , all the people involved , uh , 
I:  at any level can have access to all of it so you guys can have it , UW can have it , we can have it , and IBM can have it , and 
A:  Uh - huh . 
I:  lots to discuss further . 
A:  <cough> 
E:  I don't think we have any problem . I mean , we had certainly in our  you know , the proposal that we tried to make to NSF , we were assuming we would distribute this through the LDC . 
A:  No , yeah . 
A:  Yeah , I  I mean , <inbreath> 
A:  this  this is something that re 
F:  LDC is what we were thinking too . 
A:  re requires a bootstrap . I mean , there is no LDC database . There is , at least we have to share the data , I mean . 
E:  Yeah , so we have no problem with that . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  That 's the bottom line , uh . 
G:  I  I mean , I think eventually LDC could be very interested in it , especially if you have a tool that can do this . I mean , there isn't one . 
A:  Yeah . 
I:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  Hmm . 
G:  And  and the data . So maybe it 'll  we can actually  
E:  <clears throat> 
A:  Yeah . 
G:  You can sell corpora eventually to the LDC and you can get time , student time , to clean up the corpus and things . 
I:  Yeah . 
I:  Right . 
I:  So that s that requires more thinking and discussion but  but certainly amongst everybody who is helping one another , w w why not ? And I  yeah . 
H:  Hmm . 
G:  So . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yep . 
I:  So we should talk with 
I:  Mike Picheny about , you know , after this m yeah , get some other briefing later about other things that were said , but uh , assuming that it is what I think it feels like , having walked in <laugh> ten minutes ago , 
G:  <laugh> 
I:  uh , it seems li I c I can't imagine that he 'd have any problem with getting even more data than  <laugh> than he thought he was . 
H:  Right . 
topic_description:	IBM funding, LDC distribution


D:  I wanted to ask one question about the  the nature of the design . Th - Given that the overlaps are up  up uh , where the difficulty comes , in a bunch of a areas , 
E:  It 's terrific . 
D:  um , whether it would be useful to have some of the sessions have like an additional rule where if a person , you know , the  that there 's someone who recognizes people to speak or something like that to cut down on the  so you  then you have the meeting context , you have multiple channels , you have the microphones n varying the way you want them to vary , 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  but you 'd cut down substantially on the overlaps . It wouldn't be f for all meetings but whether maybe just sprinkled through there once in a while , something like that might be useful or not . Just wanted to raise that . 
D:  I don't know . 
H:  I mean , it 's difficult because you want it to be 
H:  real speech , right ? And also it 's not clear how well people can even adjust to even 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
H:  adjust to that kind of rule . 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  I mean , s it  tho those  those kinds of things are sorta the kind of things that we were thinking of  of trying , cuz we are having  we do have a more artificial set environment again . 
H:  But if there  
F:  Robert 's rules . 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  <clears throat> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  We 're trying something totally new having people speak to the computer . 
E:  I don't think we talked about that in particular cuz we didn't  we haven't done any pilots , we haven't seen this , 
E:  <laugh> incredibly difficult data of overlapping . 
E:  But this is 
E:  uh , Christine Helverson , who 's working on this with me from the s um , aspect of user , you know , usability and stuff , would , y you know  
E:  sh she 's interested in these sorts of things . What  what can you ask people to do that , um , that they can reliably do and without too much , you know , cognitive load , 
E:  um , that can help things out , or , you know , those sorts of issues . So , 
E:  I don't know . Maybe it 's something that could fit easier in  in our context than in a general meeting context . I don't know . 
D:  <whistle> 
F:  <mouth> Well I think that  
D:  Well , what I can say is that wha sometimes , you know , if  if  if we were to have this kind of coordination thing , 
E:  <breath> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <clears throat> 
D:  some  some of the overlap is due to someone wanting to claim the floor at a certain point 
D:  without knowing that other people have the same desire at the same point in time . And if  and if you were to have someone who was like a moderator , then you raise your hand , the moderator would say , you first , you know , or yeah , press the button . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> Just have a button . 
E:  <laugh> 
E:  And ring the buzzer . <laugh> 
D:  And  and I think , you know , there are always gonna be backchannels , I think that 's natural and lovely . But these  these overlaps that are due to people n not knowing other people wanna leap in at the same time and  and wanting to coordinate  you know , I think that , uh , it could be lessened . Not eliminated entirely . 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  Mm - mmm . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  Hmm .  
H:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  I don't know . 
F:  There are certainly f formal meeting settings where that 's what 's happens , y that 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  Right . 
F:  you know , Robert 's rules of order and all that . <mouth> 
F:  Uh , so that 's not something we had thought about before but I think it  it  it certainly is another 
F:  type of meeting that could be done . 
H:  Yeah . 
I:  Ha - have you been continuing the practice of collecting connected digits and so forth ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Uh , no , I didn't . I didn't know we were gonna be recording this meeting , so I didn't . 
H:  We  no  
I:  No , I meant the independent  in the other meetings . 
H:  Yeah , in general yeah . 
F:  Yes , in the other meetings we have . 
H:  Yeah . 
D:  And they 've been collecting digits too . 
H:  <clears throat> 
I:  Yeah . 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  OK . 
F:  So that 's another thing we should talk about , is making sure that we 're doing it in the same way . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  We  <laugh> For a  t for a completely different reason I assume but  
B:  Mmm . 
F:  So I  I  
E:  And  and not within a  not within a big room . Just , uh . 
I:  Yeah , I mean , in our case it was just that , uh , since everything  e everything on every level about this task is difficult , we thought we 'd s <laugh> make one part of it not difficult for at least some of the data , so that  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
D:  That 's a good idea . 
topic_description:	altering meeting format to reduce speaker overlap


F:  Yeah , if I had known and here we have all these new speakers , I could have gotten lots of digits in but  
H:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  But sorry , so you connect  you collect digits 
G:  in conversation or  or individ <laugh> 
H:  Yeah , yeah . We  we give people a list of digits and they have to like put them into their discussion , like say , " Five , one , seven , seven , three . " <laugh> 
F:  No , no , I have people read them . 
G:  Uh . 
F:  <laugh> Seven . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> I was thinking  
C:  You - you 're encouraged to , you know , just utter digits once in a while . <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> Never mind , I 'm getting attacked . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  You say , " hey , by the way , eight ! " <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
I:  No we have set sets of digit strings that we 've got from TI - digits I guess , and the idea was just that we would have  have some data with different speakers with far - field microphone effects , so that we could look at far - field versus the close mike or @ @ . 
F:  <mike noise> 
E:  Uh - huh . 
B:  Mmm . 
G:  So you don't need the meeting for that . You can just sit me in this room and set up all the microphones . Right , OK . 
I:  No , but as long as we have this same space , it 's just amortizing the people the time that they 're there . 
E:  But you need the room and the set up . 
G:  Right , right . OK . 
B:  Right . 
E:  Yeah , we 're doing digits  yeah , we 're not doing digits in the  in the room set up at all . We 're doing it for a complete I mean , 
H:  Yeah . 
E:  one of the specific things I 'm interested in is knowing  um , is the open mike issue . When you 're talking to the computer , knowing when you 're done speaking . 
I:  Yeah . 
E:  And so I 'm loo interested in  in  well , in interested in looking at prosody . Um , 
I:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh , cool . 
I:  So that 's the  
E:  and so we 're just having  we 're just doing lists of digits to see when people pause to know , 
E:  you know , " there was a big gap in time here but , they "  you know , we can tell prosodically they weren't done , so . 
I:  Yeah . 
I:  Yeah . 
I:  Yeah , so that 's a different deal . Here it 's just  we have the same group of people . You 're amortizing their time , but also , 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  <clears throat> 
G:  <breath> 
I:  you have the same room setup , you have the same microphone setup , and  but now you have s you have something we actually usually can recognize . <laugh> 
A:  <inbreath> 
F:  <laugh> 
H:  But  but there is  
G:  I  I think that 's a really good idea . To always  yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
H:  but there is also this fascinating prosodic thing that goes on because you  what we  we have is like these lists of ten digit strings or twenty digit strings and they 're like one  one to five or one to seven digits . 
E:  <high-pitched squeak or mew>  
E:  <mike noise> 
H:  And people read through them . And you know , we 're saying , well we won't to be able to separate them so please pause between but it 's very  people don't like doing that . 
H:  And so there is this prosodic thing which is  which is indicating when  
H:  whe the pauses between these digit strings . And then when they finish , the actual  the whole sheet , there 's this nice , wonderful  yeah , phrase @ @ . <laugh> And it  
B:  Mmm , mmm . 
G:  Oh , yeah . Oh , yeah , d 
E:  Yeah , right . 
F:  Nice falling , yeah . 
B:  Declination , yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  If  you definitely shouldn't use your last sample . I mean , people that do prosody work , they add a few at the end because otherwise people will  
E:  Right . 
F:  <mouth> So . 
E:  <clears throat> 
H:  Right . 
F:  Oh , I hadn't thought about that . 
B:  Mmm . 
H:  Oh right . <laugh> 
F:  I hadn't even thought about throwing out the last couple . Definitely should . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  No , but that  that is beautiful because then you can get this F zero floor 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <breath> 
G:  for each of the speakers . Just from that . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <laugh> Oh , right , just look at the very last  <laugh> look at the very end . <laugh> 
B:  Right , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
I:  You don't necessarily throw it away , but  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah , yeah . Treat especially  
F:  Don't throw it away but don't use it in your training . 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  Your  your junk is our , uh , <laugh> training data . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <uncodeable syllable> 
B:  Mmm . 
H:  Yeah . 
F:  Cool . 
G:  No , that 's a really good idea to have some standard  I mean , especially if a the different sites can do something like that . 
I:  Yeah . 
F:  <mouth> And  
G:  You 'll at least be able to see whether difficulty across site is due to , 
G:  you know , the lexicon version , uh . <laugh> 
H:  Right , right . There 'll be a common  That 'd be great . Yeah , that 's a good idea . 
G:  Yeah . 
I:  That  that was  that was actually Jerry 's idea and the first time he told me I thought it was terrible cuz I thought , " Oh , look we 've done all this stuff with digits , we don't wanna be messing with that again . " but  
E:  <breath> Funny .  
I:  then after I had a chance to sleep on it , I went , " Wait a minute " <laugh> it 's  it 's a really good idea . 
F:  Hmm .  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  That 's a good idea . 
G:  Oh . 
B:  That 's the reason , uh - huh . 
G:  You should definitely  it 's some kind of calibration , uh , for uh many of these tests . 
H:  <clears throat> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
I:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
F:  Right . 
B:  Mmm . 
I:  Yeah . 
F:  The only thing I don't like about it is that it 's not phonetically very rich , 
H:  Right . 
G:  Well , you could have TI  you know , " she put her dirty laundry in the clean  <laugh> clean bathwater " , whatever . 
F:  but . 
F:  Yeah , that 's right , <laugh> TIMIT . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
I:  @ @ 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  So we actually talked about that . Yeah , it 's plenty bad . 
I:  plenty bad . 
I:  @ @ 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  It 's plenty bad just with digits , although I haven't trained any nets on it . 
B:  Mmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
G:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
F:  I 've just been using existing digits or Broadcast News nets 
F:  since we don't have enough data yet . 
E:  And what are these  what are the digit strings  are from TI digits and , <clears throat> uh  
F:  One , seven , eight , two , three , one , three , seven , eight , four . 
E:  Uh  
H:  Yeah , it 's TI - digit strings . 
E:  I don't  
F:  M that sorta thing . 
I:  I swear we had some . 
E:  Uh  
E:  <laugh> 
D:  That 's right , this  we could each make up a string . <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . <laugh> But what were they ? 
H:  It 's actually  
A:  <laugh> 
E:  How  how long are  how long chunks are they , a 
G:  <laugh> 
H:  it 's like  but  from one to  one to nine digits . 
F:  They vary from  
C:  One two three four .   
H:  It is actually the  the actual digit strings from TI - digits . 
E:  OK , yeah , I 've never looked over the TI - digits corpus , I don't know . 
F:  I  I just extracted exactly the same ones , so . 
G:  <breath> Have we all memorized these ? Maybe we know them . <laugh> 
H:  OK . 
B:  Up a bit . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  That 's like the TIMIT sentences . <laugh> 
G:  Right . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  Greasy wash water , oh . 
D:  I know the numbers that were used but I don't remember the combinations . <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  In one ear . 
H:  <laugh> The order , yeah . <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  Just the order , OK ? 
F:  But , so I have a bunch of tools for generating these and for helping transcribe them . 
F:  Since you know what  you know what the transcript is you don't have to type it in , you just have to segment it . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So I have tools for doing that . 
F:  Using X - X Waves , Tcl - TK , Perl , and maybe some C programs too . <laugh> 
G:  <breath> 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
D:  We could do some digits . 
F:  Well I  I don't have any of the print outs . 
E:  <clears throat> 
D:  OK . 
F:  I  I print them out a a as I need them . So what I should do is just print out a whole stack and leave them up here but I haven't done that . 
E:  <clears throat> 
G:  <breath> 
E:  <clears throat> 
H:  <mouth> Put them on the Internet , put them on a web page . 
I:  We could do a string perhaps @ @ , yeah , let 's @ @ . 
F:  <laugh, "hmmph"> 
D:  That 's what I was wondering . 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  Eh yeah , you could write  write them  write something on the board and , I don't know . 
F:  <laugh> Well , but i <outbreath> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Ha - wha I mean , we could just make  make numbers up , can't we ? 
F:  It 's  it 's a different task . It 's a different task than read . 
G:  Yeah , yeah . 
F:  You  you do it differently if it 's sitting in front of you and you 're reading it than if it 's not . 
B:  @ @ 
D:  OK . 
F:  So , 
G:  Right . 
F:  I guess we could write them down and then read them , but . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  OK . 
H:  I  @ @ 
F:  I  I  we can get digits . I mean , a as you said , we don't have to be in a meeting . 
F:  And so if we 're short on digits I can just , you know , capture people in the hallway , drag them in here , and have them read digits for me . 
G:  <breath> 
I:  As long as they come to our h hallway more often but  <laugh> 
G:  <breath> 
F:  That 's right . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Oh , can you bring them up from the  no , OK . 
D:  Alright .

D:  I wanted to ask about also the air conditioning . Are  uh , is there a plan to  to turn the air conditioning off in some of these meetings or is it always gonna be on ? 
E:  <clears throat> 
G:  Yeah , it 's way too cold in here . 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
H:  We should do that cuz y you can turn it off on that  that thing right there and it makes a huge difference . 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  Right . 
F:  Well , 
B:  You also gain noise from the projector as well , isn't it ? Yeah , yeah . 
F:  the  the hum we hear right now is actually the projector , not the air conditioner . The projector is much louder than the air conditioning . 
G:  A all right . <laugh> 
H:  But the projector , yeah . This is the first time we 've done it with a projector . 
E:  Huh . 
D:  Yeah , but I was just thinking , he was showing it  on what he showed us on the web site , you could see the contribution of the air conditioning . And I just wondered if that was gonna be sometimes clear . 
F:  Yep . 
E:  But the projector 's not part of your
