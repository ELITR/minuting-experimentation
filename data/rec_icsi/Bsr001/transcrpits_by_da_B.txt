B:  yeah . 
B:  Ch - ch - ch , ch - ch - ch , ch - ch - ch , ch - ch - ch 
B:  Yeah , right . 
B:  Yeah , that 's right . 
B:  You need me , yeah . 
B:  I really count . 
B:  And is that the channel number or the microphone number ? 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  These are disturbing . 
B:  Being just in front of your ears , it  you can  you can hear the shadow it creates . 
B:  There was this like little acoustic shadow 
B:  from having this in front , yeah . 
B:  Well , I can  I can feel it . 
B:  There 's too much  
B:  Hmm . 
B:  So you can feed it to the  
B:  feed it through the headphones , for example . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Yes , 
B:  that 's right . 
B:  The medical . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  So  
B:  What exactly is the purpose of the corpus ? 
B:  What 's the purpose of the  
B:  Right . 
B:  But it will train them to the microphone characteristics of this c 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Absolutely . 
B:  I agree . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Uh  
B:  I 'm actually finding this quite comfortable now that I 've got it  I 've got it just right . 
B:  It 's just  
B:  U i 
B:  It must have numbed the areas . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Code ! 
B:  Right . 
B:  That 's an interesting language model I 'm sure . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  I 'm beginning to feel my heart beat now . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  You get the wrong answer quicker basically , 
B:  don't you ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  This i 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Yes . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  It 's still in the forma it 's still in the format which is slightly more formal I think than , you know , completely informal conversational speech . 
B:  They will do , a bit . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  The host probably gets , uh , you know  gets a little bit more . 
B:  Gets a little boost . 
B:  Uh - huh . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  There i 
B:  yeah , indeed . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  I think that 's the op 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Is that in exchange for access to the c 
B:  Right . 
B:  And you 're saying some of the infrastructure is , um , the A T - andT video conferencing . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  So pi 
B:  A free gift . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Should we stop recording ? 
B:  That 's <inbreath> to the listeners . 
B:  That 's right . 
B:  It could be . 
B:  This could be the most popular corpus . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Ha ! 
B:  But that 's only on one sp 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  That was , w 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  That 's gonna be @ @ . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Well , there might be a different style of , um  a different , actually , style of interaction . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yes , certainly . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm ! 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Well , just  just the fact that people are making different assumptions is quite an interesting problem . 
B:  You know , it 's quite an interesting issue . 
B:  That brings up  
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Yeah , 
B:  contribute the data . 
B:  Yes . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Is that the channel limitation cutting in ? 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Two of @ @ . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  M 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  And do you have the same agenda , although there 's a goal ? 
B:  Is there one goal or several goals ? 
B:  Because that 'll would be more interesting data if there is like  
B:  I mean , a budget meeting is a classic example , of where every comes in pursuit of a different goal . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  In th 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  And this is just train um , training them using the  um , the head - mounted data initially . 
B:  Or , I mean is the intention to do some  som 
B:  Right . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Understood . 
B:  Right . 
B:  You 're not intending to do any  
B:  You said you weren't gonna  planning to do any beam - forming as such , 
B:  but you 're not intending to do any signal - processing or , uh  or , uh , uh , the sort of acoustic modeling of the environment or microphones , or anything else ? 
B:  Cuz that 's actually my interest at the moment , so . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Right , right . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  So you 're having  
B:  Sorry . 
B:  When you say multi multi - stream , you mean 
B:  Right . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  That 's interesting . 
B:  Right , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  It 's transcription and processing , yeah . 
B:  Hmm ? 
B:  It 's not a speaker phone is it ? 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  I guessed it from the clue , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm , mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm , mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Sampling rate in the end . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Bits , sixteen - K , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Yes , 
B:  that 's right , 
B:  not , but  
B:  It 's similar 
B:  but not quite the same . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  So the bit we 're a bit deficient in as we  
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah , yeah , to study using the same thing . 
B:  Can you do that ? 
B:  Hmm ! 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Mmm , mmm . 
B:  Declination , yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right , 
B:  yeah , 
B:  yeah , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  That 's the reason , 
B:  uh - huh . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Up a bit . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  In one ear . 
B:  Just the order , 
B:  OK ? 

B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  You also gain noise from the projector as well , isn't it ? 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  No ? 
B:  It  
B:  Mmm . 
B:  It actually gives you a way of calibrating microphone position in a way . 
B:  Doesn't it ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  For volume , it 's a point source pretty much , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  So . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  t Uh  
B:  Digit strings , 
B:  yeah .
