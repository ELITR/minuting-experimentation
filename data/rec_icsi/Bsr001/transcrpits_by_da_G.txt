G:  give us digit strings . " 
G:  I was just thinking that  in the meeting you could like  have this secret thing that would play music if you 're  <laugh> if you got bored . 
G:  Give you stock quotes @ @ . 
G:  Nobody would know , right ? 
G:  No , I mean , just like no one would know if something 's actually  coming through if you got bored or something , cuz  
G:  Right . 
G:  Right . 
G:  You sit at the meeting but you just  
G:  Yeah , 
G:  you just say , " Mm - hmm . 
G:  Mm - hmm " . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Hello ? 
G:  And what about these ? 
G:  Where 's the  
G:  Am I nine ? 
G:  OK . 
G:  Well , thank you . 
G:  This is kinda fun . 
G:  No , 
G:  But it won't last long . 
G:  It probably  
G:  Right . 
G:  You can hear it . 
G:  The rest of us  
G:  That 's amazing . 
G:  Oh yeah . 
G:  That would give you a headache . 
G:  Can you convert these ear ones to something comfortable ? 
G:  I mean , just by putting little  
G:  Or j 
G:  Yeah , 
G:  I mean , you can just use the microphone and take the headband off . 
G:  But maybe the  
G:  Yeah , yeah . 
G:  If it didn't  if it didn't hurt , you know , if it was comfortable but you knew it was there , would it bother you ? 
G:  Because I actually think it sort of makes everybody act a little more professional . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Your telephone , 
G:  and people use it for cell phones 
G:  and . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  I think you can't do any research otherwise . 
G:  It 's just  
G:  It 's too hard . 
G:  It 's too hard without  
G:  I think you should collect both simultaneously . 
G:  And  
G:  It 's gonna be too hard to do it without a  
G:  Yeah , 
G:  forget it . 
G:  You won't be able to get grants . 
G:  You won't be able to get funding . 
G:  No , 
G:  I 'm serious . 
G:  I mean , you won't be able to show any results . 
G:  So . 
G:  It was pretty bad . 
G:  It takes off quite a lot . 
G:  Somebody will design a comfortable close talking mike . 
G:  I mean it 's  there are too many applications to  for them not  to not do that . 
G:  I mean , it may not look like this 
G:  but . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah , this one 's fine . 
G:  Right . 
G:  I 
G:  Yeah , 
G:  those are pretty bad . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Sorry . 
G:  Oh , this would drive me crazy . 
G:  I absolutely  
G:  people are very picky about this . 
G:  But that 's painful . 
G:  I can't  
G:  Huh . 
G:  Yeah , 
G:  I mean Broadcast News is for this third - party listener , 
G:  right ? 
G:  So they , you know if you were listening to an interview that sounded like this , you know , you 'd turn off your radio . 
G:  So it 's just got a d 
G:  it 's a lot easier . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Uh - huh . 
G:  Yeah , I was thinking , if Transcriber were invented in Italy or something ,  it would have been handling multiple  
G:  in New York . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  And  and software too . 
G:  I mean , things like rewriting this Transcriber tool 
G:  and thi that  That shouldn't be re redone . 
G:  And the transcription conventions  
G:  And then , uh , UW  
G:  I don't know if you mentioned this at the beginning 
G:  but , the  Mari 's group , Mari and Morgan  I th I think what happened historically , um  
G:  Oh , I don't know how much I 'm supposed to say if this is being recorded . 
G:  Well , anyway , uh . 
G:  Mmm , huh . 
G:  Um . 
G:  There 's funding , eh . 
G:  It 's  
G:  No , it 's OK . 
G:  Um , I 'll tell you later . 
G:  Sorry , listeners . 
G:  Too bad you weren't here . 
G:  Well , it does sort of make you  
G:  It 's  
G:  it 's like you 're behind closed doors 
G:  but you have to  
G:  Normally a note taker would know not to do that . 
G:  OK . 
G:  Anyway , UW is getting some funding from DARPA on Communicator , uh , with  
G:  and that 's sorta how I got involved . 
G:  I mean , Morgan wanted me to sort of do something . 
G:  I guess , I  My interest was sort of in the language and dialogue m modeling , and the turn overlaps , and how to apply you know , a language model , a dialogue act model to actually feed down to do better recognition . 
G:  So not just  
G:  Because I think it will be really difficult to do just speech recognition and then try to get some kind of meaning out of it . 
G:  I think you have to have some kind of structure from the  
G:  I mean  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  And  
G:  So knowing that an utterance is really short and low volume , you should be able to figure out it 's a backchannel and things like that . 
G:  Anyway , 
G:  apparently , and you guys know more than I do , there was some talk that you were gonna build a portable version of this so that Mari 's group  
G:  I  I mean , there 's not a huge amount of funding in the way , you know , Mari probably won't be able to do a ton of collection . 
G:  But I was thinking if there were sort of prototype collection devices or standards , then we could share data . 
G:  And we would have like a <mouth> monopoly on that . 
G:  Mar - I mean , once you get three sites collecting data and each site can demo it , and say it 's at the other two sites . 
G:  Which was  would be really good for funding purposes . 
G:  But that  I don't really know . 
G:  That 's what I heard from Morgan , 
G:  so . 
G:  Is that  
G:  And according to Morgan it 's like happening 
G:  and  
G:  OK . 
G:  Right . 
G:  And he said something about a portable  You know , that they wouldn't have a dedicated room or something like  like you guys have here . 
G:  OK . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Right , 
G:  and it doesn't have  You know , different sides can do different pieces of it I think . 
G:  And  
G:  Exactly . 
G:  Right . 
G:  And you 'll get different kinds of conversations and different interactions , 
G:  and I think just having three different sites would be great 
G:  just for sort of diversity , 
G:  and so . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Yeah , 
G:  but you know what ? 
G:  They don't say when they stop . 
G:  They don't say , you know , " I 'm done , Computer " . 
G:  They only mark the beginnings . 
G:  So , 
G:  it  uh  there are very  
G:  Very interesting . 
G:  And actually Mari 's  
G:  But there might be , uh , neat ways you can do this that are not natural but they become very easy , 
G:  and that  
G:  So . 
G:  I  I think , 
G:  yeah . 
G:  But you can still collect the multiple microphones in a similar way and transcribe , 
G:  and th 
G:  That 'd be cool actually . 
G:  Yeah , I mean , I think the formats would be similar . 
G:  But I think having the  the idea of the computer sort of in there forces you to create a  a log file format that can handle these other devices . 
G:  I mean , you were talking about the Penn 
G:  and  
G:  So 
G:  I  I think it 's  
G:  the formatting is really one of the biggest  issues . 
G:  You know , 
G:  not  not the f transcript formatting but the audio formatting and the sort of figuring out how to synchronize all of these , um , pieces . 
G:  And what kind of software you can use for post - processing all of them . 
G:  Yeah , which i 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah , 
G:  or phone meetings , 
G:  or even  
G:  Or meetings like this with  about the meetings . 
G:  You know , with a  with a telephone . 
G:  No , I 'm serious . 
G:  Even if we don't make any decisions we 'll have a lot of data . 
G:  Sorry . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Hmm . 
G:  Oh , right . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah , definitely . 
G:  That was Morgan . 
G:  Why  why is that ? 
G:  Why ? 
G:  The microphones are different ? 
G:  Hmm . 
G:  That  
G:  Yeah , 
G:  that 's pretty  
G:  Mmm . 
G:  That 's  
G:  They were gonna  
G:  There was a difference in the amount of money awarded from the beginning to e 
G:  Um . 
G:  Yeah , recording is  
G:  Right . 
G:  Right . 
G:  You can have my mike . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  But perhaps the company  a company that might , uh . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  There  
G:  No . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  But it , um , <mouth> and there will be a lot of people to people talk in those meetings I bet with even three people , 
G:  so . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Oh , yeah . 
G:  And , uh , it will really help the design too . 
G:  It 'll m keep it from being too specific to somebody 's set up or task . 
G:  Oh , do we  
G:  Right , right . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah , so we have some ideas there but not enough data to train . 
G:  So  Harry , and Kemal and I probably  
G:  So actually having different kinds of conversations is really helpful too 
G:  because  to g to make these models robust . 
G:  You don't wanna train on just a few people 's voices 
G:  cuz then you 'll just learn the  their prosodic patterns . 
G:  That 's not what we want . 
G:  That is from the transcription and from the speaker s segmentation . 
G:  That 's not hard . 
G:  I think the hard part is getting enough training data and 
G:  nor you also need normalization data . 
G:  So you 're sort of iteratively normalizing as you go through the  
G:  So . 
G:  Actually the acoustic may not be either . 
G:  So , it 's  
G:  Yeah , if it 's very good , 
G:  that 's true . 
G:  If it makes mistakes it 'll be different though 
G:  I think it  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah , 
G:  definitely . 
G:  Right . 
G:  That 's actually why I called this meeting , 
G:  cuz i I mean , you 're both working on it and with , you know , different sampling rates , and these silly things like that . 
G:  So  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  What ? 
G:  Oh , 
G:  OK . 
G:  NIST headers . 
G:  OK , s 
G:  OK . 
G:  Well I just made that up 
G:  but , 
G:  um . 
G:  But that  
G:  yeah , yeah . 
G:  But you have different na you  we 're gonna have different , you know , hardware and  and  
G:  OK , 
G:  so  
G:  so . 
G:  Actually that 's  the transcription conventions  I was talking about this with Jane  it 's really important to people at least like me who wanna know , um , certain @ @  uh , who are looking at aspects that are sort of  they 're not words but they 're structural things you 're trying to recognize . 
G:  And also I guess for the speaker . 
G:  People interested in the speaker separation 
G:  because what you call a turn and the end of a turn , and that  it  it 's horribly confused if you don't sort of  
G:  It 's inherently hard . 
G:  And so you have to make some simplifications 
G:  and different people make different simplifications , 
G:  and then you can't compare them at all , 
G:  which is what the literature is sort of like now . 
G:  So , um , and then there 's the issue of recognizer dictionaries , and non - standard forms , and things like that that have to be mapped . 
G:  So " gonna " versus " going to " and that kind of thing . 
G:  They 're not hard 
G:  but  
G:  but we definitely will be interested in some language and dialogue . 
G:  So . 
G:  And UW is also probably gonna be interested in that too , 
G:  the dialogue kinds of things . 
G:  So , i 
G:  you know . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah , that 's originally  We should thank Jane 
G:  because that 's how I originally  she showed me some transcripts and I thought , " Wow , 
G:  this is great " . 
G:  Oh , yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  But what if you had like written the s the Tcl kluge or something , <laugh> and then both done the same  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  But you still need something that can display these channels . 
G:  e e better than what it can do , I mean . 
G:  And then I guess 
G:  who is the contact at UW ? 
G:  Like 
G:  Morgan ? 
G:  Morgan doesn't have a microphone 
G:  but is it  is it  
G:  I mean Mari and  
G:  Mari or  or  or Katrin , or Jeff , or  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  I mean , both  I think both Jeff and Katrin have some time on this . 
G:  No , on the p on the DARPA project , who would be sort of contacts for  Mari . 
G:  And if Mari 's too busy then  
G:  OK , 
G:  yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  I  I mean , I think eventually LDC could be very interested in it , 
G:  especially if you have a tool that can do this . 
G:  I mean , there isn't one . 
G:  And  and the data . 
G:  So maybe it 'll  we can actually  
G:  You can sell corpora eventually to the LDC 
G:  and you can get time , student time , to clean up the corpus and things . 
G:  So . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Right . 
G:  But sorry , 
G:  so you connect  you collect digits in conversation 
G:  or  or individ 
G:  Uh . 
G:  I was thinking  
G:  Never mind , 
G:  I 'm getting attacked . 
G:  So you don't need the meeting for that . 
G:  You can just sit me in this room and set up all the microphones . 
G:  Right , 
G:  OK . 
G:  Right , right . 
G:  OK . 
G:  I  I think that 's a really good idea . 
G:  To always  
G:  yeah . 
G:  Oh , yeah . 
G:  Oh , yeah , 
G:  d 
G:  If  you definitely shouldn't use your last sample . 
G:  I mean , people that do prosody work , they add a few at the end 
G:  because otherwise people will  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  No , but that  that is beautiful 
G:  because then you can get this F zero floor for each of the speakers . 
G:  Just from that . 
G:  Your  your junk is our , uh , <laugh> training data . 
G:  No , that 's a really good idea 
G:  to have some standard  
G:  I mean , especially if a the different sites can do something like that . 
G:  You 'll at least be able to see whether difficulty across site is due to , you know , the lexicon version , 
G:  uh . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Oh . 
G:  You should definitely  
G:  it 's some kind of calibration , uh , for uh many of these tests . 
G:  Well , you could have TI  you know , " she put her dirty laundry in the clean  <laugh> clean bathwater " , whatever . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Have we all memorized these ? 
G:  Maybe we know them . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Eh yeah , you could write  write them  write something on the board 
G:  and , 
G:  I don't know . 
G:  Yeah , 
G:  yeah . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Yeah , it 's way too cold in here . 
G:  A all right . 
G:  Mmm . 
G:  Modern technology . 
G:  See , you may wanna call up your computer . 
G:  " Computer , 
G:  give us digit strings . "
