A:  Oh , I see . 
A:  This is on . 
A:  Hi , 
A:  hi , 
A:  hi . 
A:  Hello ? 
A:  Hello ? 
A:  I 'm  I 'm on zero ! 
A:  Yes ! 
A:  Oh , uh I 'm being recorded by the wire . 
A:  and Mike are coming on my channel . 
A:  So I guess now we have a lot of censors self - censorship going on . 
A:  No , we got to relax and let go . 
A:  Yeah ? 
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  He  he 's a  
A:  the sound effect man . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Alright . 
A:  They want to do something serious with this research . 
A:  Solo means you just  
A:  can  
A:  OK . 
A:  So  
A:  Wait , 
A:  you you 're going to be  you 're going to be saying , you know , funnier things , 
A:  so leave it on . 
A:  Yeah , 
A:  I mean  
A:  Clearly  I mean , my impression is i if I have to wear this thing , you know , more than five minutes , uh , uh , uh , I mean , I  I will be completely affected by it somehow . 
A:  So . 
A:  I wouldn't be  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  That  that one . 
A:  The one I tried . 
A:  I 'd  
A:  They really press my temples , 
A:  otherwise my ear channels , 
A:  otherwise my joints here . 
A:  I mean , depending where I put it ,  it press different things , 
A:  but that 's a @ @ fine . 
A:  I mean  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So , 
A:  I mean , this  this thing of course is probably , you know , acoustically more challenging 
A:  but I like this . 
A:  Th 
A:  Is it ? 
A:  But  but there  there I think , is a t you know , 
A:  No . 
A:  A Anything which is distracting or painful , <laugh> is going to impact negatively with this . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  But I mean , 
A:  but at that point  at that point it wouldn't be much different to  to wear this or that . 
A:  Hhh .  OK . 
A:  I mean , but probably this is designed in such a way that it should be closer . 
A:  And this , eh , eh  but this is designed to be worn like this  to be worn like this . 
A:  I mean , I really like this . 
A:  Uh I  I mean , if I have to design the thing , uh I  I would rather , you know , use this type of thing than the other ones . 
A:  And also i is  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , I noticed that . 
A:  I noticed that . 
A:  But , you know , that  that might be the challenging part . 
A:  I mean , because otherwise you are  
A:  If it was comfortable  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  I , uh , 
A:  I mean , no . 
A:  I mean , 
A:  I  
A:  I  
A:  I mean , I 'm kind of more deaf on this ear , whatever this is on . Uh , I could wear it this way . Still , I  I  I mean , I 'm 
A:  I 
A:  I mean , it 's my impression . I mean , of course there is a lot more work to do with this one 
A:  but  
A:  I mean if  if you want something really  really nonintrusive , really nonintrusive , really something that  
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Well  
A:  I mean , you think  you think if you  
A:  Do you think this is going to be too f too  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So  
A:  And with this  with this you 're saying , you are also in that situation ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah , 
A:  those are really bad . 
A:  I think you have , you know , he would . 
A:  And so  and what about this one ? 
A:  I mean , this thing wearing sideway that  that can ? 
A:  Oh . 
A:  D uh does it have a speaker ? 
A:  Does it have a speaker 
A:  or  ? 
A:  Uh  Uh - huh . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  You do . 
A:  Y 
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Oh , you 're a  
A:  So  
A:  The market is a captive market . 
A:  Good . 
A:  Well , basically , the  the  the original project looks a lot like , you know , the  the p your project . 
A:  I mean , basically we set up with this , uh , idea of the  the  the meeting  the  the mediated spaces idea in general 
A:  and then incr incarnated in this room that will be mediated somehow by , you know , a computer to access information , to help along the meeting , 
A:  and will be like two kind of eh , f main functions . 
A:  One is the interaction with the computer 
A:  which , as you said , you know , is your interaction with the PDA in your case , 
A:  where you kind of query it to ask for information , et cetera . 
A:  At the same time , our process is somehow , you know , getting all this multi - channel information , doing some sort of , you know , cross , eh , channel , you know , cancellation and transcribing the individual streams , 
A:  not necessarily in real time . 
A:  And the idea is y you can eventually after the meeting query , you know , previous meetings 
A:  and  
A:  and there is all this work on transcription , 
A:  similar probably to what we do in Switchboard but with better bandwidth , 
A:  you know , 
A:  but worse , <laugh> you know , environmental conditions . 
A:  An - and then , you know , there is , all  all these issues about processing all this information , you know , transcription , 
A:  but then using , you know , prosody information to better , you know , segment , endpoint . 
A:  Eh , also using topic segmentation to help better classification of information or extraction of information . 
A:  I mean , 
A:  we didn't dare to say it will be just in a PDA you throw in the middle of a meeting . 
A:  That  that was daring . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  But , you know , uh let 's assume somehow the compu processor power is going to be there . 
A:  Whatever . 
A:  I mean , initially you may do a super - computer for the transcription ,  real time and then  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I  I mean , ou uh we  we kind of set up this concept like a year and a half ago . 
A:  And at that time I said , you know , we said , " don't worry about the  the compute power " . 
A:  I mean , it will be somewhere ,  you know . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I mean , our approach , somehow , I mean , I believe it 's probably , you know , complimentary in many ways , is to focus on the actual deep technology that we have somehow in speech . And basically , make progress on , you know , the algorithms . 
A:  And then , you know , it will run somewhere . 
A:  I mean , 
A:  as you said , to  I mean , we would like the idea to have it there 
A:  but  but our focus is basically to develop the algorithms , to push the state of the art on this transcription task . 
A:  And , uh , the other task probably is also , you know , challenging the comp the  the querying , uh , the command , control , or , you know , I mean , doing that in natural language . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  I see . 
A:  You really are challenged to do that , 
A:  to put as much power as you can in the PDA . 
A:  OK , 
A:  uh , our approach is , you know , we do whatever is necessary to do it 
A:  and , you know , some of it may go into something , depending on , you know , your scalable power . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Well , you know , is , eventually y you will get all this you know , sc eh , higher and higher , you know , powers in these portable things . 
A:  So as long as you have enough algorithms and technology to do something better if you have more processing power . 
A:  I mean , the  the situation now in the speech community is that , you know , there is some boundary , some limit in the performance . 
A:  And no matter how much processing you throw in , you don't get any better . 
A:  And so we are trying to push that . 
A:  And then you have room to port whatever you can to , you know , smaller devices . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Sorry I interrupt you . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Always @ @ . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Huh . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Exactly . 
A:  I mean , it 's one of the areas where Kemal is going to work , like , you know , speaker tracking , and speaker ID . 
A:  I mean , 
A:  you want to know . 
A:  I mean , if you have the people wired individually it probably is easier . 
A:  But  but you know , in  in the other situation , you know . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  I think there are some programs in TV . 
A:  I 've been trying to get this from  something like this from , you know , public cast 
A:  uh w eh eh . 
A:  Um uh yeah , 
A:  and they  but they  they do it somehow . They clean it up . 
A:  I notice that they  they s they sa have some help with control of what person to pick up . 
A:  I  I mean there is some program at midnight somewhere . 
A:  It 's a bunch of , like , four people discussing 
A:  and they , it 's a lot clean . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I yeah , 
A:  probably . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh , yeah . 
A:  I 've heard that  that  that sometimes . 
A:  But it 's  it 's OK , though . 
A:  So you don't think they  they fill it at all with any , you know  
A:  They  
A:  I am pretty sure they do . 
A:  I mean , it 's  it 's  it 's still , you know , understandable . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  At the same time . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah , in many cultures it 's not bad manners to  to speak on top of another one . 
A:  I it somehow  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I mean , could be reassuring , 
A:  you know ? 
A:  Keep going , 
A:  keep going . 
A:  Well , I mean , 
A:  I  I belie I believe there is a lot of overlap 
A:  and would be great to com to  to basically take advantage of that to  to make a synergy more than an overlap , and , you know , help each other . 
A:  I  I believe each group has , you know , depths in  in different , uh , areas , 
A:  so . 
A:  I mean , we clearly c should collaborate for the best of everybody . 
A:  Uh , 
A:  I , you know  
A:  There are no final  
A:  I mean , the official decisions I guess have to be made in terms of resources to that . 
A:  My personal opinion , if you ask , is that we should 
A:  because the only way  
A:  I mean , if I learn anything on speech in  for the last , you know @ @  
A:  No , no , no . 
A:  Um , you need a task to really , you know , improve your system for that particular environment . 
A:  So right now we are focusing our research on doing evaluation type of , you know , in incremental you know , improvements . 
A:  So , 
A:  Switchboard , for instance . 
A:  They have five is kind of  
A:  OK , you have two people talking , 
A:  it 's the closest thing . 
A:  But we really should move into the  you know , data that reflects as much as possible , the real scenario . 
A:  And that that 's a way to improve . 
A:  And then you do improvement on that particular database . 
A:  So even if we don't collect the data to train models , we should collect data at least to evaluate progress . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Uh - huh ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So , on one question . 
A:  I mean , uh , this  this thing is also for you , made on internal funding ? 
A:  Or I mean , I know you 're applying for some DARPA funding . 
A:  Oh , you already got some . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  You are on the line . 
A:  This would never go away ! 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  You know , maybe thousands of people are listening to us now 
A:  because it 's in the future , 
A:  but , you know , sequentially maybe thousands . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Erase that part . 
A:  We could have like , you know , some periodic meetings , 
A:  and like , uh , 
A:  phone meetings or something . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  At the same time we contribute to the <laugh> database collection , 
A:  and , uh . 
A:  But it will be all documented . 
A:  How is that ? 
A:  Three peop total ? 
A:  S 
A:  Well , some peo people speak with their mouth full , you know that 's a @ @ . 
A:  Delete that part . 
A:  So  so , I  One question . 
A:  I  I mean , I haven't been in these , uh ,  you know , preliminary de decision meetings , 
A:  but I don't know what 's the  idea for the computer interaction . 
A:  I mean , it 's going to be a real computer , as in Wizard of Oz ? 
A:  Uh , what 's  
A:  And so it will be a real computer recognition . 
A:  Oh , OK . 
A:  OK , OK , OK . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So somebody will be playing the recognizer 
A:  and then other agents will be doing their task independently . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Good . 
A:  You p you plan to  to train actually models based on this data . 
A:  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So basically if you plan on really training  collecting a database uh for  database for training , I mean , you are talking about , you know , twenty thousand or forty thousand sentences . 
A:  Things like that . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Tens of hours . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  But I mean , i i 
A:  So  so  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So  so , clear 
A:  So , I mean , clearly i if everybody 's collecting data to train on , m maybe we should do something  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  If you doubt , don't do it . 
A:  So  
A:  Ah ! 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So basically it seems to be like , uh , 
A:  I mean , if everybody w e u was in the universities collecting data , we are , you are , I mean , sharing the data and making a bigger corpus is going to be , you know , a benefit for everybody . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Morgan said yes . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I guess 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I mean , 
A:  except  
A:  Well  
A:  well , indeed . 
A:  I mean , most people , you know , after this evaluation and conference @ @  should be working on these type of things . At least , 
A:  you know 
A:  Yeah , 
A:  yeah , but  but eventually  I mean , will be people working on uh kind of recognition aspects and , uh , you know , and  and  and in core technology . 
A:  So I mean , recognition technology and also core , you know , algorithms , et cetera . 
A:  And for those people to have these data will be , you know , the best way to , you know , develop the systems to an @ @ . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So probably , uh , on the  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  You were also thinking about the same tool ? 
A:  Wow ! 
A:  Already ! 
A:  I mean , it 's  
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  No , 
A:  yeah . 
A:  Yeah , 
A:  I  I mean , 
A:  this  this is something that re re requires a bootstrap . 
A:  I mean , there is no LDC database . 
A:  There is , at least we have to share the data , I mean . 
A:  That 's the bottom line , 
A:  uh . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yep . 
A:  You say , " hey , 
A:  by the way , eight ! " 
A:  Mm - hmm ! 
A:  Oh , I see .
