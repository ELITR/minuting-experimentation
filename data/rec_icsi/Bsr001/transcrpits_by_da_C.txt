C:  One two three four . 
C:  Well , it 's being recorded anyway , right ? 
C:  Why listen to the guy ? 
C:  If you need it you may record it .  Then we can get Liz 's X marks later to see if there are any important things . 
C:  Mine is on . 
C:  Where am I ? 
C:  Which one ? 
C:  Which one ? 
C:  Channel  
C:  Oh , I 'm on two . 
C:  Good . 
C:  You are on zero . 
C:  Oh , they 're already labeled ? 
C:  Yeah , 
C:  that 's what I figured out . 
C:  No ? 
C:  I 'm , uh  
C:  Well , I mean , you 're counting maybe from one instead of zero , 
C:  so . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  So , yeah . 
C:  No ! 
C:  This is  
C:  So , Harry , we should maybe record some of your clicks and , you know . 
C:  Actually I think this thing is really cutting the blood flow . 
C:  I 'm gonna pass out . 
C:  This is a very sensual thing . 
C:  Maybe this is a little better . 
C:  Boy ! 
C:  Yeah , this is just m bad design . This , um , this is  
C:  Ouch . 
C:  Yeah , 
C:  go to that . 
C:  What are you doing ? 
C:  Actually , I use something like this on  on the telephone and it 's very comfortable . 
C:  Not for this , for sure . 
C:  No . 
C:  I mean , it 's just  But talking in general , yeah , that 's , uh  
C:  Well , yeah , I mean , that 's really like having one of these almost , 
C:  so . 
C:  I think he 's about to pass out . 
C:  That 's why  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Really ? 
C:  So you could actually produce like code 
C:  or  ? 
C:  Yeah ? 
C:  Wow . 
C:  Uh . 
C:  Huh . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah , for example , when you go to your PDA system it 's , uh , really an awful  open problem to determine how many speakers there are and where they change turns , 
C:  uh . 
C:  That 's actually being ad That 's one of the problems that 's being addressed at this year 's evaluation , 
C:  uh , 
C:  which is taking place right now , actually . 
C:  Right . 
C:  You  you do need to figure out the number of speakers in the waveform . 
C:  This is a NIST evaluation . 
C:  Um . 
C:  Eh , right , speaker verification . 
C:  Uh , Switchboard . 
C:  Switchboard and , uh  
C:  I  I  
C:  We  
C:  Well , I mean  
C:  We will also run so some part of that , uh , evaluation too 
C:  but probably not that segmentation part . 
C:  But I don't know if they are using a different data for that . 
C:  But I mean , it 's  s While I say " Switchboard " , s eh , of course there 's <very short laugh> only two speakers . 
C:  But , um , I don't know how they , uh , actually went about . 
C:  Um . 
C:  Cuz they were saying some  some  some  up to eight speakers . Maybe they  
C:  maybe some other data for that part , 
C:  you 're right . 
C:  No , no . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  No . 
C:  We 've also , uh , s done some of that as , uh , eh , 
C:  um , I mean , I have a so  small , uh , hacked up system which sort of , for  for the Broadcast News determines the approximate number of speakers and actually assigns some names to them . 
C:  This is something we did for the MAESTRO project , uh , for  for Rick . 
C:  But , um , uh , 
C:  yeah , uh , for  for Broadcast News it works much better actually . 
C:  It 's , uh , 
C:  you do get eh , like in an interview , uh , nice long segments 
C:  and  
C:  Well , there can be like a problem solution kind of thing where they would actually , you know  they have to come to one solution . 
C:  Not with these around . 
C:  You - you 're encouraged to , you know , just utter digits once in a while . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  One two three four .
