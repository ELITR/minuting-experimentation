F:  OK . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Will you get the door , 
F:  and  ? 

F:  OK . 
F:  You collected an agenda , huh ? 
F:  No there 's only ten . 
F:  Well , OK . 
F:  So you think two  you think two hours is the  is the total that we have ? 
F:  And you think we th uh , 
F:  I  I didn't quite catch all these different things that are not quite right , 
F:  but you think we 'll be able to retrieve the other hour , reasonably ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  So the relevance of the speaker form here , s 
F:  Oh , OK . 
F:  Wasn't like whether they were giving us permission to use their digits or something . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah 
F:  Um , do um 
F:  you want different prosodics , 
F:  so if you always had the same groupings you wouldn't like that ? 
F:  Is that correct ? 
F:  No but , I was asking if that was something you really cared about 
F:  because if it wasn't , it seems to me if you made it really specifically telephone groupings that maybe people wouldn't , uh , go and do numbers so much . 
F:  You know if it if it 's  
F:  Maybe some , but I probably not so much . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  So if you  if  if you have uh 
F:  if you go six six six uh dash uh two nine three one . 
F:  That 's what I was asking , yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Right . 
F:  I mean , the other thing is we could just bag it 
F:  because it 's  it 's  
F:  it 's - I 'm not worrying about it 
F:  I mean , because we do have digits training data that we have from uh from OGI . 
F:  I 'm sorry , 
F:  digits  numbers training that we have from OGI , 
F:  we 've done lots and lots of studies with that . 
F:  And um . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  No , no , I guess what I 'm saying is that 
F:  to some extent maybe we could just read them  have them read how  how they read it 
F:  and it just means that we have to expand our  our vocabulary out to stuff that we already have . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  We can go back to the other thing later . 
F:  I mean we s we  we 've  We can do this for awhile 
F:  and then go back to digits for awhile , 
F:  or um . 
F:  Do yo I mean , do you want  do you want this  Do you need training data or adaptation data out of this ? 
F:  How much of this do you need ? 
F:  with uh the  
F:  OK . 
F:  OK , well if you pre 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Let 's try it . 
F:  So we have  
F:  Sorry , 
F:  I  I was just gonna say , so we have in the vicinity of forty hours of  of recordings now . 
F:  And you 're saying two hours , uh , is digits , 
F:  so that 's roughly the ratio then , 
F:  something like twenty  twenty to one . 
F:  Which I guess makes  makes sense . 
F:  So if we did another forty hours of recordings then we could get another couple hours of this . 
F:  Um , yeah like you say , I think a couple hours for a  for a  for a test  test set 's OK . 
F:  It 'd be nice to get , you know , more later 
F:  because we 'll  we might use  use this up , uh , in some sense , 
F:  but  but uh  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  No it 's  it 's not the same . 
F:  A little bit , 
F:  but the other differences are so major . 
F:  They 're such major sources of variance that it 's  it 's  it 's uh  
F:  Well i i individual human glottis <laugh> is going to be different for each one , 
F:  you know , it 's just  There 's so many things . 
F:  it 's  it  and  and enunciation . 
F:  TI - digits was ? 
F:  I thought  I thought it was read . 
F:  Yeah , I think the reading zipcode stuff you 're thinking of would be OGI . 
F:  Yeah , no TI - digits was read in th in read in the studio I believe . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  But it  but  
F:  It - it 's different people  is the  is the core thing . 
F:  And they 're different circumstances with different recording environment and so forth , 
F:  so it 's  it 's  it 's really pretty different . 
F:  But I think the idea of using a set thing was just to give you some sort of framework , 
F:  so that even though you couldn't do exact comparisons , it wouldn't be s valid scientifically at least it 'd give you some kind of uh frame of reference . 
F:  Uh , you know it 's not  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah I mean , for the  for the um acoustic research , 
F:  for the signal - processing , farfield stuff , I see it as  as  as the place that we start . 
F:  But , th I mean , it 'd be nice to have twenty hours of digits data , 
F:  but  but uh the truth is I 'm hoping that we  we through the  the stuff that  that you guys have been doing as you continue that , we get , uh , the best we can do on the spontaneous stuff uh , uh nearfield , 
F:  and then um , we do a lot of the testing of the algorithms on the digits for the farfield , 
F:  and at some point when we feel it 's mature and we understand what 's going on with it then we  we have to move on to the spontaneous data with the farfield . 
F:  So . 
F:  Let 's try it . 
F:  Sixty - one . 
F:  No , I 'll p 
F:  See , y 
F:  OK . 
F:  No , I can do it . 
F:  Alright , let 's try three at once you  you pick one in the middle . 
F:  Go . 
F:  Oh like a round , 
F:  yeah , like in a  a  
F:  yeah . 
F:  Row , row , row your boat . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I don't think we 're gonna collect vast amounts of data that way , 
F:  but I think having a little bit might at least be fun for somebody like Dan to play around with , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  Yeah , yeah . 
F:  Spend the whole time reading digits with different qu quantities . 
F:  That 's " two " bad . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Uh , they don't all work as well , do they ? 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  What does nine work in ? 
F:  Uh , 
F:  Oh . In German , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  That 's right ! 
F:  I think everybody 's a little punchy here <laugh> today . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Well I don't know . 
F:  Well I think the question is what the research is , 
F:  so I mean , I presume that the reason that you wanted to have these digits this way is because you wanted to actually do some research looking at the prosodic form here . 
F:  Yeah OK . 
F:  So if somebody wanted to do that , if they wanted to look at the  the  the difference of the uh phones in the digits in the context of a word versus uh the digits  a  a non - digit word versus in digit word , uh that would be a good thing to do , 
F:  but I think someone would have to express interest in that . 
F:  I think , to  
F:  I mean if you were interested in it then we could do it , for instance . 
F:  Yeah , so it 's the same thing ? 
F:  It 's the same thing I mailed to every everybody that w where it was , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  Yeah , that 's  that 's why I only used the part from use 
F:  which we had uh about uh about the alt over all the channels 
F:  or mixed channel 
F:  rather mixed signal . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  It  just  it just to r to remove cross - talk . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , Dave  Dave uh is , um , also gonna be doin usin playing around with echo cancellation for the nearfield farfield stuff , 
F:  so we 'll be  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  No , I didn't notice that actually . 

F:  Yeah . 
F:  That 's typical , huh . 
F:  In fact , this is an eighteen gig drive ,  or is it a thirty six gig drive with eighteen  
F:  Oh OK . 
F:  I  I  I 'm sorry  
F:  Yeah , l I mean over all our data , we  we want to not downsample . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  ye 
F:  Yeah , I mean  
F:  yeah , I 'm sorry . 
F:  As  yeah , as long as there is a  a form that we can come from again , that is not downsampled ,  then , 
F:  uuu 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Then it 's fine . 
F:  But for  for  fu future research we 'll be doing it with different microphone positions and so on 
F:  we would like to  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I mean it just depends how big the file is . 
F:  If the file sits in memory you can do extremely fast seeks 
F:  but . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yep . 
F:  So , @ @ . 
F:  But  but in our meetings people don't say " hey cuz how you doing ? " 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I wanna work with lost data . 
F:  Well , you just did . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah 
F:  Arg . 
F:  Arg  arg - max , arg - min , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  Canadians , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
F:  Quick Thilo , do a  do a filled pause for us . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  I 'm sorry , I  I got lost here . 
F:  What - w what 's the difference between the parenthesized acronym and the non - parenthesized ? 
F:  Ah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I  I don't recognize a lot of these . 
F:  I  
F:  Maybe . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  The number to the left is the number of incidences ? 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  So CTS is really big here , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  IP , 
F:  I know what IP is . 
F:  OK . 
F:  S s six now , yeah . 
F:  Wh - the self - referential aspect of these  these p 
F:  No , I didn't . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So th 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Seven hundred eighty . 
F:  So now we 're up to seven hundred and eighty eight . 
F:  What 's a QUAL ? 
F:  I f I forget , 
F:  what 's QUAL ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Don and I were just noticing , 
F:  love this one over on page three , 
F:  " vocal  vocal gesture mimicking sound of screwing something into head to hold mike in place . " 
F:  Beep . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  " Sings finale - type song " 
F:  that 's  that 's good . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Tah - dah ! 
F:  I don't know . 
F:  Something like that 
F:  maybe , yeah . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So I 'd  so " I 'd like  I 'd like to talk about point five " . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  OK .
