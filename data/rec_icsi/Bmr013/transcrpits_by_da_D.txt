D:  Oh , god . 
D:  So we 'll have a corpus that 's the size of TI - digits ? 
D:  Test set , OK . 

D:  Oh ! Great . 
D:  Great . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Good . 
D:  So are these two separate tasks that can happen ? 
D:  Or do they have to happen at the same time before  
D:  OK . 
D:  Oh , OK . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Although the models weren't , that good , 
D:  right ? 
D:  I mean , the models are pretty crappy ? 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  How did we do on the TI - digits ? 
D:  H how do  
D:  H How 
D:  do we do on TI - digits ? 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Pre - prehistory . 
D:  Sort of less predictability , 
D:  and  You hafta  
D:  Hey . 
D:  Hafta think about , the particular acoustic features to mark , too , because , I mean , some things , they wouldn't be able to mark , like , uh , you know , uh , tense lax . 
D:  Some things are really difficult . 
D:  You know , 
D:  just listening . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Points of articulation ? 
D:  What do you mean ? 
D:  Place of ar place of articulation . 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK , I see . 
D:  There was no name for that . 
D:  So it would be  it would be great if we had , either these kind of , labelings on , the same portion of Switchboard that Steve marked , or , Steve 's type markings on this data , with these . 
D:  And it 's more accurate than , phone labels . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So it 's like a continuum . 
D:  It 's  you 're going all the way down , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right . 
D:  It 's basically just having , multiple levels of  of , information and marking , on the signal . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Well , you know , um  I mean if we 're talking about , having the , annotators annotate these kinds of features , it seems like , 
D:  You know , you  
D:  The  the question is , do they do that on , meeting data ? 
D:  Or do they do that on , Switchboard ? 
D:  Well cuz the yeah , and then also , if you did it on Switchboard , you would have , the full continuum of transcriptions . 
D:  You 'd have it , from the lowest level , the ac acoustic features , then you 'd have the , you know , the phonetic level that Steve did , 
D:  and , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  It 'd be a complete , set then . 
D:  But it  it might be good to do what Jane was saying uh , you know , seed it , with , guesses about what we think the features are , based on , you know , the phone or Steve 's transcriptions or something . to make it quicker . 
D:  Adjusting ? 
D:  Yeah , exactly . 
D:  Scoot the voicing over a little , because  
D:  Or you could start from the  if we were gonna , do the same set , of sentences that Steve had , done , we could start with those transcriptions . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Are they busy for the next couple years , or  ? 
D:  It 'd be very interesting though , to have  that data . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Of the f acoustic features ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Well won't you have that from their transcriptions ? 
D:  So , current  This week . 
D:  You ordered them already ? 
D:  Great . 
D:  So it 's a replacement for this headset mike ? 
D:  What 's the , um , style of the headset ? 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Oh , god .
