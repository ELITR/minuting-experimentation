D:  OK , that 's  let 's  let 's  let 's do digits . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  We 're on again ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Uh , we were gonna do that at the end , 
D:  remember ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Just  just to be consistent , from here on in at least , that   that we 'll do it at the end . 
D:  OK 
D:  Um Well , it ju I mean it might be that someone here has to go , 
D:  and  
D:  Right ? 
D:  That was  that was sort of the point . 
D:  So , uh  I had asked actually anybody who had any ideas for an agenda  to send it to me and no one did . 
D:  So , 
D:  Uh , 
D:  Right , 
D:  s OK , so one item for an agenda is uh  Jane has some uh <inbreath> uh some research to talk about , research issues . 
D:  Um  and  Uh , Adam has some short research issues . 
D:  Um , I have a  list of things that I think were done over the last three months 
D:  I was supposed to <inbreath> <laugh> send off , uh  and , um  I  I sent a note about it to uh  to Adam and Jane 
D:  but I think I 'll just run through it  also and see if someone thinks it 's inaccurate or  uh insufficient . 
D:  Uh , to uh uh , IBM . 
D:  OK . 
D:  They 're , you know  
D:  So . 
D:  Um , So , uh  so , I 'll go through that . 
D:  Um ,  And , Anything else ?  anyone wants to talk about ? 
D:  No . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Um . 
D:  Sort of off - topic I guess . 
D:  Cuz that 's  Cuz that was all  all about the , uh  
D:  I  I  I can chat with you about that  off - line . 
D:  That 's another thing . 
D:  Um , And , Anything else ? 
D:  Nothing else ? 
D:  Uh , there 's a  I mean , there is a   a , um  uh  telephone call tomorrow ,  which will be a conference call  that some of us are involved in  for uh a possible proposal . 
D:  Um , we 'll talk  we 'll talk about it next week if  if something  
D:  Uh Well , we 'll talk  talk about that after our meeting . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Uh , OK . 
D:  So it sounds like the  the three main things that we have to talk about are , uh this list , uh Jane and  Jane and Adam have some research items , and , other than that , anything ,  as usual ,  anything goes beyond that . 
D:  OK , uh , Jane , since  since you were sort of cut off last time why don't we start with yours , 
D:  make sure we get to it . 
D:  What was  what 's the  the parenthesized stuff  that says , like  e the first one that says six overlaps and then two point eight ? 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Ah . 
D:  S so , i it would be statistically incorrect to conclude from this that Adam talked too much or something . 
D:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Excuse me . 
D:  B I  I  I rather enjoyed it , but  but this 
D:  Sure . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh sure . 
D:  Well , of course th the biggest ,  um  result here , which is one we 've   we 've talked about many times and isn't new to us , but which I think would be interesting to show someone who isn't familiar with this <inbreath>  is just the sheer number of overlaps . 
D:  That  that  Right ?  that  that , um 
D:  here 's a relatively short meeting , 
D:  it 's a forty   forty plus minute  <inbreath> meeting , 
D:  and not only were there two hundred and fifteen overlaps <laugh>  but ,  uh I think there 's one   one minute there where there  where  where there wasn't any overlap ? 
D:  I mean , it 's   <inbreath> uh throughout this thing ? 
D:  It 's  You have  
D:  Oh , so the bottom three did have s stuff going on ? 
D:  There was speech ? 
D:  OK , so if  the  this  
D:  Oh , about how much is it ? 
D:  O oh , what 's  what 's the  what 's the average  length ? 
D:  You don't know ? 
D:  OK , you  you don you don't have a feeling for roughly how  much it is ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh , I 'm sure . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , but I  I 'd  <inbreath> u 
D:  go ahead . 
D:  I I 
D:  I I 
D:  I 'm  I 'm  I 'm confused now . 
D:  So l l let me restate what I thought Andreas was saying and  and see . 
D:  Let 's say that in  in second fifty - seven  <inbreath> of one minute ,  you start talking and I start talking and  we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds . 
D:  So we go over  So we were  we were talking over one another ,  and it 's just  in each case , it 's just sort of one  interval . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  So , um  we talked over the minute boundary . 
D:  Is this  considered as one overlap in each of the minutes , the way you have done this . 
D:  OK , so that 's  good , i I think , in the sense that I think Andreas meant the question , 
D:  right ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm ? 
D:  Well , but see , I find it interesting even if it wasn't any more , 
D:  because  since we were dealing with this full duplex sort of thing in Switchboard where it was just all separated out <inbreath> we just  everything was just nice , 
D:  so that  so the issue is in  in a situation  where th that 's  
D:  Mm - hmm ? 
D:  Let  let m let me rephrase what I 'm saying cuz I don't think I 'm getting it across . 
D:  What  what I  what  I shouldn't use words like " nice " because maybe that 's too  i too imprecise . 
D:  But what I mean is <inbreath> that , um in Switchboard ,  despite the many  many other problems that we have , one problem that we 're not considering is overlap . 
D:  And what we 're doing now is ,  aside from the many other differences in the task , we are considering overlap 
D:  and one of the reasons that we 're considering it ,  you know , one of them not all of them , one of them is <inbreath> that w uh at least ,  you know I 'm very interested in <inbreath> the scenario in which , uh  both people talking are pretty much equally  audible , <inbreath> and from a single microphone . 
D:  And so ,  in that case , it does get mixed in , <inbreath> and it 's pretty hard to jus  to just ignore it , to just do processing on one and not on the other . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  That 's an important question to ask . 
D:  I think what I 'm   All I 'm s really saying is that I don't think we were considering that in Switchboard . 
D:  Were you ? 
D:  Were you  were you  were you  were you measuring it ? 
D:  I mean , w w were  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah ? 
D:  Yeah ? 
D:  Yeah , I wasn't saying that . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  I was just saying that w now we 're looking at it . 
D:  And  and  and , you  you maybe wanted to look at it before but , for these various technical reasons in terms of how the data was you weren't . 
D:  So that 's why it 's coming to us as new 
D:  even though it may well be  you know , if your  if your hypothes The hypothesis you were offering <inbreath> eh  
D:  Right ?  if it 's the null poth  hypothesis , and if actually you have as much overlap in a two - person , <inbreath> we don't know the answer to that . 
D:  The reason we don't know the answer to is cuz it wasn't studied and it wasn't studied because it wasn't set up . Right ? 
D:  Mm - hmm ? 
D:  May have been . 
D:  May have been . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  We do kn we don't know the numbers . 
D:  See , I mean , i i le let me t 
D:  I mean , my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody , " what have we learned about overlaps here ? " 
D:  just never mind comparison with something else , 
D:  what we 've learned about is overlaps in this situation , is that  the first   the first - order thing I would say is that there 's a lot of them . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  In  in the sense that i if you said if  i i i 
D:  In a way , I guess what I 'm comparing to is more the common sense notion of <inbreath> how  how much people overlap . 
D:  Uh  you know the fact that when  when  when , uh , Adam was looking for a stretch of  of speech before , that didn't have any overlaps , and he w he was having such a hard time 
D:  and now I look at this and I go , " well , I can see why he was having such a hard time " . 
D:  It 's happening a lot . 
D:  I wasn't saying it wasn't . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  I was commenting about this . 
D:  I 'm saying if I   I 'm saying if I have this complicated thing in front of me , <inbreath> and we sh which ,  you know we 're gonna get much more sophisticated about when we get lots more data , 
D:  But  Then , if I was gonna describe to somebody what did you learn  right here , about , you know , the  the modest amount of data that was analyzed I 'd say , " Well , the first - order thing was there was a lot of overlaps " . 
D:  In fact  <inbreath> and it 's not just an overlap  bunch of overlaps  second - order thing is <inbreath> it 's not just a bunch of overlaps in one particular point , <inbreath> but that there 's overlaps , uh throughout the thing . 
D:  And that 's interesting . 
D:  That 's all . 
D:  Oh yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I wasn't making any statement about that . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , that would be good to know , 
D:  but w we  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  u 
D:  Actually , I think I 've done it  a fair number of times today . 
D:  But . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I have a feeling most of these things are  that   that are not  a benevolent kind are  are <laugh>  are , uh  um  <mouth> are  are competitive as opposed to real really  really hostile . 
D:  But . 
D:  Uh a vote  vote in Florida . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Um , o one thing  I  I wanted to  or you can tell a good joke and then everybody 's laughing and you get a chance to g break in . 
D:  But . 
D:  But . 
D:  Um . 
D:  You know , the other thing I was thinking was that ,  um  these  all these interesting questions are , of course , pretty hard to answer with , uh u  you know , a small amount of data . 
D:  So , um  I wonder if what you 're saying suggests that we should make a conscious attempt to have , um <inbreath> a  a fair number of meetings with , uh a smaller number of people . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  I mean <inbreath> we  most of our meetings are  uh , meetings currently with say five , six , seven , eight people 
D:  Should we  really try to have some two - person meetings ,  or some three - person meetings and re record them <inbreath> just to  to  to beef up the  the statistics on that ? 
D:  Well , Liz was raising the question of  of whether i it 's the number  there 's a relationship between the number of people and the number of overlaps or type of overlaps there , 
D:  and , um <inbreath> If you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance then you 'd still have the visuals . 
D:  You wouldn't have that difference  also that you have in the <inbreath> say , in Switchboard data . 
D:  Uh 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , acoustic is fine , 
D:  but  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  But  what  what do you think about that ? 
D:  Do you think that would be useful ? 
D:  I 'm just thinking that as an action item of whether we should try to record some two - person meetings or something . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Well , <laugh> OK . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Uh Well , we 'll have to set up for it . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , we 're not really set up for it  to do that . 
D:  But . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , we  we record this meeting so regularly it wouldn't be that  I mean  a little strange . 
D:  Oh , th that was the other thing , 
D:  weren't we gonna take a picture  at the beginning of each of these meetings ? 
D:  Yes . 
D:  There 's a head nodding here vigorously , yeah . 
D:  But if you just 
D:  f But from one picture , I don't know that you really get that . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  You 'd want a video for that , I think . 
D:  Think so ? 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Speaking of taking control , you said you had some research to talk about . 
D:  I think so , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah , the  you know , the reason that he , uh  just used silence <inbreath> was not because he thought it was better , it was  it was  it was the place he was starting . 
D:  So , he was trying to get something going , 
D:  and , uh e e you know , as  as  <inbreath> as is in your case , if you 're here for only a modest number of months you try to pick a realistic goal , 
D:  But his  his goal was always to proceed from there to then allow broad category change also . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Well , I  I  
D:  u <inbreath> Look , I  I think this is a  
D:  One  once  It 's a  I used to work , like , on voiced  on voice silence detection , you know , and this is this  kind of thing . 
D:  Um  If you <inbreath> have somebody who has some experience with this sort of thing , and they work on it for a couple months , <inbreath> they can come up with something that gets most of the cases fairly easily . 
D:  Then you say , " OK , I don't just wanna get most of the cases I want it to be really accurate . " 
D:  Then it gets really hard no matter what you do . 
D:  So , the p the problem is is that if you say , " Well I  I have these other data over here , <inbreath> that I learn things from , either explicit training of neural nets or of Gaussian mixture models or whatever . " 
D:  Uh  Suppose you don't use any of those things . 
D:  You say you have looked for acoustic change . 
D:  Well , what does that mean ? 
D:  That  that means you set some thresholds somewhere or something , 
D:  right ? 
D:  and  and so <inbreath> where do you get your thresholds from ? 
D:  From something that you looked at . 
D:  So <inbreath> you always have this problem , you 're going to new data 
D:  um  H how are you going to adapt whatever you can very quickly learn about the new data ? <inbreath> Uh , if it 's gonna be different from old data that you have ? 
D:  And I think that 's a problem  with this . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  But  Actually , Andreas may maybe  maybe just something simpler but  but along the lines of what you 're saying , 
D:  I was just realizing , I used to know this guy who used to build , uh <inbreath> um , mike mixers  automatic mike mixers where , you know , t in order to able to turn up the gain , you know , uh <inbreath> as much as you can , you  you  you lower the gain on  on the mikes of people who aren't talking , 
D:  right ? 
D:  And then he had some sort of <inbreath> reasonable way of doing that , 
D:  but <inbreath> uh , what if you were just looking at very simple measures like energy measures but you don't just compare it to some threshold  overall but you compare it to the <inbreath> energy in the other microphones . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , it 's probably harder , 
D:  but I  I think what I was s nnn noting just when he  when Andreas raised that , was that there 's other information to be gained from looking at all <inbreath> of the microphones and you may not need to look at very sophisticated things , 
D:  because if there 's  <inbreath> if most of the overlaps  you know , this doesn't cover , say , three , but if most of the overlaps , say , are two , <inbreath> if the distribution looks like there 's a couple high ones and  and  the rest of them are low , 
D:  you know , what I mean , 
D:  there 's some information there about their distribution even with very simple measures . 
D:  Uh , by the way , I had an idea with  while I was watching Chuck nodding at a lot of these things , is that we can all wear little bells on our heads , <inbreath> so that <laugh> then you 'd know that  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Wow . 
D:  Mm - hmm ? 
D:  Yeah , I think th 
D:  I think it 's a great idea . 
D:  W Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Blindfolds would be good . 
D:  Probably we should wait until after Adam 's set up the mikes , 
D:  But . 
D:  That 's  
D:  that 's  that 's  that 's the one that we videotape . 
D:  So . 
D:  Um , I  I wanna move this along . 
D:  Uh  I did have this other agenda item which is , uh @ @  it 's uh a list which I sent to uh  a couple folks , but um I wanted to get broader input on it , 
D:  So this is the things that I think we did <laugh> in the last three months 
D:  obviously not everything we did but  but sort of highlights that I can   can  tell  s some outside person , you know , what  what were you  actually working on . 
D:  Um  in no particular order <inbreath> uh , one , uh , ten more hours of meeting r meetings recorded , something like that , you know from  from , uh  three months ago . 
D:  Uh  XML formats and other transcription aspects sorted out  and uh  sent to IBM . 
D:  Um , pilot data put together and sent to IBM for transcription , 
D:  uh  next batch of recorded data put together on the CD - ROMs for shipment to IBM , 
D:  But yeah , that 's why I phrased it that way , yeah OK . 
D:  Um  human subjects approval on campus , uh  and release forms worked out 
D:  so the meeting participants have a chance to request audio pixelization of selected parts of the spee their speech . 
D:  Um <inbreath> audio pixelization software written and tested . 
D:  Um  <mouth> preliminary analysis of overlaps in the pilot data we have transcribed , 
D:  and exploratory analysis of long - distance inferences for topic coherence , that was  I was   wasn't  sure if those were the right way   that was the right way to describe that because of that little exercise that  that you  and  and Lokendra did . 
D:  I  well , I I 'm probably saying this wrong , but what I said was exploratory analysis of long - distance inferences <inbreath> for topic coherence . 
D:  Something like that . 
D:  Um  so , uh  I  <inbreath>  a lot of that was from , you know , what  what  what you two were doing 
D:  so I  I sent it to you , 
D:  and you know , please mail me , you know , the corrections or suggestions for changing 
D:  I  I don't want to make this twice it 's length but  <inbreath> but you know , just im improve it . 
D:  Um Is there anything anybody  
D:  " Bunch of stuff for s " 
D:  OK , maybe  maybe send me a sentence that 's a little thought through about that . 
D:  " Bunch of stuff " , yeah , " stuff " is probably bad too , 
D:  Yeah , well . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , yeah , 
D:  " range of things " , yeah . 
D:  Um  and  and you know , I sort of threw in what you did with what Jane did on  in  under the , uh  uh <inbreath> preliminary analysis of overlaps . 
D:  Uh <inbreath> uh <inbreath> Thilo , can you tell us about all the work you 've done on this project in the last , uh  last three months ? 
D:  That 's  
D:  Uh , audio pix wh he did it , 
D:  so why don't you explain it quickly ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  We  we  we spent a  a  a fair amount of time early on just talk dealing with this issue about op w e e <inbreath> we realized , " well , people are speaking in an impromptu way and they might say something that would embarrass them or others later " , and , how do you get around that 
D:  so in the consent form it says , well you  we will look at the transcripts later and if there 's something that you 're  unhappy with , yeah . 
D:  But you don't want to just totally excise it 
D:  because 
D:  um 
D:  uh , well you have to be careful about excising it , how  how you excise it 
D:  keeping the timing right and so forth 
D:  so that at the moment tho th the idea we 're running with is  is h putting the beep over it . 
D:  Yeah , that  I mean , he 's  he 's removing the old  thing 
D:  and  and  and  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Ke - keep a back door . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Alright , so , uh  I think we should , uh  uh , go on to the digits ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Um  I d I did  before we do the digits , I did also wanna remind people , uh  <inbreath> please do send me , you know , uh thoughts for an agenda , 
D:  yeah 
D:  that  that would be that 'd be good . 
D:  Eh So that , uh , people 's ideas don't get 
D:  yeah , well it does creep up , 
D:  doesn't it ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK , go ahead 
D:  OK , that 's  let 's  let 's  let 's do digits .
