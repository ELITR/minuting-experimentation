A:  It 's too late now . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  That is really great . 
A:  That 's terrific . 
A:  Now you won't be able to walk or ride your bike , huh ? 
A:  A list that you have to send off to who ? 
A:  Oh . 
A:  What about the , um  your trip , yesterday ? 
A:  Oh , OK . 
A:  Same idea ? 
A:  Hmm ! 
A:  But the numbers speak for themselves . 
A:  It 'd be interesting  
A:  But it w 
A:  It 'd be interesting to see what the total amount of time is in the overlaps , versus  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Well , here I have a question . 
A:  What  
A:  Well  
A:  In  in the two - person  
A:  So , in the two - person conversations ,  when there 's backchannel , is there a great deal of  overlap  in the speech ? 
A:  or  
A:  Cuz my impression is sometimes it happens when there 's a pause , 
A:  you know , like you  you get a lot of backchannel , when somebody 's pausing 
A:  It 's hard to do both , 
A:  huh ? 
A:  Um  no , when  when  when there 's backchannel , I mean , just  I was just listening , and  and when there 's two people talking and there 's backchannel it seems like ,  um the backchannel happens when , you know , the pitch drops and the first person  
A:  and a lot of times , the first person actually stops talking and then there 's a backchannel  and then they start up again , 
A:  and so I 'm wondering about  h I just wonder how much overlap there is . 
A:  Is there a lot ? 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  But maybe a  just a small overlap ? 
A:  I was just thinking more in terms of alignment , alignment overlap . 
A:  Hostile takeovers . 
A:  I wonder what determines who gets the floor ? 
A:  I mean  
A:  Why  why do we want to have a picture of the meeting ? 
A:  We can  can't you figure it out from the mike number ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  You know where you could get it ? 
A:  Beam - forming during the digit  uh stuff . 
A:  Just remembered a joke . 
A:  How big their heads are . 
A:  He agreed . 
A:  How did you do it Adam ? 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I mean , wh what was the  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Every frame that 's over what threshold ? 
A:  In terms of energy ? 
A:  Ah ! 
A:  OK . 
A:  Did you ever try running the filter before you pick a threshold ? 
A:  Who was it trained on ? 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  I think he 's saying the onset detector . 
A:  " Mixed " . 
A:  You have candidates . 
A:  to make marking easier . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  But he 's not gonna even read that . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Actually , I saw a uh  a woman at the bus stop the other day who , um , was talking on her cell phone <inbreath> speaking Japanese , and was bowing . 
A:  you know , profusely . 
A:  Just , kept  
A:  I 'll be peeking . 
A:  Technical stuff . 
A:  It 's too complicated . 
A:  No , no . 
A:  You can  you know , you could make a m as long as you keep using the same beep , people could make a model of that beep , 
A:  and  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , it 's more obvious that there was something there than if there 's just silence . 
A:  Yea - right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  But I mean if you just replaced it with silence ,  it 's not clear whether that 's really silence or  
A:  They 're easy to find , then . 
A:  Actually  actually I  I thought that 's what you were giving us was another meeting and I was like , " Oh , OK ! " 
A:  But it has to be hand - labeled first ? 
A:  That 'd be interesting . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  It 's too late now .
