B:  Uh - oh . 
B:  One t 
B:  One five , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Yeah , OK , 
B:  that 's a good idea . 
B:  I 'm on  I 'm on two and I should be on . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I don't know . 
B:  I  I don't know . 
B:  It 's very badly designed ? 
B:  Why ? 
B:  It 's not s It 's not supposed to cover up your ears . 
B:  I mean , it 's only badly  
B:  Oh , that 's strange . 
B:  OK . 
B:  It 's still the same words . 
B:  We didn't  
B:  That 's the microphone number . 
B:  Transcript number  
B:  Oh , God . 
B:  No , let me do it . 
B:  No , 
B:  but I 'm gonna look at the uh , logs as well . 
B:  Yeah , there  there  there was  there was a  there was a bug . 
B:  There was a glitch last time we ran . 
B:  No . 
B:  No , we don't . 
B:  But we  we ought to st we ought to standardize . 
B:  I think , <breath> uh , I s I spoke to somebody , Morgan ,  about that . 
B:  I think  I think we should put mar Well , no , w we can do that . 
B:  I know what they  they 're  they 're four , three , two , one . 
B:  In order now . 
B:  Three , 
B:  two , <breath> and one . 
B:  But I think  I think we should put them in standard positions . 
B:  I think we should make little marks on the table top . 
B:  So that we can put them  
B:  I guess that 's the point . 
B:  It 'll be a lot easier if we have a  if we have them permanently in place or something like that . 
B:  You do ? 
B:  Oh , gosh . 
B:  When 's it gonna be installed ? 
B:  I see . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Cool . 
B:  I see . 
B:  Distribute what ? 
B:  The data ? 
B:  Oh . 
B:  Yes . 
B:  Right . 
B:  The  
B:  It 's not so much the actu The logistics of distribution are secondary to  preparing the data in a suitable form for distribution . 
B:  And the other thing is that , um , University of Washington may want to start recording meetings as well , 
B:  in which case w w we 'll have to decide what we 've actually got so that we can give them a copy . 
B:  Oh , really ? 
B:  Different for you . 
B:  Yes . 
B:  I don't know . 
B:  I see . 
B:  All about that . 
B:  Oh , now you 've touched the fan control , 
B:  now all our data 's gonna be  
B:  Yeah , it 's great . 
B:  That 's  
B:  Oh , yeah . 
B:  Absolutely . 
B:  Well it 's  well like <breath> " low " is mid  mid - scale . 
B:  So it could be <laugh> that it 's not actually wired backwards 
B:  it 's just that ambiguous . 
B:  Oh , they do . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh , yeah . 
B:  What 's it sound like ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , 
B:  absolutely . 
B:  Absolutely . 
B:  Uh - huh . 
B:  Sure , 
B:  of course . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Let 's . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  That 's right . 
B:  Oh , really . 
B:  I have such a hard name . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Wow . 
B:  That 's true . 
B:  We don't  we don't know , actually . 
B:  We haven't decided which  which time we care about , 
B:  and that 's kind of one of the things that you 're saying , is like  <breath> you have the option to put in more or less timing data  
B:  and , uh , be in the absence of more specific instructions , <breath> we 're trying to figure out what the most convenient thing to do is . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  It could do that 
B:  couldn't it . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I would have thought so , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Yeah , yeah , 
B:  but  
B:  But we 've got  we 've got the most channel data . 
B:  We 'd have to do it from your signal . 
B:  Right . 
B:  I mean , we 've  we 've got  we 've got a lot of data . 
B:  Right . 
B:  but the chances are if we if we 're talking about collecting <breath> ten or a hundred hours , which is going to take a hundred or a thousand hours to transcribe  
B:  If we 're just doing silence detection  
B:  Um , i it seems like  
B:  Well , 
B:  uh , I don't know . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I mean , it  it 's  it 's maybe like  <breath> a week 's work to get to do something like this . 
B:  So forty or fifty hours . 
B:  Sure . 
B:  Several minutes . 
B:  Well , no , you should do it  you should do it  <breath> Do it again from scratch 
B:  and then do it again at the boundaries . 
B:  So you do the whole thing three times 
B:  and then we get  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh ! 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  The point we  where do we get the  the  the oracle boundaries from ? 
B:  Or the boundaries . 
B:  We  we  we could get fake  
B:  That would be the automatic boundaries . 
B:  Well it w 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yes . 
B:  Right . 
B:  So I  I need to  we need to look at what  what the final output is 
B:  but it seems like <breath> we  it doesn't  it seems like it 's not really not that hard to have an automatic tool to generate <breath> the phrase marks , and the speaker , and speaker identity without putting in the words . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  No . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , I mean I don't know if we 'd be able to do any thing f to help STP type problems . 
B:  But certainly for this problem we can do a lot better than  
B:  No . 
B:  Because they had  because they only had two speakers , right ? 
B:  I mean , the  the segmentation problem is  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , they won't . 
B:  They w they 'll refuse to do it . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  No , but I mean , they  they  they won't  they won't  they will refuse to transcribe this kind of material . 
B:  That 's not what they 're d quoting for , right ? 
B:  For quoting meetings ? 
B:  Wow . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
B:  I see . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  That 's right . 
B:  Yeah , it 'd be cheap . 
B:  Cheap to transcribe . 
B:  Well , for ten thousand dollars . 
B:  Three hundred . 
B:  How  how much lower are they ? 
B:  Ten . 
B:  Yeah , give them a break . 
B:  No , it isn't . 
B:  So . 
B:  Yep , yep . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  No . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , 
B:  out of  out of Adam 's pocket . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  We 'd like to . 
B:  Unfortunately  
B:  Yeah , that 's right . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  What s so what are you  so you 've done some portion of the first meeting . 
B:  And what 's your plan ? 
B:  To carry on doing it ? 
B:  OK . 
B:  What  what do they  what do they cover ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , yeah , 
B:  their academic . 
B:  Oh , really ? 
B:  Linguists . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Pre - lay . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I transcribed a minute of this stuff 
B:  and there was a lot of overlapping . 
B:  It was  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  It was at the beginning . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  You don't have to . 
B:  Uh - huh . 
B:  I see . 
B:  No . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  But that 's  but there 's only one  there 's only one time boundary for both speakers , 
B:  right ? 
B:  OK . 
B:  No . 
B:  " Uh - huh " is " U H H U H . " 
B:  H U H . " 
B:  We have to mark those ? 
B:  Don't they  d can't we just leave them unmarked ? 
B:  OK . 
B:  Sure . 
B:  Uh , yeah , 
B:  it seems like  
B:  it seems like the , uh , tran the transcription problem would be very different if we had these <breath> automatic speaker detection turn placing things . 
B:  Because suddenly  
B:  I mean , I don't know , 
B:  actually it sounds like there might be a problem <breath> putting it into the software if the software only handles two parallel channels . 
B:  But assuming we can get around that somehow . 
B:  But what if you wanna edit it ? 
B:  Right ? 
B:  I mean , the point is we 're gonna generate <breath> this transcript with five  five tracks in it , but with no words . 
B:  Someone 's gonna have to go in and type in the words . 
B:  Um , 
B:  and if there are five  five people speaking at once , 
B:  Oh , yeah . 
B:  Yes . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  But the only time that becomes ambiguous is if you have two speakers . 
B:  Like , if you  <breath> If you only have one person , if you only have one thought that 's continuing across a particular time boundary , you just need <breath> one arrow at each end , 
B:  and if it 's picked up by a different speaker , it 's picked up by a different speaker . 
B:  The time it becomes ambiguous if you have more than one speaker and that  and they sort of swap . 
B:  I guess if you have more than one thread going , then you  <breath> then you need to know whether they were swapped or not . 
B:  Hopefully not very much . 
B:  Sure . 
B:  I know . 
B:  But it  it does feel  it does feel like it 's really in there . 
B:  I  you know I did this  I did this transcription 
B:  and I marked that , I marked it with ellipsis 
B:  because it seemed like there was a difference . 
B:  It 's something you wanted to indicate that it  that I  this was the end of the phrase , 
B:  this was the end of <breath> that particular transcript , 
B:  but it was continued later . 
B:  And I picked up with an ellipsis . 
B:  I didn't have the equal , not equal thing . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  No . 
B:  But it 's something @ @ that I feel we definitely ought to do . 
B:  Yeah , it took me half an hour to transcribe a minute , 
B:  but I didn't have any  I didn't even have a  
B:  I was trying to get Transcriber to run but I couldn't . 
B:  So I was doing it by typ typing into a text file and trying to fit  
B:  It was horrible . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Is it  
B:  It was actually  it was quite  it was a t 
B:  it w 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  No . 
B:  Web site ! 
B:  That 's great ! 
B:  We could have like business - to - business E - commerce as well ! 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  We can have  
B:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
B:  Yes . 
B:  Yes . 
B:  We c 
B:  we can do it all ! 
B:  We can write  
B:  Oh . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  We could actually  maybe we could use the TCL plug - in . 
B:  Oh , man . 
B:  I know , 
B:  but that  but , I  
B:  Right . 
B:  But I should be allowed to 
B:  but  
B:  I sh I shouldn't be allowed to by m by my own  <breath> by my  according to my own priorities . 
B:  Alright . 
B:  Let 's look at it anyway . 
B:  So definitely we should  we should have some kind of access to the data . 
B:  Yes . 
B:  Well , yeah . 
B:  Well so then th 
B:  the other side is , yeah . 
B:  Right , 
B:  that 's the problem . 
B:  No one owns the project . 
B:  No one owns the project . 
B:  No one wants to own the project . 
B:  Well then you have to do the web site . 
B:  You know , it 's like , it 's that simple . 
B:  No  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  That 's obviously not true , 
B:  but you have  
B:  Right . 
B:  That 's true . 
B:  That 's right . 
B:  No , both . 
B:  I  I  I  I  
B:  I 'm not  o 
B:  OK . 
B:  I 'm not sure how  how <breath> important that distinction is . 
B:  I don't think <breath> we should say , <breath> " oh , it 's internal 
B:  therefore we don't have to make it very good " . 
B:  I mean , you can say <breath> " oh  oh , it 's internal 
B:  therefore we can put data in it that we don't  we don't have to worry about releasing " . 
B:  But I think the point is to try and <breath> be coherent and make it a nice presentation . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Ah . 
B:  Great . 
B:  No , 
B:  we 're doing  we 're doing great . 
B:  What ? 
B:  What ? 
B:  I see . 
B:  You trying to  screw up the m the microphones ? 
B:  I mean th 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Right . 
B:  All the lights . 
B:  Velcro . 
B:  No . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  It 's like a  it 's a sleeping policeman . 
B:  Speed bump ! 
B:  Speed bump . 
B:  That 's the s that 's British for speed bump , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  How else are you gonna distribute them around the tables ? 
B:  Oh , because then you don't have to just have one each . 
B:  So that if t if you have two people sitting next to each other they can actually go into the same box . 
B:  Only if you had  
B:  Well it depends on this box , right ? 
B:  Exactly . 
B:  Hmm ! 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  But there are only four . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , I mean , we  I had that last time . 
B:  But uh there are actually  that you know , there 's an extra  there 's a mix out on the radio receiver ? 
B:  So there are actually six <breath> XLR outs on the back of the radio receiver 
B:  and only five cables going in , 
B:  I had the wrong five , 
B:  so I ended up <breath> not recording one of the channels and recording the mix . 
B:  No . 
B:  But I subtracted the four that I did have from the mix and got a pretty good approximation of the @ @ . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  It 's not bad . 
B:  It 's not bad , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  But , you always  
B:  Hmm ! 
B:  See 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yep . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh , yeah ! 
B:  Well w yeah , exactly . 
B:  We 'll know  we 'll know to come after . 
B:  Sorry ? 
B:  Oh ! 
B:  Sure . 
B:  Well of course we do . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , yeah , 
B:  yeah . Sure . 
B:  Which we 'll borrow from them , <laugh> when we need it . 
B:  Oh , a Applecard . 
B:  Sure . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah , you could use my machine . 
B:  I  or the  
B:  Uh , that 's an ethernet connection . 
B:  It 's going next door . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  No , no , 
B:  absolutely , that 's the right way to do it . 
B:  T to have it uh , just  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  And given  given that we 've got a wireless  that we 've got a  we got the field . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I don't know . 
B:  W we don't need X access 
B:  but I mean that 's fine . 
B:  That 's  that 's what it does , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  So  
B:  With a  with a  with a  w 
B:  No . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I do ! 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  No , 
B:  I would love to 
B:  but I 'm not sure if my laptop is compatible with the wave LAN thing they 're using . 
B:  Well Apple has their own thing , right ? 
B:  Apple has their own thing . 
B:  And  
B:  Yeah , 
B:  I think what  
B:  I think you  I think it just plug plugs in a PC card , 
B:  so you could probably make it run with that , 
B:  but . 
B:  Yeah , I 'm sure . 
B:  I imagine there is . 
B:  But  uh anyway 
B:  there are  there are abs there are a bunch of machines at ICSI that have those cards 
B:  and so I think if w if it doesn't  we should be able to find a machine that does that . 
B:  I  I mean I know that 
B:  doesn't  don't  don't the important people have those little blue VAIOs that  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  I see . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  Absolutely . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  You 're kidding ! 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  I 'd trade them a flat panel display for it . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Huge VU meters . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  That 's an end 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  I think and uh , having  having it on wireless is  is the neatest way  neatest way to do it . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh , cool . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Um , 
B:  well , that sounds like a d good solution one way or the other . 
B:  We 'd  I think  
B:  Uh - oh ! 
B:  Uh - oh ! 
B:  Does that  it means  it means it 's gonna explode . 
B:  No . 
B:  Um  
B:  This  
B:  So again , Washington wants to equip a system . 
B:  Our system , we spent ten thousand dollars on equipment not including the PC . 
B:  However , seven and a half thousand of that was the wireless mikes . 
B:  Uh , 
B:  using  using these  
B:  Yeah , 
B:  that 's true 
B:  but we haven't spent that , right ? 
B:  But once we  once we 've done the intellectual part of these , uh , we can just knock them out , right ? 
B:  We can start  <breath> we  you can make a hundred of them or something . 
B:  And then we could  
B:  Washington could have a system that didn't have any wireless but would had  what 's based on these 
B:  and it would cost  
B:  PC and two thousand dollars for the A - to - D stuff . 
B:  And that 's about  cuz you wouldn't even need the mixer if you didn't have the  
B:  Oh th <breath> the P Z 
B:  P Z Ms cost a lot . 
B:  But anyway you 'd save , on the seven  seven or eight thousand for the  for the wireless system . 
B:  So actually that might be attractive . 
B:  OK , 
B:  I can move my thumb now . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , but if the words are more predictable . 
B:  Mmm ! 
B:  Sorry . 
B:  Tha - tha 
B:  Yeah , 
B:  that 's been filled in for you . 
B:  But they 're in order ! 
B:  They start , six , seven , eight , nine , zero , one , two , three , four , five , six , eight , nine . 
B:  And they 're in order because they 're sorted lexically by the file names , which are  have the numbers in digits . 
B:  And so they 're actually  this is like all the  all utterances that were generated by speaker MPJ or something . 
B:  And then within MPJ they 're sorted by what he actually said . 
B:  It doesn't matter ! 
B:  It 's like  Cuz you said " six , seven , eight " . 
B:  We think it doesn't matter . 
B:  If I  if not I  
B:  Cuz we have these writt written down , right ? 
B:  That 's why  
B:  You can  you can generate  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  That 's a great idea . 
B:  Alright . 
B:  Looks good . 
B:  Looks like there were no errors . 
B:  There were no  there were no direct driver errors , by the look of it , which is good . 
B:  So I 'm gonna stop it . 
B:  Yeah , 
B:  OK . 
B:  Uh - oh .
