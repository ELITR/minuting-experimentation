C:  but he 's not gonna say anything . 
C:  This is Eric on channel three , I believe . 
C:  You 're always having one of those days , Dave . 
C:  It 's not neck mounted . 
C:  It 's supposed to be h head mounted . 
C:  Right . 
C:  i 
C:  Yeah , that 's  that 's what I have . 
C:  It feels so good when I stop . 
C:  You 're always doing digits . 
C:  OK , this is Eric on microphone number three , 
C:  Would it make you feel more important ? 
C:  I see . 
C:  Well , I think  I mean , for that particular issue ther there are known sources where people go to  to find these kind of things like the LDC for instance . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah , a little bit . 
C:  It would  you know , it would real really mean that we should do short meetings when you <laugh> turn off the   turn off the air conditioning , 
C:  got to finish this meeting . 
C:  That 's right . 
C:  Right , 
C:  I see . 
C:  So , 
C:  um , in addition to this issue about the UW stuff there was announced today , uh , via the LDC , um , a corpus from I believe Santa Barbara . 
C:  Um , of general spoken English . 
C:  And I don't know exactly how they recorded it 
C:  but apparently there 's a lot of different <breath> styles of speech and what not . 
C:  And  
C:  I see . 
C:  So it is sort of far field stuff . 
C:  Right ? 
C:  Oh , OK . 
C:  S 
C:  But it may be  it may be useful in  
C:  Well , what I was thinking is it may be useful in transcribing , if it 's far field stuff , 
C:  right ? 
C:  In doing , um , some of our first automatic speech recognition models , it may be useful to have that kind of data 
C:  because that 's very different than any kind of data that we have so far . 
C:  That 's  that 's not great . 
C:  No , and their web  their web page didn't answer it either . 
C:  So I 'm , I uh , was thinking that we should contact them . 
C:  So it 's  that 's sort of a beside - the - point point . 
C:  But . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Uh , in fact we get it for free 
C:  cuz they 're distributing it through the LDC . 
C:  So , I can  I can actually arrange for it to arrive in short order if we 're  
C:  Huh . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Maybe we should  maybe we should get a copy of it just to see what they did 
C:  so  so that we can  we can compare . 
C:  Alright , I 'll do that . 
C:  I can't remember the name of the corpus . 
C:  It 's Corps - S  
C:  S  
C:  Right , 
C:  OK . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well they 're  
C:  Apparently this was like phase one 
C:  and the there 's still more that they 're gonna do apparently or something like that 
C:  unless of course they have funding issues 
C:  and then then it ma they may not do phase two 
C:  but <breath> from all the web documentation it looked like , " oh , this is phase one " , 
C:  whatever that means . 
C:  OK . 
C:  But , it uh it would also maybe help be helpful for Liz , if she wanted to start working on some discourse issues , you know , looking at some of this data and then , 
C:  you know  
C:  So when she gets here maybe that might be a good thing for her . 
C:  Maybe we should have a big meeting meeting . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Oh . 
C:  Right . 
C:  But maybe we should , uh find some day that Liz  uh , Liz and Andreas seem to be around more often . 
C:  So maybe we should find a day when they 're gonna be here and  and Morgan 's gonna be here , 
C:  and we can meet , 
C:  at least this subgroup . 
C:  I mean , not necessarily have the U - dub people down . 
C:  We need  we need to talk to them some more . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  How fast are you ? 
C:  Right . 
C:  Well , I mean , but sometimes it 's easier to type out something instead of going through and figuring out which is the right  
C:  I mean , it depends on the error rate , 
C:  right ? 
C:  But we don't care about the timing of the words . 
C:  We cut it s s 
C:  Right . 
C:  So maybe  
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  So 
C:  maybe  maybe we could try the following experiment . 
C:  Take the data that you 've already transcribed 
C:  and  
C:  Already in the past . 
C:  She  she 's done one  she 's one  
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  I 'm go 
C:  Right . 
C:  Um , 
C:  and  and throw out the words , 
C:  but keep the time markings . 
C:  And then go through  I mean , and go through and  and try and re - transcribe it , given that we had perfect boundary detection . 
C:  And see if it  see if it  see if it feels easier to you . 
C:  Yeah , I mean uh , that 's part of the problem is , is that what we really need is somebody else to come along . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  No , no , no , no . 
C:  You wanna know  given  Given a perfect human segmentation , I mean , you wanna know how well  
C:  I mean , the  the question is , is it worth giving you the segmentation ? 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  I mean , there 's gonna  there 's gonna be  in the meeting , like the reading group meeting that we had the other day , that 's  it 's gonna be a bit of a problem 
C:  because , like , I wasn't wearing a microphone 
C:  f and there were other people that weren't wearing microphones . 
C:  That 's pretty much true 
C:  but  
C:  but , yes . 
C:  OK . 
C:  So that 's three  that 's three hours . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  And who 
C:  who knows if they 're gonna be able to m manage multal multiple channel data ? 
C:  Right . 
C:  So , meanwhile  
C:  So it 's thirty dollars an hour , essentially , right ? 
C:  But we can pay a graduate student seven dollars an hour . 
C:  And the question is what 's the difference  
C:  or ei eight dollars . 
C:  What  do you know what the going rate is ? 
C:  It 's  it 's <breath> on the order of eight to ten . 
C:  I think . 
C:  But I 'm not sure . 
C:  Let 's say ten . 
C:  Cuz it 's easier . 
C:  Yeah , I  I  I don't  I don't know what the  I don't know what the standard  
C:  but there is a standard pay scale 
C:  I just don't know what it is . 
C:  Um , 
C:  so that means that even if it takes them thirty times real time it 's cheaper to  to do graduate students . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  That 's a  
C:  Oh , so multi multichannels . 
C:  I see . 
C:  OK . 
C:  For transcription . 
C:  It 's  
C:  They 're  they have some connection to the LDC 
C:  cuz the LDC has been advising them on this process , 
C:  the Linguistic Data Consortium . 
C:  Um , 
C:  so  
C:  but a apart from that . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  How are you handling backchannels ? 
C:  What do you mean by du 
C:  I see . 
C:  Well , yeah , 
C:  what I mean is wh I mean , when somebody says " uh - huh " in the middle of , uh , a @ @  
C:  Oh , cuz I was  I was listening to  Dan was agreeing a lot to things that you were saying as you were talking . 
C:  So . 
C:  And  
C:  I see . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  So , s 
C:  I was just gonna ask , uh , so I just wanted to c sort of finish off the question I had about backchannels , 
C:  if that 's OK , 
C:  which  which was , so say somebody 's talking for a while 
C:  and somebody goes " mm - hmm " in the middle of it , and  and  and what not , 
C:  does the conversation come out from the  or the person who 's speaking for the long time as one segment and then there 's this little tiny segment <breath> of this other speaker 
C:  or does it  does the fact that there 's a backchannel split the  the  the  it in two . 
C:  OK . 
C:  OK . 
C:  I see , 
C:  I see , 
C:  OK . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Huh - uh . 
C:  How often does that happen do you think ? 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  So  so if we hired a who if we hired a whole bunch of Dan 's  
C:  So  
C:  Is there  
C:  Maybe we should s consider also , um , starting to build up a web site around all of these things . 
C:  I know . 
C:  That 's right . 
C:  No , but I 'm 
C:  it would be interesting  it would be interesting to see  
C:  I want to introduce  
C:  I  I want to introduce the word " snot - head " into the conversation at this point . 
C:  You see , cuz  uh , cuz  
C:  Exactly . 
C:  Um . 
C:  No . 
C:  The r 
C:  w What  
C:  OK . 
C:  No . 
C:  Alright , 
C:  see here 's  here 's  here 's my thought behind it 
C:  which is that , uh , the  the stuff that you 've been describing , Jane , I gu one has to , <laugh> of course <laugh> indicate ,  <breath> um , i is very interesting , 
C:  and 
C:  I I 'd like to be able to  to pore through , you know , the  the types of tr conventions that you 've come up with and stuff like that . 
C:  So I would like to see that kind of stuff on the web . 
C:  Either 's fine . 
C:  Ow . 
C:  See he said the word TCL and  and that 's  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right , 
C:  so we can add in links and stuff like that to other things . 
C:  The  
C:  Uh , right . 
C:  Well , we could put  we could put sort of a disorganized sort of group gestalt  
C:  Right . 
C:  No , I think in 
C:  I think mostly internal . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Internal to the project . 
C:  No . 
C:  No . 
C:  What is  
C:  What does that mean ? 
C:  Is it a speed bump ? 
C:  Wow . 
C:  It could go either way . 
C:  I guess . 
C:  Well  
C:  He 's  
C:  Well  
C:  What is the , um , projector supposed to be hooked up to ? 
C:  But I mean , that 's another  that 's another possibility that , you know , solves  
C:  It 's  it really come down to the driver . 
C:  I mean  
C:  Now , shorter words wouldn't  would induce more dynamics , 
C:  right ? 
C:  You want to have  
C:  Huh . 
C:  I 'm done . 
C:  Dan isn't 
C:  but he 's not gonna say anything .
