A:  <mike noise> OK , this is one channel . <mike noise> Can you uh , say your name and talk into your mike one at a time ? 
C:  This is Eric on channel three , I believe . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Uh , I don't think it 's on there , Jane . 
D:  Tasting one two three , tasting .  
E:  OK , this is Jane on channel five . 
A:  Uh , I still don't see you Jane . 
E:  Oh , darn , what am I doing wrong ? 
D:  Can you see me on channel four ? 
D:  Really ? 
D:  My lucky day . 
E:  Uh , screen no ,  it is , oh , maybe it just warmed up ? 
A:  Yeah , I s 
A:  No . 
E:  Oh , darn , can you can't see channel five yet ? 
A:  Uh , well , the mike isn't close enough to your mouth , so . 
E:  <mike noise> Oh , this would be k OK , is that better ? 
D:  I like the high quality labelling . 
A:  S uh , try speaking loudly , so , OK , good . Thank you . 
E:  Hello , hello . Alright . 
D:  David , can we borrow your labelling machine to improve the quality of the labelling a little bit here ? 
B:  <mike noise> <breath> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  Numbers from one to  zero to X or something ? 
D:  @ @  How  how many are there , one to five ? 
B:  One t 
B:  <mike noise> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath> One five , yeah . 
E:  Would you like to join the meeting ?  I bet  
D:  Yeah , please . 
A:  Well , we don't wanna renumber them , cuz we 've already have like , forms filled out with the numbers on them . So , let 's keep the same numbers on them . 
D:   
B:  Yeah , OK , that 's a good idea . 
C:   
E:   
A:  OK , Dan , are you on ? 
B:  I 'm on  I 'm on two and I should be on .

E:  <inbreath> 
F:  I 'm  I shouldn't . I 've got something  
D:  We ' r we 're  
D:  we ' r This is  this  this is a meeting meeting . 
E:  This is abou we 're  we 're mainly being taped but we 're gonna talk about , uh , transcription for the m future meeting meetings . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Stuff . 
D:  <mike noise> 
A:  Yeah , this is not something you need to attend . So . 
F:  No , I shouldn't really . I would have on another day , but it 's been one of those days today .  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  <inbreath> e 
E:  OK . 
C:  You 're always having one of those days , Dave . 
E:  Y you 'd be welcome . You 'd be welcome . 
A:  Besides , I don't want anyone who has a weird accent . Right , Dan ?  
E:  <laugh> 
D:  So , I don't understand if it 's neck mounted you don't get very good performance .  
C:  It 's not neck mounted . <mike noise> It 's supposed to be h head mounted . 
D:  Yeah . It  it should be head mounted . Right ?  
C:  Right . 
A:  Well , then put it on your head . What are you doing ? 
B:  I don't know . 
D:  Cuz when you do this , you can   
D:  Rouww - Rouww .  
E:  Why didn't I  you were saying that but I could hear you really well on the  on the transcription  on the , uh , tape . 
B:  <mike noise> 
B:  I  I don't know . 
A:  Well , I m I would prefer that people wore it on their head but they were complaining about it . 
C:  i 
D:  Why ? 
A:  Because it 's not  it doesn't go over the ears . 
E:  It 's badly designed . 
A:  It 's very badly designed so it 's  
B:  It 's very badly designed ? Why ? It 's not s It 's not supposed to cover up your ears . I mean , it 's only badly  
D:  What do you mean it doesn't go over the ears ? 
D:  <mike noises> 
A:  Yeah but , there 's nowhere to put the pad so it 's comfortable . 
E:  So that 's what you 're d He 's got it on his temples so it cuts off his circulation .   
D:  <mike noises> 
E:  <mike noise> 
C:  Yeah , that 's  that 's what I have . 
B:  Oh , that 's strange . 
A:  And it feels so good that way .  
D:  <snoring sounds> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
C:  It feels so good when I stop . 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  Try it . 
D:  Somebody wanna  
A:  So I  I again would like to do some digits . Um . 
D:  Somebody wanna close the door ? 
B:  <mike noise> OK .  
D:  <mike noises> 
A:  Sure . 
E:  We could do it with noise .  
E:  <mike noise> 
A:  So let me  
C:  You 're always doing digits . 
D:  <mike noises> 
A:  Well , you know , I 'm just that sort of  
A:  digit - y g sorta guy . 
B:  <breath> <laugh> 
D:  When can we do the alphabet ?  
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <mike noise> 
A:  OK . So this is Adam . <breath> 
E:  Uh , this is the same one I had before .  
B:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  I doubt it . 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  It 's still the same words .

topic_description:	digit task


A:  Thanks . Should I turn off the VU meter Dan ? Do you think that makes any difference ? 
B:  Oh , God . No , let me do it . 
A:  Why ?  Are you gonna do something other than hit " quit " ? 
B:  No , but I 'm gonna look at the uh , logs as well . 
A:  Oh . 
E:  Uh , you said turn off the what ? 
A:  Should have done it before . 
A:  The VU meter which tells you what the levels on the various mikes are and there was one hypothesis that perhaps that  
E:  Oh . 
A:  <breath> the act of 
A:  recording the VU meter was one of the things that contributed to the errors . 
D:  <mike noise> 
E:  Oh , I see . 
D:  Yeah , but Eric , uh , you didn't think that was a reasonable hypothesis , right ? 
E:  I See . 
A:  That was me , I thought that was  
D:  Oh , I 'm sorry y 
D:  That was malarkey . <mike noise> 
A:  Well , the only reason that could be is if the driver has a bug . 
A:  Right ? Because the machine just isn't very heavily loaded . 
D:  <inbreath> 
D:  No chance of that . <laugh> 
A:  No chance of that . Just because it 's beta . 
B:  Yeah , there  there  there was  there was a  there was a bug . There was a glitch last time we ran . 
A:  Look OK ? 
D:  Are - are yo are you recording where the table mikes are by the way ? Do you know which channels  
B:  No . 
A:  Yeah , we usually do that . 
B:  @ @  No , we don't . <breath> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah .  
D:  Why not ? 
B:  But we  we ought to st we ought to standardize . I think , <breath> uh , I s I spoke to 
B:  somebody , Morgan ,  about that . 
B:  <breath> I think  I think we should put mar Well , no , w we can do that . I know what they  they 're  they 're four , three , two , one . 
D:  Why don't you just do this ? 
A:  I mean , that 's what we 've done before . 
B:  <breath> In order now . 
D:  Four . 
B:  Three , 
D:  Three . 
B:  two , <breath> and one . But I think  I think we should put them in standard positions . I think we should make little marks on the table top . 
E:  Oh , OK . 
B:  So that we can put them  
A:  Which means we need to move this thing , and sorta decide how we 're actually going to do things . 
B:  I guess that 's the point . It 'll be a lot easier if we have a  if we have them permanently in place or something like that . 
A:  So .  
A:  Right .  
E:  I do wish there were big booms coming down from the ceiling . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  You do ? 
E:  <laugh> Yeah .  
A:  <breath> 
C:  Would it make you feel more important ? 
E:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . You know . 
A:  Mmm .  
C:  I see . 
D:  Wait till the projector gets installed . 
A:  That 'll work . 
E:  Oh , that 'll be good . OK . 
A:  That 'll work .  
B:  Oh , gosh . 
D:  Cuz it 's gonna hang down , make noise . 
B:  When 's it gonna be installed ? 
E:  OK .  
D:  Well , <laugh> it depends on  <laugh> 
B:  I see . 
D:  Is this b is this being recorded ? <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> That 's right . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Uh , I think Lila actually is almost getting r pretty close to even getting ready to put out the purchase order . <laugh> 
B:  OK . Cool . 
D:  I handed it off to her about a month ago . 
B:  I see . 
C:  <mike noise> 
topic_description:	recording setup issues


A:  OK , so , 
A:  topic of this meeting is I wanna talk a little bit about transcription . 
A:  <breath> Um , I 've looked a little bit into commercial transcription services and Jane has been working on doing transcription . 
A:  <breath> Uh , and so we wan wanna decide what we 're gonna do with that <breath> and then get an update on the electronics , 
A:  <breath> and then , uh , maybe also talk a little bit about some infrastructure and tools , and so on . 
A:  Um , you know , eventually we 're probably gonna wanna distribute this thing and we should decide how we 're gonna  
A:  how we 're gonna handle some of these factors . 
A:  <breath> So . 
B:  Distribute what ? <breath> The data ? 
A:  Hmm ? 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right .  
A:  <breath> I mean , so we 're  we 're collecting a corpus and I think it 's gonna be generally useful . 
A:  I mean , it seems like it 's not a corpus which is  uh , has been done before . 
A:  And so I think people will be interested in having  having it ,  and so we will  
B:  Oh . 
D:  u Using , like , audio D V Ds or something like that ? 
B:  Yes .  
A:  Excuse me ? 
D:  Audio D V Ds ? 
A:  Well , or something . 
A:  Yeah , audio D V Ds , C Ds , 
D:  Or t 
A:  you know .  
D:  Yeah .  
D:  tapes . 
A:  And  and so how we do we distribute the transcripts , how do we distribute the audio files , how do we  
A:  how do we just do all that infrastructure ? 
C:  Well , I think  I mean , for that particular issue ther there are known sources where people go to  to find these kind of things like the LDC for instance . 
E:  Yeah , that 's right .  
A:  Right , but  but so should we do it in the same format as LDC and what does that mean to what we 've done already ? 
B:  <breath> Right . The  
C:  <breath> <mike noise> 
B:  It 's not so much the actu The logistics of distribution are secondary to  preparing the data in a suitable form for distribution . 
C:  <breath> 
C:  Right . 
A:  Right .  So , uh , 
A:  as it is , it 's sort of a  ad - hoc combination of stuff Dan set and stuff I set up , which we may wanna make a little more formal . 
A:  So .  
topic_description:	summary of meeting agenda items, data distribution


B:  And the other thing is that , um , 
B:  University of Washington may want to start recording meetings as well , in which case 
A:  Right . 
B:  w w we 'll have to decide what we 've actually got so that we can 
B:  give them a copy . 
D:  A field trip . 
A:  That 's right . 
A:  Yeah .  I was actually thinking I wouldn't mind spending the summer up there . That would be kind of fun .  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh , really ? 
A:  Yeah .  
B:  Different for you . Yes . 
A:  Visit my friends and 
A:  spend some time   <inbreath> Well , and then also I have a bunch of stuff for doing this digits . 
A:  So I have a bunch of scripts with X Waves , and some Perl scripts , and other things that make it really easy to extract out <breath> and align where the digits are . 
A:  <breath> And if U d UW 's going to do the same thing I think it 's worth while for them to do these digits tasks as well . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <breath> And what I 've done is pretty ad - hoc , 
A:  um , so we might wanna change it over to something a little more standard . 
C:  Hmm .  
A:  You know , STM files , or XML , or something . 
D:  An - and there 's interest up there ? 
A:  What 's that ? 
D:  There 's interest up there ? 
A:  Well they  they certainly wanna collect more data . 
A:  And so they 're applying , I think I B M ? Is that right ?  
B:  I don't know . 
A:  Something like that .  
A:  <breath> Um , for some more money to do more data . So we were planning to do like thirty or forty hours worth of meetings . 
A:  <breath> They wanna do an additional hundred or so hours . So , they want a very large data set . 
A:  <breath> Um , but of course we 're not gonna do that if we don't get money . 
A:  So .  
B:  I see . 
A:  And I would like that just to get a disjoint speaker set and a disjoint room . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  I mean , one of the things Morgan and I were talking about is we 're gonna get to know this room really well , the  the acoustics of this room . 
topic_description:	University of Washington, data collection


D:  Including the fan . Did you notice the fan difference ? 
B:  All about that . 
A:  Including the fan .  
B:  Oh , now you 've touched the fan control , now all our data 's gonna be  
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Hear the difference ? 
E:  Oh , that 's better . 
B:  Yeah , it 's great . 
A:  Oh , it 's enormous . 
D:  Do you wanna leave it off or not ? <laugh> 
E:  That 's better . 
A:  All the others have been on . 
D:  Yeah , the  You sure ? 
B:  That 's  
B:  Oh , yeah . Absolutely . 
D:  You  <inbreath> You think that  
A:  y Absolut -  
D:  things after the f then 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  <inbreath> This fan 's wired backwards by the way . 
D:  Uh , I think this is high speed here . 
E:  Yeah , it 's noticeable . 
D:  Well , not clear . Maybe it  Maybe it isn't . 
B:  Well it 's  well like <breath> " low " is mid  mid - scale .  So it could be <laugh> that it 's not actually wired backwards it 's just that ambiguous .  
D:  <laugh> That 's right .  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <breath> I was wondering also , 
D:  Get ready .  
E:  Uh - huh .  
D:  whether the lights made any noise . 
A:  There 's definitely  Yep . High pitch hum . Wow . 
B:  Oh , they do . Yeah . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , a little bit . 
B:  <breath> 
D:  So , <laugh> do our meetings in the dark with no air conditioning in the future . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Yeah , just get a variety . 
E:  I think 
E:  candles would be nice if they don't make noise . 
B:  Oh , yeah . 
A:  They 're very good . 
C:  It would  you know , it would real really mean that we should do short meetings when you <laugh> turn off the   
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Carbon monoxide poisoning ? 
D:  Short meetings , that 's right .  Or  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
C:  turn off the air conditioning , <mock heavy breathing> 
D:  Yeah , sort of  r r 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  got to finish this meeting . 
D:  Tear t  
D:  Tear your clothing off to stay cool . <laugh> 
C:  That 's right . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Actually , the a th air  the air conditioning 's still working , that 's just an auxiliary fan . 
C:  Right , I see . 
topic_description:	chitchat


C:  So , um , in addition to this issue about the UW stuff there was announced today , uh , via the LDC , um , a corpus from I believe Santa Barbara . 
A:  So - 
E:  Yeah , I saw it . I 've been watching for that corpus . 
C:  Um , of general spoken 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  English . 
E:  Yep .  
C:  And I don't know exactly how they recorded it but apparently there 's a lot of different <breath> styles of speech and what not . And  
D:  <breath> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  They had people come in to a certain degree and they  and they have DAT recorders . 
C:  I see . So it is sort of far field stuff . 
E:  <breath> I  I assume so , actually , I hadn't thought about that . Unless they added 
C:  Right ? 
E:  close field later on but , um , I 've listened to some of those data and I , um , I 've been  I  I was actually on the advisory board for when they set the project up . 
A:  Mm - hmm .  
C:  Oh , OK . 
E:  I 'm glad to see that it got released . So it it 's a very nice thing . 
B:  What 's it sound like ? 
A:  Yeah , I  I wish  
C:  <breath> S 
A:  I wish we had someone here working on adaptation because it would nice to be able to take that stuff and adapt it to a meeting setting . 
E:  How do you mean  do you mean mechanical adaptation or  
C:  But it may be  it may be useful in  
A:  You know  
A:  No , software , to adapt the speech recognition . 
E:  OK . 
C:  Well , what I was thinking is it may be useful in 
C:  transcribing , if it 's far field stuff , right ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <breath> In doing , um , some of our first automatic 
C:  speech recognition models , it may be useful to have that kind of data because that 's very different than any kind of data that we have so far . 
E:  Great idea .  
A:  That 's true . 
E:  And  and their recording conditions are really clean . I mean , I 've  I 've heard  I 've listened to the data . It sounds  <breath> well but what I mean is that , um  <breath> 
A:  Well that 's not good , right ? 
C:  That 's  that 's not great . 
D:  Tr - 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  But far field means great distance ? I mean  
A:  Just these . 
D:  Not head mounted ? 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  And so that 's why they 're getting away with just two channels or something , or are they using multiple DATs ? 
E:  Um , oh , good question and I can't ans answer it . I don't know . 
A:  Well we can look into it . 
C:  No , and their web  their web page didn't answer it either . So I 'm , I uh , was thinking that we should contact them . <breath> So it 's  that 's sort of a beside - the - point point . But . 
E:  OK . 
A:  So we can get that just with , uh , media costs , is that right ? 
D:  Still a point . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Uh , in fact we get it for free cuz they 're distributing it through the LDC . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Great . 
E:  Yep . 
A:  So that would be  yeah , that would be something to look into . 
C:  So , I can  I can actually arrange for it to arrive in short order if we 're  
A:  So . 
E:  The other thing too is from  from a  
A:  Well , it 's silly to do unless we 're gonna have someone to work on it , so maybe we need to 
A:  think about it a little bit . 
E:  <breath> The other thing too is that their their jus their transcription format is really nice and simple in  in the discourse domain . 
C:  Huh . 
E:  <breath> But they also mentioned that they have it time aligned . I mean , I s I  I saw that write - up . 
C:  Yeah . <breath> Maybe we should  maybe we should get a copy of it just to see what they did so  so that we can  we can compare . 
B:  Yeah , absolutely . 
E:  It 's very nice . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Absolutely . 
A:  OK , why don't you go ahead and do that then Eric ? 
C:  Alright , I 'll do that . 
C:  <breath> 
C:  I can't remember the name of the corpus . It 's Corps - 
E:  CSAE . Corpus of Spoken American English . 
C:  S  Right , OK . 
E:  Yeah , sp I 've been  I was really pleased to see that . I knew that they  
E:  <breath> they had had some funding problems in completing it but , um , 
C:  Yeah . <breath> Well they 're  
B:  Uh - huh . 
E:  this is clever . 
C:  Apparently this was like phase one and the there 's still more that they 're gonna do apparently or something like that unless of course they have funding issues and then 
E:  Got it through the LDC . 
E:  Great . 
E:  Great . 
C:  then it ma they may not do phase two but 
C:  <breath> from all the web documentation it looked like , " oh , this is phase one " , whatever that means . 
E:  Super . 
E:  Super . Great . Yeah , that  I mean , they 're really well respected in the linguistics d side too and the discourse area , and  
C:  OK . 
E:  <breath> So this is a very good corpus . 
C:  <breath> But , it uh it would also maybe help be helpful for Liz , if she wanted to start working on some discourse issues , you know , looking at some of this data and then , you know  
A:  Right . 
C:  So when she gets here maybe that might be a good thing for her . 
topic_description:	UC Santa Barbara corpus - CSAE


A:  Actually , that 's another thing I was thinking about is that maybe Jane should talk to Liz , 
A:  to see if there are any transcription issues related to discourse that she needs to get marked . 
E:  OK . 
C:  <breath> Maybe we should have a big meeting meeting . 
A:  <breath> 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  Sure , of course . 
D:  That would be a meeting meeting meeting ? 
A:  A meeting meeting meeting .  
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Well this is the meeting about the meeting meeting meeting . So .  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Oh . 
C:  Right . 
A:  Um . 
C:  But maybe we should , uh find some day that Liz  uh , Liz and Andreas seem to be around more often . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  So maybe we should find a day when they 're gonna be here and  
C:  and Morgan 's gonna be here , and we can meet , at least this subgroup . I mean , not necessarily have the U - dub people down . 
A:  Well , I was even thinking that maybe we need to at least ping the U - dub  
C:  We need  we need to talk to them some more . 
A:  to see  
A:  you know , say " this is what we 're thinking about for our transcription " , if nothing else . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  So , well w shall we move on and talk a little bit about transcription then ? <breath> OK , so  <breath> since that 's what we 're talking about . 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  Let 's . 
A:  Um , any more on transcript we wanna talk about ? 
B:  What s so what are you  so you 've done some portion of the first meeting . And what 's your plan ? To carry on doing it ? 
E:  Yes . Mm - hmm . 
E:  <breath> What  Well , you know what I thought was right now we have p So I gave him the proposal for the transcription conventions . He made his , uh , suggestion of improvement . The  the  It 's a good suggestion . 
B:  OK . 
E:  <breath> So as far as I 'm concerned those transcription conventions are fixed right now . 
E:  <breath> And so my next plan would be  
B:  What  what do they  
B:  what do they cover ? 
E:  They 're very minimal . So , <breath> it would be good to  just to summarize that . <breath> So , um , <breath> one of them is the idea of how to indicate speaker change , 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  and this is a way which meshes well with  with , uh , making it 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  <breath> so that , uh , you know , on the  At the  Boy , it 's such a nice interface . When you  when you get the , um  you  you get the speech signal you also get <breath> down beneath it , 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath> an indication of , <breath> uh , if you have two speakers overlapping in a s in a single segment , you see them <breath> one  displayed one above each other . 
E:  And then at the same time <breath> the top s part of the screen is the actual verbatim thing . You can clip  click on individual utterances and it 'll take you immediately to that part of the speech signal , and play it for you . 
E:  <breath> And you can , eh you can work pretty well between those two  these two things . 
D:  Is there a limit to the number of speakers ? 
A:  Um , the user interface only allows two . 
B:  Hmm . 
A:  And so if  if you 're 
A:  using their interface to specify overlapping speakers you can only do two . But my script can handle any . And their save format can handle any . 
A:  And so , um , using this  the convention that Jane and I have discussed , you can have as many overlapping speakers as you want . 
E:  within , <breath> and  But so in terms of the con the conventions , then , <breath> uh , basically , <breath> uh , it 's strictly orthographic which means with some w 
B:  Mm - hmm . <breath> 
E:  provisions for , uh , 
E:  w uh , <breath> colloquial forms . So if a person said , " cuz " instead of " because " then I put a  <breath> an apostrophe at the beginning of the word and then in  in double ang angle brackets 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <mike noise> 
E:  what the full lexical item would be . And this could be <breath> something that was handled by a table or something but I think 
E:  <breath> to have a convention marking it as a non - standard 
E:  or wha I don't mean standard  but a  a  a non <breath> uh , ortho orthographic , uh , whatever .  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Non - canonical . 
E:  " Gonna " or " wanna " , <breath> you know , the same thing . And  and there would be limits to how much refinement you want in indicating something as non - standard pres pronunciation . 
A:  Well , so anyway , are we interested then in writing tools to try to generate any of this stuff automatically ? Is that something you want to do , Dan ? 
B:  No . But it 's something @ @ that I feel 
A:  No . 
B:  we definitely ought to do . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  I also wanted to ask you if you have a time estimate on the part that you transcribed . Do you have a sense of how long  
B:  Yeah , it took me half an hour to transcribe a minute , but I didn't have any  I didn't even have a  
E:  OK . 
B:  <breath> I was trying to get Transcriber to run but I couldn't . <breath> So I was doing it by typ typing into a text file and trying to fit  It was horrible . 
E:  OK .  
E:  OK .  
D:  So thirty to one 's what you got ? So that 's a new upper limit ? 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  Well , I mean , that 's  that 's because you didn't have the segmentation help and all the other  
B:  Is it  
A:  But I think for a first try that 's about right . 
C:  So  so if we hired a who if we hired a whole bunch of Dan 's   
D:  That 's right . <laugh> a 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . <laugh> 
B:  It was actually  it was quite  it was a t 
A:  If we  hire an infinite number of Dan 's   <laugh> 
E:  And there 's always a warm up thing of  
D:  It 'd b a a 
B:  it w 
A:  Are we gonna run out of disk space by the way ? 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  No . 
A:  OK , good . <laugh> 
E:  OK .  
D:  <laugh> d Doesn't it beep in the other room when you 're out of disk space ? <laugh> 
C:  So  
topic_description:	transcription


A:  What we 're using right now is a tool , um , from this French group , called " Transcriber " that seems to work very well . 
A:  Um , 
A:  so it has a , uh , nice useful Tcl - TK user interface <breath> and , uh , 
D:  Thi - this is the process of converting audio to text ? 
A:  Right . 
D:  And this requires humans just like the  
A:  Yes , yeah . 
D:  the STP stuff . 
A:  Right , right . So we 're  we 're at this point only looking for word level . So all  all  so what you have to do is just identify a segment of speech in time , 
A:  and then write down what was said within it , <breath> and identify the speaker . 
A:  <breath> And so the things we  that we know  that I know I want are <breath> the text , the start and end , and the speaker . 
A:  But other people are interested in for example stress marking . And so Jane is doing primary stress , 
A:  <breath> um , stress marks as well . <breath> Um , and then things like repairs , and false starts , and , 
A:  <breath> filled pauses , and all that other sort of stuff , <breath> we have to decide how much of that we wanna do . 
E:  I did include a glo  uh , a certain first pass . <breath> My  my view on it was when you have a repair <breath> then , uh  
E:  it seems  I mean , we saw , there was this presentation in the  one of the speech group meetings about how  <breath> and I think Liz has done some stuff too on that , that it , uh  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <breath> that you get it bracketed in terms of like  <breath> well , if it 's parenthetical , which I know that Liz has worked on , then <breath> uh  
E:  y y you 'll have different 
E:  prosodic aspects . <breath> And then also <breath> if it 's a r if it 's a repair where they 're  like what I just did , <laugh> then it 's nice to have sort of a sense of 
A:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  Hmm . 
D:  <mike noise> 
E:  the continuity of the utterance , the start to be to the finish . And , uh , it 's a little bit deceptive if you include the repai the pre - repair part  
E:  and sometimes or of it 's in the middle . Anyway , <breath> so what I was doing was bracketing them to indicate that they were repairs <breath> which isn't 
E:  uh , 
E:  very time - consuming . 
A:  Mm - hmm .  <breath> 
topic_description:	what to mark


D:  I is there already some sort of plan in place for how this gonna be staffed or done ? Or is it real  is that what we 're talking about here ? 
A:  Well , that 's part of the thing we 're talking about . So what we wanted to do was have Jane do basically one meeting 's worth , 
A:  you know , forty minutes to an hour , and  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  As a pilot study . Yeah , as a pilot study . 
D:  Yourself ? It  this is  this is like five times real time or ten times real time  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Ten times about , is  and so one of the things was to get an estimate of how long it would take , 
A:  <breath> and then also what tools we would use . And so the next decision which has to be made actually pretty soon is how are we gonna do it ? 
D:  And so you make Jane do the first one so then she can decide , oh , we don't need all this stuff , just the words are fine . <laugh> 
A:  So . 
E:  <laugh> That 's right , that 's right . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> That 's right . 
E:  <breath> I wanna hear about these  uh , we have a g you were s continuing with the transcription conventions for s 
A:  R right , so  so one  one option is to get 
A:  linguistics grad students and undergrads to do it . And apparently that 's happened in the past . <breath> And I think that 's probably the right way to do it . 
A:  Um , it will require a post pass , I mean people will have to look at it more than once to make sure that it 's been done correctly , 
A:  <breath> but I just can't imagine that we 're gonna get anything that much better from a commercial one . 
A:  <breath> And the commercial ones I 'm sure will be much more expensive . 
D:  Can't we get Joy to do it all ? <laugh> 
E:  No , <laugh> that 's  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah right .  
A:  <laugh> We will just get Joy and Jane to do everything . 
D:  <breath> Is tha wasn't that what she was doing before ? 
D:  Yeah , that 's right .  
A:  But , you know , that 's what we 're talking about is getting some slaves who  who need money and , uh , 
D:  Right . 
A:  <breath> duh , again o 
E:  I object to that characterization ! <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Oh , really . 
A:  I meant Joy . <breath> And so again , I have to say " are we recording " and then say , uh , Morgan has  has consistently 
E:  Oh , thank you . OK . <laugh> 
A:  resisted telling me how much money we have . 
D:  Right . Well , the answer is zero . There 's a reason why he 's resisted . But . <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  So . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Well , if it 's zero then we can't do any transcription . I mean , cuz we 're  we  
D:  Right . 
B:  I have such a hard name . <breath> 
A:  I mean , I  I can't imagine us doing it ourselves . 
D:  Well , we already  we already  <laugh> We already have a plan in place for the first meeting . Right ? That 's  <laugh> 
A:  Right ? 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  N right . 
E:  Well th there is als Yeah , really .   
E:  There is also the o other possibility which is if you can provide not money but instructional experience or some other perks , 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath> you can  you could get people to  
E:  to um , 
D:  <breath> Well , i b but seriously , I  I mean , Morgan 's obviously in a bind over this and thing to do is just the field of dreams theory , 
A:  Right . 
E:  to do it in exchange . 
D:  <breath> which is we we go ahead as though there will be money at the time that we need the money . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <breath> And that 's  that 's the best we can do . i b To not do anything until we get money is  is ridiculous . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
A:  Right .  
D:  We 're not gonna do any  get anything done if we do that . <breath> 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  So at any rate , Jane was looking into the possibility of getting students , at  is that right ? Talking to people about that ? 
E:  <breath> I 'm afraid I haven't made any progress in that front yet . I should 've sent email and I haven't yet . 
A:  OK .  
A:  Yeah , right . So , uh  
D:  I d do  So until you actually <breath> have a little experience with what this  this French thing does we don't even have  
E:  And I do have  
A:  She 's already done quite a bit . Yeah . 
E:  I have  
D:  Oh , we have . I 'm sorry . 
E:  a bunch of hours , yeah . 
D:  So that 's where you came up with the f the ten X number ? 
E:  <breath> Actually that 's the  the one people usually use , ten X . 
D:  Or is that really just a guess ? 
E:  And I haven't really calculated  How fast am I ? <laugh> I haven't done a s see , I 've been at the same time doing kind of a boot strapping in deciding on the transcription conventions that  that are  
C:  How fast are you ? 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah i 
B:  Mmm . 
E:  <breath> you know , and  and stuff like , you know , how much  
C:  Right . 
E:  <laugh> There 's some interesting human factors problems like , <breath> yeah , what span of  of time is it useful to segment the thing into in order to 
E:  uh , transcribe it the most quickly . Cuz then , you know , you get like  <breath> if you get a span of five words , that 's easy . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  <breath> But then you have to take the time to mark it . And then there 's the issue of <breath> it 's easier to  <breath> 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  hear it th right the first time if you 've marked it at a boundary instead of <breath> somewhere in the middle , cuz then the word 's bisected or whatever and  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <breath> And so I mean , I 've been sort of playing with , uh , different ways of mar cuz I 'm thinking , you know , I mean , if you could get optimal instructions you could cut back on the number of hours it would take . 
topic_description:	hiring a transcriber pool, timing issues


D:  D does uh  this tool you 're using is strictly  it doesn't do any speech recognition does it ? 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  No . 
E:  No , it doesn't but what a super tool . It 's a great environment . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  But  but is there anyway to  to wire a speech recognizer up to it and actually run it through  
E:  That 's an interesting idea . Hey ! 
A:  We 've  we 've thought about doing that but the recognition quality is gonna be horrendous . 
D:  Well , a couple things . First of all the time marking you 'd get  you could get 
B:  Wow . 
D:  by a tool . <breath> And so if the  if  if the issue really uh , I 'm think about the close caption that you see running by on  on live news casts . You know , yo 
B:  That 's true . 
E:  That 's interesting . 
A:  Most of those are done by a person . 
D:  I know  I know that . No , I understand . And  in a lot of them you see typos and things like that , but it  but it occurs to me that <breath> 
E:  Yeah , I 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  it may be a lot easier to correct things than it is to do things from scratch , no matter how wonderful the tool is . <breath> But if  if there was a way to merge the two  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , we  
C:  Well , I mean , but sometimes it 's easier to type out something instead of going through and figuring out which is the right  I mean , it depends on the error rate , right ? 
E:  That 'd be fun . 
A:  I mean , we 've talked about it but  
D:  Well s but  but again the timing is for fr should be for free . The timing should be  <breath> 
C:  But we don't care about the timing of the words . 
D:  Well I thought you just  that 's  said that was a critical issue . 
E:  No , uh the  the boundary  
A:  We don't care about the timing of the words , just of the utterances . 
C:  We cut it s s 
B:  We don't  we don't know , actually . We haven't decided which  which time we care about , and that 's kind of one of the things that you 're saying , is like  <breath> 
E:  boundary . 
B:  you have the option to put in more or less timing data  
B:  and , uh , be in the absence of more specific instructions , <breath> 
B:  we 're trying to figure out what the most convenient thing to do is . 
A:  Yeah , so  so what  what she 's done so far , is sort of  
A:  more or less breath g not breath groups ,  sort of phrases , 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  continuous phrases . 
A:  <breath> And so , um , that 's nice because you  you separate when you do an extract , you get a little silence on either end . So that seems to work really well . 
E:  That 's ideal . <breath> Although I was  I  you know , the alternative , which I was sort of experimenting with before I ran out of time , <laugh> recently was , <breath> um  
A:  Um . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  <breath> that , you know , ev if it were like an arbitrary segment of time  
E:  i t pre - marked cuz it does take time to put those markings in . 
E:  <breath> It 's really the i the interface is wonderful because , you know , the time it takes is you listen to it , <breath> and then you press the return key . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  <breath> But then , you know , it 's like , <breath> uh , you press the tab key to stop the flow 
E:  and  <breath> and , uh , the return key to p to put in a marking of the boundary . 
E:  <breath> But , you know , obviously there 's a lag between when you hear it and when you can press the return key so it 's slightly delayed , so then you  
B:  Yeah . 
E:  you listen to it a second time and move it over to here . <laugh> So that takes time . <breath> Now if it could all be pre - marked at some , <breath> l you know , good  
D:  <inbreath> a  
D:  i a  
D:  ar but  
D:  <breath> Are  are those d delays adjustable ? 
A:  Hmm .  
D:  Those delays adjustable ? <breath> See a lot of people who actually build stuff with human computer interfaces <breath> understand that delay , 
D:  and  and so when you  by the time you click it it 'll be right on because it 'll go back in time to put the  
B:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , uh , not in this case . It has other  
B:  It could do that couldn't it . 
A:  We could program that pretty easily , couldn't we Dan ? 
A:  Yeah , mis Mister TCL ? 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh , interesting point . Ah !  Interesting point .  OK , that would make a difference . 
B:  I would have thought so , yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
A:  But , um  
E:  I mean , it 's not bad but it does  take twice . 
A:  But , if we tried to do automatic speaker ID . 
A:  I mean , cuz primarily the markings are at speaker change . 
B:  Yeah , yeah , but  
B:  But we 've got  we 've got the most channel data . We 'd have to do it from your signal . 
A:  But that would be  
B:  Right .  
E:  Oh , good point ! Ah !  We 've got volume . 
B:  I mean , 
B:  we 've  we 've got  we 've got a lot of data . 
A:  Yeah , I guess the question is how much time will it really save us versus the time to write all the tools to do it . 
B:  Right . <breath> but the chances are if we if we 're talking about collecting <breath> ten or a hundred hours , which is going to take a hundred or a thousand hours to transcribe  
D:  If  
A:  But  
D:  if we can go from ten X to five X we 're doing a big  <laugh> 
A:  We 're gonna need  we 're gonna need ten to a hundred hours to train the tools , 
C:  Right . <breath> So maybe  
E:  Wow .   
A:  and validate the tools the do the d to  to do all this anyway . 
E:  <breath> But  but it op <mike noise> 
B:  If we 're just doing silence detection   <laugh> 
A:  I knew you were gonna do that . <laugh> Just saw it coming . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> I 'm sorry . I wish you had told me  wish you 'd told me . <laugh>  <mike noise>

C:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> OK , I 'm alright . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Um , i it seems like  
B:  Well , uh , I don't know . Yeah . I mean , it  it 's  it 's maybe like  <breath> 
B:  a week 's work to get to do something like this . So forty or fifty hours . 
topic_description:	pre-marking time boundaries


E:  <breath> Could you get it so that with  so it would  it would detect volume on a channel and insert a marker ? And the  the format 's really transparent . It 's just a matter of 
C:  Right . 
B:  Sure . 
C:  Yeah .  
E:  <breath> a very c clear  it 's XML , isn't it ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  It 's very  I mean , I looked at the  
E:  the file format and it 's just  it has a t a time  
E:  <breath> a time indication and then something or other , and then an end time or something or other . 
C:  So 
C:  maybe  maybe we could try the following experiment . <breath> Take the data that you 've already transcribed 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  and  
D:  Is this already in the past or already in the future ? 
C:  Already in the past . She  she 's done one  she 's one  
D:  You 've already  you 've already done some ? 
E:  Yes I have . 
A:  She 's  she 's done about half a meeting . 
D:  Oh - Oh , I see . OK , good . 
C:  Right . Right . <breath> I 'm go 
A:  Right ? About half ? 
E:  S I 'm not sure if it 's that 's much but anyway , enough to work with . 
C:  Right . <breath> Um , 
B:  Several minutes . 
C:  and  and throw out the words , but keep the time markings . 
C:  And then go through  I mean , and go through and  and try and re - transcribe it , 
E:  OK . 
E:  Good idea . 
C:  given that we had perfect boundary detection . <breath> And see if it  see if it  see if it feels easier to you . 
E:  OK . 
D:  And forgetting all the words because you 've been thr <laugh> 
E:  Yeah , that 's what I was thinking . I 'd  I 'd be cheating a little bit g with familiarity effect . 
C:  Yeah , I mean uh , that 's part of the problem is , is that what we really need is somebody else to come along . 
B:  Well , no , you should do it  you should do it  <breath> Do it again from scratch and then do it again at the boundaries . So you do the whole thing three times and then we get   
A:  <laugh> 
E:  No .  
D:  <laugh> And then  then w since we need some statistics do it three more . <laugh> 
C:  Yeah . <laugh> 
E:  Now , there 's a plan . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> OK . <laugh> Oh , yeah . I 'll do that tomorrow . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> And so you 'll get  you 'll get down to one point two X by the time you get done . <laugh> 
B:  <breath> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  I should have it finished by the end of the day . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <breath> No , but the thing is the fact that she 's  she 's did it before just might give a lower bound . That 's all . Uh , which is fine . It 's  
E:  Exactly . 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . <breath> 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  And if the lower bound is nine X then w it 's a waste of time . 
C:  Right . 
E:  Well , uh but there 's an extra problem which is that I didn't really keep accurate  
E:  uh , it wasn't a pure task the first time , so  
B:  Oh !  
E:  <breath> uh , it 's gonna be an upper bound in  in that case . <breath> And it 's not really strictly comparable . So I think though it 's a good proposal to be used on a new  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  a new batch of text that I haven't yet done yet in the same meeting . 
E:  Could use it on the next segment of the text . 
B:  The point we  where do we get the  the  the oracle boundaries from ? 
C:  Right . 
B:  Or the boundaries . 
E:  <breath> Well , but couldn't I do it for the next  
A:  Yeah , one person would have to assign the boundaries and the  and the other person would have to  <breath> I mean that 's easy enough . I could do that . 
B:  We  we  we could get fake  
E:  Oh , I see what you mean . 
E:  <breath> Well , but the oracle boundaries would come from volume on a partic specific channel wouldn't they ? 
B:  That would be the automatic boundaries . 
C:  No , no , no , no . You wanna know  given  Given a perfect human segmentation , I mean , you wanna know how well  I mean , the  the question is , is it worth giving you the segmentation ? 
A:  No , no . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh , I see what you mean . Yeah . 
A:  I mean , that  that 's easy enough . I could generate the segmentation and  and you could do the words , 
C:  Right . 
A:  and time yourself on it . So . 
D:  A little double - blind - ear kind of thing . <laugh> 
A:  Yep . 
E:  I see . 
E:  OK . 
A:  So it  that might be worth doing . 
E:  That 's good . I like that . 
E:  <inbreath> 
A:  That would at least tell us whether it 's worth spending a week or two trying to get a tool , that will compute the segmentations . 
D:  <breath> And the thing to keep in mind too about this tool , guys is that <breath> sure , you can do the computation for what we 're gonna do in the future but if  if 
C:  Right . 
D:  UW 's talking about doing two , or three , or five times as much stuff and they can use the same tool , then obviously there 's a real multiplier there . 
A:  Right .

E:  And the other thing too is with  with speaker identification , if  if that could handle speaker identification that 's a big 
B:  Well it w I think it 's pretty easy when we 've got separate channels .  
E:  deal . 
D:  <laugh> Well , use it . Yeah , that 's why we s bought the expensive microphones . <laugh> 
E:  <breath> OK . Yeah , I mean , that 's a nice feature . 
C:  Right . 
A:  Yep . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
E:  That 's a major  that 's like , one of the two things that  
C:  I mean , there 's gonna  there 's gonna be  in the meeting , like the reading group meeting that we had the other day , that 's  it 's gonna be a bit of a problem because , 
B:  OK . 
C:  like , I wasn't wearing a microphone f and there were other people that weren't wearing microphones . 
B:  Yes . 
D:  But you didn't say anything worth while anyway , right ? 
A:  That  
B:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . <laugh> 
A:  That 'll s 
C:  That 's pretty much true but  
A:  it might save ninety percent of the work though . 
C:  but , yes . 
A:  So . 
B:  <breath> So I  I need to  we need to look at what  what the final output is but it seems like <breath> 
B:  we  it doesn't  it seems like it 's not really not that hard to have an automatic tool to generate <breath> 
B:  the 
B:  phrase marks , and the speaker , and speaker identity without putting in the words . 
A:  Yeah . I 've already become pretty familiar with the format , so it would be easy . 
E:  That 'd be so great . 
E:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <breath> We didn't finish the  
A:  If you 'd tell me where it is , huh ? 
E:  the part of work already completed on this , 
E:  did we ? I mean , you  <breath> you talked a little bit about the transcription conventions , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <breath> and , I guess you 've mentioned in your progress report , or status report , that you had written a script to convert it into  
E:  So , <breath> I  when I  i the  it 's quickest for me in terms of 
E:  <breath> the transcription part <breath> to say <breath> something like , you know , if  <breath> if Adam spoke to , um  
E:  to just say , " A colon " , 
E:  Like who could be , you know , I mean at the beginning of the line . <breath> 
B:  Mmm .  
E:  and E colon <breath> instead of entering the interface for speaker identification and clicking on the thing , uh , indicating the speaker ID . 
E:  <breath> So , and then he has a script that will convert it into the  the thing that , uh , would indicate speaker ID . 
E:  If that 's clear .

A:  It 's pretty cute . <laugh> But at any rate . So , um , 
C:  OK . 
E:  It 's Perl script . 
A:  Right . So  so I think the guess at ten X seems to be pretty standard . 
A:  Everyone  more or less everyone you talk to says about ten times for hard technical transcription . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  Using wh using stone age 
D:  using stone age tools . <laugh> 
E:  That 's right . 
A:  Using  using stone age tools . 
E:  Yeah , well that 's true , but  
A:  <breath> I mean , I looked at Cyber Transcriber which is a service that you send an audio file , they do a first - pass speech recognition . 
A:  And then they  they do a clean up .  
A:  But it 's gonna be horrible . They 're never gonna be able to do a meeting like this . 
E:  What  i just approximately , what did you find out in terms of price or  or whatever ? 
D:  Right . 
B:  No . 
A:  Well , for Cyber Transcriber they don't quote a price . They want you to call and  and talk . So for other services , 
A:  um , they were about thirty dollars an hour . 
E:  Of  of tape ? 
E:  Or of action ? OK . 
A:  Thirty  So , yeah . For thirty dollars an hour for  of their work . 
E:  OK . Oh , of their  Oh ! 
A:  So  so if it 's ten times it 's three hundred dollars an hour . 
C:  So that 's three  that 's three hours . 
D:  <breath> D did you talk to anybody that does closed captioning for  for uh , TV ? 
E:  OK . 
C:  Right .  
A:  No . 
D:  Cuz they a usually at the end of the show they 'll tell what the name of the company is , the captioning company that 's doing it . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Interesting . 
A:  Yeah , so  so my  my search was pretty cursory . It was just a net search . 
A:  And , uh , so it was only people who have web pages and are doing stuff 
D:  <breath> Well , you know , the  the thing  the thing about this is thinking 
A:  through that . 
D:  kind of , maybe a little more globally than I should here but  <breath> 
D:  that really this could be a big contribution we could make . 
D:  <breath> Uh , I mean , we 've been through the STP thing , we know what it  what it 's like to  to manage the  manage the process , and admittedly they might have been looking for more detail than what we 're looking for here but <breath> 
D:  it was a  it was a big hassle , right ? I mean , uh , you know , they  they constantly could 've reminding people and going over it . <breath> 
E:  <mike noise> 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  And clearly some new stuff needs to be done here . <laugh> And it 's  it 's only <breath> 
D:  our time , where " our " of course includes Dan , <laugh> Dan and you guys . It doesn't include me at all .  Uh . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  j Just seems like  
B:  <breath> Yeah , I mean I don't know if we 'd be able to do any thing f to help STP type 
B:  problems . But certainly for this problem we can do a lot better than  
D:  Bec - 
D:  Why ? Because they wanted a lot more detail ? 
B:  No . Because they had  because they only had two speakers , right ? I mean , the  the segmentation problem is  
A:  Right . 
D:  Only had two . 
A:  Trivial .  
A:  They had two speakers over the telephone . 
D:  Oh , I see . So what took them so long ? 
A:  Um , mostly because they were doing much lower level time . So they were doing phone and syllable 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  transcription , as well as , uh , word transcription . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  And so we 're  w we decided early on that we were not gonna do that . 
D:  I see . 
E:  <breath> 
D:  But there 's still the same issue of managing the process , of  <breath> of reviewing and keeping the files straight , and all this stuff , that  which is clearly a hassle . 
A:  Yep . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . And so  so what I 'm saying is that if we hire an external service I think we can expect three hundred dollars an hour . 
B:  Yeah .  
A:  I think that 's the ball park . There were several different companies that  <breath> and the  the range was very tight for technical documents . Twenty - eight to thirty - two dollars an hour . 
D:  <breath> 
C:  And who 
C:  who knows if they 're gonna be able to m manage multal multiple channel data ? 
B:  Yeah , they won't . They w they 'll refuse to do it . Yeah . 
A:  They won't . We 'll have to mix them . 
E:  Mm - hmm . <breath> And then there 's the problem also that  
C:  Right . 
B:  No , but I mean , they  they  they won't  they won't  they will refuse to transcribe this kind of material . 
B:  That 's not what they 're d quoting for , right ? 
D:  Well , they might  <breath> they might quote it  
A:  Yes , it is . 
B:  For quoting meetings ? 
A:  Sev - several of them say that they 'll do meetings , and conferences , and s and so on . None of them specifically said that they would do speaker ID , 
B:  Wow . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  or speaker change mark . They all just said transcription . 
D:  Th - th the th there may be just multiplier for five people costs twice as much and for ten people co  Something like that . <breath> 
B:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A:  Well , the  the way it worked is it  it was scaled . So what they had is , 
A:  <breath> if it 's an easy task it costs twenty - four dollars an hour and it will take maybe five or six times real time . 
A:  <breath> And what they said is for the hardest tasks , bad acoustics , meeting settings , it 's thirty - two dollars an hour and it takes about ten times real time . 
A:  <breath> So I think that we can count on that being 
B:  I see . 
A:  about what they would do . It would probably be a little more because we 're gonna want them to do speaker marking . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  Right .

D:  <breath> A lot of companies I 've worked for y the , uh  
A:  So . 
D:  the person leading the meeting , the executive or whatever , would sort of go around the room and  
D:  and mentally calculate h how many dollars per hour this meeting was costing , right ?  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  In university <laugh> atmosphere you get a little different thing . But <breath> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  you know , it 's a lot like , " he 's worth fifty an hour , he 's worth  "  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <breath> And so he 
D:  so here we 're thinking , " well let 's see , if the meeting goes another hour it 's going to be another thousand dollars . " You know ? It 's   <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> So ch <breath> So every everybody ta Talk really fast . <breath> Let 's get it over with .  <breath> 
A:  Yep , we have to have a short meeting . Stop talking !  <laugh> 
E:  That 's very interesting . 
B:  Yeah .  
E:  <laugh> Talk <breath> slowly but with few words . <laugh> 
A:  And clearly . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> That 's right . 
D:  And 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  only talk when you 're pointed to . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  There you go . 
A:  Content words only . <laugh> 
E:  We could have some telegraphic meetings . That might be interesting . 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah , it 'd be cheap . Cheap to transcribe . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> @ @ 
topic_description:	chitchat


A:  So . But at any rate , so we  we have a ballpark on how much it would cost if we send it out . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  And we 're talking about do doing how many hours worth of meetings ? 
A:  Thirty or forty . 
D:  So thirty or forty thousand dollars . 
E:  Yeah .  
B:  Well , for ten thousand dollars . 
C:  So , meanwhile  
D:  Oh . What  Well , it was thirty times  
B:  Three hundred . <breath> 
A:  Three hundred dollars an hour . Right .  
D:  Oh , I 'm sorry , three hundred . Right , I w got an extra factor of three there . Yeah . 
C:  So it 's thirty dollars an hour , essentially , right ? But we can pay a graduate student 
C:  seven dollars an hour . And the question is what 's the difference  or ei eight dollars . What  do you know what the going rate is ? It 's  it 's <breath> on the order of eight to ten . 
B:  How  how much lower are they ? 
E:  I think uh that would give us a  a good  good estimate . 
C:  I think . 
C:  But I 'm not sure . 
E:  I 'd  I 'd say  yeah , I was gonna say eight  you 'd say ten ? 
B:  Ten . 
C:  Let 's say ten . 
D:  The - these are not for engineering graduate students , right ? <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , give them a break . 
C:  Cuz it 's easier . 
A:  Right , these are linguistics grad students . 
D:  <laugh> That 's right .  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , I  I  I don't  I don't know what the  I don't know what the standard  but there is a standard pay scale I just don't know what it is . 
A:  Six . <laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm .  
E:  Yeah , that 's right . That 's right . 
C:  Um , 
C:  so that means that even if it takes them thirty times real time it 's cheaper to  
C:  to do graduate students . 
E:  <breath> And there 's another aspect too . 
A:  I mean , that 's why I said originally , that I couldn't imagine sending it out 's gonna be cheaper . 
B:  No , it isn't . So . 
E:  <breath> The other thing too is that , uh , if they were linguistics they 'd be  
E:  you know , in terms of like the post editing , i uh  tu uh content wise they might be easier to handle cuz they might get it more right the first time . 
A:  And also we would have control 
A:  of  I mean , we could give them feedback . Whereas if we do a service it 's gonna be limited amount . 
E:  Mmm . Good point . 
B:  Yep , yep . 
A:  I mean , we can't tell them , you know , " for this meeting we really wanna mark stress and for this meeting we want  "  
B:  Yep . 
B:  No . 
E:  Good point . 
A:  And  and they 're not gonna provide  they 're not gonna provide stress , they 're not gonna re provide repairs , they 're not gonna 
A:  <breath> provide  they  they may or may not provide speaker ID . 
A:  So that we would have to do our own tools to do that . So  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Just hypoth hypothetically assuming that  that we go ahead and ended up using graduate students . I who  who 's the person in charge ? Who 's gonna be the Steve here ? You ? 
A:  I just  
A:  I hope it 's Jane . Is that alright ? 
E:  Oh , interesting . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Um , now would this involve some manner of 
E:  uh , monetary compensation or would I be the voluntary , uh , coordinator of multiple transcribers for checking ? 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Um , I would imagine there would be some monetary involved but we 'd have to talk to Morgan about it . 
B:  Yeah , out of  out of Adam 's pocket . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
D:  You know , it just means you have to stop working for Dave . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Oh , I don't wanna stop working for Dave .  
D:  See ? That 's why Dave should have been here .  To pr protect his people .  
E:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath> Oh , cool . Yeah . 
A:  Well , I would like you to do it because you have a lot more experience than I do , but if  if that 's not feasible , I will do it with you as an advisor . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  W we 'd like you to do it and we 'd like to pay you . Not being Morgan though , it 's  <laugh> 
E:  We 'll see . 
E:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Oh , I see . <laugh> Well  
C:  Right . 
B:  We 'd like to . Unfortunately   <laugh> 
D:  Yeah .  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah , six dollars an hour . <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> And  and then  
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah , I see . OK .  <breath> Boy , if I wanted to increase my income I could start doing the transcribing again . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> That 's a  
B:  Yeah , that 's right . Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  an an an and be and be sure and say , would you like fries with that when you 're thinking about your pay scale .  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> I see . Good . <laugh> 
E:  Yeah , no , that  I  I would be interested in that  in becoming involved in the project in some aspect like that  more . Yeah . Uh - huh . 
A:  OK .  
A:  More . <breath> 
E:  Yeah .

E:  within , <breath> and  But so in terms of the con the conventions , then , <breath> uh , basically , <breath> uh , it 's strictly orthographic which means with some w 
B:  Mm - hmm . <breath> 
E:  provisions for , uh , 
E:  w uh , <breath> colloquial forms . So if a person said , " cuz " instead of " because " then I put a  <breath> an apostrophe at the beginning of the word and then in  in double ang angle brackets 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <mike noise> 
E:  what the full lexical item would be . And this could be <breath> something that was handled by a table or something but I think 
E:  <breath> to have a convention marking it as a non - standard

D:  Do y is this a , uh , university project ? 
D:  Th - this is the French software , right ? 
B:  Yeah . Yeah , yeah , their academic . 
A:  Yeah , French . Yeah . And they 're  they 've been quite responsive . I 've been exchanging emails on various issues . 
D:  eh 
B:  Oh , really ? 
E:  Oh . 
D:  Uh , did you ask them to change the interface for more speakers ? 
A:  Yes , and they said that 's on  in  in the works for the next version . 
D:  Good . 
D:  Good . 
C:  Oh , so multi multichannels . 
A:  Multichannels was also  <breath> Well , they said they wanted to do it but 
A:  that the code is really very 
A:  organized around single channels . So I think that 's n unlikely to ha happen . 
D:  <mike noise> 
C:  I see . 
C:  OK . 
D:  Do - do you know what they 're using it for ? Why 'd they develop it ? Are they linguists ? 
A:  For this exact task ? 
C:  For transcription . It 's   
D:  But I mean , are they  are they linguists or are they speech recognition people ? 
E:  <breath> Ho - 
A:  I think they 're linguists . 
E:  Hmm . 
B:  Linguists .  
C:  They 're  they have some connection to the LDC cuz the LDC has been advising them on this process , the Linguistic Data Consortium . 
B:  Yeah .  
D:  Mm - hmm . <breath> 
C:  Um , so  
C:  but a apart from that . Yeah . 
A:  It 's also  All the source is available . So . 
C:  Right .  
D:  Great . 
A:  If you  if you speak TCLTK . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  And they have  they 've actually asked if we are willing to do any development and I said , well , maybe . <laugh> 
D:  Good . 
C:  Right .  
E:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  So if we want  if we did  if we did something like programmed in a delay , which actually I think is a great idea , um , I 'm sure they would want that incorporated back in . 
E:  Yeah , I do too . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Their pre pre - lay .  
B:  Pre - lay . 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Pre - lay . <laugh> <breath> Well , and they 've thought about things . You know , I mean , they  they do have  
A:  Way . <laugh> 
E:  <breath> So you have  when you  when you play it back , 
E:  um , it 's  it is useful to have , uh , a  a break mark to  se segment it . 
E:  But it wouldn't be strictly necessary cuz you can use the  uh , the tabbed key to toggle 
E:  <breath> the sound on and off . I mean , it 'll stop the s speech you know if you if you press a tab . <breath> And , um . <breath> 
E:  And so , <breath> 
E:  uh , that 's a nice feature . <breath> And then also once you 've put a break in then you have the option of <breath> cycling through the unit . 
E:  You could do it like multiply  until you get  crazy and decide to stop cycling through that unit . <laugh> Or  or  <laugh> or   
D:  Loop it ? 
D:  <breath> Yo - you n you know , there 's al also the  the user interface that 's missing . It 's missing from all of our offices , and that is some sort of analog input for something like this . <breath> It 's what 
D:  audio people actually use of course . It 's something that wh 
D:  <breath> when you move your hand further , the sound goes faster past it , like fast forward . 
D:  <breath> You know , like a joy stick or a  uh , you could wire a mouse or trackball to do something like that . 
E:  Why , that 's   
E:  That 's not something I wanted to have happen . <laugh> 
D:  <breath> No , but I 'm saying if this is what professionals who actually do this kind of thing for  for  for  m for video or for audio  
E:  I see . 
D:  <breath> where you  you need to do this , and so you get very good at sort of jostling back and forth , rather than hitting tab , and backspace , and carriage return , and enter , and things like that . 
E:  Uh - huh .  
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , we talked about things like foot pedals and other analog   So <breath> I mean , tho those are things we could do but <breath> 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  I  I just don't know how much it 's worth doing . I mean we 're just gonna have  
D:  Ye - Yeah . Right . 
E:  Yeah , I  I agree . They  they have several options . So , uh , you know , I mentioned the looping option . Another option is it 'll pause when it reaches the end of the boundary . 
C:  Yeah . 
E:  <breath> And then to get to the next boundary you just press tab and it goes on to the next unit . I mean , it 's very nicely thought out . They thought about  and also it 'll <breath> go around the c the , uh , 
A:  Hmm . 
D:  Cool . 
C:  Hmm . 
E:  I wanna say cursor but I 'm not sure if that 's the right thing .  
A:  Point , whatever . 
E:  <breath> Anyway , you can  so they thought about different ways of having windows that you c uh work

E:  <breath> Backchannels ? Um , 
A:  Comments . 
E:  you know  oh , yes , there was some  <breath> in my view , 
E:  when i when you 've got it densely overlapping ,

C:  What do you mean by du 
E:  I didn't worry about s specific start times . I sort of thought that

E:  uh , i " immediate " . <laugh> And instead just sort of rendered " within this time slot ,

E:  you know , then I wou I would indicate <breath> that it happened within the same tem time frame but wouldn't say exactly when it happened . 
D:  <mike noise> 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  I 'll be right back . <breath> 
B:  I transcribed a minute of this stuff and there was a lot of overlapping . It was  
C:  I see . 
D:  <clears throat> 
E:  A lot of overlapping , yeah . 
A:  Well there there 's a lot of overlapping at the beginning and end . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Huge amounts . Um , when  when no one i when we 're not actually in the meeting , <breath> and we 're all sort of separated , and  and doing things . 
B:  It was at the beginning . 
D:  <water filling cup> <water cooler sound>  
A:  <breath> But even during the meeting there 's a lot of overlap but it  it 's marked pretty clearly . 
A:  <breath> Um , some of the backchannel stuff Jane had some comments  
A:  and  but I think a lot of them were because you were at the meeting . 
A:  And so I think that  that often  
E:  Yeah , well that 's true . That 's another issue . 
A:  <breath> often you can't tell . I mean , Jane had  had comments like 
D:  <sniff> <clears throat> 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  uh , 
A:  to  who  who the person was speaking to . 
E:  Yeah . <breath> Only when it was otherwise gonna be puzzling because he was in the other room talking . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah .  
A:  Yeah , but someone who , uh , <breath> was just the transcriber wouldn't have known that . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
E:  That 's true . 
topic_description:	backchannels, overlapping speech


A:  Or when Dan said , " I wa I wasn't talking to you " . <laugh> 
C:  Right . 
E:  I know . 
D:  <breath> So you take a bathroom break in the middle and  and keep your head mount Oh , you do ? <laugh> 
A:  You have to turn off your mike . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
E:  <breath> Well he was so  so he was checking the meter levels and  and we were handling things while he was labeling the  the whatever it was , the PDA ?  
B:  You don't have to . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  @ @ 
B:  Uh - huh . 
E:  <breath> And  and so he was  in  sort of  you were sort of talking  
E:  you know , so I was saying , like  <breath> " and I could label this one left . Right ? " And he  and he said , " I don't see anything " . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
E:  And he said  <breath> he said , <breath> " I wasn't talking to you " . <laugh> Or  it wasn't  it didn't sound quite that rude . But really , no , uh  w you know in the context if you know he can't hear what he 's saying  
A:  But  
A:  but when you w when you listen to it  
D:  he he 
D:  It was a lot funnier if you were there though . <laugh> 
E:  Uh , yeah , I know . Well , you 'll see . You can listen to it . 
A:  Well what  what it  what happens is if you 're a transcriber listening to it it sounds like Dan is just being a total  
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> Oh , I thought it was you who was . 
A:  <laugh> totally impolite . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  No , well , but you were  you were asking off the wall questions . 
A:  Um  
A:  But  but if you knew that  that I wasn't actually in the room , and that Dan wasn't talking to me , 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  it  it became OK . So . 
B:  I see . 
D:  So th 
E:  And that 's w that 's where I added comments . The rest of the time I didn't bother with who was talking to who but  but this was unusual circum circumstance . 
C:  Hmm . 
D:  So this is  this is gonna go on the meeting meeting transcriber bloopers tape , right ? <laugh> 
A:  Yes . Right .  
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> Well and part of it was funny , uh  reason was because it was a mixed signal so you couldn't get any clues from 
A:  Stereo . Yeah .  
E:  volume <breath> that , you know , he was really far away from this conversation . You couldn't do that symmetrically in any case . 
D:  <clears throat twice> 
B:  No . 
topic_description:	chitchat


A:  Oh . I should rewrite the mix tool to put half the people in one channel and half in the other . <breath> 
E:  <laugh> That 's a good idea . 
A:  I have a  auto - gain - mixer tool that mixes all the head mounted microphones into one signal and that seems to work really well for the uh  transcribers .  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Great . 
E:  <breath> But I thought it would be  you know , I  I didn't wanna add more contextual comments than were needed but that , it seemed to me , clarified that the 
E:  con what was going on . 
E:  <breath> And , uh  <breath> OK , so normalization  
C:  So , s 
C:  I was just gonna ask , uh , so I just wanted to c sort of finish off the question I had about backchannels , 
E:  Yeah . OK . Yeah . 
C:  if that 's OK , <breath> which  which was , so say somebody 's talking for a while and somebody goes " mm - hmm " in the middle of it , and  and  and what not , 
B:  Mmm . 
C:  does the 
C:  conversation 
C:  come out from the  or the person who 's speaking for the long time as one segment and then there 's this little tiny segment <breath> 
C:  of this other speaker or does it  does the fact that there 's a backchannel split 
C:  the  
E:  <breath> 
C:  the  the  it in two . 
E:  OK , my  my focus was to try and maintain conten con content continuity 
E:  and , uh , to keep it within what he was saying . Like <breath> I wouldn't say breath groups but prosodic or intonational groups as much as possible . So 
E:  <breath> if someone said " mm - hmm " in the middle of a  of someone 's , <breath> uh , 
E:  uh , intonational contour , <breath> I  I indicated it as , 
C:  OK . 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  like what you just did .  <laugh> 
E:  then I indicated it as a segment which contained 
E:  <breath> @ @  this utterance plus an overlap . 
C:  OK . 
B:  But that 's  but there 's only one  there 's only one time boundary for both speakers , right ? 
E:  Yeah , that 's right . <breath> And you know , it could be made more precise than that but I just thought  
C:  I see , I see , OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  Right .  
D:  I think whenever we use these speech words we should always <breath> do the thing like you 're talking about , accent , <laugh> @ @ <laugh> @ @ . 
C:  <breath> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> Oh , I see what you mean . <breath> 
E:  And then  " hesitation " .  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath> 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  <breath> OK , and so then , uh , in terms of like words like " uh " and " um " I just wrote them because I figured there 's a limited number , and I keep them to a  uh , limited set because it didn't matter if it was " mmm " or " um " ,  
D:  <clears throat> 
E:  <breath> you know , versus " um " . <breath> So I just always wrote it as U M . 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  And " uh - huh " , 
B:  OK . 
E:  you know , " UHUH . " I mean , like a s set of like five . But in any case  <breath> I didn't mark those . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  No . " Uh - huh " is " U H H U H . " " Uh - uh "  is " UHUH . "  
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  <breath> I 'd be happy with that . That 'd be fine . <laugh> It 'd be good to have that in the  in the conventions , what 's to be used . 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  Huh - uh .    
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
topic_description:	segmenting backchannels


A:  I  I did notice that there were some segments that had pauses on the beginning and end . We should probably mark 
D:  <clears throat> 
A:  areas that have no speakers as no speaker . 
E:  Yeah , that 's a fine idea . 
A:  Then , so question mark colon is fine for that . 
E:  That 's a fine idea . 
E:  Yeah , OK . Yeah . 
D:  Well , what 's that mean ? You mean re 
A:  Just say silence . No one 's talking . 
D:  ye s Oh . Silence all around . Yep . 
A:  Yep . 
E:  So I had  
B:  We have to mark those ? Don't they  d can't we just leave them unmarked ? 
E:  I d 
E:  Well , you see , that 's possible too . 
A:  Well , I wanna leave the marked  I don't want them to be part of another utterance . 
B:  OK . 
A:  So you just  you need to have the boundary at the start and the end . 
B:  Sure . 
E:  Mm - hmm . <breath> Now that 's refinement that , uh , maybe it could be handled by 
E:  part of the  part of the script or something more  
B:  Uh , yeah , it seems like  
B:  it seems like the , uh , tran the transcription problem would be very different if we had these 
B:  <breath> automatic speaker detection turn placing things . 
B:  <breath> Because suddenly  
B:  I mean , I don't know , actually it sounds like there might be a problem <breath> putting it into the software if the software only handles two parallel channels . 
B:  <breath> But assuming we can get around that somehow . 
E:  Mm - hmm .  Well you were saying , I think it can read  
A:  It can read and write as many as you want , it 's just that it 
E:  Uh - huh .  
B:  But what if you wanna edit it ? 
B:  Right ? I mean , the point is we 're gonna generate <breath> this transcript with five  five tracks in it , 
B:  but with no words . <breath> Someone 's gonna have to go in and type in the words . <breath> Um , and if there are five  five people speaking at once , 
A:  Right , i it 's  
A:  I didn't explain it well . If we use the  the little  
A:  the conventions that Jane has established , I have a script that will convert from that convention to their saved convention . 
B:  Oh , yeah . <breath> 
B:  Yes . 
E:  Which allows five . 
A:  Right .  
E:  And it can be m edited after the fact , can't it also ? <breath> But their  but their format , if you wanted to in indicate the speakers right there instead of doing it through this indirect route , 
A:  Yes . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  <breath> then i they  a c window comes up and it only allows you to enter two speakers . 
B:  Right . 
D:  <breath> But you 're saying that by the time you call it back in to  from their saved format it opens up a window with window with five speakers ? 
E:  So . But . 
A:  Right . 
D:  <breath> Oh ! <laugh> That is sort of  f 
D:  They didn't quite go the whole  
A:  It 's just user interface . So i it 's  
D:  Yeah , they didn't go the whole route , did they ? They just  
A:  the  the  the whole saved form the saved format and the internal format , all that stuff , handles multiple speakers . 
D:  <clears throat> <breath> 
A:  <breath> It 's just there 's no user interface for specifying 
D:  Right . 
A:  multiple  any more than two . 
E:  And that  
D:  So your  your script solves  Doesn't it solve all our problems , cuz we 're always gonna wanna go through this 
A:  Yep . 
A:  Yep . 
D:  preprocessing  uh , assuming it works . 
A:  Yep . 
E:  And that works nicely cuz this so quick to enter . So I wouldn't wanna do it through the interface anyway adding which  worry who the speaker was . 
A:  Yep . 
D:  I see . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Good . 
topic_description:	data pre-processing, speech/non-speech segmentation


E:  And then , uh , let 's see what else . 
E:  <breath> Oh , yes , I  I wanted to have  
E:  So sometimes a pers I  uh in terms of like the continuity of thought 
C:  <breath> 
E:  <breath> for transcriptions , it 's  i it isn't just words coming out , it 's like there 's some 
C:  <mike noise> 
E:  purpose for an utterance . And <breath> sometimes someone will <breath> do a backchannel in the middle of it <breath> but you wanna show that it 's continued 
E:  at a later point . So I have  I have a convention of putting like a dash <breath> arrow 
E:  just to indicate that this person 's utterance continues . And then when it 
E:  uh , catches 
E:  back up again then there 's an arrow dash , and then you have the opposite direction 
E:  <breath> to indicate continuation of ones own utterance versus , <breath> um , sometimes <breath> we had the situation which is  
E:  you know , which you  which you get in conversations ,  of someone continuing someone else 's utterance , 
B:  Mmm .  
E:  and in that case I did a tilde arrow versus a arrow tilde , 
E:  <breath> to indicate that it was continuation but it wasn't  Oh , I guess I did 
E:  <breath> equal arrow for the  for the own  for yourself things cuz it 's  the speakers the same . <breath> And then tilde arrow if it was a different  
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm .  
E:  if a different speaker , uh , 
A:  Oh .  
E:  con continuation . But just , you know , the arrows showing continuation of a thought . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  And then you could track whether it was the same speaker or not by knowing  you know , at the end of this unit you 'd know what happened later . 
E:  And that was like this person continued and you 'd be able to <breath> look for the continuation . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <breath> But the only time 
A:  So - 
B:  that becomes ambiguous is if you have two speakers . 
B:  Like , if you  <breath> If you only have one person , if you only have one thought that 's continuing across a particular time boundary , you just need 
D:  <scratch noise> <clears throat> 
B:  <breath> one arrow at each end , and if it 's picked up by a different speaker , it 's picked up by a different speaker . 
B:  <breath> The time it becomes ambiguous if you have 
B:  more than one speaker and that  and they sort of 
B:  swap . I guess if you have more than one thread going , then you  
B:  <breath> then you need to know whether they were swapped or not . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  How often does that happen do you think ? 
B:  Hopefully not very much . 
E:  Yeah , I didn't use it very often . 
A:  Especially for meetings . 
D:  It l ou 
A:  I mean , if i if you were just recording someone 's day , it would be impossible . You know , if you were trying to do a remembrance agent . 
A:  <breath> But I think for meetings it 's probably alright . 
C:  Hmm .  
A:  But , a lot of these issues , I think that for  
A:  uh , from my point of view , where I just wanna do speech recognition and information retrieval , it doesn't really matter . But other people have other interests . So . 
B:  Sure . 
B:  I know . 
B:  <breath> But it  it does feel  it does feel like it 's really in there . I  you know I did this  I did this transcription and I marked that , I marked it with ellipsis <breath> 
B:  because it seemed like there was a difference . It 's something you wanted to indicate that it  that I  this was the end of the phrase , this was the end of 
B:  <breath> that particular transcript , but it was continued later . 
A:  Right .  
B:  And I picked up with an ellipsis . 
E:  Excellent . Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  I didn't have the equal , not equal thing . 
E:  Well that 's  you know , I mean  I  that 's why I didn't  I didn't do it n <breath> I mean , that 's why I thought about it , and  and re - ev and it didn't do  I didn't do it in ten times the  <laugh> the time . 
B:  <breath> 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
E:  Yeah .

C:  Is there  Maybe we should s consider also , um , starting to build up a web site around 
C:  No . Alright , see here 's  here 's  here 's my thought behind it which is that , 
E:  <laugh> 
E:  Alright . 
C:  uh , the  the stuff that you 've been describing ,

C:  I I 'd like to be able to  to pore through , you know , the  the types of tr conventions that you 've come up with and stuff like that . So I would like to see that kind of stuff on the web . 
B:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
E:  OK , now , w the alternative to a web site would be to put it in Doctor speech . 
B:  Yes . 
E:  Cuz  cuz what I have is a soft link to my transcription <breath> 
B:  Yes . 
C:  Either 's fine . 
E:  that I have on my account but it doesn't matter . 
B:  We c 
A:  We can do it all . 
B:  we can do it all !  <breath> 
E:  OK . 
B:  We can write  
E:  Web site 's nice . 
B:  Oh .  
B:  Yeah . 
E:  Then you have to t 
E:  you have to do an HT access . 
D:  Web site 's what ? 
B:  We could actually  maybe we could use the TCL plug - in . 
B:  Oh , man .  
E:  Ooo !  He 's committed himself to something . <laugh> 
C:  Ow . See he said the word TCL and  and that 's  
E:  <laugh> 
D:  But he does such a good job of it . He should be allowed to  to , you know , 
E:  I know , I know .  
D:  w do it . 
B:  I know , but that  but , I  Right . But I should be allowed to but  
D:  <laugh> <breath> If you just did a crappy job , <laugh> no nobody would want you to do it . 
B:  I sh I shouldn't be allowed to by m by my own  
B:  <breath> by my  according to my own priorities . 
B:  Alright . Let 's look at it anyway . So definitely we should  we should have some kind of access to 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  And we have  we have quite a disparate number of 
B:  the data . 
A:  web and other sorts of documents on this project sort of spread around . I have several and Dan has a few , and  
B:  Yes . 
E:  Ah !  
C:  Right , so we can add in links and stuff like that to other things . <breath> The  
E:  Nice .  
A:  Yep . 
B:  Well , yeah . Well so then th 
A:  Try  try to s consolidate . I mean , who wants to do that though ? <breath> No one wants to do that . So .  
B:  the other side is , yeah . 
C:  Uh , right . 
E:  Yeah .  
C:  <sigh> 
B:  Right , that 's the problem . 
D:  Why ? What  what 's  what 's the issue ? 
C:  Well , we could put  we could put sort of a disorganized sort of group gestalt  
B:  No one owns the project . 
D:  No one what ? 
B:  No one owns the project . 
A:  Yeah , I own the project but I don't wanna do it . <breath> 
B:  No one wants to own the project . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Right . 
D:  W well  Do  But  
A:  It 's mine ! All mine !   <laugh> 
B:  Well then you have to do the web site . You know , it 's like , it 's that simple . 
D:  But  
A:  " Wah - hah - hah - hah - hah - hah . "  
D:  b but  but  but what are you  what are you talking about for web site hacking ? You 're talking about writing HTML , right ? 
B:  No  
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , I  I 'm talking about putting together all the data in a form that  that is 
A:  legible , and pleasant to read , and up to date , and et cetera , et cetera , et cetera .  
D:  But , is it against the law to actually use a tool to help your job go easier ? 
A:  Absolutely . 
A:  It 's  it 's absolutely against the law to use a tool . 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  You y 
A:  I haven't found any tools that I like . It 's just as easy to use  to edit the raw HTML as anything else . 
D:  No kidding ? 
B:  That 's obviously not true , but you have  
A:  It 's obviously not true . 
D:  <breath> No , it it it 's obviously true that he hasn't found any he likes . The question is what is  what 's he looked at . 
B:  Right . That 's true . 
E:  <breath> Which one do you use Jim ? 
D:  I use something called Trellix . 
E:  Oh , that 's right . I remember . Yeah . 
D:  And it  
E:  Which produces also site maps . 
D:  it 's - it it 's very powerful . 
A:  Now , I guess if I were  if I were doing more powerful  excuse me  more complex web sites I might want to . But 
A:  most of the web sites I do aren't that complex . 
E:  Well , would this be to document it also for outside people or mainly for in house use ? 
A:  But . 
C:  No , I think in 
A:  I think both . 
C:  I think mostly internal . 
A:  Mostly in house . 
B:  That 's right . 
E:  OK . 
D:  Well , yeah , but what does internal mean ? I mean , you 're leaving . 
B:  No , both . 
D:  <breath> People at UW wanna look at it . I mean , it 's  it 's internal  until  
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Right . Internal to the project . 
D:  I see . 
E:  We could do an HT access which would accommodate those things . 
B:  I  I  I  I  
A:  OK , well , send me links and I wi send me pointers , rather , and I 'll put it together .  
B:  I 'm not  o 
E:  Wonderful . 
B:  OK . <breath> I 'm not sure how  how 
B:  <breath> important that distinction is . I don't think <breath> we should say , <breath> " oh , it 's internal therefore we don't have to make it very good " . <breath> I mean , you can say <breath> 
C:  No . No . 
B:  " oh  oh , it 's internal therefore we can put data in it that we don't  
B:  we don't have to worry about releasing " . <breath> But I think the point is to try and <breath> 
B:  be coherent and make it a nice presentation . 
D:  Right . I agree . 
E:  Yeah , it is true , that is  it benefits to  
D:  Cuz you 're gonna have to wor do the work sooner or later . 
E:  That 's right . I mean , it 's the early on . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Even if it 's just writing things up . You know ? 
A:  Yep .  
E:  It 's a great idea .

A:  <laugh> Clink ! Clink ! 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Let 's see  <breath> see what it does to the  <breath> But this was the uh  just  just to review , and I also brought this  along rather than the projector so we can put these on the table , and sort of 
A:  And  and crinkle them and  
D:  w push them around .  
E:  And th " that " being a diagram .  
B:  What ? What ? 
D:  <breath> That  that 's the six tables that we 're looking at . These six tables here , 
D:  <breath> with  with little boxes sort of , uh , in the middle here . Which es would  
E:  OK . 
B:  I see . 
D:  I mean , the  the boxes are pretty much out of the way anyway . I 'll - I 'll show you the  <breath> the cro this is the table cross section . I don't know if people realize what they 're looking at . 
B:  You trying to  screw up the m the microphones ? I mean th  
A:  Yes . He is . Absolutely .  
B:  <laugh> 
D:  Well why not ? I mean , cuz this is what 's gonna happen . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  You got plenty of data . <laugh> I won't come to your next meeting . <breath> And  and  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <breath> and you So this is the box 's  
A:  Get your paper off my PDA ! 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , let  let the record show that this is exhibit two B . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  That 's right .  " Or not to be " .  Yeah , yeah . 
A:  Yeah .  
D:  <breath> Uh , the box , uh  there 's a half inch lip here . The box is an inch thick so it hangs down a half an inch . And so the  the two 
D:  <breath> head set jacks would be in the front and then the little LED to indicate that that box is live . 
D:  <breath> The  the important issue about the LED is the fact that we 're talking about eight of these total , which would be sixteen channels . 
D:  <breath> And , uh , even though we have sixteen channels back at the 
D:  capture , they 're not all gonna be used for this . So there 'd be a subset of them used for  obviously j just use the ones at this end for  <breath> 
B:  Hmm .  
D:  for this many . So  <breath> 
D:  Excuse me .   you 'd like a  a way to tell whether your box is live , so the LED wouldn't be on . So if you 're plugged in it doesn't work and the LED is off that 's  
B:  Right . All the lights . 
D:  that 's a tip off . <breath> And then the , uh  
E:  That 's good .  
D:  would wire the  all of the cables in a  in a bundle come through here and o obviously collect these 
D:  cables at the same time . Uh , so this  this notion of putting down the P Z Ms 
D:  <breath> and taking them away would somehow have to be turned into leaving them on the table or  or  
A:  Right . Well , we wanna do that definitely . So . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Right . And so the  
D:  you  we just epoxy them down or something . <laugh> Big screw into the table . <breath> 
B:  Velcro . 
D:  Uh , and even though there 's eight cables they 're not really very big around so my model is to get a  a  
A:  Sleeve . 
D:  a p piece of  yeah , that  that stuff that people put with the little  you slip the 
D:  wires into that 's <breath> sort of shaped like that cross section . 
D:  Yeah . <breath> I 'm  I 'm r a I 'm going up and then I 'm going down .  <laugh> 
A:  Oh . OK , not just sleeve them all ? 
B:  No . 
A:  And leave them loose ? 
E:  That looks like a semi - circle .  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  It 's like a  it 's a sleeping policeman .  
E:  Sleeping pol  
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Whoo !  Speed - 
B:  Speed bump ! Speed bump . 
E:  <breath> Speed bump . That 's good . There we go s <breath> 
D:  Yeah , it 's like a speed bum <breath> An - 
A:  A " sleeping policeman " !  Cool .  
D:  And they 're ac they 're actually ext extruded from plastic . They sorta look like this . 
C:  What is  
A:  Oh . 
C:  What does that mean ? Is it a speed bump ? 
B:  That 's the s that 's British for speed bump , yeah . 
D:  So that the wires go through here . 
E:  Oh , is that right ? I never heard that . Ah !  
C:  Wow . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  So . 
A:  That 's really cruel . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <clears throat> 
A:  OK , so that  
D:  s 
D:  <breath> So it would c basically go on the diagonal here . 
C:  It could go either way . 
A:  So why do we have sixteen channels instead of like some fewer number ? 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  I guess . 
D:  Uh , because the  
B:  How else are you gonna distribute them around the tables ? 
D:  Because they 're there . 
A:  Well , OK , let me rephrase that . Why two each ? 
B:  Oh , because then you don't have to just have one each . So that if t if you have two people sitting next to each other they can actually go into the same box . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And to  See , thi this is really the way people sit on this table . 
A:  OK .  
D:  Th - 
E:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  OK . 
D:  Uh . 
D:  Dot , dot , dot .  <laugh> 
E:  Which means two at each station . 
D:  Well that  that 's the way people sit . That 's how many chairs are in the room . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , I 'm just saying that for the recording . 
A:  Alright . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  OK . 
D:  And certainly you could do a thing where all sixteen were plugged in . 
D:  Uh if  if you ha if you had nothing else . Yeah . 
A:  But then none of these . 
A:  Right . N none of these and no P Z Ms then . 
D:  Right . Right . I agree . 
B:  Only if you had  Well it depends on this box , right ? 
D:  Oh , true enough . And actually , at the m my plan is to only bring eight wires out of this box . <breath> This  this box  
B:  Exactly . 
A:  Oh , I didn't understand  Oh , I see , I see . 
E:  That being the wiring box . 
D:  Thi - thi thi this box is a one off deal . Uh . <breath> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <breath> And , uh , it 's function is to s to , uh , essentially a wire converter to go from these little blue wires to these black wires , <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  plus supply power to the microphones cuz the  the  
D:  he the , uh , cheap head mounteds all require low voltage . 
A:  So  so you 'd imagine some sort of  
A:  in some sort of patch panel on top to figure out what the mapping was between each d of these two and each of those one or what ? 
D:  Well I w I I the simplest thing I could imagine , i which is really , really simple is to  quite literally that these things plug in . 
B:  Hmm ! 
A:  <breath> 
E:  What  
D:  And there 's a  there 's a plug on the end of each of these  these , uh , ei 
E:  OK .  
B:  Yeah . 
E:  Each of the blue wires ? Mm - hmm . 
D:  eight cables . <breath> An - and there 's only  there 's only four slots that are  
B:  But there are only four . Yeah . 
D:  you know , in  in the first version or the version we 're planning to  to build . So <breath> that  that was the whole issue with the LED , that you plug it in , the LED comes on , and  and  and you 're live . <breath> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh , then it comes on . I see , I see . OK , good . 
D:  Now the  the  <laugh> the subtle issue here is that  tha I  I haven't really figured out a solution for this . So , we it 'll have to be convention . 
D:  <breath> What happens if somebody unplugs this because they plug in more of something else ? Well the  there 's no clever way to let the up stream guys know that you 're really not being powered . So  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <breath> th there will be a certain amount of looking at cables has to be done if people , uh , rewire things . But . 
A:  Right . 
B:  Yeah , I mean , we  I had that last time . 
B:  But uh there are actually  that you know , there 's an extra  there 's a mix out on the radio receiver ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <breath> So there are actually six <breath> XLR outs on the back of the radio receiver and only five cables going in , I had the wrong five , so I ended up <breath> not recording one of the channels and recording the mix . 
D:  How interesting . D did you do any recognition on the mix  mix out ? 
E:  Hmm . 
B:  No . 
D:  Wonder whether it works any  
B:  But I subtracted the four that I did have from the mix and got a pretty good approximation of the @ @ . Yeah . 
D:  Got the fifth ? Cool . 
A:  You g <laugh> 
E:  Oh , how great . 
A:  And did it work ? Did it sound good ? 
D:  Is it  is  
B:  It 's not bad . It 's not bad , yeah . 
D:  Ain't science wonderful ? <breath> 
A:  Wow . 
E:  That 's amazing . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  <breath> So  
A:  So what 's the schedule on these things ? 
B:  But , you always  
E:  Wow . 
D:  Uh , well I was wrestling with th with literally the w 
D:  number of connectors in the cable and the  <breath> 
D:  the , uh , 
D:  <breath> powering system . And I  
D:  I was gonna do this very clever phantom power and I decided a couple days ago not to do it . So I 'm ready to build it . 
B:  Hmm ! 
D:  <breath> Which is to say , uh , the neighborhood of a week to get the circuit board done . 
topic_description:	recording setup


A:  Mm - hmm . So I think the other thing I 'd like to do is , do something about the set up so that it 's a little more presentable and organized . 
B:  See - 
D:  I agree . 
A:  And I 'm  I 'm just not sure what that is . I mean , some sort of cabinet . 
D:  <breath> Well I can build a cabinet . The  the difficulty for this kind of project is the intellectual capital to design the cabinet . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  <breath> In other words , to figure out ex exactly what the right thing is . That cabinet can  can go away . We can use that for  for uh kindling or something . 
B:  <sudden outbreath> 
D:  <breath> But if you can imagine what the right form factor is . Dan - Dan and I have sort of gone around on this , and we were thinking about something that opened up in the top 
D:  <breath> to allow access to the mixer for example . 
A:  Mm - hmm .  
D:  <breath> But there 's these things sticking out of the mixer which are kind of a pain , so you end up with this thing that  <breath> 
D:  if if you stuck the mixer up here and the top opened , it 'd be  it 'd be fine . You wouldn't necessarily  Well , <breath> 
D:  you s understand what I 'm  
D:  the  the  you can  you can start  start s sketching it out , and I can certainly build it out of oak no problem , would it  you know , arb you know , arbitrarily amount of  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , I understand . So . 
A:  I need a desk at home too , alright ?  
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Is that gonna be a better solution than just going out and buy one ? 
D:  <breath> Well , the  as we found out with the  the thing that , uh , Jeff bought a long time ago to hold our stereo system 
D:  <breath> the stuff you buy is total crap . And I mean this is something you buy . 
D:  <breath> And  and  It 's total crap .  Well , it 's useless for this function . <breath> Works fine for holding a Kleenex , but it  <laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  And it 's total crap . 
A:  Right , Kleenex and telephones . 
D:  Right . 
A:  Um , so yeah , I g I guess it 's just a question , is that something you wanna spend your time on ? 
D:  Oh , I  
D:  I 'm paid for . <laugh> 
A:  OK , great . 
D:  I have no problem . No , but w certainly one of the issues is  is the , uh  
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Hmm ? 
D:  is security . I mean , we 've been  been  been lax and lucky . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Lax .  
B:  Yep . 
D:  <breath> Really lucky with these things . <breath> But they 're not ours , so  the , uh  the flat panels . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah .  
B:  Oh , yeah ! 
A:  I 'm telling you , I 'm just gonna cart one of them away if they stay there much longer . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Wow .  Tempting . Tempting . <breath> Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  Uh , let the record show at  uh <laugh> at f four thirty - five <laugh> Adam Janin says    <laugh>

topic_description:	cabinet construction


A:  then the other question is do we wanna try to do a user interface that 's available out here ? 
B:  Sorry ? 
E:  Use - user interface  
D:  <laugh> Slipped  almost slipped it by Dan . 
A:  A user interface . I mean , do we wanna try to get a monitor ? 
B:  <breath> Oh ! Sure . Well of course we do . 
A:  Or just something . 
E:  Oh . 
A:  And how do we want to do that ? 
E:  You mean like see  see meter readings , from  while sitting here . 
A:  J just so we see something . 
E:  Wow . 
D:  <breath> How about 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  use the thing that um 
D:  ACIRI 's doing . 
D:  <breath> Which is to say just 
D:  laptop with a wireless . 
B:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . Sure . 
E:  Oh . 
B:  Which we 'll borrow from them , <laugh> when we need it . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  What 's wrong with yours ? If we bought you a  a  
B:  Oh , a Applecard . Sure . Right . Yeah , you could use my machine . 
C:  <breath> Well  
D:  What ? 
B:  <laugh> I  or the   
A:  I have an IRAM machine I 've borrowed and we can use it .  
D:  N no , I 'm  I 'm  I 'm serious . Does  does the wireless thing work on your  
A:  Wait , isn't that an ethernet connection or is that a phone ? 
B:  Uh , that 's an ethernet connection . 
A:  Well  
D:  Yeah  no  no I 'm a 
B:  It 's going next door . <laugh> 
D:  I  I  I ain't joking here . I 'm serious , that  that  <breath> it  it  
A:  We jus 
B:  Yeah . No , no , absolutely , that 's the right way to do it . T to have it uh , just  
D:  It 's very convenient especially if Dan happens to be sitting at that end of the table to not have to run down here and  and look in the thing every so often , but just have the  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  And given  given that we 've got a wireless  that we 've got a  we got the field . Right . 
D:  It 's right there . <laugh> Right ? The antenna 's right there , right outside the  
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  Right .  
B:  I don't know . 
D:  Y I mean , we need  obviously need to clear this with ACIRI but , uh , 
D:  how tough can that be ? There  it you 'd  all you need 's web access , isn't it ? 
B:  W we don't need X access but I mean that 's fine . That 's  that 's what it does , yeah . 
D:  In  in theory . 
D:  OK , great , great . 
B:  <breath> So  
A:  Um , 
C:  <inbreath> 
A:  right , so it 's just a question of getting a laptop and a wireless modem . 
B:  With a  with a  with a  w 1 x 
D:  <breath> No , and he  he had , reque @ @  my  my proposal is you have a laptop . You don't ? 
B:  No . 
B:  Yeah . I do ! Yeah . Yeah , yeah . 
D:  If  if we bought you the thing would you mind using it with i the  the  
B:  No , I would love to <breath> but I 'm not sure if my laptop is compatible with the 
B:  wave LAN thing they 're using . 
D:  Really ? 
A:  To  Mac . 
C:  He 's  
D:  Your new one ? 
B:  Well Apple has their own thing , right ? 
D:  I 'm sorry ? 
A:  Airport . 
B:  Apple has their own thing . And  
D:  I thought it just came through a serial p or an Ethernet port . 
B:  Yeah , I think what  
B:  I think you  I think it just plug plugs in a PC card , so you could probably make it run with that , but . 
A:  The question is , is there an Apple driver ? 
D:  I  e <breath> 
B:  Yeah , I 'm sure . I imagine there is .  
B:  <breath> But  uh anyway 
D:  But the two t 
B:  there are  there are abs there are a bunch of machines at ICSI that have those cards and so I think 
B:  if w if it doesn't  we should be able to find a machine that does that . 
B:  I  I mean I know that <breath> doesn't  don't  don't the important people have those little blue VAIOs that  
D:  <breath> Well , uh , b that  to me that 's a whole nother . That 's a whole nother issue . 
E:  Hmm . Hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  <breath> The  the idea of con convincing them that we should use their network 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  i is fairly straight forward . <breath> The idea of being able to walk into their office and say , " oh , can I borrow your machine for a while " , is  is  is a non - starter . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  That  I  I don't think that 's gonna work . 
B:  I see . 
D:  <breath> So , I mean , either  either we figure out how to use a machine somebody already  in the group already owns , 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . 
D:  <breath> a a and the idea is that if it 's it perk , you know , it 's an advantage not  not a disadvan  
B:  Absolutely . 
D:  <breath> or else we  we literally buy a machine 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  e exactly for that purpose . <breath> Certainly it solves a lot of the problems with leaving a monitor out here all the time . 
D:  <breath> I  I  I  I 'm  I 'm not a big fan of doing things to the room that make the room 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  less attractive for other people , right ? Which is part of the reason for getting all this stuff out of the way and  <breath> 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
D:  and , so a monitor sitting here all the time you know people are gonna walk up to it and go , " how come I can't get , you know , Pong on this " or , whatev <breath> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Well  
A:  Right . 
A:  I 've  I 've borrowed the IRAM 
A:  VAIO Sony thingy , and I don't think they 're ever gonna want it back . 
D:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  You 're kidding ! 
D:  <breath> Well , the next conference they will . 
A:  <laugh> So . 
A:  Sure . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  But that does mean  so we can use that as well . 
D:  <breath> Well , uh , the  certainly , u you should give it a shot first See whether 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  you you can get compatible stuff . <breath> 
D:  Uh , ask them what it costs . Ask them if they have an extra one . Who knows , they might have an extra <breath> hardware s 
B:  I 'd trade them a flat panel display for it . Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> Good . <breath>

C:  What is the , um , projector supposed to be hooked up to ? 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Uh , the , uh  Tsk .  It 's gonna be hooked up to all sorts of junk . <laugh> 
D:  <breath> There 's gonna be actually a  a plug at the front that 'll connect to people 's laptops so you can walk in and plug it in . <breath> And it 's gonna be con connected to the machine at the back . 
D:  <breath> So we certainly could use that as  as a constant reminder of what the VU meters are doing . So people sitting here  are going <breath>

D:  there in front of you is really cool . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah , yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  I think and uh , having  having it on wireless is  is the neatest way  neatest way to do it . 
D:  R

A:  I had  
B:  Yeah . 
A:  I had actually earlier asked if I could borrow one of the 
A:  cards to do wireless stuff and they said , " sure , whenever you want " . So I think it won't be a problem . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Oh , cool . 
D:  And  and it 's a  a PCMCIA card , right ? PC card , so you can have a slot , right ? In your new machine ? 
B:  OK . 
A:  Yep . 
A:  PC card .   
B:  Yeah , yeah .

C:  It 's  it really come down to the driver .

B:  Yeah . 
D:  Right , i it 'll  it 'll work  
A:  Right , I mean , and if  and if his doesn't work , as I said , we can use the PC . 
D:  It 'll work the first time . 
D:  I  I trust Steve Jobs . 
A:  Good . 
B:  Um , well , that sounds like a d good solution one way or the other . 
A:  So  
A:  So Jim is gonna be doing wiring and you 're gonna give some thought to cabinets ? 
D:  Uh , y yeah . We  we need to 
A:  Great .

B:  So again , Washington wants to equip a system . Our system , we spent ten thousand dollars on equipment not including the PC . 
B:  However , seven and a half thousand of that was the wireless mikes . 
B:  <breath> Uh , using  using these  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And it  and the f the five thousand for the wires , so if I 'm gonna do  <laugh> No . <breath> It 's a joke . I have to do  
B:  Yeah , that 's true but we haven't spent that , right ? 
B:  <breath> But once we  once we 've done the intellectual part of these , 
B:  uh , we can just knock them out , right ? We can start  <breath> we  you can make a hundred of them or something . 
A:  Cheap . 
D:  Oh , of the  of the boards ? Yeah , yeah , sure , right . 
B:  <breath> And then we could  Washington could have a system that didn't have any wireless but would had  what 's based on these and it would cost

B:  <laugh>

A:  Well , actually shorten  
B:  Yeah . 
A:  There 's a speech compression program that works great on things like this , cuz if the dynamic range is low it encodes it with fewer bits . 
A:  <breath> And so most of the time no one 's talking so it shortens it dramatically . But <breath>

D:  <breath> Eric , you and I win . We didn't make any mistakes . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  It 's harder at the end than at the beginning . 
E:  We don't know that for sure , do we ? <laugh> 
A:  I should have mentioned that s uh , to pause between lines but  
D:  No , I know . I 'm just giving you a hard time . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  It 's  it 's only a hard time for the transcriber not for the speech recognizer . Me . 
B:  Tha - tha 
E:  But  
D:  <laugh> 
E:  I also think you said channel four and I think you meant microphone four . 
D:  <mock gasp> 
E:  And I think that 's a mistake . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Very good . So Eric , you win . But the other thing is that there 's a  there 's a colon for transcripts . 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  And there shouldn't be a colon . 
D:  Because see , everything else is stuff you fill in . 
B:  Yeah , that 's been filled in for you . 
D:  Right ? Automatically . <breath> But real 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  But they 're in order ! They start , six , seven , eight , nine , zero , one , two , three , four , five , six , eight , nine . <breath> 
D:  Where 'd they come from ? 
E:  Oh .  
B:  And they 're in order because they 're sorted lexically by the file names , which are  have the numbers in digits . 
B:  And so they 're actually  this is like all the  all utterances that were generated by speaker MPJ or something . And then within MPJ they 're sorted by what he actually said . 
E:  Oh .  
A:  Ugh !  I didn't know that . I should have randomized it . 
E:  Wow .  
B:  It doesn't matter ! It 's like  Cuz you said " six , seven , eight " . 
D:  Well , we think it doesn't matter . 
D:  <laugh> But the real question I have is that , why bother with these ? Why don't you just ask people to repeat numbers they already know ? 
B:  We think it doesn't matter . If I  if not I  
E:  Oh , interesting . 
D:  Like phone numbers , you know , social security numbers . <laugh> I know .  I kn <laugh> 
B:  Cuz we have these writt written down , right ? That 's why  
A:  Because  Right . If we have it , uh  
E:  Social security numbers .  Bank account numbers . <laugh> Passport numbers . <laugh> 
B:  You can  you can generate  
A:  we don't have to transcribe . 
D:  Credit card numbers , yeah . <laugh> 
A:  We don't have to tran Yeah , please . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . That 's a great idea .  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> Yeah , so you just say  <laugh> say your credit card numbers , say your phone numbers , say your mother 's maiden name . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Bet we could do it . 
D:  <laugh> You know pe 
E:  Password to your account . Go on . <laugh> 
D:  people off the street . This  
A:  <breath> 
E:  <breath> 
B:  Alright . 
A:  Actually , this  I got this directly from another training set , from Aurora . So . We can compare directly . 
E:  <breath> I was  I  the reason I made my mistake was  Wa - was this  ? 
B:  Looks good . Looks like there were no errors . 
A:  What ? 
B:  There were no  there were no direct driver errors , by the look of it , which is good . 
A:  Great . <clanking> OK , the mike 's off . <clanking> Thank you all . 
E:  Good news . 
B:  So I 'm gonna stop it . Yeah , OK . 
E:  OK . <breath> 
D:  <breath> Mony on the mike . 
B:  Uh - oh .
