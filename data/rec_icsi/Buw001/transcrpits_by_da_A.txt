A:  Great . 
A:  We 're not recording yet , are we ? 
A:  Um , Meeting Recorder meeting . 
A:  OK . Do we do th do you go around the room  and do names or anything ? 
A:  What ? 
A:  Whoops . 
A:  Would it  m 
A:  So  
A:  Oh , this thing . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  It 's kind of  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  OK . 
A:  This w 
A:  Alright . 
A:  How 's that working ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Um . 
A:  So , I think the goal  the goal was what can we do  how can you do the data collection differently to get  
A:  what can you add to it to get , um , some information that would be helpful for the user - interface design ? 
A:  Like  
A:  Especially for querying . 
A:  So , getting people to do queries afterwards , 
A:  getting people to do summaries afterwards . 
A:  Um . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Well , if  if you actually take notes as a summary as opposed to n take notes in the sense of taking advantage of the time - stamps . 
A:  So action item or uh , reminder to send this to so - and - so , blah - blah - blah . 
A:  So that wouldn't be a summary . 
A:  That would just be  that would b relate to the query side . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Well  
A:  So  
A:  Yeah . We also could come up with some code for things that people want to do so that  for frequent things . 
A:  And the other things , people can write whatever they want . 
A:  I mean , it 's to some extent , uh , for his benefit . 
A:  So , 
A:  if that  you know , if  if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful . 
A:  Right . 
A:  I thought you did that on purpose . 
A:  But anyway , shall we do the roll call ? 
A:  Mari on channel zero . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  So the there will be jargon that we he There 'll be transcription errors . 
A:  So , 
A:  uh , u u 
A:  So , actually there 's kind of three issues . 
A:  There 's the CrossPad issue . 
A:  Should we do it and , if so , what 'll we have them do ? 
A:  Um , do we have s people write summaries ? 
A:  Everybody or one person ? 
A:  And then , do we ask people for how they would query things ? 
A:  Is that  
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  They  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  W 
A:  How about this idea ? 
A:  That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker . 
A:  And  So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ? 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Well  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Well , what it does  
A:  Well , what it does is provide a different  
A:  I  I think it 's an interesting thing . 
A:  I don't think it gets at the  the queries per - se , 
A:  but it does give us an information fusion sort of thing that , you know , you wanna i say " what were the hot - points of the meeting ? " 
A:  Well , yeah . 
A:  I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , uh , when  uh , when did so - and - so s talk about blah . 
A:  And at least that gives you the word  that they might run a query on . 
A:  Right . 
A:  It 'll tell you the hit but not the query . 
A:  Right . 
A:  w 
A:  Well , th you could do  
A:  I think the summaries actually may help get us there , 
A:  for a couple reasons . 
A:  One , if you have a summary  if you have a bunch of summaries , you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings . 
A:  So " action item " is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever . 
A:  So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about . 
A:  Um , the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying " here 's a summary of a meeting , what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? " 
A:  Well  
A:  That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary , 
A:  and you want to ask questions to get more detail . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  I th 
A:  No . 
A:  I think you got to have somebody who knows the pro knows the topic or  you know , whose job it is delegated to be the note - taker . 
A:  Somebody who 's part of the meeting . 
A:  Well 
A:  I think it serves two purpo purposes . 
A:  One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries , 
A:  but also , I mean , maybe we do want to generate summaries . 
A:  And then it 's  you know , it 's kind of a key . 
A:  Uh  
A:  Well , i i  ? 
A:  Or , d o 
A:  What I  I think , you know , in most meetings , 
A:  this one being  different , 
A:  but in most meetings that I attend , there 's somebody t explicitly taking notes , frequently on a laptop  
A:  Um , you can just make it be on a laptop , 
A:  so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII 
A:  and not somebody  
A:  you don't have to go through handwriting recognition . 
A:  Um , and then they post - edit it into , uh , a summary 
A:  and they email it out for minutes . 
A:  I mean , that happens in most meetings . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  So , I think it depends on whether it 's a business meeting or a technical discussion . 
A:  And I agree , 
A:  technical discussions you don't usually have somebody taking notes . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  No , no , no , no . 
A:  So  
A:  e 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  What do you mean we 're not saving it anyway ? 
A:  I 've written all of this down and it 's getting emailed to you . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , that 's why  that 's why I 'm saying that I think the note - taking would be  
A:  I think in many  for many meetings there will be some sort of note - taking , 
A:  in which case , that 's a useful thing to have  
A:  Uh , I mean , we  uh , we don't need to require it . 
A:  Just like the  
A:  I mean , I think it would be great if we try to get a picture with every meeting . 
A:  Um , 
A:  so  so we won't worry about requiring these things , 
A:  but the more things that we can get it for , the more useful it will be for various applications . 
A:  So . 
A:  Well , before we leave the CrossPads and  and call it done . 
A:  So , if I 'm collecting data then there is this question of do I use CrossPads ? 
A:  So , I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it , 
A:  um , unless you think that the CrossPads are gonna  
A:  n 
A:  I 'm not  I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do . 
A:  But  but having a small percentage of the data with it , 
A:  I 'm not sure whether that 's useful or not . 
A:  Maybe  maybe it 's no big deal . 
A:  Maybe we just do it and see what happens . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Nothing . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Right . 
A:  OK . 
A:  That 's true . 
A:  So if it  if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . So CrossPads , we 're just gonna try it and see what happens . 
A:  OK . 
A:  The note - taking  
A:  So , I  I think that this is gonna be useful . 
A:  So if we record data I will definitely ask for it . 
A:  So , I j I think we should just say this is not  we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could  could they send it to us ? 
A:  And then  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  But  but again , like the CrossPads , I don't think I would base a lot of stuff on it , 
A:  because I think  I know when I see the  the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door . 
A:  So , 
A:  you 're probably not gonna get  a lot of people wanting to do this . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . I think that  I think doing it orally at the end of the meeting is the best time . 
A:  I just don't  
A:  because they 're kind of a captive audience . 
A:  Once they leave , 
A:  you know , forget it . 
A:  But  but i 
A:  Right . 
A:  But , uh , I don't think that they 'll necessarily  you 'll  you 'll get many people willing to stay . 
A:  But , you know , if you get even one  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  For a little while I thought it was just that I was really tired . 
A:  That and y  Too much caffeine and really tired , 
A:  but then I thought " no , maybe that 's real " . 
A:  Yeah ? 
A:  Um , <clears throat> what 's our schedule ? 
A:  Let 's see , 
A:  you and I need dis Uh , 
A:  no , we did the Liz talk . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So  so that was the prosody thing . 
A:  Um , we need to finish the  
A:  It 's already four - fifteen . 
A:  Uh , after . 
A:  We need to  finish this discussion , and you 
A:  and I need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart . 
A:  So , 
A:  um  
A:  Um , what  what 's the plan for this discussion ? 
A:  We should  
A:  Uh , less . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So , I think  
A:  Action  
A:  Yeah . 

A:  So , 
A:  e e why don't you say five - thirty ? 
A:  I don't  
A:  Is that OK ? 
A:  We 'll probably hit horrible traffic . 
A:  That 's not a lot of time , 
A:  but  
A:  Hmm . 
A:  But actually I would say that 's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting . 
A:  You get two  
A:  Yeah , that 's true . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah , that 's actually a really good idea . 
A:  But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say  what was the most interesting thing you learned , 
A:  for those pe people willing to stay . 
A:  And  and that might be something people are willing to stay for . 
A:  That 's fine . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Uh  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , I  That 's hard to generate 
A:  and  and I think that 's half of what i I would use it for . 
A:  But I also a lot of times um , make  you know , think to myself " this is interesting , 
A:  I 've gotta come back and follow up on it " . 
A:  So , things that I think are interesting , um , I would be , uh , wanting to do a query about . 
A:  And also , I like the idea of going around the room , 
A:  because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it 
A:  and then I 'd want to follow up on it . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  OK - OK . 
A:  In the interest of , um , 
A:  generati  generating an interesting summary ,  um  
A:  No , i in the interest of generating some minutes here , 
A:  uh , and also moving on to action items and other things , 
A:  let me just go through the things that I wrote down as being important , 
A:  um , that we at least decided on . 
A:  CrossPads we were going to try , 
A:  um , if Landay can get the , uh  get them to  to you guys , 
A:  um , and see if they 're interesting . 
A:  And if they are , then we 'll try to get m do it more . 
A:  Um , 
A:  getting electronic summary from a note - taking person if they happen to do it anyway . 
A:  Um , 
A:  getting  just , uh , digital pictures  
A:  a couple digital pictures of the  the table and boards to set the context of the meeting . 
A:  Uh , and then going around the room at the end to just say  qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned . 
A:  So rather than say the most interesting thing , something interesting , 
A:  and that way you 'll get more variety . 
A:  OK . 
A:  " Thing  that was  discussed . " 
A:  And then the last thing c would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards and give an oral summary . 
A:  OK ? 
A:  Does that pretty much cover everything we talked about ? 
A:  That  well , that we want to do ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . So  
A:  Play with and generate real queries from . 
A:  Right . 
A:  OK . 
A:  So . Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Well , we 're piloting . 
A:  We 'll just do it and see what happens . 
A:  OK - OK . Speaking of action items , can we move on to action items ? 
A:  Um , 
A:  or maybe we should wait until the summary of this  until this meeting is transcribed 
A:  and then we will hav 
A:  I got  
A:  Yeah . In fact , why don't you hand me those transparencies so that I remember to take them . 
A:  eee , 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  What I have down for action items is we 're supposed to find out about our human subject , um , <mouth> requirements . 
A:  Uh , 
A:  people are supposed to send me U R 
A:  for their  for web pages , 
A:  to c and I 'll put together an overall cover . 
A:  And you 're s 
A:  Hmm ? 
A:  And  and you also need to look at your web page 
A:  and clean it up by mid - July . 
A:  Um , 
A:  let 's see . 
A:  Choo - choo - choo . 
A:  We  
A:  Mailing list ? 
A:  Uh , you need to put together a mailing list . 
A:  Uh , I think w 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Um , 
A:  uh , I need to email Adam or Jane , 
A:  um , about getting the data . 
A:  Who should I email ? 
A:  Um . 
A:  How about if I just c 
A:  Uh , Right now all I want  
A:  I personally only want text data . 
A:  I think the only thing Jeff would do anything with right now  
A:  But I 'm just speaking fr based on a conversation with him two weeks ago I had in Turkey . 
A:  But I think all he would want is the digits . 
A:  Um , but I 'll just speak for myself . 
A:  I 'm interested in getting the language model data . 
A:  Eh , so I 'm just interested in getting transcriptions . 
A:  So then just email you ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  And your email is ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  And then  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  OK . Related to  to the conversation with Picheny , 
A:  I need to email him , uh , my shipping address 
A:  and you need to email them something which you already did . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . We never had our data format discussion . 
A:  Oh , OK . 
A:  That 's  
A:  W My  my u feeling right now on format is you guys have been doing all the work 
A:  and whatever you want , we 're happy to live with . 
A:  Um , 
A:  other people may not agree with that , 
A:  but  Cuz I 'm not actually touching the data , 
A:  so I shouldn't be the one to talk . 
A:  But  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh , yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Or , <clears throat> like if you have a  
A:  Or , like if you have somebody who makes your  your plane reservations for you , 
A:  um , which is 
A:  the n 
A:  Yeah . Yeah . Seriously . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  e You know , it could  result in some good bloopers , 
A:  which is always good for presentations . 
A:  So  
A:  Um , anyway  
A:  Mmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Um , other  
A:  Let 's see , 
A:  other action items . 
A:  So I have the  
A:  I 'm  I 'm shooting to try to get it done  get it put together by  the beginning of August . 
A:  So , um , 
A:  you know , if 
A:  We don't know . 
A:  i It 's probably unlikely that we 'll pull this off , 
A:  but a at least it 's worth trying . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Um , and I will email these notes  
A:  Um , I 'm not sure what to do about action items for the data stuff , 
A:  although , then somebody  I guess somebody needs to tell Landay that you want the pads . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Oh ! 
A:  Right . 
A:  But  but that 's actually what I wanna do . 
A:  That 's  that 's what I wanna work with , 
A:  is  is things that s the wrong material but the right da the right source . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . He seemed  when I asked him if he could actually supply data , he seemed a little bit more reluctant . 
A:  So , I 'll  I 'll send him email . 
A:  I 'll put it in an action item that I send him email about it . 
A:  And if I get something , great . 
A:  If I don't get something  
A:  Landay . 
A:  And , uh , um , 
A:  you know , otherwise , if you guys have any papers 
A:  or  
A:  I could  I could use , uh  I could use your web pages . 
A:  That 's what we could do . 
A:  You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor 
A:  Yeah ! 
A:  Oh , forget this ! 
A:  I  One less action item . 
A:  I can use what web pages there are out there on meeting recorders . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  So , there 's  there 's ICSI , Xerox , 
A:  CMU , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Great . That solves that problem . 
A:  One less action item . 
A:  Um  
A:  OK . I think that 's good enou that 's  that 's pretty much all I can think of . 
A:  Oh , yeah . 
A:  I don't think we should have rules of participation , 
A:  but I think we should try to  get a variety of meetings . 
A:  That 's something that if we get the  the meeting stuff going at UW , that I probably can do more than you guys , 
A:  cuz you guys are probably mostly going to get ICSI people here . 
A:  But we can get anybody in EE , uh , over  
A:  and  and possibly also some CS people , uh , over at UW . 
A:  So , I think that  that there 's a good chance we could get more variety . 
A:  Um , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  OK . 
A:  So I 'm just writing here , we 're not gonna try to specify rules of interaction 
A:  but we 're gonna try to get more variety by i using different  groups of people 
A:  and different sizes . 
A:  e e 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  And then the other thing might be , um , uh , technical versus administrative . 
A:  Cuz if I recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap , 
A:  because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever . 
A:  Well , the reason why I didn't want to is be why I personally didn't want to  is because I wanted it to be  as , uh , unintrusive as possi 
A:  as you could be with these things hanging on you . 
A:  Is that an action item ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Yes , we should do that . 
A:  They 're related to this morning 's meeting . 
A:  I think  I think " pass " is socially acceptable . 
A:  But I will say  uh , I will actually  
A:  uh , a spin on different  slightly different spin on what you said , 
A:  this issue of , uh , realizing that we could take minutes , 
A:  and that actually may be a goal . 
A:  So that  that may be kind of the test  in a sense , test data , 
A:  uh , the  the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary . 
A:  So that 's an interesting new twist on what we can do with this data . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Great .
