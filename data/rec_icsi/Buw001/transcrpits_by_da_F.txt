F:  OK . 
F:  No , uh , that  that wasn't recorded . 
F:  Temple squeezers . 
F:  I guess I have to d stop doing this sigh of contentment , you know , after sipping cappuccino or something . 
F:  I was just noticing a big s 
F:  I mean , the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the , uh , quality of <outbreath> the handwriting recognition was quite poor . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Eric on channel nine . 
F:  There 's  there 're sub - problems in that , 
F:  in that where  or when do you actually ask them about that ? 
F:  I mean , that was  One thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then . 
F:  But there 's a problem with that in that if  you 're not  
F:  If you don't have an interactive system , it 's gonna be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question . 
F:  Right . 
F:  And furth id explore the data further . 
F:  So . 
F:  Did they store it digitally , 
F:  or  ? 
F:  or just put it on videotape ? 
F:  Or even just have one or two people stay behind . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  So I have a question about queries , 
F:  which is , um , 
F:  uh  
F:  I don't know . 
F:  There you go . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Good . 
F:  So , 
F:  the question I had about queries was , um , so what we 're planning to do is have people look at the summaries and then generate queries ? 
F:  Are  are we gonna try and o 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Well , I mean , 
F:  so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ? 
F:  I mean , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself , 
F:  so that it may not be a feasible thing . 
F:  But  
F:  n 
F:  Well , I 'm not sure  I 'm not sure that 's a solved problem . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  Of how to  how to generate queries from a  
F:  That was sort of what my  question was  aimed towards . 
F:  Do we  
F:  The question  the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by  you know , introduce by saying , you know , this was important now 
F:  and , you know , maybe tha something else is important later ? 
F:  I mean , does it  does the bias matter ? 
F:  I  I don't know . 
F:  I mean , uh , that 's , I guess , a question for you guys . 
F:  But  
F:  Uh , yeah , yeah . 
F:  Sure , sure . 
F:  But I  I  I guess that 's the question , really , is that  I mean , 
F:  does building queries based on what 's important now introduce an irreversible bias on being able to do what Morgan wants to do later ? 
F:  That 's  that 's  
F:  Right . 
F:  Sure . 
F:  I agree . 
F:  I think " important " can often be uninteresting . 
F:  But w 
F:  It 's not  
F:  Right . It doesn't  it isn't difficult for us to do , 
F:  so we might as well just do it . 
F:  " Here 's a mysterious file 
F:  and  " 
F:  Adam ! 
F:  I 'm not . 
F:  Oh ! 
F:  OK . 
F:  I see . 
F:  I 'm gonna pass 
F:  because I can't  
F:  I mean , of the  Jane took my answer . 
F:  So . 
F:  Um , 
F:  so I 'm gonna pass for the moment 
F:  but y come  come back to me . 
F:  Well , I mean , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot . 
F:  Right ? 
F:  So . 
F:  No . 
F:  OK .
