C:  But , um , <mouth> it 's definitely something I would  want to do something on . 
C:  Katrin on channel two . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  That 's true . 
C:  And you 're gonna send it out by email , too . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Oh , yeah . 
C:  That 's better . 
C:  Are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them ? 
C:  Make it a voluntary thing , 
C:  and then  
C:  Yeah . That 's why I was wondering . 
C:  Yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something 
C:  and then you go around the room and they say " yeah , me too , I agree . " 
C:  So  
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  No , I think that 's fine . 
C:  Now , something that I mentioned earlier to Mari and Liz is that it 's probably important to get as many non - technical and non - speech people as possible 
C:  in order to get some realistic users . 
C:  So if you could ask other people to call and use our system , that 'd be good . 
C:  Cuz we don't want people who already know how to deal with dialogue systems , 
C:  who know that 
C:  you shouldn't hyper - articulate , for instance , and things like that . 
C:  So . 
C:  Yeah , for instance . 
C:  Your grandmother . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Hmm . 
C:  I agree with Jane and Eric . 
C:  I think the question of how to generate queries automatically was the most interesting question that came up , 
C:  and it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself , 
C:  so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it 
C:  because we don't have funding on it , uh , in this project . 
C:  But , um , <mouth> it 's definitely something I would  want to do something on .
