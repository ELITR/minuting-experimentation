H:  On the channel , channel . 
H:  Please give me one . 

H:  It 's worse . 


H:  Well , I only say that the  this is , a summary of the  of all the VTS experiments 
H:  and say that the result in the last  um , for Italian  the last experiment for Italian , <breath> are bad . 
H:  I make a mistake when I write . 
H:  Up at D I copy <breath> one of the bad result . 
H:  And  
H:  There . <breath> You know , this . 
H:  Um , 
H:  well . 
H:  If we put everything , we improve a lot u the spectral use of the VTS 
H:  but the final result <breath> are not still mmm , good <breath> like the Wiener filter for example . 
H:  I don't know . 
H:  Maybe it 's  @ @  it 's possible to  to have the same result . 
H:  I don't know exactly . 
H:  Mmm . 
H:  Because I have , <breath> mmm ,  worse result in medium mismatch and high mismatch . 
H:  And  Yeah . 
H:  I someti are more or less similar but  but are worse . 
H:  And 
H:  still I don't have the result for TI - digits . 
H:  The program is training . 
H:  Maybe for this weekend I will have result TI - digits 
H:  and I can complete that s like this . 
H:  Well . 
H:  One thing that I  note are not here in this result <breath> but are speak  are spoken before with Sunil I  I improve my result using clean LDA filter . 
H:  If I use , <breath> eh , the LDA filter that are training with the noisy speech , <breath> that hurts the res my results . 
H:  This is with the clean . 
H:  With the noise I have worse result , that if I doesn't use it . 
H:  But m that may be because <breath> with this technique <breath> we are using really  really clean speech . 
H:  The speech  the  representation that go to the HTK is really clean speech 
H:  because it 's from the dictionary , 
H:  the code book 
H:  and maybe from that . 
H:  I don't know . 
H:  Because I think that you  did some experiments using the two  the two LDA filter , clean and noi and noise , 
H:  and it doesn't matter too much . 
H:  It 's better to use clean . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  Maybe you can do d also this . 
H:  To use clean speech . 
H:  Yeah , with the clean LDA . 
H:  Is that the reason ? 
H:  And  
H:  And this is everything . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  And prepare at the s 
H:  Yeah , 
H:  I was thinking to do that next week . 
H:  Yeah , 
H:  I wi I  I will do that next week . 
H:  Mm - hmm . 
H:  OK . 
H:  I can send 
H:  yet . 
H:  This is date and time . 
H:  No .
