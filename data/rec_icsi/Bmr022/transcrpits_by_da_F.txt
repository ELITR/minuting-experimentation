F:  Ooo ! 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Yeah , that 's true . 
F:  I 've noticed that . Yeah . 
F:  Which makes sense . 
F:  Oh , on the email . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Well , and then the other possibility was  e that we provide them with a  a file that already has the beeps in it or something . 
F:  Wasn't that what you said ? 
F:  Uh - huh . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh ! 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Oh ! 

F:  Oh . 
F:  Well  
F:  But  
F:  Well you th 
F:  So just r r truly chron chromatically up  all the way through the entire meeting . 
F:  Interesting . 
F:  It 'd be impossible to r to misorder them . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  It 's pretty simple , 
F:  pretty simple . 
F:  Hmm , interesting . 
F:  Well . <laugh> Well , 
F:  " high " , " low " is pretty straightforward , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  You 'd have to  they 'd have to have the acoustics of dogs t <laugh> hear into the high high ranges . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  It 's a shame we can't really give a number . 
F:  So it would be a number and a beep . 
F:  e 
F:  It 's a shame we can't do that . 
F:  That 'll work . 
F:  Wow , that 'd also be shorter to type . 
F:  Interesting . 
F:  Oh , that 's true . 
F:  Or maybe could it be a click and the number . 
F:  Or a beep and the number , and then  and then you just do the  the num th you do it as a d a digit . 
F:  Well , if  if it saves time , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  It might actually help them in terms of their place holding . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  And it might be helpful to them in terms of d act 
F:  Know  
F:  Well , no no no no . 
F:  OK . 
F:  I  i 
F:  And then also , if we  I mean , I don't know what their setup is , but your template idea might be a way of  of of  
F:  We could actually build the numbers into a template . 
F:  Well . 
F:  That 's a good idea . 
F:  Very simple . 
F:  It 's forty - five minutes . 
F:  Forty - five minutes for that one . 
F:  It 's possible . 
F:  Yeah . That 's right . 
F:  Yeah , it was forty - five minutes . 
F:  Hmm , interesting . 
F:  Well , with just one digit though , 
F:  I think  
F:  Well , and the other thing is , maybe the numbers would help them keep their place in the transcript and speed the process  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I think it would save them time . 
F:  I think it would help them keep the track  track of it . 
F:  Interesting , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  So , someone 's gonna talk to Brian . 
F:  OK . 
F:  I also looked thr over the text 
F:  and I was impressed by the accuracy , 
F:  it looks really good . 
F:  Yeah , it 's there . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Oh . Yes . But this is not important . 
F:  It 's systematic , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  And  and Brian actually forwarded me in advance . 
F:  He  he wor he very nicely worked out a set of conventions which is intermediate between ours and the ones that they 're used to . 
F:  Which is  which is really a good  a good way to do it . 
F:  No problem . 
F:  Yeah . We can do it this week . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I thought we were going to get two more of the ones  
F:  Can I  I c I  
F:  I actually really like them though . 
F:  Yeah , I do . 
F:  The other thing , too , is th y you said that the acoustic pra q quality of the one that you 're wearing , the fancy one , is actually somewhat better than 
F:  So I I don't know if it 's a noticeable difference , 
F:  but it is  
F:  I mean , I p I personally really prefer that model , 
F:  so I think you know we 've got this problem of people having different  different preferences . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  It 's  I  I understand , 
F:  that 's fine with me . 
F:  I  I g would say that um , I find this model easier to adjust , 
F:  that 's one of the reasons I don't like these , 
F:  cuz I keep m you know , bending it , 
F:  and then it 's n and I never really know  
F:  You do ? 
F:  OK . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Huh . 
F:  Then they have to be rewired though , 
F:  don't they ? 
F:  Specially . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  You  you put it over the corner of your ear . 
F:  I can't  I 'm having competing microphone  headphone problems here . 
F:  This one . 
F:  It 's an interesting idea . 
F:  The acoustics  
F:  the acoustics on this are really s m better than when I talk into it directly . 
F:  Works with this . 
F:  I don't know . 
F:  I had another thought . 
F:  Would  w would it be possi 
F:  There are scripts that uh , run , 
F:  and  and when it 's finished compressing , would it be possible for the script to change the permissions on the file to be more strict ? 
F:  Have them  
F:  But after the meeting 's done , would they want to ? 
F:  That 's true . 
F:  Yeah , that 's true . 
F:  Also it seems like once it 's been stored that night , it 's  it 's possible to recover from backups , 
F:  so that the main risk is avoiding it being accidentally deleted during the day that it was recorded . 
F:  Yeah . Yeah . 
F:  And I 'd prefer it to go through me . 
F:  Well I p At this point  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  w w 
F:  Well 
F:  I  I wanna also say that , you know , this is a  
F:  uh , uh , My  my view on this is that once it 's in a final version and I 'm working toward all these being final versions , then it can go into this next ro this next realm . 
F:  But it  it 's sort of counter - productive to have changes made which I would be making if I 'd just gotten that far in the file . 
F:  You know , it 's  it 's , um . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  That 's right . 
F:  And then after that , then this would probably work . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Good , good . 
F:  Well , the " key " file is  
F:  ke " key " file 's different . 
F:  " Key " fi 
F:  Well , " key " file has the extra attributes that if you notice that there are lots of spikes on channel 
F:  so - and - so , it 's useful as a repository for putting that there . 
F:  And also if you notice that  there was an extra speaker , 
F:  and didn't get mentioned in the " key " file , 
F:  but they were only there for a second , 
F:  but it 's t useful to mention that they were there . 
F:  So I th I think that the " key " file is usefu for notations related to the meeting , 
F:  but it 's different from the transcript . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  That 's interesting . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I also think , um , that the type of change ch ch varies an I think it 's a very good point . 
F:  Because what if the  uh , what if one set of changes one person was making was with reference to some typographical convention . 
F:  And the other person n unkn n quite unknowingly , was changing it the other way around . 
F:  Then you could end up with a real mess , 
F:  in terms of , like , consistency of conventions across a file , there is an argument to be made for having a single editor editing at that level . 
F:  But I like b I like what Liz is saying about  
F:  That 's right . 
F:  And I also like  I l also like Liz 's uh , k um , phraseology of " at this level of "  I don't remember how you put it ,  but this  " at this level of transcription " or whatever . 
F:  I mean it 's like there are different layers of whatever 
F:  and different types of conventions , 
F:  and if it were an acronym , then I would  I think that it would make sense f for them to have input into that level of things , 
F:  but I wouldn't want them to be changing  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Well , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  I agree . 
F:  Well  
F:  Well , I see now , we 're k back into the same situation as when we were , uh , talking about a allowing people to edit the transcripts before they  become public . 
F:  So there 's a question of how easy or how hard to modify , 
F:  and how that impacts the amount of changing that 's done . 
F:  And I  I think that it 's , um , 
F:  I  I have received some suggestions for change , which I 've made . 
F:  And um , I think with an acronym , that 's a clear case where it would be an easy change to incorporate . 
F:  But it would worry me to have people , um , having free reign to change these things , because of the need to have consistent conventions . 
F:  And  people who are only just visiting the data might not have a sense of the larger system . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  I agr I agree but I have to also add one other thing which i before I forget it , 
F:  which is Adam 's point about when you were reviewing the IBM transcripts . 
F:  u This was mentioned at the beginning of the meeting . 
F:  You said that there were some places where  it wasn't what y was written already , but you could see how they might have thought that 's what it said . 
F:  So there  it 's not just a right and wrong thing . 
F:  Sometimes there tru there are absolutely stretches where there is no  no  k if you were at the meeting and you could ask the person , 
F:  maybe , m you know , they could  they could 've told you , 
F:  but five minutes later they might not have been able to tell you , 
F:  even if they were listening to it . 
F:  So , sometimes it isn't right and wrong , 
F:  sometimes it 's multiple interpretations , 
F:  and  
F:  Now  But of course , this does raise the possibility of allowing , um , an extra annotation for , you know , alternative interpretations of a stretch . 
F:  But I just wanted to say it isn't simply right or wrong . 
F:  Or overlooked or not overlooked . 
F:  Sometimes they 're truly ambiguous , 
F:  and um , uh , um , 
F:  nice to have a notation for that , 
F:  but . Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  And als it also 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Ooo !
