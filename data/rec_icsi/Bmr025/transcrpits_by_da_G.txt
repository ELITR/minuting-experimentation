G:  or you start laughing . 
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Guess who I practice on ? 
G:  So another idea I w t had just now actually for the demo was whether it might be of interest to sh to show some of the prosody uh <mouth> work that Don 's been doing . 
G:  Um actually show some of the features 
G:  and then show for instance a task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries . 
G:  Um , 
G:  you know , you can show that graphically , sort of what the features are doing . 
G:  It , you know , it doesn't work great but it 's definitely giving us something . 
G:  I don't know if that would be of interest or not . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  I mean , you 're looking at this now  
G:  Are you looking at Waves or Matlab ? 
G:  Yeah def 
G:  I 
G:  Oh , the end of this month or next month ? 
G:  Oh , you mean like today ? 
G:  Oh . 
G:  Next month . 
G:  Sorry . 
G:  Sorry . 
G:  I think , I mean eh where  
G:  Yeah if d if Don can sort of talk to whoever 's  
G:  cuz we 're doing this anyway as part of our  you know , the research , 
G:  visualizing what these features are doing 
G:  and so either  
G:  it might not be integrated 
G:  but it  it could potentially be in it . 
G:  Could find some . 
G:  I mean it 's different . 
G:  I don't think anyone has done this on meeting data 
G:  so it might be neat , you know . 
G:  Oh , quick question on that . Is  do we have the  <clears throat> the seat information ? 
G:  In  in the Key files now ? 
G:  Oh in  
G:  For the new one 
G:  OK . 
G:  Great . 
G:  Sea - yeah . 
G:  Alright . 
G:  OK . 
G:  Alright . 
G:  Never mind . 
G:  I 'm just trying to figure out , you know , when Morgan 's voice appears on someone 's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him ? 
G:  Cuz I mean I haven't been putting it in 
G:  and  in by  
G:  Right . 
G:  I have not . 
G:  And  
G:  Well it 
G:  I mean they 're on th right , these , 
G:  but I just hadn't ever been putting it in the Key files . 
G:  And I don't think Chuck was either 
G:  cuz  
G:  Oh , so we 're both sorry . 
G:  So  
G:  OK . 
G:  OK . 
G:  OK . 
G:  So if  
G:  Right . Well I  I just realized I hadn't been doing it 
G:  and probably  So  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Right . 
G:  I know  
G:  Yeah , I usually delete the  
G:  I don't , 
G:  maybe I forgot to d 
G:  But it 's almost  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  And I was  I was looking at Chuck 's , like , " oh what did Chuck do , 
G:  OK I 'll do that " . 
G:  So . 
G:  Uh  
G:  We will do better . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  I mean  
G:  I think  
G:  there 's also  
G:  there 's this use that  
G:  the  
G:  Well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wanna make an X 
G:  and you don't wanna take notes 
G:  and you 're  you just wanna 
G:  get the summary of the transcript from this time location 
G:  like  you know , and  and then while you 're bored you don't do anything 
G:  and once in a while , maybe there 's a joke and you put a X 
G:  and   But  
G:  in  in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way . 
G:  Also with  I was thinking and I know Morgan disagrees with me on this 
G:  but suppose you have a group in here and you wanna let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not wanna distribute in terms of content , 
G:  they could just sort of make an X near that point 
G:  or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c could get some red flags in that transcript region 
G:  and they can then look at it . 
G:  So . 
G:  I know we haven't been using it 
G:  but I w I can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods 
G:  which you then get back in a transcript 
G:  so . 
G:  Right . 
G:  And you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful , 
G:  so . 

G:  Well , could we keep one of these things for another year ? 
G:  Would h I mean is there a big cau 
G:  just  just in case we  
G:  even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate 
G:  uh f just there 's a bunch of things that might be neat to do 
G:  but I  it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure 
G:  but we could at least try it out . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Yeah I don't think it has to be part of a what everybody does in a meeting 
G:  but it might be a useful , neat part of the project 
G:  that we can , you know , show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time 
G:  that happen that you just wanna make a note of , 
G:  like what Jane was talking about 
G:  with some later browsing , just  just as a convenience , 
G:  even if it 's not a full - blown note taking substitute . 
G:  So what kind of input would you be  ? 
G:  You 'd just be pressing like a  a  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
G:  Yeah , 
G:  that be good . 
G:  M 
G:  right . 
G:  That would be fine too . 
G:  I mean , I don't have , you know , grandiose ideas in mind 
G:  but I 'm just sort of thinking well we 've  we 're getting into the next year now 
G:  and we have a lot of these things worked out at  in terms of the speech 
G:  maybe somebody will be interested in this 
G:  and  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Or like this is my " I 'm supposed to do this " kind of button , 
G:  like " I better remember to  " 
G:  Yeah 
G:  something like that 
G:  or  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  W 
G:  Yeah , yeah . 
G:  Well it also  it 's maybe realistic cuz people are supposed to be bringing their P D As to the meeting eventually , 
G:  right ? 
G:  That 's why we have this little  
G:  I don't know what  I don't wanna cause more work for anyone 
G:  but I can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it 
G:  and so if we don't have to return it 
G:  and we can keep it for a year  
G:  I don't know . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  We c 
G:  One would probably be fine . 
G:  Maybe we could do like a student project , 
G:  you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool . 
G:  Well , I 'm  yeah , that 's not a bad  
G:  Jeremy 's gonna be an  he 's a new student starting on modeling brea breath and laughter , actually , 
G:  which sounds funny 
G:  but I think it should be cool , 
G:  so . 
G:  OK . 
G:  " Ha - ha - ha . " 
G:  You 're  you 're gonna tease me ? 
G:  OK . 
G:  Great . 
G:  That 's a very philosophical statement from Morgan . 
G:  I just  it 's sort of a anachronism , 
G:  I mean it 's like  
G:  It 's great . 
G:  We could do simultaneous . 
G:  Initiate him . 
G:  Well , I 'm just thinking , are you gonna try to save the data before this next group comes in ? 
G:  Yeah , so we might wanna do it simultaneous . 
G:  Right , so  
G:  so we might n we might need to do that actually . 
G:  You have to plug your ears , by the way uh Eric , 
G:  or  
G:  or you start laughing .
