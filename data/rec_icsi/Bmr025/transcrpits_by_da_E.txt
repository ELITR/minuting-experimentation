E:  OK , alright . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Well what you need  
E:  All you need to do is say to Dan " gee it would be nice if this worked under Autoconf " and it 'll be done in a day . 
E:  Right ? 
E:  Right . 
E:  I  I  I wouldn't be surprised . 
E:  What I  
E:  James Christie . 
E:  Steve Renals is not SoftSound , 
E:  is he ? 
E:  Steve wro i it 's Ste - Steve Renals wrote THISL IR . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Here 's a  here 's a crazy idea  actually . 
E:  Why don't you try and merge  Transcriber  and THISL IR ? 
E:  They 're both Tcl interfaces . 
E:  Right . 
E:  And then you get  they  then you get the Windows media playing for free . 
E:  Right . But the point is that the Transcriber uses Snack and then you can  but you can use a  a lot of the same functionality 
E:  and it 's  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Well my thought was is that it would be nice  it would be nice to have the running transcripts um eh you know , from speaker to speaker . 
E:  Right ? 
E:  Do you have  you have , you know , a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here ? 
E:  Right . Well that  eh my thought was if you had like Multitrans or whatever do it . 
E:  Or whatever . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Exactly . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  I thought you guys were gonna burn C Ds ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I see . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Alright . 
E:  Why  
E:  Right . 
E:  Well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a PDA with a wireless card . 
E:  And  and that way you can synchronize very easily with the  the  the meeting 
E:  because you 'll be synchroni you can synchronize with the  the Linux server 
E:  and uh  
E:  so  so , I mean , if you 're not worried about  
E:  Well  well you have a PDA 
E:  and may and you could have the same sort of X interface or whatever , 
E:  I mean , you 'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it . 
E:  But you could imagine , 
E:  I mean , if  if all you really wanted was  you didn't want this secondary note - taking channel 
E:  but just sort of being able to use m markers of some sort , 
E:  a PDA with a l a wireless card would be the  probably the right way to go . 
E:  I mean even buttons you could do , 
E:  sort of , 
E:  I mean , as you said . 
E:  Right . 
E:  The transfer function is less errorful , 
E:  yes . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Alright . 
E:  This is  
E:  Yes , this is number two for me today . 
E:  Oh . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK , alright .
