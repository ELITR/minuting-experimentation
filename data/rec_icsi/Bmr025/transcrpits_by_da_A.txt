A:  Yeah . 
A:  I can do that quickly . 
A:  Um I hired several more transcribers , 
A:  They 're making great progress . 
A:  Seve - several , several . 
A:  And uh  
A:  and uh , 
A:  uh I 've been uh finishing up the uh double checking . 
A:  I hoped to have had that done by today 
A:  but it 's gonna take one more week . 
A:  Certainly . 
A:  Yeah I mean , it 's in the same place it 's been . 
A:  Uh - huh . No change . 
A:  Uh  Yes . Uh - huh . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  These are separate from the ones that  
A:  I mean , these are  
A:  Excellent . 
A:  Good . 
A:  Excellent . 
A:  Hm - mmm . 
A:  I  Can I ask a question ? 
A:  So um as it stands within the  the Channeltrans interface , it 's possible to do a find and a play . 
A:  You can find a searched string and play . 
A:  So e Are you  So you 're adding like um , I don't know , uh are they fuzzy matches or are they  uh  ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  It 's a lot more sophisticated than the uh the basically Windows - based  
A:  OK . 
A:  Hm - mmm . 
A:  Good . 
A:  At some point we 're gonna have to say what that private joke is , 
A:  that keeps coming up . 
A:  Wow . 
A:  It 's amazing . 
A:  Can I ask one more thing about THISL ? 
A:  So with the IR stuff then you end up with a somewhat prioritized um  ? 
A:  Excellent . 
A:  Excellent . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Ah . 
A:  Well bu 
A:  Isn't it always on the digits ? 
A:  Isn't it always on the digits forms ? 
A:  It would be nice if  if these had little light indicators , 
A:  little L E Ds for  
A:  Yeah , a buzzer . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Actually  
A:  Hmm . 
A:  I do have uh uh  It 's a different topic . Can I add one top topic ? 
A:  We have time ? 
A:  I wanted to ask , 
A:  I know that uh that Thilo you were , um , bringing the Channeltrans interface onto the Windows machine ? 
A:  And I wanted to know is th 
A:  It 's all done ? That 's g wonderful . Great . 
A:  Does  and that  does that mean , I  
A:  maybe I should know this but I don't . 
A:  Does this mean that the  that this could be por uh ported to a Think - Pad note or some other type of uh  
A:  Wonderful . 
A:  Wonderful . 
A:  We used them once . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Couple times . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  And I have  uh so my  my feeling on it is that I think in principle it 's a really nice idea , 
A:  and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . 
A:  On the other hand , I  the down side for me was that I think the pen is really noisy . 
A:  So you have ka kaplunk , kaplunk , kaplunk . 
A:  And I  and I don't know if it 's audible on the  
A:  but I  I sort of thought that was a disadvantage . 
A:  I do take notes , 
A:  I mean , I could be taking notes on these things 
A:  and I guess the plus with the CrossPads would be the time markings 
A:  but  
A:  I don't know . 
A:  Could  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Well I did it one time 
A:  but um  
A:  u but I guess the  the other thing I 'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing I wonder if we 'd lose that much by having someone be a scribe 
A:  by listening to the tape , to the recording afterwards 
A:  and taking notes in some other interface . 
A:  Oh it 's la it 's useful , 
A:  have a summary and high points . 
A:  Well . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Well when  when I d 
A:  OK . 
A:  w Mm - hmm . 
A:  There is an alternative . 
A:  There is an alternative , 
A:  I mean , it 's still , there 's uh  you know , your point stands about there be  needing to be an infrastructure , 
A:  but it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock 's timer on it . 
A:  You c I mean , I  when I  when I did it I synchronized it by voice , 
A:  by whispering " one , two , three , four " onto the microphone 
A:  and uh , you know . 
A:  Yeah , it 's transcribed . 
A:  It 's in the transcript . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well it 's in the transcript . 
A:  I like this PDA idea . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  And then  
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Well , and not just for you . 
A:  But it 's also , it has this problem of having to go from an analog to a d a digital record too , 
A:  doesn't it ? 
A:  I mean  
A:  But I mean , say , if i if  if you 're writing  if you 're writing notes in it does  it  it can't do handwriting recognition , 
A:  right ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  I  I guess what I 'm thinking is that the PDA solution you h you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a  to a  
A:  I mean  
A:  Oh , nicely put . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Yeah .
