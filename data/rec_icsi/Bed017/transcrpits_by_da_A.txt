A:  Uh , right , right . 
A:  Why ? 
A:  No , cuz she already told me it , before she told you . 
A:  Oh , well , it doesn't matter what time . 
A:  Well maybe she hadn't just started transcribing me yet . 
A:  Anyway . 
A:  I beg to differ . 
A:  But you have to say something genuinely funny before you 'll get an example . 
A:  No , it 's a different laugh . 
A:  Ooh , wow ! 
A:  Wow . Whoa ! 
A:  Uh . 
A:  Sorry . 
A:  Hi . Hi . 
A:  So when you said " Andreas " I thought you were talking about Stolcke . 
A:  Now I know that we aren't , 
A:  OK . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Of course . 
A:  That 's good . 
A:  That 's definitely a job for artificial intelligence . 
A:  Except for humans can't really solve it either , so . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  And then you can blame the computer . 
A:  So . 
A:  That should be one of them . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  And so some of the  I don't know how much you know about the larger Heidelberg project , 
A:  I  Are you  
A:  So it seems like a lot of  some of the issues are the same . 
A:  It 's like , um , you know , the c context - based factors that influence how you interpret , 
A:  um , s how to interpret . 
A:  In  in this case , infer in in knowing  wanting to know what kinds of things to ask . 
A:  We - we 've kind of talked about that , 
A:  but we haven't worried too much about that end of the discourse . 
A:  But maybe you guys had that in the previous models . 
A:  Documents that have the answers . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  So you also don't have to figure out what the content is . 
A:  You 're just taking the keywords as a topic text , 
A:  as  
A:  OK . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mmm , 
A:  mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  So , you 're not  
A:  I guess I 'm trying to figure out how  how it maps to the kinds of things that we 've talked about in this group , and , actually associated groups , 
A:  cuz some of us do pretty detailed linguistic analyses , 
A:  and I 'm guessing that you  you won't be doing that ? 
A:  OK . 
A:  Just checking . 
A:  So , <laugh> OK . 
A:  So , you take the query , and  and  
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Well , he had other things to do . 
A:  The uh  
A:  The other person I thought of is Dan Gildea ? 
A:  because he did some work on topic spotting 
A:  w um , which is , I mean , you  I mean . I don't  Depending on how well you wanna integrate with that end , 
A:  you know , like , taking the data and fig you said the learning systems that figure out  
A:  We  There 's someone in ICSI who actually has been working on  has worked on that kinda stuff , 
A:  and he 's worked with frame net , 
A:  so you could talk to him about , you know , both of those things at once . 
A:  So . 
A:  And he just finished writing a draft of his thesis . 
A:  So . 
A:  I u <laugh> Dan Gildea , GILDEA . 
A:  And , he 's in one of the rooms on the fifth floor and stuff , 
A:  and  
A:  Hmm . 
A:  Well , if you fal solve the problem , <laugh> hope you can do one for us too . 
A:  Talk about changing the topic . 
A:  At least this is a private meeting . 
A:  Right , exactly , 
A:  OK , that 's the link . 
A:  Mmm . Definitely . 
A:  But for adults and not for the children . 
A:  Uh - huh . 
A:  Oh .
