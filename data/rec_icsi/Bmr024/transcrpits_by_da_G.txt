G:  Oh . 
G:  Well  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Maybe the  start of your speech and the end of it , 
G:  or stuff like that . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Actually , I had a question about that . 
G:  If you find that you can <mouth> lower the false alarms that you get where there 's no speech , that would be useful  for us to know . 
G:  So , um  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  So , <clears throat> r right now you get f fal you know , false  false , uh , speech regions when it 's just like , um , <inbreath> breath or something like that , 
G:  and I 'd be interested to know the  wha if you retrain 
G:  um , 
G:  do those actually go down or not ? 
G:  Because  of  
G:  Yeah , just to see if by doing nothing in the modeling of  just having that training data wh what happens . 
G:  So did they actually save the far - field  data ? 
G:  Cuz at first they weren't  they weren't sa 
G:  OK . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Or  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Right . 
G:  Nnn . 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Maybe we can have him vary the microphones , too , 
G:  or they 're different s speakers . 
G:  What if we just give it a  a name like we give these meetings a name ? 
G:  And then later on some people will consider it a meeting and some people won't , 
G:  and  
G:  Just give it a <breath> title . 
G:  Can we just have a directory called , like , " other stuff " ? 
G:  And  
G:  Well  or , I dunno . 
G:  And  <laugh> and just , um , store it there . 
G:  I mean  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  Like  
G:  But we have like thirty  you know , from  ten years ago ? 
G:  No . 
G:  Yeah ! 
G:  Ten years ago . 
G:  Ninety - one , 
G:  and they 're still all fine . 
G:  Uh , both . 
G:  I 've burned them and they 're still OK . 
G:  I mean , usually they 're  
G:  That 's what I  
G:  See  
G:  Yeah . 
G:  H everytime it was a " gonna "  " gonna die " . 
G:  Just before they be before it goes bad , it burns them in . 
G:  Ah . 
G:  But  
G:  So , who 's gonna do these back - ups ? 
G:  The people that collect it ? 
G:  Well , s 
G:  Yeah . 
G:  That 's what I 'm wondering , 
G:  if  
G:  OK . 
G:  I mean , you don't have to physically put a tape in the drive ? 
G:  Or s ? 
G:  s ?  Oh , OK . 
G:  So it 's just  
G:  Oh , OK . 
G:  But not at the same time . 
G:  What about if the times overlap with the normal back - up time ? 
G:  OK . 
G:  OK . 
G:  Lift the Herve approach . 
G:  Well , let 's just say that men are simple . 
G:  I 'm well rehearsed . 
G:  Is there less training data ? 
G:  I mean , we don 
G:  This is on just digits ? 
G:  Oh , sorry . 
G:  OK . 
G:  This is on  
G:  Oh , OK . 
G:  Well , what 's the standard  ? 
G:  Yeah , so I thought the performance was actually a little better on females than males . 
G:  Right . 
G:  I 'm just wondering if that  if  if you have any indication of your standard features , 
G:  you know , if that 's also different  or in the same direction or not . 
G:  Cuz  
G:  Oh .
