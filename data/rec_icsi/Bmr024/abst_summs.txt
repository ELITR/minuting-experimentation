abst_sum - abstract: This meeting mainly outlines the progress of the meeting recorder project.

D:  Well , maybe uh , since that  that was a pretty short one , maybe we should talk about the IBM transcription status . 
F:  So , we , uh  we did another version of the beeps , where we separated each beeps with a spoken digit . 
A:  I  I hire  I 've hired two extra people already , expect to hire two more . 
A:  which are now being edited by my head transcriber , <breath> in terms of spelling errors and all that . 
A:  She 's also checking through and mar and  <breath> and monitoring , um , the transcription of another transcriber . 
A:  And  and you indicated to me that we have a g a goal now , <breath> for the  for the , um , <click> <breath> the , uh , DARPA demo , of twenty hours . 
A:  So , I 'm gonna go up to twenty hours , be sure that everything gets processed , and released , and    and that 's  that 's what my goal is . 
D:  But I guess the other thing is that , um , that  that 's kinda twenty hours ASAP because the longer before the demo we actually have the twenty hours , the more time it 'll be for people to actually do cool things with it . 
D:  Yeah , I mean , I guess the  So the difference if  if , um , if the IBM stuff works out , the difference in the job would be that they p primarily would be checking through things that were already done by someone else ? 
abst_sum - abstract: In particular, the group discuss their preparation of materials for the transcriptions of digits by IBM, and also the human transcribers who are working towards preparing the set of 20 for the DARPA meeting.

B:  N I 'm successfully , uh , increasing the error rate . 
D:  We 've always viewed it , anyway , as the major difference between the two , is actually in the smoothing , 
D:  that the  that the , um , <inbreath> PLP , and  and the reason PLP has been advantageous in , uh , slightly noisy situations is because , <inbreath> PLP does the smoothing at the end by an auto - regressive model , 
abst_sum - abstract: Other discussion focuses on the re-evaluation of recognition without cheating on segmentation, and also how SRI recognition can be improved, especially for the female group.

F:  and the , uh  Porzel  and the , uh , SmartKom group are collecting some dialogues . 
D:  I mean , I don't care what directory tree you have it under . 
F:  Well , but  but , <mouth> I put it under the same directory tree . 
F:  and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction , rather than another type of interaction . 
F:  We 're about  we 're about half  halfway through our disk right now . 
A:  Well , but you can have it NW archive to  you can have , <inbreath> uh , a non - backed - up disk NW archived , 
abst_sum - abstract: A number of issues regarding the management of data are addressed by the group:

F:  and the , uh  Porzel  and the , uh , SmartKom group are collecting some dialogues . 
D:  It 's just that it 's , you know , different directory , it 's called something different , it 's  
F:  and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction , rather than another type of interaction . 
D:  I mean , I don't care what directory tree you have it under . 
F:  Well , but  but , <mouth> I put it under the same directory tree . 
F:  We 're about  we 're about half  halfway through our disk right now . 
A:  Well , but you can have it NW archive to  you can have , <inbreath> uh , a non - backed - up disk NW archived , 
abst_sum - abstract: The inclusion of different data types in the corpus, and the storage and back-up of the group's data.

D:  but  but , uh , probably , if we had to pick something  that we would talk on for ten minutes or so while they 're coming here . Or I guess it would be , you think , reorganization status , 
F:  I mean , I think , Chuck was the one who added out the agenda item . 
F:  I don't really have anything to say other than that we still haven't done it . 
F:  So , naming conventions and things like that , that I 've been trying to keep actually up to date . 
F:  And I 've been sharing them with U - d UW folks also . 
abst_sum - abstract: Progress has been made in naming conventions, with file reorganisation to be done at a later date, however this was not discussed fully due to Chuck's absence.

D:  So , is there something quick about Absinthe  that you  ? 
F:  and got <mouth> <inbreath> a speedup roughly proportional to the number of processors times the clock cycle . 
F:  But the  what it means is that it 's likely that for net training and forward passes , we 'll  Absinthe will be a good machine . 
F:  Especially if we get a few more processors and upgrade the processors . 
abst_sum - abstract: Finally, Absinthe is now up and running with improved performance.

D:  So I guess the other thing that we were gonna talk about is  is , uh , demo . 
D:  And , um , so , these are the demos for the  uh , July , uh , meeting  and , um  DARPA mee 
D:  but maybe , uh  maybe we 'll just put that off for now , given that  
D:  But I think maybe we should have a  a sub - meeting , 
D:  I think , uh , probably , uh , Adam and  and , uh , Chuck and me should talk about  should get together and talk about that sometime soon . 
abst_sum - abstract: Discussion of demos for the July DARPA meeting were left to the individuals concerned.

F:  and the , uh  Porzel  and the , uh , SmartKom group are collecting some dialogues . 
D:  I mean , I don't care what directory tree you have it under . 
F:  Well , but  but , <mouth> I put it under the same directory tree . 
F:  and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction , rather than another type of interaction . 
abst_sum - decisions: A number of data issues were resolved:

F:  and the , uh  Porzel  and the , uh , SmartKom group are collecting some dialogues . 
F:  Basically they have one person sitting in here , looking at a picture , and a wizard sitting in another room somewhere . 
F:  And , uh , they 're doing a travel task . 
F:  but it starts where the wizard is pretending to be a computer and it goes through a , uh , <breath> speech generation system . 
F:  Should this be part of the corpus or not ? 
F:  And my attitude was yes , because there might be people who are using this corpus for  acoustics , as opposed to just for language . 
I:  We simulate a computer breakdown halfway through the session , and so then after that , the person 's told that they 're now talking to a , uh  to a human . 
F:  But of course they don't know that it 's the same person both times . 
F:  and I said , " well that 's silly , if  if we 're gonna try to do it for a corpus , there might be people who are interested in acoustics . " 
D:  I  I would not say it was part of the meetings corpus . 
F:  So it 's  It  it  I guess it  the  begs the question of what is the meeting corpus . 
D:  I think it 's  I  I think  I th think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key . 
F:  Well , this has two or more people conversing with each other . 
F:  we give everyone who 's involved as their own user ID , give it session I Ds , <inbreath> let all the tools that handle Meeting Recorder handle it , or do we wanna special case it ? 
I:  Well , it  it makes sense to handle it with the same infrastructure , since we don't want to duplicate things unnecessarily . 
I:  But as far as distributing it , we shouldn't label it as part of this meeting corpus . 
A:  Because we have , like , meetings that have a reason . 
A:  And  and those  and this sounds like it 's more of an experimental setup . 
D:  It 's scenario - based , it 's  it 's human - computer interface  <inbreath> it 's really pretty different . 
D:  It 's just that it 's , you know , different directory , it 's called something different , it 's  
F:  and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction , rather than another type of interaction . 
D:  Well , I don I wouldn't call reading digits " meetings " . 
F:  Well , but  but , <mouth> I put it under the same directory tree . 
D:  I mean , I don't care what directory tree you have it under . 
abst_sum - decisions: After discussing the human-computer interaction Smartkom data, the group decide that different types of data can be included in the meeting corpus, but that it should be structured into different directories according to data type.

A:  Well , but you can have it NW archive to  you can have , <inbreath> uh , a non - backed - up disk NW archived , 
abst_sum - decisions: Some of the data storage problems can be overcome by backing up using the NW archive.

A:  And I  and I think a crucial part of that is the idea of  of not wanting to do it until right before the next level zero back - up so that there won't be huge number of  of added , 
abst_sum - decisions: However, file reorganisation will be left until just before zero-level back up.

F:  Um , or we could try some automated methods . 
F:  And my  my tendency right now is , well , if IBM comes back with this meeting and the transcript is good , just let them do it . 
D:  Yeah , I mean , I guess the  So the difference if  if , um , if the IBM stuff works out , the difference in the job would be that they p primarily would be checking through things that were already done by someone else ? 
F:  We could let IBM transcribe it . 
abst_sum - decisions: The group decide to use IBM transcription of the digits, in addition to automatic methods.

D:  Yeah , I mean , I guess the  So the difference if  if , um , if the IBM stuff works out , the difference in the job would be that they p primarily would be checking through things that were already done by someone else ? 
abst_sum - decisions: If IBM methods work, transcribers will check and comment these.

D:  but maybe , uh  maybe we 'll just put that off for now , given that  
abst_sum - decisions: Discussion of demos for the July meeting has been postponed: the individuals concerned will meet independently.

F:  We 're about  we 're about half  halfway through our disk right now . 
F:  So , once everything gets converted over to the disks we 're supposed to be using we 'll be probably , uh , seventy - five percent . 
F:  I 'm much more concerned about the backed - up . 
I:  What about putting the stuff on , like , C - CD - ROM or DVD or something ? 
F:  I mean , when I say two or three years what I 'm saying is that I have had disks which are gone in a year . 
F:  But , uh  I  I  you don't want to per p have your only copy on a media that fails . 
I:  So  so how about putting them on that plus , like on a  on  on DAT or some other medium that isn't risky ? 
F:  ICSI already has a perfectly good tape system and it 's more reliable . 
F:  So for archiving , we 'll just use tape . 
F:  But even without that , the back - up system is becoming saturated . 
I:  But  but this back - up system is smart enough to figure out that something hasn't changed and doesn't need to be  backed - up again . 
A:  Well , but you can have it NW archive to  you can have , <inbreath> uh , a non - backed - up disk NW archived , 
abst_sum - problems: Disk space is an issue for the group, especially in terms of back-up, which is 75% full: DVDs or CDs are unreliable and cannot be used, and although tape is reliable, this creates access issues.

B:  N I 'm successfully , uh , increasing the error rate . 
B:  So , I mean I 'm just playing with , um , the number of Gaussians that we use in the  the recognizer , and  
I:  Well , you have to sa you have to  tell people that you 're  you 're doing  you 're trying the tandem features . 
I:  A and I 'm still tinkering with the PLP features . 
I:  That was  that was before I tried it on the females . 
I:  we had reached the point where ,  um , on the male portion of the  development set , the , um  or one of the development sets , I should say  <inbreath> the , um  the male error rate with , uh , ICSI PLP features was pretty much identical with , uh , SRI features . 
I:  Um , and the test data is CallHome and Switchboard . 
I:  Oh , and plus the  the vocal tract  length normalization didn't  actually made things worse . 
I:  So something 's really seriously wrong . 
D:  So  but you see , now , between  between the males and the females , there 's certainly a much bigger difference in the scaling range , than there is , say , just within the males . 
I:  d so the one thing that I then tried was to put in the low - pass filter , which we have in the  
I:  So , most  most Hub - five systems actually band - limit the  uh , at about , uh , thirty - seven hundred , um , hertz . 
I:  Although , you know , normally , I mean , the channel goes to four  four thousand . 
I:  Um  and it didn't hurt on the males either . 
I:  Oh , and suddenly , also the v the vocal tract length normalization only in the test se on the test data . 
I:  maybe between one and two percent , um , for the females . 
I:  We 're looking at the discrepancy between the SRI system and the SRI system when trained with ICSI features . 
D:  Or maybe  or maybe you 're doing one too many . 
I:  No , but with Baum - Welch , there shouldn't be an over - fitting issue , really . 
abst_sum - problems: Experimentation with the SRI recognition have shown greater error when using tandem features, with vocal tract normalisation also making results worse.

I:  That was  that was before I tried it on the females . 
I:  we had reached the point where ,  um , on the male portion of the  development set , the , um  or one of the development sets , I should say  <inbreath> the , um  the male error rate with , uh , ICSI PLP features was pretty much identical with , uh , SRI features . 
D:  So  but you see , now , between  between the males and the females , there 's certainly a much bigger difference in the scaling range , than there is , say , just within the males . 
I:  d so the one thing that I then tried was to put in the low - pass filter , which we have in the  
I:  Um  and it didn't hurt on the males either . 
I:  Oh , and suddenly , also the v the vocal tract length normalization only in the test se on the test data . 
I:  maybe between one and two percent , um , for the females . 
I:  We 're looking at the discrepancy between the SRI system and the SRI system when trained with ICSI features . 
D:  Or maybe  or maybe you 're doing one too many . 
I:  No , but with Baum - Welch , there shouldn't be an over - fitting issue , really . 
abst_sum - problems: In particular more error is found with the female group which is 1-2% worse than the males.
