E:  Oops . 
E:  The data . 
E:  The data which we are collecting here . 
E:  Data ? 
E:  The SmartKom data ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  And also the SmartKom thing should b 
E:  And we have done that on the  automatic segmentations . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Into two pieces . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  I recognize that , too . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Some latency or something . 
E:  Yeah ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  They are not transcribed yet . 
E:  So . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Ch 
E:  So  
E:  And how do we find the transcripts for those so that  ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  The references for  for  those segments ? 
E:  It 's not that  
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  So , basically you give some time constraints for  for the references and for  for the hypothesis , 
E:  and  
E:  Yeah , OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I 'm just in progress of  of doing that . 
E:  So . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So , it 's basically  
E:  s 
E:  I think , eight meetings or something which  which I 'm using , 
E:  and , <inbreath> it 's  <breath> before it was twenty minutes of one meeting . 
E:  So  should  be a little bit better . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  But  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  We 'll see that . 
E:  There were the false alarms . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I 'll  can make  an can , like , make a c comparison of  of the old system to the  to the new one , 
E:  and  then  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Actually , it 's changed to a synthesis for  for the first part now . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  It 's a human operator . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yes . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  No . 
E:  projector  We were not saying we are not  doing it . 
E:  We wer we just wanted to do  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  The English system ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  B 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  But  but I 'm not sure about the legal aspect of  of that . 
E:  Is  is there some contract with SmartKom or something about the data ? 
E:  What they  
E:  or , is  is that our data which we are collecting here , 
E:  or  ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  So . 
E:  OK . 
E:  So . Yeah , th th that was the question . 
E:  If  if  ? 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Basically . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  So . 
E:  It  it  it  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Transcription is done in Munich . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  You can do that if you want . 
E:  Non - back - up . 
E:  Yeah .
