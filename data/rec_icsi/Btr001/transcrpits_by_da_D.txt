D:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
D:  One thing that I remember being really difficult at the beginning and it got easier as we went along was , um , acronyms and technical terms . 
D:  Um , because there are so many 
D:  and  it 's a field that I 'm not really l very  
D:  I don't know , 
D:  I don't know very much about this kind of stuff  
D:  computers and speech recognition . 
D:  I 've never taken classes on it or anything , 
D:  so . I found that really hard . 
D:  And I remember transcribing and having a bunch of  
D:  You know , every five words there 'd be something I 'd put in parentheses cuz I didn't know what it was . 
D:  So . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , 
D:  but it 's definitely gotten easier because the same things keep getting repeated , 
D:  once you learn what it is , and you can say , " OK I know what they meant by that " 
D:  or " I know how to spell that now " 
D:  or something like that . 
D:  And the Cast of Characters that you put up on the Web was helpful 
D:  also . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Especially when describing like the set - up in this room , also , and the different types of mikes . 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  And it 's hard to tell when people are talking relatively quickly . 
D:  They just glide over some of the letters . 
D:  They don't fully pronounce them . 
D:  So you can't really tell even if you listen to it ten times @ @  what it is . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Even though I still don't know what they are . 
D:  I mean , I assume they 're microphones of some sort , 
D:  but that 's all . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  About the microphone ? 
D:  I can't remember . 
D:  I mean he 's e 
D:  he  he said that they were designed for a specific sized head ? 
D:  Right ? 
D:  And so if  if your head happened to be that size , then you were fine 
D:  and if it w was bigger , then it was like torture , 
D:  o or  I don't know . 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  Oh , yeah . 
D:  Oh , it doesn't look so bad , 
D:  but , I guess it depends really . 
D:  Hm - hmm . 
D:  That 's interesting . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  For me I found the Spanish speakers to be the hardest . 
D:  And the German speakers I found a little bit easier , 
D:  and I thought maybe that was because I had  I took German for a semester and I 've had exposure to German , 
D:  um , because I had a lot of friends who were really into Germany and German language 
D:  and  
D:  But  
D:  And I found that I could  
D:  if they were pronouncing something in a certain way I could say , " Oh well that 's just the German way of pronouncing this " 
D:  and then I figured out what they were saying . 
D:  um , but with the Spanish speakers it was  
D:  I 've never taken Spanish , 
D:  and even though I 've taken French , and I speak French fairly well , um , I found the Spanish to be much harder 
D:  and  maybe also because the level of fluency for the Spanish speakers was a little bit less than the level of fluency of the German speakers that are here ? 
D:  I think 
D:  There was a couple of different Spanish speakers . 
D:  Huh , that 's really interesting . 
D:  I think so , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , he was hard . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And you got to know his pronunciation of them . 
D:  I remember , yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I remember that . 
D:  And  and m eh the way he said " mixed " was really strange , too . 
D:  " Miss - ed " or somethi 
D:  yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  He  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Especially because also in the beginning meetings , I mean , he 'd say something and no one in the meeting would understand , 
D:  and then everyone would say , " What was that again ? " 
D:  and then they 'd pronounce it in English 
D:  and so I could figure out what it was 
D:  that way . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Like his English fluency got better ? 
D:  Oh , I went crazy . 
D:  I  I would skip doing that portion for as long as I could 
D:  because i I just couldn't deal with it , 
D:  and  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And they won't know . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I have no idea about Spain , 
D:  but I know that in France for example Parisian French is much easier for me to understand 
D:  cuz I learned it 
D:  versus France in like Marseilles or in the south or in like the provin like <mouth> the  villages in the south , 
D:  it 's really hard to understand . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Much different . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  And  
D:  isn't it Catalan ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That 's really good . 
D:  Yeah , 
D:  cuz that 's definitely something that I wouldn't have be able to do . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  There were problems even with , um , Am - English speakers though . 
D:  I mean , not in their level of fluency , obviously , 
D:  but in  
D:  Some people tend to mumble , 
D:  and  
D:  and it 's hard to catch what it is 
D:  is , cuz it goes by really quickly 
D:  and you can't really tell 
D:  and  
D:  That too . 
D:  That too . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Or just  
D:  I don't know . 
D:  And some people tend to get interrupted more , 
D:  I know that 's not something that the person themselves can control 
D:  but  
D:  um  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Especially when they 're  when you  were using the l the mikes that weren't m headmounted mikes . 
D:  And there was input from other people on the same channel as the person who was talking . 
D:  And that was really hard to deal with . 
D:  Oh , yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , 
D:  absolutely . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  No , it was one like  one ribbon for everybody 
D:  and you had to kind of  
D:  you could switch signals , 
D:  like you could listen to a different one , 
D:  but you couldn't really  
D:  Well could you ? 
D:  Did  we didn't do that very much . 
D:  You couldn't visually do it , 
D:  no . 
D:  And f 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And it was very hard to be precise about it , 
D:  and it was very hard to tell  
D:  I had so much trouble at the very beginning trying to figure out who was who . 
D:  Cuz there 's m so many men and so few women . 
D:  The women were easy to f figure out who was who , 
D:  and then the men  all their voices sounded the same 
D:  except I think there was one British English speaker 
D:  and that was easy 
D:  but 
D:  Eh .   Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  An easier time ? 
D:  That 's possible . 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  It 's interesting . 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , but it definitely got much better when that change happened . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Oh , yeah . 
D:  That took a l 
D:  E No .  It just took time . Yeah . 
D:  Me too , 
D:  yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , that happens a lot . 
D:  Then to have it be cut off . 
D:  I thought  
D:  Shrink in them or whatever , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  Of breath or of uh  nothing ? 
D:  Hmm , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  With fricatives a lot . 
D:  Although I found one in  actually I was just working right before this meeting ,  one where someone said , " great " 
D:  and 
D:  the  the G  it was pronounced as a K 
D:  so it was unvoiced 
D:  and then part of the R was cut off in the beginning . 
D:  And then 
D:  you  It sounded like " great " 
D:  if you just listened to that time bin it still sounded like " great " . 
D:  But if you listened to right before it you could hear a little the  the K or whatever and a little bit of the R . 
D:  So  
D:  I don't know . 
D:  Usually it 's not  
D:  usually that doesn't happen 
D:  but this time it did . 
D:  Or " sss " . 
D:  Or  
D:  But it 's not completely blocking the airflow . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mmm , yeah . 
D:  Oh it does . 
D:  Completely . 
D:  Yeah , 
D:  I  I don't remember the words exactly . 
D:  It 's a shame . 
D:  There was one that was a whole sentence was broken up in the middle , and there was a little like millisecond of break in the middle . 
D:  And 
D:  if you connected it all together , it completely changed what was right before it and what was right after <mike spike> it . 
D:  It was written as something else , 
D:  and then it became a word together from what was before and after 
D:  and then with this little tiny millisecond pause . 
D:  So I guess  I don't know . I mean , I guess when we talk in between different segments of the word maybe ,  there 's pauses somehow , 
D:  I guess  
D:  or the  you can  
D:  Yeah , 
D:  or something like that . 
D:  It 's probably like inaudible for us 
D:  but  
D:  And maybe the pause was just so short that it made up a pause . 
D:  I don't  is  it  That doesn't make any sense , 
D:  but . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  On purpose , though . 
D:  Or not . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah , that is true . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  How it was really pronounced ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  I always get confused with the pronunciation convention . 
D:  I get confused with pronunciation , like when there 's a strange pronunciation that I wanna mark . 
D:  Because I think w 
D:  m may di in the beginning did we do the strange pronunciation and then write PRN and what it really was meant to be ? 
D:  And now we 're doing the normal word and then inside the brackets what it sounded like ? 
D:  We did a switch , right ? 
D:  Or not . 
D:  I don't know if it 's just me that 's confused or if it was swi 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
D:  So the convention as it stands now is write the word as it is normally conventionally spelled in English with the little <mouth> apostrophe , or whatever you call it , 
D:  and then " PRN " , 
D:  how it 's pronounced . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  OK . 
D:  He does it a lot . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Or " a "  versus " a " . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  There 's a study done on when people say " uh " and when people say " um " . 
D:  Also , there 's contec in concet contextual variation , 
D:  and it 's predictable apparently , 
D:  I haven't read the  
D:  It 's really interesting . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  You know , what 's  On that sort of similar topic , I just thought of something that 's been hard for me sometimes , is you can have a pronunciation of  of the word " a "  as " a " . 
D:  And then you can have " uh " like a pause or whatever as " uh " , 
D:  and sometimes it 's hard to tell what the person meant . 
D:  Are  did they mean " uh " like they 're pausing 
D:  or did they mean " a " like " a person " ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And 
D:  you can kind of tell from the context 
D:  but sometimes it 's hard , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Like you can't tell , 
D:  mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  A few . 
D:  It 's really  
D:  yeah , 
D:  relatively rare . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I mean I can only think of like two or three occasions where I sat and thought about it for a while . 
D:  Other times just you figure  you look at it and what 's the context . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  It 's OK , 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  This time is fine for me . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Then you don't have to rush . 
D:  Hnh - nn . 
D:  Mistreat ? Oh ! 
D:  You know what we could do ? 
D:  We could just ask the  someone like the front desk person or Lila to like set aside a little bit for us . 
D:  Yeah , so we 'll survive . 
D:  That 's fine too . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah , 
D:  mm - hmm . 
D:  And they put paren 
D:  um , not parentheses . 
D:  What 's it called ? 
D:  Punctuation after brackets . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  No it doesn't to me either 
D:  but . 
D:  No . 
D:  No . 
D:  I didn't either . 
D:  I think it was a little bit faster than just transcribing it , 
D:  but I definitely saw a lot of  
D:  there was a lot of errors that are not in the Tigerfish ones . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And they just have better intuitions , or I don't know what but , about what 's said . 
D:  If it says " TF " . 
D:  Yeah , and we had to split them up . 
D:  Where they have li 
D:  Yeah , but they 're not like  
D:  they 're not huge huge , though . 
D:  Really ? 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  But they don't have that option . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And they don't  
D:  One person doesn't listen to all the channels of one meeting , 
D:  right ? 
D:  So they can't get clues from the other channels ? 
D:  Or can they ? 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Oh , OK . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  As there are slots in the pre - segmentation . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Oh , wow . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  God , it must take them a really long time to do these . 
D:  That 's amazing . 
D:  It sounds so hard . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Leak their secrets ? 
D:  Well , I  
D:  I definitely prefer not doing the transcript 
D:  I mean , I liked transcribing  because I felt like I was much closer to the data 
D:  and I had a lot more ideas ,  like you were saying , hypotheses of what 's going on 
D:  and  
D:  but it took a really long time and I 'd get frustrated with it . 
D:  And I think that I would lose my  
D:  I don't know , 
D:  I would not be as thorough , 
D:  not be as careful . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  It was more personal . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  You don't tend to notice as much I don't think at checking as you do transcribing , 
D:  because it 's already there 
D:  so you don't have to pay as much attention . 
D:  And time bin corrections and things , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  One thing that 's annoying I think with checking is that a lot of times in the meetings you tend to have one or two people who talk a lot and the rest of the people just sit there until it 's their turn to give their little report or whatever . 
D:  And yet you have to check the channels for if they did backchannels or if they did other things that you need to encode that weren't on the pre - segmenter . 
D:  But sometimes it 's not visually easy . 
D:  And so 
D:  I 'm  
D:  Sometime I debate with myself whether it 's really worth it to sit there and listen to the whole thing  or risk missing a little bit and doing it visually . 
D:  It 's hard to decide sometimes . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And s 
D:  Yeah , 
D:  that 's the thing . 
D:  i that 's the thing that makes it harder sometimes . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  You mean the transcribers ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And even bigger things . 
D:  I mean you 've  said things that weren't caught on the pre - segmenter , 
D:  like whispers , kind of . 
D:  Just like , " Oh , that 's interesting " , 
D:  or something like that . 
D:  Yeah , 
D:  you 're about to s speak . 
D:  But then they don't . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And sometimes even laughs . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  I don't either . 
D:  M but , I mean I don't take them out if they 're already there . 
D:  I don't  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  But it 's a laugh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And you can  
D:  And everyone else is laughing , 
D:  and then the other person is like " ha - ha " 
D:  but it 's not a actual laugh , 
D:  but like  
D:  I don't know how you do it , 
D:  you know ? 
D:  Oh yeah , 
D:  mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  You mean in between the segments that they did transcribe ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That 's where you f tend to find  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  It 's  it depends on the person , 
D:  I mean , some people don't tend to do  aren't that involved in the meeting , or something , 
D:  and they don't tend to say as much , 
D:  um , m backchannels or whatever . 
D:  And some people  
D:  I mean  
D:  I remember <laugh> transcribing one person , 
D:  all they did was clear their throat and breathe . 
D:  And then read digits 
D:  and then it was like the end of the meeting . 
D:  So . 
D:  But then some people tend to  
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  But then there are some people who are  Even if they 're not actually speaking , you can tell they 're more involved or interested or something , 
D:  cuz they 're always , " Mm - hmm , oh yeah , really , mm - hmm "  Um , reacting . Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  I remember from the very beginning , I would go to tea and start recognizing voices . 
D:  And like turn around and be like , " Wait , that person doesn't look anything like I imagined them . " 
D:  a eh  
D:  Nnn . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Nn - mm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  She always tends to get interrupted . 
D:  It 's  really makes it a lot nicer to transcribe 
D:  because there can be a lot of heated discussions about these very technical issues 
D:  and people will have their opinions 
D:  and , you know  
D:  And then you can  
D:  It 's really nice to have a little bit of humor , 
D:  a little bit of break away from that 
D:  because it 's hard to sit there and li see  like , " But , don't you see h you 're being rude to this person , you 're cutting off this person 
D:  and it 's not nice ? " 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  You definitely get an image of  
D:  uh  Especially if you can relate it to what the person  or y what you assume the person is uh interested in academically . 
D:  It 's really  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And there was a whole set of meetings that are like that . 
D:  It  Wasn't there ? 
D:  Yeah , 
D:  those were really hard . 
D:  Really hard . 
D:  Yeah , 
D:  and it 's hard  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  U no . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  What would be the point of that ? 
D:  Oh . 
D:  I think that would be really interesting . 
D:  Right . 
D:  That 'd be kinda creepy . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  That 's good . 
D:  That 's OK . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  It 's OK . 
D:  I had something that I could bring up . 
D:  Um , 
D:  as far as ideas about looking at the data and getting ideas about whatever you said  hypotheses about how to figure it out . 
D:  One thing that I  I 'm  you probably don't remember this  that I was really interested in is the use of " so " and the use of " or " . 
D:  Because the way people use it in these meetings , I found , was  
D:  I don't know if it was  it  if it 's different than other people . 
D:  I don't know if it 's a computer speech thing . 
D:  I mean , computer people speech thing , 
D:  but um , 
D:  people tend to end utterances quite often with " so " or " or " and trailing off . 
D:  Yeah , 
D:  mm - hmm . 
D:  And I found that really interesting , 
D:  and I was curious to  to figure out when that happened , 
D:  if it happened in certain occasions and whatever , 
D:  and I never really got around to it , 
D:  but . 
D:  It didn't sound stran 
D:  I mean , it doesn't sound like bizarre enough that I don't understand . 
D:  But I don't think it 's something that happens in just everyday speech really . 
D:  Really ? 
D:  Really ? 
D:  Huh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Like that you 're flexible ? 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah , but it tends to happen  
D:  I mean , " so " tends to happen when the person brings up a new idea that kind of goes against what the other people is saying . 
D:  Or at least that 's what I found . 
D:  Like if someone in a meeting is talking about a certain thing and someone kind of interrupts or doesn't necessarily interrupt and says something  either a new topic or a different take on the same topic will tend to use  will trail off with " so " . 
D:  Yeah , 
D:  kind of , 
D:  yeah , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And " or " tends to be used with questions more than  So . 
D:  But . 
D:  I thought that was really interesting . 
D:  When you end the utterance . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  I 'd definitely like to look more at that if I can , 
D:  but . 
D:  Oh , yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  " But I 'm not really sure 
D:  so you can  you could finish my thought . " 
D:  It 's a different kind of shrug though . 
D:  I think it shows less of confident  like less confidence in what they just said 
D:  in a way . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  More similar than to " so " I think . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Or maybe it 's just a link to get back to the conversation or something ? 
D:  Like to connect it with what is going on elsewhere ? 
D:  Oh , like kind of  kind of laughing with it 
D:  in a way ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Maybe it means that . 
D:  Uh . 
D:  Maybe if  maybe it 's when people don't laugh enough or something . 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Giving them permission to  
D:  I don't know about permission . 
D:  To keep going with the meeting . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Cuz sometimes you can get on digressions that just last for like minutes at a time . 
D:  And people are just hysterical 
D:  and they 're like , " What were we talking about ? 
D:  I don't know " .
