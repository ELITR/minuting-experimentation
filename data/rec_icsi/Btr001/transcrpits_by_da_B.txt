B:  OK .

B:  Hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Hmm .

B:  Seems like I always have to cut off pads at the end . 
B:  I don't have so much problem at the beginning , 
B:  but . 
B:  No , of n just nothing . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Unlike like a " tuh " or a " kuh " that just stops . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Oh . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  I don't think I ever have . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  They used to . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  I didn't get one either . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Oh wow . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm .

B:  I kinda did too . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Hmm .

B:  Hmm . 
B:  Mmm .

B:  " So , you can see you might be wrong , 
B:  but I don't want to actually say that . " 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Hm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Mmm .

B:  Mmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  We  we are meant to be transcribing if they 're just left in the  the curly brackets ? 
B:  And sometimes they don't . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Oh . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Oh , I see . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Oh , can I ask also ? 
B:  Um , it says  it looks like the groupings are important , 
B:  but some of the transcripts I 've seen they don't have any commas or breaks , 
B:  it 's just a string of numbers . 
B:  So we should be adding the breaks if  
B:  Oh , OK . 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  But if you can clearly hear pauses and there 've not been transcribed , we should be adding the commas or not ? 
B:  Though the one I 'm working on now is like that . 
B:  OK . 
B:  It was hard ! 
B:  It is . 
B:  OK .
