E:  OK , we 're on . 
G:  <tapping on mike> 
B:  OK . <inbreath> 
E:  So , I mean , everyone who 's on the wireless check that they 're on . 
F:  C we  
G:  Alright . 
C:  I see . 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  <mike noise> Yeah . 
E:  OK , our agenda was quite short . <breath> 
B:  <inbreath> Oh , could you  close the door , maybe ? Yeah . 
E:  Sure . Two items , which was , uh , 
E:  digits and possibly stuff on  on , uh , forced alignment , which Jane said that Liz and Andreas had in information on , but they didn't , so . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> @ @  <inbreath> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  I guess the only other thing , uh , for which I  
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  We should do that second , because Liz might join us in time for that . 
E:  OK . 
B:  Um . OK , so there 's digits , alignments , and , um , 
B:  I guess the other thing , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  which I came unprepared for , uh , <laugh> 
B:  is , uh , to dis s s see if there 's anything anybody wants to discuss about the Saturday meeting . 
E:  Right . 
B:  <breath> 
B:  So . 
B:  Any  I mean , maybe not . 
E:  Digits and alignments . <laugh> 
B:  <sniff> 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  But  
F:  Talk about aligning people 's schedules . <laugh> 
B:  Uh . 
G:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . <laugh> 
E:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm .  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> 
F:  <breath> 
B:  Yeah . I mean  Right . Yeah , I mean , it was  
E:  <mouth> Yeah , it 's forced alignment of people 's schedules . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Yeah . If we 're very  <laugh> 
D:  Forced align .  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . <breath> 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  With  with  whatever it was , a month and a half or something ahead of time , the only time we could find in common  roughly in common , was on a Saturday . 
G:  <mike noise> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> Ugh . 
E:  Yep . 
F:  <breath> It 's pretty sad . Yeah . 
C:  <mouth> <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah . 
C:  Have  Have we thought about having a conference call to include him in more of  <laugh> in more of the meeting ? 
C:  I  I mean , I don't know , if we had the  if we had the telephone on the table  
G:  <mike noise> 
B:  No . But , h I mean , he probably has to go do something . Right ? <outbreath> 
F:  No , actually I  I have to  I have to shuttle  kids from various places to various other places . 
C:  I see . 
C:  OK . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> Yeah . 
F:  So . And I don't have  and I don't , um , have a cell phone so I can't be having a conference call while driving . 
D:  A cell phone ? 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  No .  It 's not good . That 's not good . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  R r right . So we have to  we  
G:  <laugh> 
F:  Plus , it would make for interesting noise  background noise . 
B:  @ @  
I:  <laugh>  
B:  <laugh> So we have to equip him with a  with a  <laugh> with a head - mounted , uh , cell phone and  <laugh> 
E:  Yep . 
G:  <laugh> 
F:  Uh  <breath> 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  Ye - we and we 'd have to force you to read lots and lots of digits , so it could get real  <laugh> real car noise . <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
F:  Oh , yeah .  Oh , yeah . 
I:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  <laugh> Take advantage . <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
G:  <mike noise> 
C:  <breath-laugh> <mike noise> 
D:  And with the kids in the background . Yeah . 
F:  I 'll let  I 'd let  
F:  I let , uh , my five - year - old have a try at the digits , eh . <mouth> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	opening


E:  <mouth> So , anyway , I can talk about digits . Um , did everyone get the results or shall I go over them again ? 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  <mouth> 
E:  The other thing is , isn't TI - digits isolated digits ? 
F:  Right . 
E:  Or is that another one ? I 'm  I looked through a bunch of the digits t corp corpora , and now they 're all blurring . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Cuz one of them was literally people reading a single digit . 
F:  <clears throat> 
E:  And then others were connected digits . 
B:  Yeah . Most of TI - digits is connected digits , I think . The  I mean , we had a Bellcore corpus that we were using . It was  
E:  OK . 
E:  Maybe it 's the Bell Gram . 
B:  <inbreath> that 's  that was isolated digits . 
E:  Bell Digits . 
E:  Alright . 
F:  <outbreath> Mm - hmm . 
C:  <inbreath> 
topic_description:	adaptation - digit recognition


E:  I mean that it was basically  the only thing that was even slightly surprising was that the lapel did so well . 
E:  Um , and in retrospect that 's not as surprising 
E:  as maybe i 
E:  it shouldn't have been as surprising as I  as  as I felt it was .  <laugh> 
E:  The lapel mike is a very high - quality microphone . <inbreath> 
E:  And as Morgan pointed out , that there are actually some advantages to it in terms of breath noises and clothes rustling  if no one else is talking . 
F:  Exactly . 
D:  Yeah . 
G:  Mm - hmm .  
E:  Um , so , uh  
G:  It 's g it  
B:  Well , it 's  Yeah , sort of the bre the breath noises and the mouth clicks and so forth like that , the lapel 's gonna be better on . <inbreath> 
D:  Or the cross - talk . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  The lapel is typically worse on the  on clothes rustling , but if no one 's rustling their clothes , 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  Right . I mean , a lot of people are just sort of leaning over and reading the digits , so it 's  it 's a very 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  it 's  it 's  
E:  different task than sort of the natural . So . 
D:  Yeah .  You don't move much during reading digits , I think . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
G:  Probably the fact that it picks up other people 's speakers  other people 's talking is an indication of that it  the fact it is a good microphone . 
D:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . Right . 
B:  Right . So in the digits , in most  most cases , there weren't other people talking . So . 
G:  So . 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  D do the lapel mikes have any directionality to them ? 
G:  <mike noise> 
C:  <mike noise> 
B:  <mouth> There typically don't , no . 
F:  Because I  I suppose you could make some that have sort of  that you have to orient towards 
F:  your mouth , and then it would  
C:  <mike noise> 
E:  <inbreath> They have a little bit , but they 're not noise - cancelling . So , uh  
B:  <inbreath> They 're  they 're intended to be omni - directional . 
E:  Right . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  And th it 's  and because you don't know how people are gonna put them on , you know . 
G:  <mike noise> 
E:  Right . 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  <inbreath> So , also , Andreas , on that one the  
E:  the back part of it should be right against your head . 
E:  And that will he keep it from flopping aro up and down as much . 
F:  It is against my head . 
E:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> 
topic_description:	microphone choice


B:  Um . Yeah , we actually talked about this in the , uh , front - end meeting this morning , too . 
E:  Uh - huh . <laugh> 
B:  Much the same thing , and  and it was  
B:  <inbreath> 
G:  <mike noise> 
B:  uh , I mean , there the point of interest to the group was primarily that , um , 
B:  <inbreath> the , uh  the system that we had that was based on H T K , that 's used by , you know ,  all the participants in Aurora , 
E:  Everybody . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  was so much worse 
B:  <inbreath> than the  than the S R I . And the interesting thing is that even though , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  yes , it 's a digits task and that 's a relatively small number of words and 
B:  there 's a bunch of digits that you train on , 
B:  <inbreath> it 's just not as good 
C:  <mike noise> 
B:  as having a  a l very large amount of data and training up a  a  a nice good big <inbreath> 
B:  HMM . Um , also you had the adaptation in the SRI system , which we didn't have in this . <inbreath> 
B:  Um . So . 
G:  <mike noise> 
B:  Um . 
F:  And we know  
F:  Di - did I send you some results without adaptation ? 
E:  No . Or if you did , I didn't include them , cuz it was  
B:  <noise> 
B:  <mouth> I s I think Stephane , uh , had seen them . So  
F:  Yeah , I think I did , actually . 
F:  So there was a significant loss from not doing the adaptation . 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  Um . 
F:  A  a  a couple percent or some I mean  
F:  Well , I don't know it  Overall  
C:  <mike noise> 
F:  Uh , I  I don't remember , but there was  <adjusts mike> there was a significant , 
F:  um , 
F:  loss or win  from adaptation  with  with adaptation . 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  And , um , <breath> <mouth> 
F:  that was the phone - loop adaptation . And then there was a very small  
F:  like point one percent on the natives  uh , win from doing , 
F:  um , 
F:  you know , adaptation to  the recognition hypotheses . 
F:  And  I tried both means adaptation and means and variances , and the variances added another  or subtracted another point one percent . So , <inbreath> 
F:  it 's , um  that 's the number there . Point six , I believe , is what you get with 
E:  Right . 
F:  both , uh , means and variance adaptation . 
B:  <mouth> 
B:  But I think one thing is that , uh , I would presume  
B:  Hav - Have you ever t <inbreath> 
B:  Have you ever tried this exact same recognizer out on the actual TI - digits test set ? 
F:  This exact same recognizer ? No . 
B:  <inbreath> It might be interesting to do that . Cuz my  my  cuz my sense , 
B:  <inbreath> um  <outbreath> 
F:  <mouth> But  but , I have  I mean , people  people at SRI are actually working on digits . 
E:  I bet it would do even slightly better . 
F:  I could  and they are using a system that 's , 
F:  um  
F:  you know , h is actually trained on digits , <breath> 
F:  um , but h h otherwise uses the same , 
B:  <inbreath>  
F:  you know , decoder , the same , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  uh , training 
F:  methods , and so forth , and I could ask them what they get  on TI - digits . <outbreath> 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah , bu although I 'd be  I think it 'd be interesting to just take this exact actual system so that these numbers were comparable and try it out on TI - digits . 
F:  Mm - hmm . Well , Adam knows how to run it , so you just 
B:  <inbreath> 
E:  Yeah . No problem . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Cuz our sense from the other  from the Aurora , uh , task is that  I mean , cuz we were getting sub one percent 
F:  make a f 
E:  And try it with TI - digits ? 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <inbreath> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  numbers on TI - digits also with the tandem thing . So , <inbreath> 
F:  Mmm . 
B:  one  so there were a number of things we noted from this . One is , yeah , the SRI system is a lot better than the HTK  
F:  Hmm . 
B:  <inbreath> this , you know , very limited training HTK system . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
topic_description:	SRI adaptation


B:  <inbreath> Uh , but the other is that , um , the digits 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  recorded here in this room with these close mikes , i uh , are actually a lot harder than the  studio - recording TI - digits . 
B:  <inbreath> I think , you know , one reason for that , uh , might be that there 's still  even though it 's close - talking , there still is some noise and some room acoustics . <inbreath> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <inbreath> 
B:  And another might be that , uh , I 'd  I would presume that in the studio , uh , uh , situation recording read speech that if somebody 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  did something a little funny or n pronounced something a little funny or made a little  that they didn't include it , they made them do it again . 
E:  They didn't include it . 
F:  <breath> 
E:  <inbreath> Whereas , I took out  the ones that I noticed that were blatant  that were correctable . 
F:  <breath> 
B:  Mmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  So that , if someone just read the wrong digit , I corrected it . And then there was another one where Jose 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  <cough> 
E:  couldn't tell whether  I couldn't tell whether he was saying zero or six .  And I asked him and he couldn't tell either . <breath> 
I:  Hmm . 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  So I just cut it out . 
E:  You know , so I just e edited out the first , i uh , word of the utterance . 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  Um , so there 's a little bit of correction but it 's definitely not as clean as TI - digits . 
E:  <inbreath> So my expectations is TI - digits would , especially  
E:  I think TI - digits is all  American English . Right ? So it would probably do even a little better still 
B:  Mm - hmm . <mouth> 
E:  on the SRI system , but we could give it a try . 
F:  Well . But  remember , we 're using a telephone bandwidth front - end here , uh , on this , uh  
F:  on this SRI system , so , 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  um , I was  I thought that maybe that 's actually a good thing because it  it gets rid of some of the  uh , the noises , 
F:  um , you know , in the  
F:  the  below and above the  
B:  <breath> Mm - hmm . 
F:  um , the , 
F:  you know , speech bandwidth and , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  um , 
F:  I suspect that to get sort of the last bit out of these higher - quality recordings you would have to in fact , uh , 
F:  use models that , uh , were trained on wider - band 
F:  data . And of course we can't do that or  
E:  Wha - what 's TI - digits ? I thought t 
B:  It 's wide - band , yeah . It 's  in  in fact , we looked it up and it was actually twenty kilohertz sampling . 
E:  It is wide - band . OK . 
F:  <clears throat> 
E:  Oh , that 's right . I  I did look that up . I couldn't remember whether that was TI - digits or one of the other digit tasks . 
F:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  Yeah . 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  Right . 
F:  But  but , I would  Yeah . It 's  it 's easy enough to try , just run it on  
E:  Mm - hmm . So , Morgan , you 're getting a little breath noise . You might wanna move the mike down a little bit . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  See w 
topic_description:	acoustic differences in data


F:  Now , eh , does  
F:  one  one issue  
F:  one issue with  with that is that <mouth> 
F:  um , the system has this , uh , notion of a speaker to  which is used in adaptation , variance norm uh , you know , 
F:  both in , uh , mean and variance normalization and also in 
B:  <mike noise> 
C:  <mike noise> 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  the VTL  estimation . So  
E:  Yeah , I noticed the script that extracted it . 
F:  Do y ? 
F:  Is  ? 
F:  So does  so th so does  does , um , <mouth> 
F:  the TI - digits database have speakers that are known ? 
E:  Yep .  Yep . 
F:  And is there  is there enough data or a comparable  comparable amount of data to  to what we have in our recordings here ? 
E:  <mouth> That I don't know . 
E:  I don't know . 
E:  I don't know how many speakers there are , 
B:  <inbreath> 
E:  and  and how many speakers per utterance . 
F:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> Well , the other thing would be to do it without the adaptation and compare to these numbers without the adaptation . 
B:  That would  
F:  Right . Uh , but I 'm not so much worried about the adaptation , actually , than  than the , um , <mouth> 
F:  um  
F:  the , uh , 
F:  VTL estimation . 
D:  <outbreath> 
F:  If you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating the  
E:  Right . 
F:  the warping , uh , factor . So , um  
E:  <mouth> 
E:  I strongly suspect that they have more speakers than we do . 
F:  Right . But it 's not the amount of speakers , it 's the num it 's the amount of data per speaker . 
E:  So , uh  
E:  Right . So we  we could probably do an extraction that was roughly equivalent . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Right . 
F:  So  
E:  Um . 
E:  So , although I  I sort of know how to run it , there are a little  a f few details here and there that I 'll have to  dig out . 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  OK . The key  
F:  So th the system actually 
F:  extracts the speaker ID from the waveform names . 
E:  Right . I saw that . 
F:  And there 's a  there 's a script  and that is actually all in one script . So there 's this one script that parses waveform names 
B:  <mike noise> 
F:  and extracts things like the , um , speaker , 
F:  uh , ID or something that can stand in as a speaker ID . So , 
C:  <mike noise> 
F:  we might have to modify that script to recognize the , um , speakers , 
E:  Right . 
F:  <inbreath> um , in the  in the , uh , um , <mouth> TI - digits  database . 
C:  <mike noise> 
E:  Right . 
E:  And that , uh  
F:  <mouth> Or you can fake  you can 
F:  fake  names for these waveforms that resemble the names that we use here for the  for the meetings . 
E:  Right . <laugh> 
F:  That would be the , sort of  probably the safest way to do  
E:  I might have to do that anyway to  to do  because we may have to do an extract to get the  amount of data per speaker about right . 
F:  Uh - huh . 
topic_description:	multiple speaker recognition


F:  By the way , I think we can improve these numbers if we care to compr improve them 
B:  Um . 
F:  <inbreath> by , um , <mouth> not starting with the Switchboard models but by taking the Switchboard models and doing supervised adaptation 
F:  on a small amount of digit data collected 
E:  Yep . 
F:  in this setting . 
F:  Because that would adapt your models to the room acoustics and f for the far - field microphones , you know , to the noise . <breath> 
F:  And that should really improve things , um , further . 
F:  And then you use those adapted models , which are not speaker adapted but sort of acous you know , channel adapted  
E:  Channel adapted . 
F:  use that as the starting models for your speaker adaptation . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> But the thing is , uh  I mean , w when you  
G:  <mike noise> 
B:  it depends whether you 're ju were just using this as a  
B:  <inbreath> a starter task for  you know , to get things going for conversational or if we 're really interested i in connected digits . And I  I think the answer is both . 
B:  <inbreath> And for  for connected digits over the telephone you don't actually want to put a whole lot of effort into adaptation because 
F:  Well , I don't know . 
B:  <inbreath> somebody  gets on the phone and says a number and then you just want it . 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  This is  this  that one 's better . Mm - hmm .   
B:  You don't  don't , uh  
F:  <mouth> 
F:  Right . Um , but , you know , I  uh , my impression was that you were actually interested in the far - field microphone , 
F:  uh , problem , I mean . So , 
B:  <mouth> 
F:  you want to  you want to  That 's the obvious thing to try . Right ? Then , eh  because 
A:  <mike noise, as she puts on headphone> 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  Oh . Oh .  
B:  Right . 
F:  you  you don't have any  That 's where the most m acoustic mismatch is between the currently used models and the  the r the set up here . So . 
C:  Yeah .  
A:  <mike noise> 
B:  Right . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah . So that 'd be anoth another interesting data point . I mean , I  I guess I 'm saying I don't know if we 'd want to do that as the

D:  <laugh> 
C:  <inbreath> 
A:  <mike noise>

C:  Yeah . 
E:  Uh , it pivots . 
C:  <inbreath> So if you see the picture  and then you have to scr 
F:  I I  
E:  It  it  like this . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  I  I already adjusted this a number of times . I  I 
D:  <laugh> 
E:  Eh . Yeah , I think these mikes are not working as well as I would like . 
F:  can't quite seem to  
F:  Yeah , I think this contraption around your head is not  working so well . 
B:  Too many adju too many adjustments . Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Anyway , what I was saying is that I  I think I probably wouldn't want to see that as sort of like the norm , that we compared all things to .  
C:  That looks good . Yeah .  
B:  To , uh , the  to have  have all this ad all this , uh , adaptation . 
B:  <inbreath> But I think it 's an important data point , 
B:  if you 're  if  Yeah . 
F:  Right . 
B:  <inbreath> Um . 
B:  <mouth> The other thing that  that , uh  of course , 
B:  what Barry was looking at was  was just that , the near versus far . And , yeah , the adaptation would get 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  th some of that . But , I think even  even if there was , uh , only a factor of two or something , like I was saying in the email , I think that 's  <inbreath> 
B:  that 's a big factor . So  <inbreath> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  <mouth> 
E:  Liz , you could also just use the other mike if you 're having problems with that one . 
B:  N 
C:  Well . 
A:  OK .  
C:  Yeah . This would be OK . We  we  we think that this has spikes on it , so it 's not as good acoustically , but  
H:  <mike noise> 
A:  It 's this thing 's  This is too big for my head .  
F:  Yeah , basically your ears are too big . I mean , mine are too .

A:  Right . I already  tried to get it close . 
C:  Good . 
E:  So if it doesn't bounce around too much , that 's actually good placement . 
F:  <outbreath> 
A:  OK .  <laugh> 
E:  <inbreath> 
C:  That looks good . 
E:  But it looks like it 's gonna bounce a lot . 
B:  <laugh>

C:  Yeah . <outbreath> 
E:  Digits . Adaptation . 
B:  Uh , adaptation , non - adaptation , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  um , factor of two , 
B:  um  
F:  What k u By the way , wh what factor of two did you  ? I mean  
topic_description:	adaptation - digit recognition


B:  Oh , yeah . I know what I was go w 
B:  Oh , no , no . It 's tha that  that we were saying , you know , well is  how much worse is far than near , you know . And I mean it depends on which one you 're looking at , but for the everybody , it 's 
F:  <outbreath> 
F:  Oh , th OK . That factor of two . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  little under a factor or two . <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah . I  I know what I was thinking was that maybe , uh , 
B:  i i 
B:  we 
B:  could actually t t try at least looking at , uh , some of the  the large vocabulary speech from a far microphone , at least from the good one . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  I mean , before I thought we 'd get , you know , a hundred and fifty percent error or something , but if  <inbreath> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  if , uh  if we 're getting 
B:  thirty - five , forty percent or something , 
B:  <inbreath> 
A:  Actually if you run , 
B:  u um  
A:  though , on a close - talking mike over the whole meeting , during all those silences , you get , like , four hundred percent word error . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <mouth> Right . I understand . But doing the same kind of limited thing  
A:  Or  or some high number . <laugh> 
B:  Yeah , sure . Get all these insertions . But I 'm saying if you do the same kind of limited thing 
A:  Yeah . 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  <inbreath> as people have done in Switchboard evaluations or as  a 
A:  Where you know who the speaker is and there 's no overlap ? 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  And you do just the far - field for those regions ? 
B:  Yeah . The same sort of numbers that we got those graphs from . Right ? 
E:  Could we do exactly the same thing that we 're doing now , but do it with a far - field mike ? 
B:  Yeah , do it with one of  on 
E:  Cuz we extract the times from the near - field mike , but you use the acoustics from the far - field mike . 
A:  Right . I understand that . I just meant that  so you have  three choices . There 's , um  
A:  You can use times 
A:  where that person is talking only from the transcripts but the segmentations were  
A:  were synchronized . Or you can do a forced alignment on the close - talking 
G:  <mike noise> 
A:  to determine that , the you know , within this segment , these really were the times that this person was talking and 
A:  elsewhere in the segment other people are overlapping and just front - end those pieces . 
A:  Or you can run it on the whole data , which is  
B:  <mouth> 
B:  But  but  but how did we get the  how did we determine 
A:  which is , you know , a  
B:  the links , 
B:  uh , that we 're testing on 
B:  in the stuff we reported ? 
A:  In the H L T paper we took  segments that are channel  time - aligned , which is now h being changed in the transcription process , which is good , 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  and we took cases where the transcribers said there was only one person talking here , because no one else had time  
G:  <mike noise> 
A:  any words in that segment and called that " non - overlap " . 
B:  And tha 
B:  And that 's what we were getting those numbers from . Right . 
A:  Yes . 
A:  Tho - good  the good numbers . The bad numbers were from  the segments where there was overlap . 
B:  <inbreath> Well , we could start with the good ones . But anyway  so I think that we should try it once with <inbreath> 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  the same conditions that were used to create those , and in those same segments just use one of the P Z Ms . 
G:  <mike noise> 
A:  Right . So we  we can do that . Yeah . 
B:  And then , you know , I mean , the thing is if we were getting , uh  what , thirty - five , forty percent , something like that on  on that particular set , 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  <outbreath> 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  uh , does it go to seventy or eighty ? Or , does it use up so much memory we can't decode it ? 
A:  Right . 
C:  <mike noise> 
B:  <inbreath> 
A:  It might also depend on which speaker th it is and how close they are to the PZM ? I don't know how different they are from each other . 
B:  Uh  
F:  You want to probably choose the PZM channel that is closest to the speaker . 
A:  To be best  
E:  <inbreath> For this particular digit ones , I just picked that one . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  f 
B:  Well  
A:  OK . So we would then use that one , too , or  ? 
F:  Oh , OK . 
E:  So  
B:  <inbreath> This is kind of central . 
B:  You know , it 's  so i but I would  I 'd pick that one . It 'll be less good for some people than for other , but I  I 'd like to see it on the same  exact same data set that  that we did the other thing on . Right ? 
H:  <cough> 
E:  Actually  
E:  I sh actually should 've picked a different one , because  that could be why the PDA is worse . 
E:  Because it 's further away from most of the people reading digits . 
D:  It 's further away . Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  That 's probably one of the reasons . 
C:  Hmm . 
B:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Well , yeah . You could look at , I guess , that PZM or something . 
E:  Yep . 
B:  <inbreath> But the other is , it 's very , uh  I mean , even though there 's  I 'm sure the f f 
B:  the  the SRI , uh , front - end has some kind of pre - emphasis , it 's  it 's , uh  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <inbreath> still , th it 's picking up lots of low - frequency energy . So , even discriminating against it , I 'm sure some of it 's getting through . 
B:  Um . 
B:  But , yeah , you 're right . Prob - a part of it is just the distance . 
A:  And aren't these pretty bad microphones ? 
B:  <inbreath> Well , they 're bad . 
E:  Yep . 
A:  I mean  
B:  <laugh> But , I mean , if you listen to it , it sounds OK . You know ? 
E:  <laugh> 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  Yeah . When you listen to it , 
B:  u Yeah . <outbreath> 
E:  uh , the PZM and the PDA  Yeah , th the PDA has higher sound floor but not by a lot . It 's really pretty  
E:  uh , pretty much the same . 
A:  I just remember you saying you got them to be cheap on purpose . 
B:  <inbreath> 
A:  Cheap in terms of their quality . So . 
B:  Well , they 're  twenty - five cents or so . Yeah . <laugh> 
E:  Th - we wanted them to be  to be typical of what would be in a PDA . So they are  
A:  Mm - hmm .  
E:  they 're not the PZM three hundred dollar type . They 're the twenty - five cent , 
E:  <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah . 
E:  buy them in packs of thousand type . <breath-laugh> 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <mouth> 
F:  <outbreath> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  But , I mean , the thing is people use those little mikes for everything because they 're really not bad . 
A:  I see . 
H:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  Everything . 
A:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  I mean , if you 're not 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  doing something ridiculous like feeding it to a speech recognizer , they  they  <breath-laugh> they  you know , you can hear the sou hear the sounds just fine .  You know , it 's  
G:  <laugh> 
I:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Right . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  They  I mean , i it 's more or less the same principles as these other mikes are built under , it 's just that  there 's less quality control . 
B:  They just , you know , churn them out and don't check them . 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  Um . 
B:  So . 
H:  <cough> 
B:  So that was  Yeah . So that was i interesting result . So like I said , the front - end guys are 
B:  very much interested in  in this is as  as well and 
topic_description:	far v near microphone


F:  So  so , but where is this now ? I mean , what 's  where do we go from here ? I mean , 
E:  Yeah . That was gonna be my question . 
F:  we  so we have a  we have a  a system that works pretty well but it 's not , you know , the system that 
F:  people here are used to using  to working with . So what  what do we do now ? 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Well , I think what we wanna do is we want to  eh , and we 've talked about this in other  contexts  we want to <inbreath> 
B:  have the ability to feed it different features . 
F:  Mm - hmm . OK . 
B:  And then , um , <inbreath> 
H:  <mike noise> 
B:  from the point of view of the front - end research , it would be s uh , substituting for HTK . 
F:  <clears throat> <mike noise> 
F:  OK . 
B:  I think that 's the key thing . And then if we can feed it different features , then we can try all the different things that we 're trying there . <inbreath> 
F:  OK . 
F:  Alright . 
B:  And then , um , 
B:  uh , also Dave is  is thinking about 
B:  using the data in different ways , uh , to 
F:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  um , 
B:  uh , 
B:  explicitly work on reverberation starting with some techniques that some other people have  found somewhat useful , and  Yeah . 
F:  OK . 
F:  So  so the key  thing that 's missing here is basically the 
F:  ability to feed , 
F:  you know , other features <outbreath> i into the recognizer and also then to train the system . 
B:  Right . 
B:  Right . 
F:  OK . And , uh , es I don't know when Chuck will be back but that 's exactly what he  he 's gonna  
B:  <mouth> H h 
B:  He 's  he 's sort of back , but he drove for fourteen hours an and wasn't gonna make it in today . <laugh> 
F:  Oh , OK . So , 
F:  I think that 's one of the things that he said he would be working on . Um . 
F:  Just sort of t to make sure that  we can do that and  
E:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  Um . 
B:  Right . 
F:  It 's  uh , I mean , the  the front - end is f i tha that 's in the SRI recognizer is very nice in that it 
H:  <cough> 
F:  does a lot of things on the fly but it unfortunately  is not  designed and , um  <mouth> like the , uh , ICSI system is , where you can feed it 
F:  from a pipeline of  of the command . So , 
F:  the  what that means probably for the foreseeable future is that 
F:  you have to , uh , dump out , um  
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  you know , if you want to use some new features , you have to dump them into 
F:  individual files 
F:  and  give those files to the recognizer . 
E:  We do  we tend to do that anyway . 
F:  OK . 
G:  <mike noise> 
E:  Oh . So , although you  you can pipe it as well , we tend to do it that way because that way you can concentrate on one block and not keep re - doing it over and over . 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  Oh , OK . 
G:  <breath> 
F:  Alright . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . So I 've  I  
E:  So tha that 's exactly what the P - file  is for . 
B:  Yeah . <inbreath> 
F:  <mouth> Yeah , the  the  the cumbersome thing is  is , um  is that you actually have to dump out little  little files . So for each segment that you want to recognize <breath> you have to  dump out  a separate file . 
A:  Uh  
C:  <mike noise> 
E:  Uh - huh . 
F:  Just like i th like th as if there were these waveform segments , but instead you have sort of feature file segments . 
F:  But , you know  <outbreath> 
F:  So . <outbreath> 
B:  <mouth> 
B:  Cool . <outbreath> 
F:  <clears throat> 
topic_description:	integrating features


B:  <mouth> OK . So the s the  the next thing we had on the agenda was something about alignments ? 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Yes , we have  
A:  I don't know , did you wanna talk about it , or  ? 
A:  I can give a  I was just telling this to Jane and  and  
A:  W we  
A:  we were able to get some 
A:  definite improvement on the forced alignments by 
A:  looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors  that were occurring and 
A:  um , 
A:  some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition , which is a 
G:  <mike noise> 
A:  um , 
F:  um , in regions where there was no real speech yet from the foreground speaker . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
topic_description:	alignment


A:  I think was both a  a pruning  problem and 
A:  possibly a 
A:  problem with 
G:  <mike noise> 
A:  needing constraints on word locations . And so we tried both of these st things . We tried saying  
G:  <mike noise> 
A:  I don't know , I got this <outbreath> whacky idea that  
A:  just from looking at the data , that when people talk  their words are usually chunked together . 
A:  It 's not that they say one word 
A:  and then there 's a bunch of words together . 
A:  They 're  might say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just backchannels ? 
A:  But in general , if there 's , like , five or six words and one word 's far away from it , that 's probably wrong on average . So , 
A:  um  
A:  And then also , ca the pruning , of course , was too  too severe . 
F:  <inbreath> So that 's actually interesting . The pruning was the same value that we used for recognition . 
F:  And we had lowered that  we had used tighter pruning after Liz ran some experiments showing that , 
A:  <clears throat> 
F:  you know , it runs slower and there 's no real difference in  
E:  No gain . 
A:  Actually it was better with  slightly better or about th it was the same with tighter pruning . 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  Right . 
F:  So for free recognition , this  the lower pruning value is better . You  
A:  It 's probably cuz the recognition 's just bad en 
A:  at a point where it 's bad enough that  that you don't lose anything . 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  Correct . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Um , but it turned out for  for  to get accurate alignments it was really important to open up the pruning 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  Right .  
F:  significantly . 
B:  Hmm . 
F:  Um  because otherwise it would sort of do greedy alignment , 
topic_description:	pruning


F:  Um , <mouth> so that was one big factor that helped improve things and then the other thing was that , 
F:  you know , as Liz said the  we f enforce 
F:  the fact that , 
F:  uh , the foreground speech has to be continuous . It cannot be  
F:  you cannot have a background speech 
F:  hypothesis in the middle of the foreground speech . You can only have background speech at the beginning and the end . 
A:  Yeah . I mean , yeah , it isn't always true , and I think what we really want is some clever way to do this , where , 
F:  <clears throat> 
A:  um , you know , from the data or from maybe some hand - corrected alignments from transcribers that 
A:  things like 
A:  words that do occur just by themselves  a alone , like backchannels or something that we did allow to have background speech around it  
D:  Yeah . 
C:  <cell phone ringing> Sorry .  <zipper> <cell phone ringing> 
A:  those would be able to do that , but the rest would be constrained . 
A:  So , I think we have a version that 's 
A:  pretty good for the native speakers . I don't know yet about the non - native speakers . 
A:  And , um , 
A:  we basically also made noise models for the different  sort of grouped some of the  mouth noises together . 
A:  Um , so , and then there 's a background speech model . 
A:  And we also  
A:  There was some neat  or , interesting cases , like there 's one meeting where , 
A:  <inbreath> um , Jose 's giving a presentation and he 's talking about , 
A:  um , the word " mixed  signal " and someone didn't understand , 
A:  uh , that you were saying " mixed "  
A:  I think , Morgan . 
H:  <laugh> Yeah , yeah . 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  <inbreath> 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  And so your speech - ch 
F:  <outbreath> 
A:  was s saying something about mixed signal . And the next turn 
A:  was 
A:  a lot of people saying " mixed " , like " he means mixed signal " or " I think it 's mixed " . And the word " mixed " in this segment occurs , like , a bunch of times . 
H:  Sh - 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  And Chuck 's on the lapel here , and he also says " mixed " but it 's at the last one , and of course the aligner th aligns it everywhere else to everybody else 's " mixed " , 
H:  <laugh> Yeah . 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  cuz there 's no adaptation yet . So there 's  <inbreath> 
F:  <outbreath> 
A:  I think there 's some issues about  
A:  u 
A:  We probably want to adapt 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  at least the foreground speaker . But , I guess Andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker , and that 's actually a little bit 
F:  <clears throat> 
A:  of a f funky model . Like , it gives you some weird alignments , just because often the background speakers match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker . So there 's some things there , especially when you get lots of the same words , 
F:  <mouth> Oh  
D:  Yeah . 
H:  Oh . 
A:  uh , occurring in the  
F:  Well , the  
F:  I  I think you can do better by 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  uh , cloning  so we have a reject phone . 
F:  And you  and what we wanted to try with  you know , once we have this paper written and have a little more time , 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  uh , t cloning that reject model and then one copy of it would be adapted to the foreground speaker 
F:  to capture the rejects in the foreground , like fragments and stuff , and the other copy would be adapted to the background speaker . 
F:  <mouth> 
A:  Right . I mean , in general we actually  
F:  And  
A:  Right now the words like  partial words are  reject models 
F:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  and you normally allow those to match to any word . But then the background speech was also a reject model , 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  and so this constraint of not allowing rejects in between  you know , it needs to differentiate between the two . So just sort of working through a bunch of 
H:  <outbreath> 
F:  Right . 
A:  debugging kinds of issues . 
C:  <mechanical sound> 
A:  And another one is turns , like people starting with 
A:  <inbreath> " well I think " and someone else is  " well how about " . So the word " well " is in this  
A:  in this  segment 
A:  multiple times , and as soon as it occurs usually the aligner will try to align it to the first person who says it . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  But then that 
A:  constraint of sort of  
A:  uh , proximity constraint will push it over to the person who really said it in general . 
E:  <mouth> 
E:  Is the proximity constraint a hard constraint , or did you do some sort of probabilistic weighting distance , or  ? 
A:  <outbreath> 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  We  we didn't  No . We  w 
A:  <laugh> Right now it 's a kluge .  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  OK . We  it 's straightforward to actually just have a  a penalty that doesn't 
F:  completely disallows it but discourages it . 
F:  But , um , we just didn't have time to play with , you know , tuning yet another  yet another parameter . <breath> 
E:  The ve level . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  And really the reason we can't do it is just that we don't have a  we don't have ground truth for these . So , 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  we would need a hand - marked , um , <mouth> word - level alignments or at least sort of the boundaries of the speech betw you know , between the speakers . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  Um , 
F:  and then use that as a reference and tune 
F:  the parameters of the  of the model , uh , to op to get the best  performance . 
B:  <mouth> 
C:  <mouth> <inbreath>  
A:  Yeah . 
topic_description:	background speech


B:  G given  I  I mean , I wa I wa I was gonna ask you anyway , uh , how you assessed that things were better . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  I looked at them . I spent two days  um , in Waves  
B:  OK . 
B:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh , it was painful because 
I:  <laugh> 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  the thing is , you know the alignments share a lot in common , so  
A:  And you 're  yo you 're looking at these segments where there 's a lot of speech . I mean , a lot of them have a lot of words . 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  Not by every speaker but by some speaker there 's a lot of words . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
H:  Ju - <laugh> 
A:  No , not  I mean that if you look at the individual 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <inbreath> Yeah . 
A:  segments from just one person you don't see a lot of words , but altogether you 'll see a lot of words up there . And so the reject is also mapping and pauses  
D:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah .  
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  So I looked at them all in Waves and just lined up all the alignments , 
A:  and , at first it sort of looked like a mess and then the more I looked at it , I thought " OK , well it 's moving these words leftward and  " 
H:  <mike noise> 
A:  You know , it wasn't that bad . It was just doing certain things wrong . So  But , I don't , 
A:  you know , have time to l  to look at all of them and it would be really useful to have , like , a  a transcriber who could use Waves , 
F:  <outbreath> 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  um , just mark , like , the beginning and end 
A:  of the foreground speaker 's real words  like , the beginning of the first word , the end of the last word  and then we could , 
C:  <mouth> <inbreath>  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  I  OK . I have to ask you something , which is , first of all , um , 
A:  you know , do some adjustments .  
C:  is i does it have to be Waves ? Because if we could benefit from what you did , incorporate that into the present transcripts ,  that would help . 
F:  No . 
C:  <inbreath> And then , um , the other thing is , I believe that I did hand 
C:  So . One of these transcripts was gone over by a transcriber and then I hand - marked it myself so that we do have , uh , the beginning and ending of individual utterances . 
F:  Mm - hmm .  
C:  Um , I didn't do it word level , but  but in terms  So I  so for  for one of the N S A groups . And also I went back to the original one that I first transcribed and  and did it 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  w uh , w uh , utterance by utterance for that particular one . So I think you do have  
C:  if that 's a sufficient unit , I think that you do have hand - marking for that . But it 'd be wonderful to be able to 
C:  <inbreath> benefit from your Waves stuff . 
A:  Mm - hmm .  
F:  We don't care what  what tool you use . 
C:  OK . I used it in Transcriber and it 's  it 's in the  
A:  Yeah . I mean , if  if you can , um  if you wanna  well , Jane and I were  
F:  U uh  
A:  just in terms of the tool , talking about this . I guess Sue had had some  reactions . You know , interface - wise if you 're looking at speech , you wanna be able to know really where the words are . And so , 
H:  <mike noise> 
F:  <clears throat> 
C:  Yeah , that 's right . Middle of the word , or  
A:  <inbreath> 
F:  <clears throat> 
A:  we can give you some examples of sort of what this output looks like , um , and see if you can in 
A:  maybe incorporate it into the Transcriber tool some way ,  or  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Well , I th I 'm thinking just ch e e incorporating it into the representation . I mean , if it 's  if it 's  
A:  Um . 
A:  You mean like  Yeah , word start insights . 
C:  if you have start points , if you have , like , time tags , which is what I assume . Isn't that what  what you  ? Well , see , Adam would be  
A:  Right . 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  Yeah , whatever you use . I mean , we convert it to this format 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  that the , um , NIST scoring tool 
F:  unders uh , CTM . 
F:  Conversation Time - Marked file . And  and then that 's the  that 's what the  
E:  I think Transcriber , uh , outputs CTM . 
C:  If it  ? OK . So you would know this more than I would . 
E:  I think so . 
A:  Yeah .  So , I mean  
F:  <breath> Right .  
C:  It seems like she  if she 's g if she 's moving time marks around , since our representation in Transcriber uses time marks , it seems like there should be some way of  of using that  benefitting from that . 
E:  Right . 
A:  Yeah , it wou the advantage would just be that when you brought up a bin you would be able  if you were zoomed in enough 
A:  in Transcriber to see all the words , you would be able to , like , have the words sort of located in time , 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <inbreath> 
B:  <mouth> So  so if we e e even just had a  a  It sounds like w we  
A:  if you wanted to do that . So . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  we almost do . 
B:  Uh , if we  We have two . Yeah . 
C:  We have two . 
B:  <inbreath> Just ha uh , 
B:  trying out  the alignment 
B:  <outbreath> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  procedure that you have on that you could actually get something , um  uh , uh , get an objective measure . 
B:  <inbreath> 
F:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  Uh  
A:  You mean on  on the hand - marked , um  
A:  <inbreath> So we  we only r hav I only looked at actually alignments from one meeting that we chose , I think MR four , just randomly , um  
B:  Yeah . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  And  
F:  Actually , not randomly . We knew  we knew that it had these insertion errors from  Yeah . 
A:  Not randomly  
A:  It had sort of  average recognition performance in a bunch of speakers and 
F:  Yeah . 
A:  it was a Meeting Recorder meeting . 
A:  Um . But , yeah , we should try to use what you have . I did re - run recognition on your new version of 
B:  <mike noise> 
C:  Oh , good . Good ! 
A:  MR one . I  I mean the  the one with Dan  Ellis in it <laugh> and Eric . 
B:  <mike noise> 
C:  Uh - huh . Yeah , exactly . Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  <mouth> I don't think that was the new version . 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  Um  
A:  That  Yeah , actually it wasn't the new new , it was the medium new . But  but we would  we should do the  the latest version . It was the one from last week . 
C:  OK . 
H:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  OK . 
F:  <outbreath> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  Yeah . You  did you adjust the  the utterance times , um , for each channel ? 
C:  Yes . 
C:  Yes , I did . And furthermore , I found that there were a certain number where  
C:  <breath> not  not a lot , but several times I actually <breath> moved an utterance from <inbreath> Adam 's channel to Dan 's or from Dan 's to Adam 's . So there was some speaker identif  
C:  <inbreath> And the reason was because <breath> I transcribed that at a point before  
B:  <inbreath> 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  uh , before we had the multiple audio available f 
C:  so I couldn't switch between the audio . I  I transcribed it off of the mixed channel entirely , which meant in overlaps , I was at a  at a terrific disadvantage . 
A:  Right . Right . 
C:  <inbreath> In addition it was before the channelized , uh , possibility was there . And finally I did it using the speakers of my , um  <breath> 
F:  <outbreath> 
C:  of  you know , off the CPU on my  on my machine cuz I didn't have a headphone . 
C:  So it @ @ , like , I mean  
A:  Right . 
H:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  <inbreath> Yeah , I  I mean , i in retrospect <laugh> it would 've been good to ha 
F:  <outbreath> 
C:  <inbreath> have got I should 've gotten a headphone . 
C:  But in any case , um , thi this is  this was transcribed in a  in a , 
C:  <inbreath> uh , less optimal way than  than the ones that came after it , and I was able to  you know , an and this meant that there were some speaker identif identifications which were 
G:  Well , I know there were some speaker labelling problems , um , after interruptions . Is that what you 're referring to ? 
C:  changes . Yeah . 
C:  Fixed that . 
C:  <inbreath> Oh , well  
G:  I mean , cuz there 's this one instance when , for example , you 're running down the stairs . I remember this meeting really well . 
H:  <breath> 
E:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah . <breath-laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Don  Don has had  <laugh> He knows  he can just read it like a play .  
C:  <laugh> 
G:  <inbreath> Right . It 's a  
I:  <laugh> <laugh> 
G:  Yeah , I 've  I 've  I 'm very well acquainted with this meeting . 
I:  <breath> 
F:  <laugh> 
D:  <breath> Yeah .  
G:  Yeah , I can s <breath> 
I:  <laugh> 
A:  " And then she said , and then he said . "  
G:  Yeah , I know it by heart . So , um , <mouth> there 's one point when you 're running down the stairs . Right ? And , like , there 's an interruption . 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  Uh - oh . <laugh> 
G:  You interrupt somebody , but then there 's no line after that . For example , there 's no speaker identification after that line . 
C:  Uh - huh .  
G:  Is that what you 're talking about ? Or were there mislabellings as far as , like , the a Adam was  ? 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  That was fixed , um , before  
C:  i i i I think I I think I understood that pretty  Thank you for mentioning . Yeah , no , tha that  
G:  Yeah . Cuz I thought I let you know about that . Yeah . 
C:  That I think went away a couple of versions ago , but it 's good to know . 
G:  OK . But you 're actually saying that certain , uh , speakers were mis mis - identified . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Yeah . So , with  under  um , uh , listening to the mixed channel , there were times when , as surprising as that is , 
C:  I got Adam 's voice confused with Dan 's and vice versa  not for long utterances , but jus just a couple of places , 
G:  OK . 
G:  OK . 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  <inbreath> and embedde embedded in overlaps . The other thing that was w interesting to me was 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  that I picked up a lot of , um , backchannels which were hidden in the mixed signal , which , you know , I mean , you c not  not too surprising . 
A:  Right . 
topic_description:	hand correcting alignment


C:  <inbreath> But the other thing that  
G:  <noise> 
C:  I  I hadn't thought about this , but I thou I wanted to raise this when you were  
C:  uh , with respect to also a strategy which might help with the alignments potentially , but that 's  
C:  <breath-laugh> 
C:  When I was looking at these backchannels , 
C:  they were turning up usually  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  very often in  w well , I won't say " usually "  but anyway , very often , I picked them up in a channel 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  w which was the person who had asked a question . <laugh> S so , like , someone says " an and have you done the so - and - so ? " 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  And then there would be backchannels , but it would be the person who asked the question . Other people weren't really doing much backchannelling . 
C:  <inbreath> And , you know , sometimes you have the  Yeah , uh - huh . 
A:  Well , that 's interesting . 
C:  <inbreath> I mean , i it wouldn't be perfect , but  but it does seem more natural to give a backchannel when  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  No , that 's really interesting . 
C:  when you 're somehow involved in the topic , and the most natural way is for you to have initiated the topic by asking a question .  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Well , 
C:  <breath-laugh>  
A:  <inbreath> That 's interesting . 
F:  I think  No . I think it 's  actually I think what 's going on is backchannelling is something that happens in two - party conversations . And if you ask someone a question , you essentially initiating a little two - party conversation . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah .  
A:  Well , actu Yeah , when we looked at this  
F:  So then you 're  so and then you 're expected to backchannel because the person is addressing you directly and not everybody . 
C:  Exactly .  
C:  <inbreath> Exactly . <inbreath> 
C:  Exactly my point . An - and so this is the expectation thing that  uh , uh , just the dyadic  But in addition , 
F:  Yeah . Yeah . Right . 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
C:  you know , if someone has done this analysis himself and isn't involved in the dyad , 
B:  <inbreath> H 
C:  but they might also give backchannels to verify what  what the answer is that this  that the  the answerer 's given  
A:  Right . It 's  
B:  I tell you , I say  I say " uh - huh " a lot , 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  There you go . 
A:  <inbreath> Well , but it 's interesting cuz , uh  
B:  <laugh> while people are talking to each other . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  There you go . Yeah . Yeah . 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  But there are fewer  I think there are fewer " uh - huhs " . I mean , just from  We were looking at word frequency lists to try to find the cases that we would allow to have the reject words in between in doing the alignment . 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  You know the ones we wouldn't constrain to be next to the other words . 
C:  <mouth> Oh , yeah . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  And 
A:  " uh - huh " is not as frequent 
A:  as it sort of would be in Switchboard , if you looked at just a word frequency list of one - word 
F:  <outbreath> <clears throat> 
A:  short utterances . And " yeah " is way up there , but not " uh - huh " . And so I was thinking 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  thi it 's not like  you 're being encouraged by everybody else to keep  talking in the meeting . And uh , that 's all , I I 'll stop there , cuz I I think what you say makes a lot of sense .  But it was sort of  <inbreath> 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  <mouth> Well , that 's right . And that would  
C:  <inbreath> Well , an 
C:  And what you say is the  is the re uh , o other side of this , which is that , you know , so 
C:  th there are lots of channels where you don't have these backchannels , w when a question has been asked and  and these  
A:  Right . There 's just probably less backchannelling 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  So that 's good news , really . 
A:  in general , even if you consider every other person altogether one person 
A:  in the meeting , but we 'll find out anyway . We were  I guess the other thing we 're  we 're  I should say is that we 're gonna , um 
A:  try  compare this type of overlap analysis to Switchboard , 
F:  And CallHome. 
A:  where  and CallHome , where we have both sides , so that we can try to answer this question of , you know , 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  is there really more overlap in meetings or is it just because we don't have the other channel in Switchboard and we don't know what people are doing . 
A:  Try to create a paper out of that . 
B:  <mouth> 
topic_description:	dealing with backchannels


B:  <inbreath> Yeah . I mean , y y you folks have probably  already told me , but were  were you intending to do a Eurospeech submission , or  ? 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> Um , you mean the one due tomorrow ? 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . <breath-laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Yeah . Well , we 're still , like , writing the scripts 
A:  for doing the research , and we will  Yes , we 're gonna try . 
C:  Mm - hmm .  
B:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  <inbreath> And I was telling Don , do not  take this as an example of how people should work .  
B:  <laugh> Do as I say , don't do as I do . Yeah . <breath-laugh> 
I:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  That 's r  <laugh> 
A:  <breath-laugh> So ,  
H:  <laugh> 
A:  we will try . It 'll probably be a little late , but I 'm gonna try it . 
E:  <inbreath> Well  
E:  It is different . In previous years , Eurospeech only had the abstract due by now , not the full paper . 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
E:  And so all our timing was off . I 've given up on trying to do digits . I just don't think that what I have so far makes a Eurospeech paper . 
A:  Well , I 'm no We may be in the same position , and I figured 
A:  <inbreath> 
G:  <mike noise> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  So , I guess , we 'll try to write this Eurospeech paper . I mean , we will write it . Whether they accept it  late or not , I don't know . 
C:  Superb . 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  Um , and the good thing is that we have  It 's sort of a beginning of what Don can use to link the prosodic 
A:  features from each file to each other . 
F:  Yeah .  
B:  Yeah . That 's the good thing about these pape 
F:  Plus , mayb 
A:  So . 
H:  Hmm ? 
A:  i You know , might as well . We - I ju Otherwise we won't get the work done  
B:  <inbreath> 
H:  <outbreath> 
F:  I don't know , m 
F:  I mean , u u Jane likes to look at data . Maybe , you know , you could  you could look at this format and see if you find anything interesting . 
A:  <laugh> on our deadline .  
B:  Yeah . 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  I don't know . 
B:  Yeah . <inbreath> No , it 's  that 's the good thing about these pape paper deadlines and , uh , you know , class projects , and  <laugh> and things like that , because you  you really get g Yeah . 
C:  <inbreath> Well , what I 'm thinking is   
A:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Right .  
C:  <inbreath> Well , my   
F:  Mm - hmm .  
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  Well th th the other thing that  that  that yo that you usually don't tell your graduate students is that these deadlines are actually not that , 
C:  Yeah . 
A:  Forces you to do the work .  Exactly . 
F:  um , you know , strictly enforced , because  the  
A:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  Strict . 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  @ @  Oh , now it 's out in the public , this  this  this secret information . Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> I think we can ha  
A:  <laugh> Right . So   
F:  because  <laugh> 
I:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> bec b <laugh> Nah  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> No . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> No . <laugh> 
C:  <breath-laugh> Nah .  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  i Because these  the conference organizers actually have an interest in getting lots of submissions . I mean , a  a monetary interest . So  
A:  Right .  
G:  <mike noise> 
E:  Right . 
B:  Yeah . 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  Um . <outbreath> 
B:  Th - that 's  that 's true . 
C:  And good ones , good ones , which sometimes means  a little extra time . <laugh> 
F:  And good submission Right . Well  
H:  <laugh> 
B:  That 's  
B:  That 's true . 
F:  <inbreath> That 's another issue , but  
B:  <mouth> 
B:  So , um  
H:  <mike noise> <cough> 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah . So tha so we 'll  you know , maybe you guys 'll have  have one . Uh , you  you and , uh  and Dan have  have a paper that  
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
B:  that 's going in . You know , that 's  that 's pretty solid , on the segmentation  stuff . 
D:  Yeah . I will send you the  the final version , which is not  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  And the Aurora folks here will  will definitely get something in on Aurora , so . 
F:  <mouth> Actually this  this , um  So , there 's another paper . It 's a Eurospeech paper but not related to meetings . 
F:  But it 's on digits . So , 
F:  um , 
F:  uh , a colleague at SRI developed a improved version of MMIE training . 
B:  Uh - huh . 
F:  And he tested it mostly on digits because it 's sort of a  you know , it doesn't take weeks to train it . <inbreath> 
B:  Right . <outbreath> 
F:  Um . <mouth> 
F:  And got some very impressive results , um , 
F:  with , you know , discriminative , uh , Gaussian training . 
F:  Um , you know , like , um , 
F:  error rates  go from  I don't know , in very noisy environment , like from , 
F:  uh , 
E:  <outbreath> 
F:  uh   
F:  I for now I  OK , now I have the order of magnit I 'm not sure about the order of magnitude . Was it like from ten percent to 
B:  <mouth> 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  eight percent or from 
F:  e e you know , point  
F:  you know , from one percent to point eight percent ? I mean , it 's a  <inbreath> 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  H i it got  it got better . Yeah , yeah . <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  It got better . That 's the important thing . Yeah . But it 's  
E:  <laugh> Hey , that 's the same percent relative , so  <breath-laugh> 
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . Right . It 's , uh , something in  Right . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> Yeah . 
E:  Twenty percent relative gain . 
F:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
topic_description:	Eurospeech submission


A:  we 'll try , because that 'll at least get us to the point where we have  We have this really nice database format that Andreas and I were working out that  
B:  <mike noise> 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  It  it 's not very fancy . It 's just a 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  ASCII line by line format , but it does give you information  
F:  It 's the  it 's the spurt format . 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  It  Yeah , we 're calling these " spurts " after Chafe . I was trying to find what 's a word for  a continuous region with  pauses around it ? 
C:  Hmm . 
B:  <mouth> 
B:  Yeah . I know that th the Telecom people use  use " spurt " for that . Yes . 
C:  Good . 
A:  They do ? Oh ! Oh . I would jus 
F:  Oh . 
B:  And that 's  I mean , I  I was using that for a while when I was doing the rate of speech stuff , because I  because I looked up in some books and I found  OK , I wanna find a spurt 
A:  Ah , right ! 
B:  <inbreath> 
A:  It 's just , like , defined by the acoustics . 
B:  in which  and  an because  cuz it 's another question about how  many pauses they put in between them . But how fast do they 
E:  Horrible . 
A:  Right . 
B:  do  the words within the spurt ? Yeah . 
E:  <inbreath> 
G:  <mouth> you know " Burst " also ? Isn't " burst " is used also ? 
A:  Right . Well , that 's what we were calling 
E:  It 's gonna  Burst . 
A:  spurt , so  
E:  Spurt has the horrible name overloading with other  with hardware at ICSI . <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> Here @ @  <laugh> 
B:  Here . Just very locally , yeah . But  but that just  
A:  Well , well , Chafe had this wor I think it was Chafe , or somebody had a  the word " spurt " originally , and so I  
C:  <mouth> 
C:  Actually  
A:  But tha that 's good to know . Was thi it 's Chafe ? 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  Well , see , I know S Sue wrote about spurts of development . But , in any case , I think it 's a good term , and , uh  
F:  So maybe we should talk  
A:  Maybe it was Sue  ? Y 
G:  <laugh> 
E:  Hmm !  
A:  So we have spurts and we have spurt - ify dot shell and spurt - ify   
B:  Yeah . 
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  And ma maybe  maybe Chafe did . I know  I know Ch - Chafe dealt with  
E:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> That 's cool . 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  Uh . So s 
B:  Yeah . 
A:  And then it 's got all  it 's a verb now .  <laugh> 
F:  W uh , w <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
C:  Chafe speaks about intonation units . 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  Yes . Right . 
C:  But maybe he speaks about spurts as well and I just don't know . Yeah , go ahead . 
F:  We - 
F:  So what we 're doing  uh , this  this is just  maybe someone has s some  some ideas about how to do it better , but we  
E:  I 've heard " burst " also . 
G:  Mmm . 
F:  So we 're taking these , uh , alignments from the individual channels . 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  We 're  
F:  from each alignment we 're producing , uh , one of these CTM files , which essentially has  it 's just a linear sequence of words with the begin times for every word and the duration . 
C:  Great . 
F:  And  and  and of course  
A:  It looks like a Waves label file almost . Right ? It 's just  
F:  Right . But it has  one  the first column has the meeting name , so it could actually contain several meetings . Um . 
F:  And the second column is the channel . 
F:  Third column is the , um , start times of the words and the fourth column is the duration of the words . 
F:  <breath> <mouth> 
F:  And then we 're , 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  um  
F:  OK . Then we have a messy alignment process where we actually insert into the sequence of words 
F:  the , uh , tags for , like , where  where sentence  ends of sentence , question marks , um , 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  various other things . Uh . 
A:  Yeah . These are things that we had Don  So , Don sort of , 
F:  Right . <outbreath> 
A:  um , propagated the punctuation from the original transcriber  so whether it was , like , question mark or period or , 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  um , you know , comma and things like that , and we kept the  and disfluency dashes  
F:  Mm - hmm .  
A:  uh , kept those in because we sort of wanna know where those are relative to the 
F:  <outbreath> 
A:  spurt overlaps  sp overlaps , or  <breath-laugh> 
F:  Right . So  so those are actually sort of retro - fitted into the time alignment . 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  And then we merge all the alignments from the various channels and we sort them by time . 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  And then 
F:  there 's a  
F:  then there 's a process where you now determine the spurts . 
F:  That is  
F:  Actually , no , you do that before you merge the various channels . So you  you id identify by some criterion , which is pause length  
F:  you identify the beginnings and ends of these spurts , and you put another set of tags in there to keep those straight . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <inbreath> 
F:  And then you merge everything in terms of , you know , linearizing the sequence based on the time marks . 
F:  And then 
F:  <mouth> you extract 
F:  the individual channels again , but this time you know where the other people start and end talking  
F:  you know , where their spurts start and end . 
F:  And so you extract the individual channels , uh , one sp spurt by spurt as it were . <inbreath> 
H:  <laugh> 
G:  <laugh> 
F:  Um , and inside the words or between the words you now have begin and end  tags for overlaps . So , 
F:  you  you basically have everything sort of lined up and in a form where you can look at the individual speakers and how their speech relates to the other speakers ' speech . 
E:  Right . 
F:  And  
A:  Uh , I mean , I think that 's actually really u useful also because 
A:  even if you weren't studying overlaps , if you wanna get a transcription for the far - field mikes , how are you gonna know 
A:  which words from which speakers occurred at which times relative to each other ? You have to be able to  get a transcript like  like this anyway , just for doing far - field recognition . So , 
A:  you know , 
F:  Yeah . 
A:  it 's  it 's sort of  
A:  I thi it 's just an issue we haven't dealt with before , how you time - align things that are overlapping anyway . 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  So  
G:  <mike noise> 
C:  That 's wonderful . 
E:  Well  
F:  And  and we  
A:  I mean , i I never thought about it before , but  
E:  <mouth> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  Y yes . I mean , s when I came up with the original data  suggested data format based on the transcription graph , there 's capability of doing 
F:  In  
H:  <laugh> 
G:  <mike noise> 
G:  <mike noise> 
G:  <mike noise> 
E:  that sort of thing in there . 
A:  Right . But you can't get it directly from the transcription . Yeah , this is like a poor man 's ver formatting version . But it 's , you know  It 's clean , it 's just not fancy . 
G:  <mike noise> 
C:  Mm - hmm . Yeah , that 's right . 
F:  Right . Well , this is  this is just  
F:  <inbreath> Well , there 's lots of little things . It 's like there 're twelve different scripts which you run and then at the end you have what you want . But , um , 
A:  <inbreath> 
E:  Right . 
A:  Um . 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  at the very last stage we throw away the actual time information . All we care about is whether  
F:  that there 's a certain word was overlapped by someone else 's word . 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  So you sort of  at that point , you discretize things into just having overlap or no overlap . 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  Because we figure that 's about the level of analysis that we want to do for this paper . <inbreath> 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  But if you wanted to do a more fine - grained analysis and say , you know , how far into the word is the overlap , you could do that . It 's just  it 'll just require more  
A:  Yeah . Just  sort of huge . <laugh> 
F:  you know , slightly different  
C:  <breath> What 's interesting is it 's exactly what , um , i in discussing with , um , Sue about this , um , she , um , 
B:  <mouth> 
A:  Yeah . 
C:  i i i indicated that that  
C:  you know , that 's very important for overlap analysis . 
G:  <mike noise> 
A:  Yeah . It 's  it 's nice to know , and also I think as a human , like , I don't always hear these in the actual order that they occur . So I can have two foreground speakers , you know , Morgan an and 
F:  Right . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  um , Adam and Jane could all be talking , and I could align each of them to be starting their utterance at the correct time , and then look where they are relative to each other , and that 's not really what I heard . 
C:  <inbreath> And that 's another thing she said . This is  This is Bever 's  Bever 's effect , when  where  
A:  Cuz it 's just hard to do . 
A:  Y Yeah . It 's sort of  
C:  In psy ps psycho - linguistics you have these experiments where people have perceptual biases a as to what they hear , that  that  
A:  Yeah , you sort of move things around until you get to a  low information point and yo then you can bring in the other person . So it 's 
C:  Not the best  
A:  <inbreath> actually not even possible , I think , for any person to listen to a mixed signal , even equalize , and make sure that they have all the words in the right order .

B:  By th by the way , this is totally unfair , you may  you may feel , but the  the , uh  the morning meeting folks actually have an  an extra month or so . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yep . <laugh> 
E:  Yep . The Aurora  there 's a special Aurora  
F:  When  
A:  Uh  
I:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  There 's a special Aurora session and the Aurora pe people involved in Aurora have till Ma - uh , early May  or something to turn in their paper . 
A:  Oh . 
F:  Mmm . 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh . 
F:  Mmm . 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  Well , then you can just  
A:  Oh , well maybe we 'll submit to s  <laugh> Actually  
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
I:  <laugh> 
F:  Maybe you can submit the digits paper on e for the Aurora session . 
H:  Yeah . <laugh> 
E:  <mouth> 
D:  Yeah .  
A:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh , I could ! I could submit that to Aurora . That would be pretty  pretty  
B:  I if it w 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> Well  
F:  Yeah . 
B:  i it has  
A:  Yeah . 
E:  S That wouldn't work . It 's not Aurora . 
B:  @ @  
B:  No , it wouldn't work . It 's  it 's not the Aurora  I mean , it  it 's  it 's actually the Aurora task . 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  Maybe they 'll get s 
E:  Aurora 's very specific . 
B:  It - 
A:  Well , maybe it won't be after this <laugh> deadline  extension . Maybe they 'll   
F:  But  but the people  I mean , 
F:  a  a paper that is not on Aurora would probably be more interesting at that point because everybody 's so sick and tired of the Aurora task . 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Yeah .  
E:  <inbreath> Oh , I thought you meant this was just the digits section . I didn't know you meant it was Aurora digits . <breath> 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  Yeah . 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  Well , no . If you  if you have  it 's to  if you discuss some relation to the Aurora task , like if you use the same  
E:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
B:  This is not the Aurora task . 
E:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
I:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  So they just do a little grep for  <laugh> 
A:  Do  uh , d d 
F:  Um . 
A:  Do not  do not  we are not setting a good example . This is not a  <laugh> 
F:  Well , a relation other than negation , maybe , um . 
G:  <mike noise> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  So . I don't know . 
A:  Anyway . 
B:  <clears throat> 
A:  But the good thing is this does  
I:  <laugh> 
E:  <inbreath> Well , I I don't know . I mean , you could  you could do a paper on  what 's wrong with the Aurora task by comparing it to  other ways of doing it . <breath> 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  <mouth> 
F:  How well does an Aurora system do on  on  you know , on digits collected in a  in this environment ? Yeah . 
H:  @ @  
I:  <outbreath> 
A:  <breath-laugh> 
G:  <mike noise> 
E:  Different way . Yeah . 
B:  Maybe . 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  Maybe . 
C:  <inbreath> 
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
G:  <mike noise> 
E:  Pretty hokey . <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  I think it 's a littl little far - fetched .  Nah , I mean , the thing is Aurora 's pretty closed community . I mean , you know , the people who were involved in the  
D:  <laugh> 
G:  <mike noise> 
F:  <mike noise> 
E:  Yep . 
F:  <mike noise> Mm - hmm . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  the only people who are allowed to test on that are people who  who made it above a certain threshold in the first round , 
E:  It 's very specific . 
B:  <inbreath> uh <mouth> w in ninety - nine and it 's  it 's sort of a  it 's  
B:  <inbreath> not like a  
F:  Well , that 's maybe why they don't f 
F:  know that they have a crummy system . I mean , a crummy back - end . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
C:  <mock gasp>  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  No , I mean  I mean , seriously , if you  if you have a very  <laugh> 
I:  <breath-laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  <inbreath> <breath-laugh> 
F:  No , I 'm sorry . 
G:  <mike noise> 
A:  Uh ,  " beep " <laugh> " bee " <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh>  
H:  <laugh> 
I:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  No . I didn't mean 
E:  I mean , th <outbreath> 
B:  <laugh> 
F:  anybody  any particular system . I meant this H T K back - end . If they  
H:  <laugh> 
G:  <mike noise> 
B:  Oh , you don't like HTK ?  <laugh> 
G:  <mike noise> 
A:  <laugh> 
I:  <breath-laugh> 
H:  Yeah . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  I don't h I don't have any stock in HTK or Entropic or anything . 
G:  <mike noise> 
B:  <laugh> No . I mean , this  it it 's the HTK  that is trained on a very limited amount of data . Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  It 's d it 's very specific . 
G:  <mike noise> 
C:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  Right . 
F:  But so , if you  
F:  But maybe you should , you know , consider more  using more data , or  I mean  
C:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  Oh , yeah . I  I really think that that 's true . 
B:  And they i i <outbreath> 
F:  If yo if you sort of hermetically stay within one task and don't look left and right , then you 're gonna  
E:  But they  they had  
B:  <inbreath> <inbreath> i  
B:  But  
E:  They had something very specific in mind when they designed it . 
F:  Right . 
B:  Well , u i 
E:  Right ? And so  so you can  you can argue about maybe that wasn't the right thing to do , but , you know , they  they  
C:  <mike noise> 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  But , one of the reasons I have Chuck 's messing around with  with the back - end that you 're not supposed to touch  
E:  they had something specific . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  I mean , for the evaluations , yes , we 'll run a version that hasn't been touched . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  But , uh , one of the reasons I have him messing around with that , because I think it 's sort of an open question that we don't know the answer to . People always say very glibly 
F:  <clears throat> 
H:  <breath> 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  that i if you s show improvement on a bad system , that doesn't mean anything , cuz it may not be  
B:  <inbreath> show  uh , because , you know , it doesn't tell you anything about the good system . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <inbreath> And I  I 've always sort of felt that that depends . 
B:  You know , that if some peopl If you 're actually are getting at something that has some  conceptual substance to it , it will port . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  <mike noise> 
B:  And in fact , most methods that people now use were originally tried with something that was not their absolute  best system at some level . 
B:  <inbreath> But of course , sometimes it doesn't , 
B:  uh , port . So I think that 's  that 's an interesting question . If we 're getting  three percent error on , uh , 
B:  u uh , English , uh , nati native speakers , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  um , using the Aurora system , and we do some improvements and bring it from three to two , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  do those same improvements bring , uh , th you know , the SRI system from one point three to  you know , to 
F:  Hmm . <outbreath> 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  <inbreath> 
E:  Zero . 
B:  point eight ? Well . <laugh> You know , so that 's  that 's something we can test . <mouth> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  Mmm . 
F:  Right . 
B:  <mouth> So . 
B:  Anyway . 
F:  OK . <outbreath> 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> I think we 've  <laugh> we 've covered that one up extremely well .  <laugh> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
F:  Whew !   
F:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
B:  OK .  <laugh> 
topic_description:	other systems


B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Um , <outbreath> let 's see . I think the only thing we had left was  unless somebody else  Well , 
B:  there 's a couple things . Uh , one is  anything that , um , 
B:  <mouth> anybody has to say about Saturday ? Anything we should do in prep for Saturday ? 
B:  Um  
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  I guess everybody knows about  
B:  <inbreath> I mean , u um , Mari was asking  was trying to come up with something like an agenda and we 're sort of fitting around people 's times a bit . 
B:  But , um , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  clearly when we actually get here we 'll  move things around this , as we need to , but  
B:  <mouth> so you can't absolutely count on it . But  but , uh  <outbreath> 
D:  OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  Are we meeting in here probably or  ? OK . 
B:  <inbreath> Yeah . 
B:  That was my thought . I think this is  
F:  Are we recording it ? 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> @ @  
A:  We won't have enough microphones , but  
B:  u No . I  I hadn't in intended to . We won we wanna  I mean , they 're  
F:  OK . <outbreath> 
A:  There 's no way . 
B:  there 's gonna be , uh , Jeff , Katrin , Mari and two students . So there 's five  from there . 
E:  And Brian . 
B:  <inbreath> 
F:  But you know th <inbreath> 
B:  And Brian 's coming , so that 's six .  
F:  Mm - hmm . <outbreath> 
E:  And plus all of us . 
B:  Uh  
F:  Can use the Oprah mike . 
H:  <laugh> 
A:  Depends how fast you can  throw it . It 's just  
E:  <inbreath> It seems like too many  too much coming and going . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
B:  Well  
A:  We don't even have enough channel  
F:  Because it would be a different kind of meeting , that 's what I 'm  
D:  Yeah . 
B:  <inbreath> Well  
H:  Yeah . <breath> 
F:  But  
B:  I hadn't  really thought of it , but  
F:  <mouth> Maybe just  maybe not the whole day but just , you know , maybe some  I mean , part of it ? 
B:  Maybe part of it . 
B:  Maybe part of it . 
E:  Make everyone read digits . 
H:  <laugh> <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> At the same time . 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  At the same time . 
E:  At the same time . 
F:  Please . <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Yeah . 
H:  @ @ 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
A:  We c 
B:  I don't know . Any - 
A:  That 's their initiation into our 
I:  <laugh> 
E:  Into our  our  our cult . 
A:  w 
A:  Yeah , our  Yeah , our   
E:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  Maybe the sections that are not right afte you know , after lunch when everybody 's still munching and  
A:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
D:  <breath-laugh> 
B:  OK . Well  
A:  So can you send out a schedule once you know it , jus ? 
B:  <mouth> 
B:  OK . Yeah . I guess I sent it around a little bit . But  
A:  Is  is there a r ? There 's a res 
A:  Is it changed now , or  ? 
B:  I hadn't heard back from Mari after I  I u u 
B:  uh , brought up the point abou about Andreas 's schedule . So , 
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  um , maybe when I get back there 'll be  some  some mail from her . 
A:  OK . 
C:  <inbreath> I 'm looking forward to seeing your representation . That 'd be , uh  
B:  <mouth> So , I 'll make a  
A:  And w we should get  the two meetings from y I mean , I know about the first meeting , um , 
C:  I 'd like to see that . Yeah . 
A:  but the other one that you did , the NSA one , which we  hadn't done cuz we weren't running recognition on it , because the non - native speaker  
F:  <clears throat> 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  there were five non - native speakers . 
C:  Mm - hmm . I see . Mm - hmm . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  But , it would be useful for the  
A:  to see what we get  with that one . So . 
G:  Which NSA meeting was that ? 
C:  Great . OK . It 's , uh , two thousand eleven twenty - one one thousand . 
G:  Oh , we did  That was the last one I gave you . 
A:  Yeah , three . Right . So  
G:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Great . I sent email when I finished the  
C:  that one . That was sort of son 
A:  N S A three , I think . 
G:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  Yeah , that 's right . That 's right . That 's much simpler . <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> I don't know what they said but I know the number .  
H:  <laugh> 
B:  Th - that part 's definitely gonna confuse somebody who looks at these later . I mean , this is  we we 're recording secret NSA meetings ? I mean , it 's  <laugh> 
F:  <mouth> Right . <breath> 
G:  I remember the date . So . 
A:  <laugh> 
F:  Um . <outbreath> Not the  <breath-laugh> Yeah . 
C:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  Uh . The  th the  
C:  Yeah . Not that NSA . 
B:  It 's network services and applications . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  They are hard to understand . <laugh> They 're very , uh , out there . I have no idea what they 're talking about . <inbreath> 
F:  Wait . The  
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
G:  Yeah , they 're cryptic . 
F:  The , um  
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Yeah . <breath-laugh> 
B:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  th the other good thing about the alignments is that , um , it 's not always the machine 's fault if it doesn't work .  So , you can actually find , um , 
A:  It 's the person 's fault . <laugh> It 's Morgan 's fault .  
F:  problem  uh , proble <laugh> You can find  
H:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
F:  <breath-laugh> 
E:  <breath-laugh> 
F:  You can find , uh , problems with  with the transcripts , um , you know , 
B:  It 's always Morgan 's fault . <breath-laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
E:  Oh . 
F:  and go back and fix them . But  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Tha - There are some cases like where the  the wrong speaker  uh , these ca 
A:  Not a lot , but where the  the wrong person  the  the speech is addre attached to the wrong speaker and you can tell that when you run it . 
A:  <inbreath> 
A:  Or at least you can get  clues to it . So these are from the early transcriptions that people did on the mixed signals , like what you have . 
C:  Interesting . 
C:  <inbreath> I guess it does w 
C:  Mm - hmm .  
C:  <inbreath> 
C:  It also raises the possibility of , um , using that kind of representation  I mean , I don't know , this 'd be something we 'd wanna check ,  
C:  but maybe using that representation for data entry and then displaying it on the channelized , uh , representation , cuz it  I think that the  
C:  I mean , my  my preference in terms of , like , looking at the data is to see it  in this kind of musical score format . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  And also , s you know , Sue 's preference as well . <inbreath> 
A:  Yeah , if you can get it to  
C:  And  and  but , I mean , this  if this is a better interface for making these kinds of , 
C:  uh , you know , lo clos local changes , then that 'd be fine , too . I don't  I have no idea . I think this is something that would need to be checked . 
B:  <mouth> 
C:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . Th - the other thing I had actually was , I  I didn't realize this till today , <laugh> but , uh , this is , uh , Jose 's last day . 
H:  <laugh> 
H:  Is my last  my last day . My  <laugh> my last meeting  about meetings . 
E:  Yeah . 
B:  <laugh> 
A:  Oh ! 
G:  Oh ! 
F:  Oh ! 
C:  Oh . 
E:  You 're not gonna be here tomorrow ? 
E:  Oh , that 's right . Tomorrow  <outbreath> 
H:  Yeah . Because , eh , I leave , eh , the next Sunday . I will come back to home  to Spain . 
D:  The last meeting meeting ? 
E:  It 's off . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Oh . 
H:  <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah . I d so I  I jus 
F:  Mm - hmm .  
H:  And I  I would like to  to  to say thank you very much , eh , to all people  in the group and at ICSI , because I  I enjoyed @ @ very much , uh . <inbreath> 
A:  Oh . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . It was good having you . 
F:  Mmm . 
A:  Yeah . 
F:  <outbreath> Mmm . 
H:  And I 'm sorry by the result of overlapping , because , eh , <laugh> I haven't good results , eh , yet but , eh , 
B:  <laugh> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  <laugh> <mike noise> 
H:  <mouth> 
H:  I  <mouth> I pretend  to  to continuing out to Spain , eh , 
H:  during the  the following months , eh , because I have , eh , another ideas 
B:  Uh - huh . 
H:  but , eh , I haven't enough time to  to  <laugh> with six months it 's not enough to  
E:  Yep . 
H:  <mouth> 
B:  Yeah . 
H:  to  to research , eh , and 
H:  e i I mean , if , eh , the topic is , eh , so difficult , uh , 
F:  <clears throat> 
H:  in my opinion , there isn't  
B:  <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah . Maybe somebody else will come along and will be , uh , interested in working on it and could start off from where you are also , you know . 
C:  <mike noise> 
B:  They 'd make use of  of what you 've done . 
H:  Yeah . 
H:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
H:  <inbreath> But , eh , I  I will try to recommend , eh , at , eh , 
C:  <mike noise> 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  the Spanish government but , eh , 
H:  the following @ @ scholarship , eh , eh , 
H:  <breath> 
H:  eh , will be here  more time , because eh , i in my opinion is  is better , 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  eh , for us  to  to spend more time here 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  and to work more time i i in a topic . No ? 
H:  <inbreath> 
B:  Yeah , it 's a very short time . Yeah . Yeah .  
H:  But , uh  
E:  Yeah , six months is hard . I think a year 
H:  Yeah . It is . 
H:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
H:  It 's difficult . 
E:  is a lot better . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  You  e you have , eh  
H:  you are lucky , and you  you find a solution  in  in  in some few tim uh , months , eh ? 
H:  OK . But , eh , I think it 's not , eh , common . 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  But , eh , anyway , thank you . Thank you very much . Eh , I  I bring 
H:  the chocolate , eh , to  
B:  <laugh> 
I:  <laugh> <outbreath> 
H:  <inbreath> 
E:  <laugh> 
F:  Mmm . 
H:  <laugh> to tear , uh , with  with you , uh . 
C:  Ah . Nice . 
A:  Oh . 
H:  I  I hope if you need , eh , something , eh , from us in the future , 
H:  I  I will be at Spain , 
H:  <inbreath> 
H:  to you help , uh . 
F:  <mike noise> 
E:  Great . 
B:  Well . 
C:  Great . Thank you . 
B:  Thank you , Jose . 
A:  Right . 
H:  And , thank you very much . 
G:  Thank you . 
F:  Have a good trip .
