E:  And we 're off . 
E:  OK , we 're on . 
E:  So , I mean , everyone who 's on the wireless check that they 're on . 
E:  OK , our agenda was quite short . 
E:  Sure . 
E:  Two items , which was , uh , digits and possibly stuff on  on , uh , forced alignment , 
E:  which Jane said that Liz and Andreas had in information on , 
E:  but they didn't , 
E:  so . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Digits and alignments . 
E:  But  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , it 's forced alignment of people 's schedules . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Ye - we and we 'd have to force you to read lots and lots of digits , 
E:  so it could get real  <laugh> real car noise . 
E:  So , anyway , I can talk about digits . 
E:  Um , did everyone get the results or shall I go over them again ? 
E:  I mean that it was basically  the only thing that was even slightly surprising was that the lapel did so well . 
E:  Um , and in retrospect that 's not as surprising as maybe i 
E:  it shouldn't have been as surprising as I  as  as I felt it was . 
E:  The lapel mike is a very high - quality microphone . 
E:  And as Morgan pointed out , that there are actually some advantages to it in terms of breath noises and clothes rustling  if no one else is talking . 
E:  Um , so , uh  
E:  Right . I mean , a lot of people are just sort of leaning over and reading the digits , 
E:  so it 's  it 's a very different task than sort of the natural . 
E:  So . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Right . 
E:  They have a little bit , 
E:  but they 're not noise - cancelling . 
E:  So , uh  
E:  Right . 
E:  Right . 
E:  So , also , Andreas , on that one the  the back part of it should be right against your head . 
E:  And that will he keep it from flopping aro up and down as much . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Everybody . 
E:  No . 
E:  Or if you did , I didn't include them , 
E:  cuz it was  
E:  Right . 
E:  I bet it would do even slightly better . 
E:  Yeah . No problem . 
E:  And try it with TI - digits ? 
E:  They didn't include it . 
E:  Whereas , I took out  the ones that I noticed that were blatant  that were correctable . 
E:  So that , if someone just read the wrong digit , I corrected it . 
E:  And then there was another one where Jose couldn't tell whether  I couldn't tell whether he was saying zero or six . 
E:  And I asked him and he couldn't tell either . 
E:  So I just cut it out . 
E:  You know , so I just e edited out the first , i uh , word of the utterance . 
E:  Um , so there 's a little bit of correction but it 's definitely not as clean as TI - digits . 
E:  So my expectations is TI - digits would , especially  
E:  I think TI - digits is all  American English . 
E:  Right ? 
E:  So it would probably do even a little better still 
E:  on the SRI system , 
E:  but we could give it a try . 
E:  Wha - what 's TI - digits ? 
E:  I thought t 
E:  It is wide - band . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Oh , that 's right . 
E:  I  I did look that up . 
E:  I couldn't remember whether that was TI - digits or one of the other digit tasks . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  So , Morgan , you 're getting a little breath noise . 
E:  You might wanna move the mike down a little bit . 
E:  Yeah , I noticed the script that extracted it . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  That I don't know . 
E:  I don't know . 
E:  I don't know how many speakers there are , 
E:  and  and how many speakers per utterance . 
E:  Right . 
E:  I strongly suspect that they have more speakers than we do . 
E:  So , uh  
E:  Right . So we  we could probably do an extraction that was roughly equivalent . 
E:  Um . 
E:  So , although I  I sort of know how to run it , there are a little  a f few details here and there that I 'll have to  dig out . 
E:  Right . I saw that . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Right . 
E:  And that , uh  
E:  Right . 
E:  I might have to do that anyway to  to do  
E:  because we may have to do an extract to get the  amount of data per speaker about right . 
E:  The other thing is , isn't TI - digits isolated digits ? 
E:  Or is that another one ? 
E:  I 'm  I looked through a bunch of the digits t corp corpora , 
E:  and now they 're all blurring . 
E:  Cuz one of them was literally people reading a single digit . 
E:  And then others were connected digits . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Maybe it 's the Bell Gram . 
E:  Bell Digits . 
E:  Alright . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Channel adapted . 
E:  Other way . 
E:  Liz  
E:  It f it clips over your ears . 
E:  There you go . 
E:  Uh , it pivots . 
E:  It  it  like this . 
E:  Eh . 
E:  Yeah , I think these mikes are not working as well as I would like . 
E:  Liz , you could also just use the other mike if you 're having problems with that one . 
E:  Oh , well . 
E:  So the  To get that , uh , pivoted this way , it pivots like this . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  There you go . 
E:  And then it  
E:  Right . 
E:  So if it doesn't bounce around too much , that 's actually good placement . 
E:  But it looks like it 's gonna bounce a lot . 
E:  Digits . 
E:  Adaptation . 
E:  Could we do exactly the same thing that we 're doing now , but do it with a far - field mike ? 
E:  Cuz we extract the times from the near - field mike , 
E:  but you use the acoustics from the far - field mike . 
E:  For this particular digit ones , I just picked that one . 
E:  So  
E:  Actually  
E:  I sh actually should 've picked a different one , 
E:  because  that could be why the PDA is worse . 
E:  Because it 's further away from most of the people reading digits . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Yeah . When you listen to it , uh , the PZM and the PDA  Yeah , th the PDA has higher sound floor 
E:  but not by a lot . 
E:  It 's really pretty  uh , pretty much the same . 
E:  Th - we wanted them to be  to be typical of what would be in a PDA . 
E:  So they are  they 're not the PZM three hundred dollar type . 
E:  They 're the twenty - five cent , 
E:  buy them in packs of thousand type . 
E:  Everything . 
E:  Yeah . That was gonna be my question . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  We do  we tend to do that anyway . 
E:  Oh . 
E:  So , although you  you can pipe it as well , we tend to do it that way 
E:  because that way you can concentrate on one block and not keep re - doing it over and over . 
E:  So tha that 's exactly what the P - file  is for . 
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  No gain . 
E:  Is the proximity constraint a hard constraint , 
E:  or did you do some sort of probabilistic weighting distance , or  ? 
E:  The ve level . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I think Transcriber , uh , outputs CTM . 
E:  I think so . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Well  
E:  It is different . 
E:  In previous years , Eurospeech only had the abstract due by now , 
E:  not the full paper . 
E:  And so all our timing was off . 
E:  I 've given up on trying to do digits . 
E:  I just don't think that what I have so far makes a Eurospeech paper . 
E:  Horrible . 
E:  It 's gonna  
E:  Burst . 
E:  Spurt has the horrible name overloading with other  with hardware at ICSI . 
E:  Hmm ! 
E:  I 've heard " burst " also . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Well  
E:  Y yes . 
E:  I mean , s when I came up with the original data  suggested data format based on the transcription graph , there 's capability of doing that sort of thing in there . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Strict . 
E:  No . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Yep . The Aurora  there 's a special Aurora  
E:  Oh , I could ! 
E:  I could submit that to Aurora . 
E:  That would be pretty  pretty  
E:  S That wouldn't work . 
E:  It 's not Aurora . 
E:  Aurora 's very specific . 
E:  Oh , I thought you meant this was just the digits section . 
E:  I didn't know you meant it was Aurora digits . 
E:  Well , I I don't know . 
E:  I mean , you could  you could do a paper on  what 's wrong with the Aurora task by comparing it to  other ways of doing it . 
E:  Different way . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Pretty hokey . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  It 's very specific . 
E:  I mean , th 
E:  It 's d it 's very specific . 
E:  But they  they had  
E:  They had something very specific in mind when they designed it . Right ? 
E:  And so  so you can  you can argue about maybe that wasn't the right thing to do , 
E:  but , you know , they  they  they had something specific . 
E:  Zero . 
E:  Hey , that 's the same percent relative , 
E:  so  
E:  Twenty percent relative gain . 
E:  And Brian . 
E:  And plus all of us . 
E:  It seems like too many  too much coming and going . 
E:  Make everyone read digits . 
E:  At the same time . 
E:  Into our  our  our cult . 
E:  Oh . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  You 're not gonna be here tomorrow ? 
E:  Oh , that 's right . 
E:  Tomorrow  
E:  It 's off . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  It was good having you . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Yeah , six months is hard . 
E:  I think a year is a lot better . 
E:  Great . 
E:  Digits ? 
E:  Are we gonna do them simultaneously 
E:  or  ? 
E:  Well , we 've gotta wait until after di after we take the mikes off . 
E:  So are we gonna do digits simultaneously 
E:  or what ? 
E:  It 's just the rest of the digits  the rest of the digits are very clean , 
E:  um , without a lot of background noise , 
E:  so I 'm just not sure  
E:  OK . 
E:  Remember to read the transcript number , please . 
E:  OK , everyone ready ? 
E:  Yeah , sure . 
E:  Hey , what a good idea . 
E:  We could do the same sheet for everyone . 
E:  Have them all read them at once . 
E:  Or  or just same digits . 
E:  See if anyone notices . 
E:  Did you read it twice or what ? 
E:  And we 're off .
