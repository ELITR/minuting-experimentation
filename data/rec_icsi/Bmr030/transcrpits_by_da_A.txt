A:  Mm - mmm . 
A:  What does that stand for ? 
A:  Alright . 
A:  Yeah , it 's pretty vague . 
A:  It 's government - run , I guess . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Cool . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  I sent  
A:  Yeah , and I sent you an email 
A:  with the instructions . 
A:  I don't know . 
A:  So , Morgan  
A:  I guess Morgan 's leaving on Saturday ? 
A:  So until then , 
A:  I guess we might hear something , 
A:  but  
A:  Yeah , exactly . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Oh - Yeah . 
A:  It 's just Alt Tab . 
A:  Like if you hold down Alt and then tap Tab , you just  the s just  the Task Manager w window comes up . 
A:  We 
A:  Well  
A:  Well , because if you just touch Alt a 
A:  If you just hit it once ? it 'll go back to the previous application . 
A:  And the previous application was the PowerPoint demo , 
A:  which was the display of like , you know  
A:  Not the slide show . 
A:  Yeah , he didn't  
A:  Right . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Right . 
A:  And I told them , um , if he decides to use multiple examples for , um , the prosody demo , to open up separate Transcribers . 
A:  Just so you don't have to load up files  e during the meeting . 
A:  So . 
A:  He 's got the memory for it . 
A:  So . 
A:  Yeah , they 're all really short . 
A:  No . I didn't have any problems  
A:  I 'm sorry ? 
A:  I don't know , 
A:  but it seemed  it didn't seem to be a problem at all . 
A:  I would imagine you add sixty - four to a hundred and twenty eight . 
A:  Yeah , either one will work , I think . 
A:  I mean , it was  
A:  Yeah , it was fine . I think y 
A:  Yeah , I mean  I  I  I  We kinda walked through it a little bit on his p on his laptop . 
A:  I could 
A:  And it 's part of the talk itself , 
A:  so it 's really not a big part . 
A:  It 's just gonna be a couple of  
A:  I know . 
A:  Right . Uh - huh . 
A:  But it 's a good tool to have . 
A:  The  th the m the meeting I R stuff is actually  
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Prosody ? 
A:  Yeah , have you guys seen the display ? 
A:  Have you guys seen either of the demos ? 
A:  They 're pretty cool , 
A:  like  the prosody demo , we basically w loaded up um , word alignments . 
A:  So , instead of having um , utterances in the bottom , it 's like just word by word . 
A:  So you can see exactly where the overlaps are . 
A:  And then , um , Adam did something where , um , we converted these feature files into wave files , 
A:  so you can display them . 
A:  Yeah . Instead of the wave file . 
A:  And then w using multi - wave you can add a file and play that sound . 
A:  Play the audio corresponding to that , um , um , feature file , 
A:  and it 's all like , aligned and stuff . 
A:  Yeah , so you see the pitch contours 
A:  and you  and when you hit play , like there 's a line that goes through it , 
A:  you know , and it 's all aligned with like the t the audio and the  feature file . 
A:  Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , there 's a  
A:  Yeah . 
A:  There 's a median filtering and then there 's a piece - wise linear fit , based on some criteria . 
A:  I 'm not sure . 
A:  Yeah , sure . 
A:  I should email Morgan about it too , 
A:  because he was asking about that . 
A:  And  Yeah . 
A:  Right , well , then it 's not a linear f fit . 
A:  You 're not fitting anything then . 
A:  Well  
A:  Yeah . It  
A:  It 's kind of a useless one . 
A:  Yeah , I actually don't know off the top of my head . 
A:  This was um , Kemal Sonmez at SRI , 
A:  who 's a co - worker with , uh , Liz . 
A:  Yeah . Did I just  
A:  Oh . <mouth> Oh . 
A:  Sorry . 
A:  Um , yeah , but , so Kamal has , uh  
A:  He did a paper on this for some v speech verification , uh , project , 
A:  and we basically e extrapolated what he  what he did for that work and applied it to our files . 
A:  And that 's how we do  That 's how we get our feature files and everything for all the prosody . 
A:  That  
A:  No , we grabbed most of it . 
A:  Like , we grabbed the linear fitting stuff . 
A:  We did all the alignments 
A:  and all the matching and stuff , 
A:  but the actual coding of the  
A:  the math was done somewhere else . 
A:  Uh , so that 's what you were working on , 
A:  right ? 
A:  From end to en Like , from the beginning of the process to the end of the process ? 
A:  Ooo . Yeah . 
A:  Yeah , right . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Right . 
A:  Right . 
A:  S 
A:  Oh . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Hmm . 
A:  So , what 's the turn around period right now from IBM ? 
A:  Should we be discussing this , 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  And the transcribers here are still , uh  are working , though . 
A:  Th - they 're just doing their own thing , like , while they 're waiting . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  What i 
A:  You 're just talking about playing it  and  recording it , like , real - time ? 
A:  Oh . 
A:  And you have to record every channel separately . 
A:  Oh , OK . 
A:  We  

A:  They couldn't use C Ds ? 
A:  Oh , I see . 
A:  I see . 
A:  Well , they must be dealing with large amounts of data if they 're transcribing , anyway . 
A:  I mean  People probably aren't sending them , you know  an utterance or two . 
A:  Isn't that next week ? 
A:  I think it was  
A:  Oh yeah , I don't know . 
A:  The demo was one of them . 
A:  Yeah . I think that 's it . 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  Cool . 
A:  So , the new disks are installed now ? 
A:  Or  ? 
A:  Mm - hmm . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Are we g just gonna keep recording ? 
A:  Like , at some point  
A:  OK . 
A:  OK . 
A:  Cuz u 
A:  How m 
A:  You 're a data fiend . 
A:  Yeah , it 's like you build this room up for so long , 
A:  and then it 's just like , you stop . 
A:  Mm - mmm .
