B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Um , is that really an ad - hoc network ? 
B:  Because the sensors are not moving . 
B:  And I think it 's  makes no sense with moving sensors because then you don't know where the sensors are . 
B:  So . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  That 's it . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm , 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah , 
B:  I see . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Um , a further question . 
B:  Um . 
B:  Am I right that this um dialogue does not prevent um any disturbance of other nodes in the um sending range of , yeah , N - one . 
B:  S 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  That 's it . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  But then this node , um , this transmission is uh aborted . 
B:  And so there 's no advantage to uh  if it 's aborted , by  by any data packets . 
B:  So this um node has to stop each transmission . 
B:  So , even the at - the - moment - ongoing transmission . 
B:  Is that right ? 
B:  So , his transmission is aborted . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  That 's right . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK , 
B:  yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK , 
B:  but this scenario is also nov uh , only working if um both or all nodes have the same range of transmission . 
B:  So , the s same radius of the sending range . 
B:  So otherwise um this one node maybe  um  would hear  his neighbor but not vice versa . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  But I 'm thinking about this example you gave  before . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  But one of the  
B:  But one of the um senders could be much stronger than the other one . 
B:  So  
B:  OK . 
B:  So that was my question . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  But  
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  It 's a assumption it 's  it 's clear . 
B:  But on the other hand , um , in a real world it isn't , or  ? 
B:  Um . 
B:  In real scenarios , uh , you have to  
B:  Yeah , 
B:  eh that 's it . 
B:  A car or  
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah , 
B:  OK . 
B:  That  
B:  You 're not assuming this . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  Yeah , a cellular phone and a car . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  So there are  
B:  OK . 
B:  So there 's more than one IP address in the header , 
B:  and  
B:  OK , I see . 
B:  Do they have to  
B:  Do they have to be in order ? 
B:  So  you are looking first for node two and then for node three and so on . 
B:  OK . 
B:  OK . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  OK . 
B:  You mentioned um six partners of this um work . 
B:  So you know already what partners are included . 
B:  OK I didn't have a look at uh slides , 
B:  OK . 
B:  Just  I 'm just curious . 
B:  Yeah , sure . 
B:  Mm - hmm . 
B:  Yeah yeah . 
B:  And all of them had agreed , 
B:  or  ? 
B:  OK .
