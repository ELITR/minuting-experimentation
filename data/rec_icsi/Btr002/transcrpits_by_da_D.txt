D:  Hmm . 
D:  I 'm  
D:  Yes . 
D:  I can change it . 
D:  I was just trying a new head position . 
D:  OK . 
D:  That 's what I was just thinking , 
D:  or maybe it was really quiet or something ? 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Ugh ! 
D:  Wow . 
D:  I wonder if that was someone who was  who had an accent , maybe ? 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  That 's very subtle . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Oh , yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Oh , like it 's a whole new utterance . 
D:  Like it 's not connected . 
D:  It 's like  kind of like introducing  
D:  It 's like introducing a new thing that they don't talk about . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  " What are we gonna do now , " 
D:  but they don't say that . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Well , I would hope they would have native speaker transcribers transcribing . 
D:  Oh  y yeah . 
D:  No , that 's not what I meant , 
D:  but that would be cool . 
D:  No , what I meant was that I would hope that , for meetings in English you would have native speakers transcribing it 
D:  because it  you would have more intuitions about what should be there . 
D:  Even if you can't fully understand the word , you can make a guess , you can  that isn't completely off like some of these are , 
D:  but they 're pretty rare  
D:  those things , the f 
D:  the really bad mistakes that they make are pretty rare 
D:  I think , so . 
D:  Not this  t t 
D:  I mean  
D:  No , not " twosome gruesome " . 
D:  Sometimes , 
D:  but  they tend to be pretty good about parentheses . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Exactly . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  Well , I mean , you get the " GR " from " groups " , I guess , 
D:  but 
D:  I don't know where the rest of it came from . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  " Groups of "  
D:  Well , also  
D:  " Group of , groups of , groups  of , group  s " 
D:  I wonder where the " P " went , though ? 
D:  Yeah ? 
D:  Nnn , I guess . 
D:  It 's possible . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Is that what it 's about ? 
D:  I wasn't  I couldn't u I don't know , for some reason that didn't make sense to me . 
D:  But th it 's about when things are transcribed on other channels than what they 're set on ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I 'm supposed to do it . 
D:  h  Yeah . 
D:  They probably don't even know how many people are at the meeting , or w anything . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Wow . 
D:  We 're  we 're really spoiled , then , with our interface here , 
D:  right ? 
D:  I mean  s it 's very useful . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Or they just tend to sp peak  louder , maybe ? 
D:  For announcements and things ? 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  They should do that at BART , too , 
D:  because sometimes it 's hard to hear . 
D:  Yeah . Those are  i a w actually probably just the computer problem 
D:  not the gender problem . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . By filtering or something ? 
D:  So what was the answer here ? 
D:  It  that 's not the case ? 
D:  Oh , OK . 
D:  Good . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , that 's what it seems like . 
D:  I have a question . 
D:  In the  <clears throat> some of the earlier meetings I guess , there was a lot of spikes , 
D:  or what I called spikes . 
D:  I was wondering what that is . 
D:  I don't even know if it 's relevant or useful to know , 
D:  but I 'm just curious . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Loose . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Cuz those ones sometimes were extraordinarily bad and pai 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , 
D:  and like not listen to them . 
D:  Or just uh s 
D:  Yeah . Or , like , skip it entirely . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Y y yeah . 
D:  Yes . Absolutely . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And so you turn it down ? 
D:  No , a I think  
D:  I think that 's really important . 
D:  Yeah , I think that 's really important 
D:  because I generally have the volume turned up to above normal volume just so I can hear more clearly , 
D:  and if it 's like that for someone screeching into the microphone than it would be really painful . 
D:  I think you could , yeah . 
D:  Yeah , that 's  
D:  Especially  we have really good headphones , 
D:  like  
D:  Yeah , I mean , it 's very useful in like all senses 
D:  cuz  
D:  It 's very good . 
D:  No . 
D:  Or , turn up 
D:  Yeah . Or , like  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  But it would play it backwards too . 
D:  But just to move back , but not necessarily a whole timebin ? 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Or otherwise , drag it , or like click on it . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I think that would be useful . 
D:  Yeah , because I noticed I started feeling like I was getting some sort of carpal tunnel issues . 
D:  Much better now that I have the keyboard st tray , 
D:  but it was  
D:  I think cuz I had my hand in one position using it all the time . 
D:  And that I would  it would crack  a lot . 
D:  It was very weird . 
D:  But . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Oh . I see what you 're saying . 
D:  Well , I would press " tab " 
D:  and listen to where I wanted it to stop , 
D:  and then press " return " , create a new timebin , 
D:  and then " shift "  
D:  " shift " , what is it ? 
D:  " Shift " , " backspace " to c collapse it , yeah . 
D:  Oh . Do you drag  do you drag the line ? 
D:  See , I never  I never do that for some reason . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Um , one thing that 's gotten me into problems a little bit is having the " shift - backspace " as the collapser . 
D:  Because I 'll tend to delete things , 
D:  or go too far , or something , 
D:  or I 'll be holding down " shift " because I wanna type something as a capital , 
D:  and then end up collapsing the timebins . 
D:  So , it might be better to use a different keys or something . 
D:  Yeah . Yeah ! 
D:  Or just , I mean  
D:  but , or just to change the keys used , you know , for  for that option . 
D:  I 'm used to it too , 
D:  but , I mean  
D:  I don't think I 'm that bad , 
D:  but  
D:  Yeah , I do that too . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  It 's just th right above the  backspace . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I think so . 
D:  Did it  
D:  Right . 
D:  I 'm actually used to  
D:  I 'm used to the SUN one , I guess , now . 
D:  Amaretto has a different one . 
D:  Linguine is  Basmati have the same . 
D:  Right ? 
D:  Ooh ! 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  But just the beginning . 
D:  Which is the  
D:  The PC one is the Amaretto one , 
D:  right ? 
D:  I prefer th I prefer the one on Linguine or Basmati . 
D:  I don't know what it 's called . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  In the c 
D:  Yeah , the one in the  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I  I I could get used to  I could get used to it too . 
D:  I just am very used to  
D:  I don't know . 
D:  Cuz I always use it . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  I  I remember recognizing certain numbers . 
D:  I don mmm , I don't remember which ones , 
D:  but I think it was maybe  
D:  well , I could recognize when there was a fricative at the beginning of a number for some reason . 
D:  It was like , a little bit of energy , or some whatever you call it , 
D:  and then it grew really big . 
D:  So like " four " and " five " and " three " all had this same characteristic , 
D:  and " six " and " seven " o both had the same characteristics to their  in the beginnings . 
D:  But " six " and " eight " ? 
D:  " Eight " ,  um , I remember tended  that people tended to not pronounce the last " T " . 
D:  And when they did , it was slightly farther away from the rest of the word than you would have es expected . 
D:  Same with " six " . 
D:  The " X " , well the " KS " or whatever , at the end . 
D:  But  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That was a  that was really interesting to notice that . 
D:  Uh , 
D:  It 's a very different interface , though . 
D:  I mean , it seems very strange . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah , I only did it a little bit , too . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  If I remember correctly , it seemed to be very efficient in the key strokes that you used to do certain things . 
D:  I can't remember what they were , now , 
D:  but I just remember that it was  once you learned them , it was very neat and concise 
D:  and , th like  
D:  couple keys that you used . 
D:  Hmm ? 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  I feel like I did a little checking or something on that . 
D:  Yeah . I don't know  I don't remember actually transcribing it , 
D:  but I remember listening to  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  One thing that I still can't figure out with the interface , 
D:  it does this sometimes 
D:  but other times it doesn't , 
D:  is when you click on  
D:  you know , there 's a bar above where this sound wave is , that has , um , n the  
D:  it has a little bar of where the meeting is , 
D:  like in  
D:  and it goes along as you 're listening to the meeting 
D:  and then it ends up the end . 
D:  And if you click on that bar to the right of that little marker then it moves forward , 
D:  if you click on the left it moves back . 
D:  But sometimes it moves two frames  or two screens , 
D:  and sometimes it doesn't . 
D:  Really ? 
D:  OK . 
D:  Cuz I noticed that a few times it would do it  it would move twice 
D:  and then in  n sometimes i it wouldn't , 
D:  and maybe i maybe I had resolution set differently 
D:  or I s 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . That 's what I tend to do , is I use a soundwave , 
D:  but if I 'm trying to scan through a long period of what appears to be silence sometimes I 'll s ry and be sc try to scan it , 
D:  but I can't 
D:  because 
D:  it skips . Yeah . 
D:  So then I end up clicking on the arrow , they have the arrow at the far right , 
D:  and so I use that sometimes . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  At the far right and far left there 's a little arrow that allows you to go like second by second or something , 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  Not second by second , 
D:  but little bit by bit , yeah . 
D:  Um , it 's not on the resolution part . 
D:  It 's where you have  it 's where you have the marker of where you are in the meeting . 
D:  So you have this bar , uh , and then you have a time marker that moves along . 
D:  Say , you 're halfway through the meeting , it 's gonna be halfway along the line . 
D:  I think  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  It 's  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Exactly . 
D:  So right at the right and left of that  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah ! 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  Exactly . 
D:  Maybe we have resolution set totally different . 
D:  Cuz I noticed when  Jen and I have totally different resolutions , 
D:  cuz hers moves so much quicker than mine , 
D:  which means it 's more stretched out , right ? 
D:  Yeah . I usually have it set to where it has , um , point five second intervals on the numbers . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . I  
D:  I do too , 
D:  but sometimes if it gets too  too  for me too stretched out , um , I 'll tend to think that there 's a break in between a pause inside of a word or something . 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So I prefer it to be a little bit tighter , 
D:  but I 'll stretch  I 'll stretch it in a particular place if I need to , or something . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That 's kind of interesting , though . 
D:  Well if there 's any left we can grab it . 
D:  Ooh , those were good . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And also that we can  I don't know , that we have this shared realm of knowledge , kind of , 
D:  and can laugh about things that other people would not understand whatsoever , 
D:  or  
D:  You know ? 
D:  Yeah . Yeah . I mean , i it 's really cool . 
D:  Yeah , or even just about what we were talking about with the technical part , you know , the interface . 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  Yeah , in the very beginning . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I prefer ones that are somewhat linguistically related , 
D:  cuz it 's more interesting for me . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Exactly . And it 's f really hard t t 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . You guys do some in the mee in the Meeting Recorder ones , there 's some talk of , 
D:  D d I don't know , 
D:  discourse stuff . 
D:  I think it 's really fun too to listen to when you give reports on transcription . 
D:  Yeah . Cuz there are always people like , you know , talking bad about the transcribers , 
D:  and just making fun of u 
D:  And so it 's really funny , 
D:  I don't know . 
D:  It 's really funny to listen to . 
D:  You haven't ? 
D:  It 's really funny . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  No ! 
D:  Wow . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I think it 's funny when there 's little side conversations like that , that happen at the same time too . 
D:  I think those are interesting . 
D:  And I think it 's really cool when people 
D:  start getting really excited about something or angry about something 
D:  because then they tend to interrupt each other a lot , 
D:  and  
D:  I don't know . 
D:  I mean , I remember one where one person , um , was really trying to get something out , really , really desperately , 
D:  and he kept getting interrupted by like three p three other people , 
D:  and he was like , " I I I I I I I I I " 
D:  And it was  I mean it was kind of sad 
D:  but it was , like , also really interesting to watch , 
D:  or to listen to . 
D:  Both . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  They 're like just trying really hard to get it out before they get interrupted or something , 
D:  falls apart . I don't know . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yep . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yes . 
D:  I know . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  You know , I 
D:  sorry , to  <laugh> I just remembered one thing that really was  you needed  
D:  I think it was you that pointed out the problem . 
D:  Like you needed to be at the meeting to be able to transcribe correctly , the noise . 
D:  I think it was Adam was making this really strange noise , 
D:  and apparently he was pretending  
D:  he was like pretending to r screw something into his head ? 
D:  Was that what it was ? 
D:  Yeah ! Y yeah ! 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Oh wow . 
D:  y I had one like that where they were describing the different f qualities of " uh - huh " and " uh " and " uah " 
D:  and like what " EH " is versus " UH " versus " AH " . 
D:  That was really hard . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That 's really interesting . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I don't have to be anywhere until five , 
D:  so . 
D:  Good . 
D:  Oh man . 
D:  Oh n 
D:  That 's really funny . 
D:  Right . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh , yeah . 
D:  It takes a long time , yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I  tends  I  you know what I noticed , is it tends to have a  still , a dominant group of speakers 
D:  and then there are two or three people generally who don't talk at all 
D:  except to say their digits or something , 
D:  or who  
D:  or to breathe and cough and sniff and whatever . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . But I  I think that still overall you 're gonna have probably three or four or five dominant speakers . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Exactly . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  So you 've  this is like the tenth time for you , then . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh , OK . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Oh , man . 
D:  Yeah ! Yeah . 
D:  Occasionally . 
D:  Like on the bus or something when I 'm bored . 
D:  Oh , really ? 
D:  Oh , OK . 
D:  Oh , that 's funny . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Huh , that 's interesting . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . I noticed a lot of my speech i I don't know , I wouldn't call them errors , I guess disfluencies , a lot more once  when I started transcribing . 
D:  I just noticed  and in ge people in general , that people break up their speech interestingly . 
D:  Yeah ! 
D:  Actually . 
D:  I think that shows a lot of  I think that shows a lot of how , um , it 's not all acoustic . 
D:  I mean , there 's other things involved , 
D:  eye contact , 
D:  body language , 
D:  gesture , 
D:  whatever . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  I definitely think so . 
D:  And I think there would be a lot more interesting data to analyze later on , <laugh> personally . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And you can really get a feel for the re interpersonal relationships , 
D:  which kind of comes into play , maybe not for speech recognition , 
D:  but for other things , maybe ? 
D:  Maybe . 
D:  Yeah , you just have to rely on your intonation , 
D:  and other things like that . 
D:  Yeah . Mm - hmm . Maybe . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  That 's pretty amazing . 
D:  Enhanced other senses , I guess . 
D:  That 's really cool . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That 's something you don't hear in normal speech too . 
D:  In normal conversations ,  unless it 's very dramatic or very loud , 
D:  that people click their  Their lips are always making funny noises 
D:  and  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  We - yeah , we filter all that out . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Which is a very  it 's  that 's how I tended  before studying linguistics anyways and , uh , definitely before doing transcription ,  how I tended to look all conversations , 
D:  and then coming here and doing this , you have to look at speech in a totally more intense way . 
D:  Um . 
D:  Including , I mean , every little aspect . 
D:  I  and when I tell people what I do here , 
D:  and tell them , " Yeah , I 'm transcribing " . 
D:  And they 're  they think I 'm like a stenographer or something . 
D:  I 'm like , " No , I don't correct the grammar . 
D:  I don't erase the " um " 's and " uh " 's , 
D:  I record all the sighs , and the laughs , and the breaths , 
D:  and  " And they 're  
D:  I don't know . 
D:  This is a very different thing than most people can relate to , I guess . 
D:  Or know about . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And when you think about it , they pick up exactly where they left off , 
D:  even though maybe it 's several seconds later , there 's no glitch in the syntax or anything . 
D:  It 's  We 're pretty amazing machines . 
D:  Or creatures , 
D:  whatever . 
D:  That 's really cool . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  It 's like 
D:  " tisk " . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  It could be . 
D:  But I noticed it more as it was obviously not  
D:  because it was always in a g the one I 'm thinking of always came in groups of four or something . 
D:  And so it wasn't ever like a , um , single l 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Right . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 
D:  That 's kind of the impression I got too . 
D:  No . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That 's more like the " @ @ " . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  It could be . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Me too . 
D:  Oh yeah . 
D:  It 's like " humph " . 
D:  Oh . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  I usually tend to think that it 's a  more of a  
D:  Hhh . <vocal gesture, expulsive outbreath, signalling difficulty> not indignation . 
D:  Something more positive . 
D:  I don't know exactly wha how to characterize it , 
D:  but something more 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  " Hmm . " 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Or  
D:  I  i I don't know . 
D:  Maybe . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  That 's interesting . 
D:  I noticed , i m as far as problems with laughs , is that a lot of them were marked as breaths . 
D:  Because a lot of people , 
D:  I think we already talked about this last time , 
D:  but  
D:  but not so much as , I never saw that written out phonetically , or whatever . 
D:  Yeah , that 's what I used to do too . 
D:  So you would have like " lef laugh , breath , laugh " 
D:  transcribed ? 
D:  Oh , I 've  
D:  Yeah . 
D:  OK . 
D:  I see what you 're saying . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Sometimes it 's hard to tell . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . Exactly . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . I 've taken out some of those . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Oh , yeah . I 'm sure they are . 
D:  Although , they did put a " missing segment " so sometimes in brackets . 
D:  I 've gotten both . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . I 've seen a few of them , 
D:  but I 've seen a  several " breath " 's too . 
D:  Yeah ! Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  It 's just in the wrong place . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Really ? 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Hmm . One thing that I noticed  
D:  I don't know if it 's a  really a question of me being more c changing my speech necessarily , 
D:  but I 'm much more aware of interruptions in conversation  in normal conversation . 
D:  So , uh , maybe I am more careful  in the sense that I maybe don't interrupt as much , 
D:  or j I 'm more aware of it when I am doing it , 
D:  or something like that , 
D:  but , um , I just pay attention more to the fact that every  pretty much all the time in normal conversation there are interruptions . 
D:  There 's no  
D:  I mean , unless you have really aw 
D:  I mean , I think if there were no interruptions it would sound really awkward . 
D:  There would be a lot of pauses , 
D:  and that would kind of i imply uncomfortability , or something . 
D:  But , 
D:  yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  It 's different . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  But even in cases like that ,  even when it is  
D:  see now I 'm contradicting myself , 
D:  but even when it is very  turn - taking is very w like people follow the turn - taking rules , or whatever , and don't really blatantly interrupt people , 
D:  um , 
D:  and I  I remember this actually from a meeting because Liz was complaining there wasn't enough o interruptions , 
D:  or e not enough overlaps , or something . 
D:  It wasn't interruptions 
D:  it was overlaps , that I was thinking about . 
D:  Not enough overlaps . 
D:  And so she wanted to  there to be an argument or something so that there 'd d be more . 
D:  And ch what she didn't realize was that throughout the meeting up until then there had been , 
D:  they were just very small , 
D:  but they were there . 
D:  I think they 're there pretty much a all the time . 
D:  Uh - huh . 
D:  Oh ! 
D:  Yeah ! 
D:  Yeah ! 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  And then everybody talks at once . 
D:  You know , thinking about it , 
D:  I  I think I 've only noticed a couple times where there 's been actual silence on all channels for a period of time . 
D:  It 's only been like twice . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Hmm . 
D:  Yeah , yeah .  Yeah . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Then

D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mmm . 
D:  Oh ! 
D:  Oh ! 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Initials ? 
D:  I I also found that it was easier to deal with the meetings when there are speaker initials . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
D:  OK . 
D:  Can I ask one more thing about these comments . 
D:  So we are for  
D:  " QUAL " is used for things like " whispered " , or " said while laughing " , or things of that nature . 
D:  Um , I remember at some point we were doing a difference between vocal and non - vocal sounds ? 
D:  Oh ! 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Mm - hmm . 
D:  Very efficient . 
D:  OK . But for , like , noise that we know is something like mike noise , or something like a door , whatever , then we can mark it as that 
D:  and no 
D:  Yeah ,  right . 
D:  Or  
D:  o or if it 's  
D:  Right . 
D:  OK . 
D:  So we do need to add that one ? 
D:  OK . Sure . OK . 
D:  Yeah , that 's fine . 
D:  That 's what we did last time . 
D:  Yeah . 
D:  Hmm .
