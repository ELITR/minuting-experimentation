F:  No problem . 
F:  We have littler heads 
F:  so . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Mm - mmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  i " Ish decay " ? 
F:  Yeah , what 's an " ish " ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Actually , that comes back to a point . 
F:  We had talked about this last week , where you were interested in " so " . 
F:  Saying " so " at the end of something . 
F:  And sometimes that would get transcribed as  
F:  OK , so , let me just think of an example . 
F:  Um , 
F:  OK , let 's say I say , " Well , that would be hard to do , so . " 
F:  OK , right ? 
F:  And the way I would transcribe it , I would put that " so that would be hard " , comma , " so " 
F:  at the end . 
F:  Cuz it 's kind of just the end of that  the  
F:  Right . 
F:  " So . " 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , I would just sort of end it . 
F:  But then sometimes they transcribe it like " So that would be a problem " , period , new word , like  capitalized " So " . 
F:  Right . And  and it just seems to sotal totally  that  that 's not the meaning . 
F:  And  and it changes the meaning , I think . 
F:  Um  
F:  Or whatever , yeah , 
F:  " that would be a problem " , 
F:  whatever . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  " So . " 
F:  It seems like  because if I was just reading that thing , I would say , " So that would be a problem .  So . " 
F:  You know what I mean ? 
F:  Th - if  if it was like , " period , capital SO " , as opposed to , um , " That would be a problem , so . " 
F:  " That would be a problem .  So . " 
F:  Some 
F:  Right , yeah . 
F:  So  
F:  Right . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah . I just wonder , like , what influences them to think of " twosome gruesome " , 
F:  like maybe this person just saw a horror movie or something ? 
F:  And , 
F:  uh , this is <laugh> the interpretation that came to mind or something ? 
F:  You know what I mean ? 
F:  Like , where would you get the word " gruesome " ? 
F:  You know , you just sort of pull it out of the air ? 
F:  Anyway . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Mmm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  " Pss " . 
F:  But this other business , um , that you have at the bottom with people getting transcribed on another channel 
F:  is , uh  is much more common . 
F:  Right . 
F:  And what 's always funny to me is when it 's th you know , they m mi miss the gender completely , 
F:  like , you know , Morgan 'll be on Jane 's channel , 
F:  or just something bizarre like that . 
F:  Um , so . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Fancy - schmancy . 
F:  If I was gonna make just a guess , though , from my experience it would seem like the men get mis um , 
F:  the men get moved onto other channels , maybe more frequently . 
F:  And it 's just probably cuz they have deeper voices 
F:  and they 're getting picked up on more channels , um , than their own channel . 
F:  Um , for w you know , it 's an acoustic thing . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , you could see it coming and you 'd turn the volume down or something . 
F:  But sometimes you 'll see like something coming up 
F:  like , " Uh - oh . 
F:  Someone 's gonna cough really loudly " , 
F:  and I could tell because of the way it looks ! 
F:  Or " someone 's about to laugh really loudly " , 
F:  um  yeah , 
F:  and then you 're just sort you 've got like  you know <laugh>  you 're sort of like 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So unless there 's gonna be some speech in there , I don't think I need to listen that carefully . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  You could h really hurt your ears . Yeah . 
F:  Oh , yeah . 
F:  So . 
F:  Gives some good clues , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  Oh yeah . Yeah . 
F:  Sometimes it doesn't pick up backchannelling , though , 
F:  and so sometimes you have to , um , try to listen  
F:  there 's no visual 
F:  but  
F:  Yeah , you have to  the resolution , 
F:  right ? 
F:  So . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Just to jump it back . 
F:  Right , cuz sometimes you 'll hear  It 'll be in  right in the middle of the timebin , 
F:  and you don't have to listen to the whole thing again 
F:  cuz you 've already gotten the first part . 
F:  So you just want it to go back , 
F:  I don't know  
F:  That 's true . 
F:  Hmm . Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , the less you have to click on the mouse , I think the faster you could go . 
F:  Yeah , you were having some wrist problems and stuff , 
F:  right ? 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . Ooh ! 
F:  I do that with the mouse , yeah . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  Mmm . 
F:  Oh yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh yeah , I do find that the keyboard is different here than it is even at my s for my school computer 
F:  and so I 'll al I 'll just be  
F:  if I was just at school , and I come here , it 's just  
F:  or vice versa 
F:  it 's just , uh  it 's like I 'll  I 'll reach for one key and it 'll do something completely different , 
F:  and I have to just get used  just get used to it again  
F:  Yeah , the backspace is in the wrong place . 
F:  Oh yeah , and then I 'll keep  I keep caps - locking too 
F:  cuz the caps - lock 's in a different spot . 
F:  So . 
F:  Th 
F:  Oh ! 
F:  Yeah , I do that all the time . 
F:  I don't know . 
F:  You seem very upset about it , 
F:  so . We  maybe we should trade . 
F:  Huh . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I just get used to it . 
F:  So . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Is Basmati . 
F:  I believe that 's correct , yeah . 
F:  Linguine must be the one in the left - hand corner . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  I just have no preference . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  It just goofs me up for like maybe a minute 
F:  and then I sorta get used to it . 
F:  Huh . 
F:  Mmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  I did it a little . 
F:  Just a little bit . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah , what happened to that , 
F:  you just stopped doing it ? 
F:  Or  ? 
F:  Oh , OK . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Good . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah the hardest thing 'd be finding them . 
F:  Cuz I would get the whole tr I 'd get the whole transcript of the meeting 
F:  and you had to find them . 
F:  You 'd have to find where the digits were . 
F:  And they 'd usually be at the end somewhere , 
F:  but you had to fig figure out where the heck in the meeting to  to look for them , 
F:  so . 
F:  Yeah ! 
F:  Yeah , the interface was different . 
F:  I  I  yeah , 
F:  it was  it was more complicated . 
F:  But anyway , 
F:  than what it would be now , 
F:  so . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . That 's when I use it too . 
F:  If there was pie again , 
F:  if there was those tarts again , I 'd be like , " Set us some aside some there . " 
F:  But  
F:  I 'm not a big ice cream fan . 
F:  Nah . 
F:  When people get really loopy , 
F:  and start telling lots of jokes , I think . 
F:  I enjoy always transcribing those sections . 
F:  It 's  yeah , it seems to be more at the end . 
F:  Like  
F:  Yeah , yeah . 
F:  Yeah , they 'll be joking around . 
F:  Wait , a favorite what ? 
F:  Oh , you mean like , eh , meeti like  like , um , Meeting Recorder as opposed to EDU as oppo 
F:  Like , those groups ? 
F:  Oh . 
F:  I 've never heard anyone make fun of transcribers . 
F:  No ! 
F:  When you guys were saying that last week , I was like " Never heard that . " 
F:  Yes . 
F:  I did that . 
F:  And whistles . 
F:  He was  it  I  you must have been sittin There was a meeting where there was this guy , 
F:  he was making these funky sounds 
F:  and making funny whistles , 
F:  and you must have been sitting next to him 
F:  cuz you sort of engaged him in a conversation about it . 
F:  And he was like , " Yeah , I can make dogs , uh , raise their ears 
F:  cuz I can whistle so high . " 
F:  And you were like , w " That 's fascinating . " 
F:  I remember that meeting . 
F:  I thought it was pretty funny . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mmm . 
F:  Yeah ! 
F:  Oh , yeah . 
F:  Yeah . Cool ! 
F:  Sure . 
F:  No . 
F:  Sure . 
F:  I mean , just weird things like before  
F:  like , I had kind of a weird thing happen , 
F:  and we 'd talked about it . 
F:  It was when I 'd first started working on the project I got this discussion where  
F:  this was before we had the different channels , 
F:  and , um , Dan Ellis  it was when Dan Ellis was still here 
F:  so it was like kind of early on , right ? 
F:  And , um , 
F:  he  everyone 's talking , 
F:  and then all of the sudden , you hear Dan talking to someone else 
F:  and it 's different people that you 'd never heard before . 
F:  And  and what he had done , is he had left the room to g 
F:  He 'd li and he had brought the microphone with him . 
F:  And this is without the channelized interface . 
F:  So you  you have no idea . 
F:  You think everyone 's just become schizophrenic or something . 
F:  And they 're all like in they 're own r world or something 
F:  because  Then all of the sudden he 's talking about a co he needs a copy machine . 
F:  And I don and I 'm just assuming , well he 's s s still in the room 
F:  and what the heck 's he talking about ? 
F:  But just sort of just weird things like that , 
F:  and , um  Yeah , he had just left the room 
F:  and gone and made a copy 
F:  and he still had his microphone on , 
F:  and then you could hear the  the  the r the women behind the desk talking to him , 
F:  and just sort of stuff like that . 
F:  It was just really bizarre . 
F:  So . 
F:  Anyway . Just sort of weird things like that . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  So . 
F:  They take longer to do . 
F:  In a way they 're more fun , though . 
F:  There 's just more variety . 
F:  Who won't talk . 
F:  And to breathe . 
F:  There 'll be lots of breathing . <laugh> Yeah . 
F:  Did you guys ever , 
F:  when  This happened to me when I first started transcribing , 
F:  cuz I had never really transcribed stuff like this before , 
F:  but , um , 
F:  I would leave here , 
F:  and I would go out and do my daily business , 
F:  and I would hear people speaking to me , 
F:  and I would transcribe them in my head ! 
F:  I 'd imagine what I would type . 
F:  It went away , like maybe after a couple of weeks , 
F:  but it was just bizarre . 
F:  Really ? 
F:  Oh . No , for me it was unconscious . 
F:  It was  I didn't mean for  to be doing it . 
F:  It would just intru it was an intrusion . 
F:  Um , not a te not a bad intrusion , 
F:  but 
F:  not something I was sort of volitionally sort of  
F:  Yes ! 
F:  Yeah ! 
F:  Yeah ! 
F:  Yeah , yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh sure . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Had she changed her perfume ? 
F:  Oh , wow . 
F:  Oof ! 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . Yeah  well , yeah , most of the time when we 're listening to other people 's speech , we 're just trying to get the gist . 
F:  Not literally what people are saying 
F:  and so , 
F:  you know , all the " uh "  " uh 's " and " um 's " , and all those different things , 
F:  we just tune it out , 
F:  yeah . 
F:  And , uh , it 's that top - down thing again . 
F:  Just  
F:  right ? 
F:  In a way . 
F:  Just trying to get the , um , 
F:  you know , what is the p " what is the point of what this person is trying to communicate ? " kind of thing . 
F:  So . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  No . 
F:  I 've heard 
F:  Which I just transcribe as " mouth " . 
F:  I just make a mouth  
F:  Cuz I think I had talked to you about this  about 
F:  what  what did we do  cuz  wha what was it that I  
F:  oh , I was  
F:  " Lipsmack " ! 
F:  I was marking " lipsmack " , 
F:  and  and you said  
F:  yeah , that 's  It 's a different noise , 
F:  but , um , 
F:  it 's what made me think of it , 
F:  but , um , 
F:  and  and you said , " Don't do " lipsmack " , 
F:  just do  we don't need  it 's too specific . 
F:  Just do " mouth " for all tha all those noises " . 
F:  Um  
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Oh , right . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  If it 's surprise then the exclamation point makes sense , too . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Yeah , once , Adam was laughing , 
F:  and it was actually written out phonetically , 
F:  and I changed it . 
F:  I 'm like " it 's just laughing " . 
F:  Like somebody had written , like " hyuh - hyuh " or  or  or something . 
F:  And  
F:  Yeah , i I  it was maybe Tigerfish had done something 
F:  like they had written out a phonetic laugh , 
F:  and they didn't do it at any other place in the transcript . 
F:  It was just that one spot . 
F:  It was just a regular old vanilla laugh , you know . 
F:  It wasn't anything special . 
F:  Well  
F:  well , here 's a question , 
F:  and there 's been some variance in transcripts that I 've looked at . 
F:  When  
F:  OK . 
F:  So when you laugh , you 're exhaling all this air , 
F:  and so you need to i inhale , 
F:  and  so how do you transcribe the inhale ? 
F:  Some people are transcribing it as a breath . 
F:  I I used to , you know , back in the day  back when I was do transcribing , I would do the whole thing as a laugh 
F:  because to me the breath is part of the laugh . 
F:  Um , so  cuz i cuz in the ones I 've been che the one I 've been checking actually right now , that breath gets marked as a breath , 
F:  and I 've been taking them out . 
F:  So that 's OK ? 
F:  Actually , it 'd be a " laugh " 
F:  and then two dots , 
F:  like the next bin will be empty , 
F:  and then it 'll be " breath " . 
F:  And so it 'll be that  
F:  it 'll be three d sort of separate units as opposed to  I think it 's sort of one coherent thing . 
F:  So . 
F:  Oh , well , yeah , that 's  that 's a different thing . 
F:  Yeah . S cuz sometimes it 's not clear . 
F:  Like sometimes " Hhh ! " is a laugh . 
F:  Um , and if other people are laughing , then I 'll usually give them  and say that they 're laughing . 
F:  Mm - hmm . Exactly . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  So . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Good . OK . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  Well they give the segmenter , though  
F:  cuz they don't have the  the rich interface that we do , 
F:  so the they must be giving the pre - segmenter sort of the benefit of the doubt , 
F:  " Well , there must be something there , um , whether I can hear it or not . " 
F:  So , they just say , " Well , it 's a breath then " . 
F:  Yes ! 
F:  That 's true . 
F:  Hmm . 
F:  Well , frequently that 'll also be a misattribution too , of voice . 
F:  Cuz then you 'll hear <laugh>  you 'll hear part of what another person is saying and th tha and that 's all transcribed on that one level , 
F:  but then you 'll hear a little bit of it and then " missing segment " . 
F:  It 's like , " OK , well they just  it 's in the wrong  
F:  That person 's not talking at all " . 
F:  So , you just get rid of it . 
F:  So . 
F:  Hmm ! 
F:  Oh , yeah . That 's true . 
F:  Oh yeah , that 's totally not true . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  It 's rare . 
F:  Yeah . 
F:  I was wondering who had been putting those in . 
F:  Yes . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Man ! 
F:  I do that too ! 
F:  I used to do that ! 
F:  A lot of time . 
F:  Yeah . Like a  a skull and crossbones . 
F:  It 's not  i it 's  
F:  Yeah . 
F:  It 's not like you said the F - word . 
F:  It 's not  it 's not an  
F:  it 's still a PG  
F:  She 's pretty darn sure that , uh , 
F:  she could make it out probably . 
F:  Yeah , no one 's ever sworn in any of the meetings ! 
F:  That actually  
F:  Not the swearword version . 
F:  Just " shoot " . 
F:  That 's OK . 
F:  Hmm ! 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Right . 
F:  Oh . 
F:  Wait , wait . How do you mark it ? 
F:  Oh , I see . 
F:  OK . 
F:  And then do " QUAL mumbled " or " QUAL whispered " or something . 
F:  I see . 
F:  OK . 
F:  Hmm ! 
F:  Mm - hmm . 
F:  Good . 
F:  Good . 
F:  Do you wanna read digits ? 
F:  Do you wanna do that ? 
F:  No ? 
F:  Well , we did it in unison last time . 
F:  Sure did . 
F:  Oh , and do you want us to mark the t roughly the time we start ? 
F:  Oh , OK . 
F:  So we have to  
F:  Sure . 
F:  No problem .
