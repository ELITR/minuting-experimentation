E:  Well , if you insist , then . 
E:  This is just one sheet , right ? 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Sure . 
E:  Extremely . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  That 's the idea . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , yeah . 
E:  It 's  that now , um , I 'm mentioned this , 
E:  I  I don't know if I ever explained this 
E:  but the point of , um , 
E:  I mentioned in the last meeting ,  the point of having something called " nominal expression " is , um , 
E:  because it seems like having the verb subcategorize for , you know , like say taking as its object just some expression which , um , designates an object or designates a thing , or whatever , um , that leads to some syntactic problems basically ? 
E:  So you wanna , you know  you sort of have this problem like " OK , well , I 'll put the word " , uh , let 's say , the word " dog " , 
E:  you know . And that has to come right after the verb 
E:  cuz we know verb meets its object . 
E:  And then we have a construction that says , oh , you can have " the " preceding a noun . 
E:  And so you 'd have this sort of problem that the verb has to meet the designatum . 
E:  And you could get , you know , " the kicked dog " or something like that , meaning " kicked the dog " . 
E:  Um , so you kind of have to let this phrase idea in there 
E:  but  
E:  It - it 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I mean , we  we  we sort of thought we were getting away with , uh  with , a p 
E:  I mean , this is not reverting to the X - bar theory of  of phrase structure . 
E:  But , uh , 
E:  I just know that this is  Like , we didn't originally have in mind that , uh  that verbs would subcategorize for a particular sort of form . 
E:  Um , 
E:  but they does . 
E:  At least in English . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  So what 's the  what 's the time frame ? 
E:  I forgot again when 
E:  you 're going away for how long ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yes . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  N 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I mean , I 'm  I 'm s curious about how much of the mental  
E:  I mean , I 'm not sure that the formalism , sort of the grammatical side of things ,  is gonna have that much going on in terms of the mental space stuff . 
E:  You know , um , basically all of these so - called space builders that are in the sentence are going to sort of  
E:  I think of it as , sort of giving you the coordinates of , you know  
E:  assuming that at any point in discourse there 's the possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different world scenarios , whatever , and the speaker 's supposed to be keeping track of those . The , um  the construction that you actually get is just gonna sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you 've already got going , um , you 're supposed to add structure to . 
E:  So " in France , uh , Watergate wouldn't have hurt Nixon " or something like that . 
E:  Um , well , you say , " alright , I 'm supposed to add some structure to my model of this hypothetical past France universe " or something like that . 
E:  The information in the sentence tells you that much 
E:  but it doesn't tell you like exactly what it  what the point of doing so is . 
E:  So for example , depending on the linguistic con uh , context it could be  
E:  like the question is for example , what does " Watergate " refer to there ? 
E:  Does it , you know  does it refer to , um  
E:  if you just hear that sentence cold , the assumption is that when you say " Watergate " you 're referring to " a Watergate - like scandal as we might imagine it happening in France " . 
E:  But in a different context , " oh , you know , if Nixon had apologized right away it wouldn't  you know , Watergate wouldn't have hurt him so badly in the US 
E:  and in France it wouldn't have hurt him at all " . 
E:  Now we 're s now that " Watergate "  we 're now talking about the real one , 
E:  and the " would " sort of  it 's a sort of different dimension of hypothe - theticality , right ? 
E:  We 're not saying  What 's hypothetical about this world . 
E:  In the first case , hypothetically we 're imagining that Watergate happened in France . 
E:  In the second case we 're imagining hypothetically that Nixon had apologized right away 
E:  or something . Right ? 
E:  So a lot of this isn't happening at the grammatical level . 
E:  Uh , um , and so  
E:  I don't know where that sits then , 
E:  sort of the idea of sorting out what the person meant . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  But the whole point of  the whole point of what Fauconnier and Turner have to say about , uh , mental spaces , and blending , and all that stuff is that you don't really get that much out of the sentence . 
E:  You know , there 's not that much information contained in the sentence . 
E:  It just says , " Here . 
E:  Add this structure to this space . " 
E:  and exactly what that means for the overall ongoing interpretation is quite open . 
E:  An individual sentence could mean a hundred different things depending on , quote , " what the space configuration is at the time of utterance " . 
E:  And so somebody 's gonna have to be doing a whole lot of work but not me , I think . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Sure , but like what  what was the point of saying that sentence about Nixon and France ? 
E:  That is not  there is nothing about that in the  in the sentence really . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Y yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Oh , yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Light up with focus , yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Oh , there 's a bunch . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Right . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , I mean , I  I 'm sort of inclined to say let 's worry about specifying the information structure focus of the sentence 
E:  and then , 
E:  hhh ,  the phonology component can handle actually assigning an intonation contour to that . 
E:  You know , I mean , later on we 'll worry about exactly how  
E:  y Yeah . 
E:  Exactly . 
E:  But figure out how the  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Japanese has this though . 
E:  You know . 
E:  Yeah , that 's what " wa " is , 
E:  uh , just to mark which thing is the topic . 
E:  It doesn't always have to be the subject . 
E:  OK , side one . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Right , " this guy I know from school came for dinner " does not mean , um , " there 's a guy , I know him from school , 
E:  and he came over for dinner " . 
E:  That 's not the same effect . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Sure . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  So the difference is basically whether you thought it was obvious what the possible fillers were . 
E:  OK . 
E:  " Whee ! " 
E:  That 's that one , right ? 
E:  So , <breath> I 'm still just really not clear on what I 'm looking at . 
E:  The " scenario " box , 
E:  like , what does that look like for an example ? 
E:  Like , not all of these things are gonna be here . 
E:  This is just basically says 
E:  " part of what I 'm going to hand you is a whole bunch of s uh , schemas , image , and X - schemas . 
E:  Here are some examples of the sorts of things you might have in there " . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Do you have to say about the binding in your  
E:  is there a slot in here for  that tells you how the bindings are done ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Right . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Well that 's  
E:  Uh - huh . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Um . y 
E:  Right . That makes sense . 
E:  So I mean , there 's this stuff in the  off in the scenario , 
E:  which just tells you how various  what schemas you 're using 
E:  and they 're  how they 're bound together . 
E:  And I guess that some of the discourse segment stuff  
E:  is that where you would sa 
E:  I mean , that 's  
E:  OK , that 's where the information structure is 
E:  which sort of is a kind of profiling on different parts of , um , of this . 
E:  I mean , what 's interesting is that the information structure stuff  
E:  Hmm . 
E:  There 's almost  I mean , we keep coming back to how focus is like this  this , uh , trajector - landmark thing . 
E:  So if I say , um , You know , " In France it 's like this " . 
E:  You know , great , 
E:  we 've learned something about France 
E:  but the fact is that utterances of that sort are generally used to help you draw a conclusion also about some implicit contrast , 
E:  like " In France it 's like this " . 
E:  And therefore you 're supposed to say , " Boy , life sure  " 
E:  You know , " in France kids are allowed to drink at age three " . 
E:  And w you 're  that 's not just a fact about France . 
E:  You also conclude something about how boring it is here in the U S . Right ? 
E:  And so  
E:  OK . 
E:  That comes in 
E:  and , uh  
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK , what was the name ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mats Gould . 
E:  Hmm . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK , thanks . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  There 's things like ther you know , there 's all kinds of stuff like , um , in  I think I mentioned last time in Czech if you have a  a verb of saying then 
E:  um , you know , you say something like  or  or I was thinking you can say something like , " oh , I thought , uh , you are a republican " or something like that . 
E:  Where as in English you would say , " I thought you were " . 
E:  Um , you know , sort of the past tense being copied onto the lower verb doesn't happen there , 
E:  so you have to say something about , you know , tense is determined relative to current blah - blah - blah . 
E:  Same things happens with pronouns . 
E:  There 's languages where , um , 
E:  if you have a verb of saying then , 
E:  ehhh , 
E:  where  
E:  OK , so a situation like " Bob said he was going to the movies " , where that lower subject is the same as the person who was saying or thinking , you 're actually required to have " I " there . 
E:  Um , and it 's sort of in an extended function  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  But it 's not perceived as a quotative construction . 
E:  I mean , it 's been analyzed by the formalists as being a logophoric pronoun , 
E:  um which means a pronoun which refers back to the person who is speaking or that sort of thing , right ? 
E:  Um , 
E:  but  uh , that happens to sound like the word for " I " 
E:  but is actually semantically unrelated to it . 
E:  Um , 
E:  Yeah . <laugh> Yeah . 
E:  There 's a whole book which basically operates on this assumption . 
E:  Uh , Mary Dalrymple , 
E:  uh , this book , a ninety - three book on , uh on pronoun stuff . 
E:  Well , yeah . And then the same thing for ASL 
E:  where , you know , you 're signing 
E:  and someone says something . 
E:  And then , you know , so " he say " , and then you sort of do a role shift . 
E:  And then you sign " I , this , that , and the other " . 
E:  And you know , " I did this " . 
E:  That 's also been analyzed as logophoric and having nothing to do with " I " . 
E:  And the role shift thing is completely left out and so on . 
E:  So , 
E:  I mean , the point is that pronoun references , uh , you know , sort of ties in with all this mental space stuff and so on , and so forth . 
E:  And so , yeah , I mean  
E:  Right . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  It 's like  it 's like what 's happening  that , yeah , what what 's happening , uh , there is that you 're moving the base space or something like that , right ? 
E:  So that 's  that 's how Fauconnier would talk about it . 
E:  And it happens diff under different circumstances in different languages . 
E:  And so , 
E:  um , things like pronoun reference and tense which we 're thinking of as being these discourse - y things actually are relative to a Bayes space 
E:  which can change . 
E:  And we need all the same machinery . 
E:  Schade . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , I mean  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Y 
E:  Yeah , it 's an  it 's an evidential . 
E:  It 's sort of semi - grammaticalized . 
E:  People have talked about it this way . 
E:  And you know , you can do sort of special things . 
E:  You can , th 
E:  put just the phrase " I think " as a parenthetical in the middle of a sentence and so on , and so forth . 
E:  So  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Um . 
E:  Well we were just talking about this sort of evidentiality and stuff like that , right ? 
E:  I mean , 
E:  that 's what I think is , 
E:  um , sort of telling you what percent reality you should give this 
E:  or the , you know  
E:  Yeah , 
E:  and the fact that I 'm , you know  the fact maybe if I think it versus he thinks that might , you know , depending on how much you trust the two of us or whatever , 
E:  you know  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  He wrote a paper about thirty - five years ago on that one . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Would you believe that that paper lead directly to the development of anti - lock brakes ? 
E:  Ask me about it later 
E:  I 'll tell you how . 
E:  When we 're not on tape . 
E:  I don't really know what like  
E:  We  we don't have to care too much about the speaker attitude , right ? 
E:  Like there 's not so many different  
E:  hhh ,  I don't know , m 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  I just mean  
E:  There 's lots of different attitudes that  that the speaker could have and that we can clearly identify , and so on , and so forth . 
E:  But like what are the distinctions among those that we actually care about for our current purposes ? 
E:  Oh , shoot . 
E:  Here it is three - fifteen already . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Right . 
E:  We have a theoretical model of sarcasm now . 
E:  Yeah , right , I mean . 
E:  Mmm . 
E:  OK . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah , OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  In case there 's any around . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Basically . 
E:  Exactly . 
E:  Yeah , yeah , we 'll start with that , 
E:  just figuring out what needs to be done 
E:  then actually the next step is to start trying to do it . 
E:  Got it . 
E:  OK . 
E:  You ran out of power . 
E:  No . 
E:  Um , yeah , there should be  I  I wanted to s find out someday if there was gonna be some way of dealing with , uh , if this is the right term , multiple inheritance , 
E:  where one construction is inheriting from , uh from both parents , 
E:  uh , or different ones , 
E:  or three or four different ones . 
E:  Cuz the problem is that then you have to  
E:  which of  you know , which are  how they 're getting bound together . 
E:  OK . 
E:  Yeah , yes . 
E:  That 's right . 
E:  But whatever . 
E:  Yeah , no , no , no no . 
E:  No , by all means , 
E:  right . Uh , sure . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah , that 's  
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Connect the dots . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yep . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Mm - hmm . 
E:  Yeah . 
E:  Fine with me . 
E:  Should we do the one PM time 
E:  for Thursday since we were on that before 
E:  or  ? 
E:  OK . 
E:  To me this is equal . 
E:  I don't care . 
E:  Well , if you insist , then .
