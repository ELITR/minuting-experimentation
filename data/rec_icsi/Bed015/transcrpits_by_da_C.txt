C:  Alright . 
C:  Oh right . 
C:  What I was gonna  
C:  Right . 
C:  Oh , I see . 
C:  So  so the current syntax is if it s if there 's a type it 's before construct 
C:  OK , that 's fine . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Good . 
C:  Well , you definitely want to de - couple the formalism from the parsing strategy . 
C:  So that whether or not it 's used for matching or only for verification , I  
C:  s For sure . 
C:  I mean , I don't know what , uh , term we want to use 
C:  but we don't want to  
C:  Yep . 
C:  It 's g it 's gone . 
C:  Th 
C:  I know . 
C:  Anyway , so the other  the other strategy you guys could consider is when you don't know what word to put , you could put no word , 
C:  just meaning . 
C:  OK ? 
C:  And the then let  
C:  OK . 
C:  Oh , whatever . 
C:  Or  wh 
C:  That - b 
C:  Right . 
C:  Minor  min problem  
C:  OK . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Good . 
C:  A a and the  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  And there 's  uh there 's ca some cases where the grammar depends on some form property of the head . 
C:  And  and this enables you to get that , if I understand you right . 
C:  Yeah yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  OK , so that all looks good . 
C:  Let me  
C:  Oh , w Oh . 
C:  I don't know . 
C:  Were you finished ? 
C:  OK . 
C:  So , i if I understand this the  
C:  aside from , uh , construed and all that sort of stuff , the  the differences are mainly that , <mouth> we 've gone to the possibility of having form - meaning pairs for a type 
C:  or actually gone back to , 
C:  if we go back far enough  
C:  Oh , I see . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
C:  I 'm sorry , 
C:  you 're right . 
C:  A construction type . 
C:  Uh , that 's fine . 
C:  But it , um  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  No , no , no , I don't think so . 
C:  I think that you 'll  you 'll do fine . 
C:  In fact , these are , um , 
C:  as long as  as Mark isn't around , these are form constraints . 
C:  So a nominal expression is  uh , the fact that it 's animate , is semantic . 
C:  The fact that it 's n uh , a nominal expression I would say on most people 's notion of  of f you know , higher form types , this i this is one . 
C:  And I think that 's just fine . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  That I  I have no problem with it at all . 
C:  I think it 's fine . 
C:  Right . 
C:  But they do . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  But it  y y it 's  yeah , just moving it  moving the c the cons the constraints around . 
C:  OK , so that 's  
C:  Right . 
C:  And so that was the  
C:  OK , and sort of going with that is that the designatum also now is a pair . 
C:  Instead of just the meaning . 
C:  And that aside from some terminology , that 's basically it . 
C:  I just want to b I 'm  I 'm asking . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  The whole  the mental space thing is clearly not here . 
C:  By the way , I do want to get on that as soon as Robert gets back . 
C:  So , uh , the  the mental space thing . 
C:  Um , obviously , <mouth> construal is a b is a b is a big component of that 
C:  so this probably not worth trying to do anything till he gets back . 
C:  But sort of as soon as he gets back I think um , we ought to  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  And furthermore it 's well worth missing . 
C:  Right . 
C:  OK , so that 's great . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  I think that 's exactly right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah .  No , I think  I think that i we 'll have to see how it works out when we do the details 
C:  but my intuition would be that that 's right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Good . 
C:  Correct . 
C:  Yeah , in the short run all we need is a enough mechanism on the form side to get things going . 
C:  Uh , I  uh , you  you  
C:  Well  
C:  I think that 's right . 
C:  Oh , I  yeah , I , uh , uh  I think that 's  Not k I th 
C:  I don't think it 's completely right . 
C:  I mean , in fact a sentence examples you gave in f did constrain the meaning b 
C:  the form did constrain the meaning , 
C:  and so , um , it isn't , uh  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  But  but  bottom line , I agree with you , 
C:  that  that  that we 're not expecting much out of the , uh f 
C:  uh , the purely form cues , yeah . 
C:  And , um  I mean , you 're  you 're the linguist 
C:  but , uh , it seems to me that th these  we  we  you know , we 've talked about maybe a half a dozen linguistics theses in the last few minutes or something . 
C:  Yeah , I mean  
C:  uh , I  I mean , that  that 's my feeling that  that these are really hard uh , problems that decide exactly what  what 's going on . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Uh , right , right , right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Does that  Is that really what they mean in  in  

C:  I didn't know that . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right , OK . 
C:  Well , I 'll check . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  N no , no . 
C:  Well , uh , th critically they 're not required syntactically . 
C:  Often they 're pres presu presupposed and all that sort of stuff . 
C:  Right , there 's  
C:  Right . 
C:  Or  I mean , or  or , uh 
C:  so the  
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  It 's  it 's his thesis , right ? 
C:  Anyway , 
C:  right , yeah , w this is gonna be a b 
C:  you 're right , this is a bit of in a mess 
C:  and we still have emphasis as well , or stress , or whatever . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Great . 
C:  I  that 's fine . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Good . 
C:  Yeah , so b b but I think the poi 
C:  I 'm not sure I understand 
C:  but here 's what I th think is going on . 
C:  That if we do the constructions right when a particular construction matches , it  the fact that it matches , does in fact specify the focus . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Uh  k uh , at at the very least it constrai 
C:  Oh , uh , for sure , yes . 
C:  There are constrai yeah , it 's not every  but there are constructions , uh , where you t explicitly take into account those considerations 
C:  that you need to take into account in order to decide which  what is being focused . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah , all  all of those . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  So , the question is actually  
C:  oh , I 'm sorry , 
C:  go ahead , 
C:  finish . 
C:  S s the question is , do we have a way on the other page , uh , when we get to the s semantic side , of saying what the stressed element was , or stressed phrase , or something . 
C:  Right . 
C:  So that 's down at the bottom here when we get over there . 
C:  OK . 
C:  I 'll - I 'll wait . 
C:  OK . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Yep , it 's there . 
C:  Right . 
C:  This  
C:  Uh  yeah , well there  there seems to be context properties . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well , uh , uh , this is recursive 
C:  cuz until we do the uh , mental space story , we 're not quite sure   Th - th 
C:  which is fine . 
C:  We 'll just  we 'll j 
C:  we just don't know yet . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Semantically . 
C:  N now , for the moment we just need the ability to l l write it down if  if somebody figured out what the rules were . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  No , I th I think at this lev which is  it should be where you have it . 
C:  I mean , how you get it may  may in will often involve the discourse 
C:  but  but  by the time you 're simulating you sh y you should know that . 
C:  Correct . 
C:  W it c 
C:  No , no , no . 
C:  I  let 's see , I think we 're  we 're not  
C:  I don't think we have it quite right yet . 
C:  So , uh , what this is , 
C:  let 's suppose for the moment it 's complete . 
C:  OK , uh , then this says that when an analysis is finished , the whole analysis is finished ,  you 'll have as a result , uh , some s resulting s semspec for that utterance in context , 
C:  which is made up entirely of these things and , uh , bindings among them . 
C:  And bindings to ontology items . 
C:  So that  that the who that this is the tool kit under whi out of which you can make a semantic specification . 
C:  So that 's A . 
C:  But B , which is more relevant to your life , is this is also the tool kit that is used in the semantic side of constructions . 
C:  So this is an that anything you have , in the party line ,  anything you have as the semantic side of constructions comes , from pieces of this  ignoring li 
C:  I mean , in general , you ignore lots of it . 
C:  But it 's got to be pieces of this along with constraints among them . 
C:  Uh , so that the , you know , goal of the , uh uh , " source , path , goal " has to be the landmark of the conta you know , the interior of this container . 
C:  Or whate whatever . 
C:  So those constraints appear in constructions 
C:  but pretty much this is the full range of semantic structures available to you . 
C:  OK , good . 
C:  Let 's  let 's mark that . 
C:  So we need a c 
C:  Right . 
C:  And  and  and  and this  this  this again may ge our , um  and we  and  and , of course , worlds . 
C:  Right . 
C:  S right . 
C:  So  so , " want " itself can be   i i i i i 
C:  Well , and it i basically it 's an action . 
C:  In  in our s in our  in our  
C:  in  in our  in our s terminology , " want " can be an action 
C:  and " what you want " is a world . 
C:  So that 's  I mean , it 's certainly one way to do it . 
C:  Yeah , there  there are other things . 
C:  Causal stuff we absolutely need . 
C:  Mental space we need . 
C:  The context we need . 
C:  Um , so anyway , Keith  
C:  So is this comfortable to you 
C:  that , uh , once we have this defined , it is your tool kit for building the semantic part of constructions . 
C:  And then when we combine constructions semantically , the goal is going to be to fill out more and more of the bindings needed in order to come up with the final one . 
C:  And that 's the wh and  and I mean , that  according to the party line , that 's the whole story . 
C:  Right . 
C:  S Swede ? 
C:  Dutch ? 
C:  Oh , Dutch . 
C:  Uh - huh . 
C:  Now , this is  this is assuming you 've already solved that . 
C:  So it 's  it 's Fred and Mary , 
C:  so the speaker would be Fred 
C:  and the  
C:  Mmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Well , here  
C:  Uh  
C:  Yeah . 
C:  That 's right . 
C:  So  so again , this  uh , this  this is gonna to get us into the mental space stuff 
C:  and t because you know , " Fred said that Mary said  " , and whatever . 
C:  And  and so we 're , uh gonna have to , um , chain those as well . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  I  I think , uh  
C:  Except s it 's  it 's trickier than that 
C:  because um , the reference for example  
C:  So he where it gets really tricky is there 's some things , 
C:  and this is where blends and all terribl 
C:  So , some things which really are meant to be identified and some things which aren't . 
C:  And again , all we need for the moment is some way to say that . 
C:  You could do that . 
C:  uh - huh . 
C:  I just had a  I just had an  an idea that would be very nice if it works . 
C:  Uh , uh , uh , I haven't told you what it is yet . 
C:  This was my build - up . 
C:  An i an idea that would be nice i 
C:  Right . 
C:  If it worked . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Right , it was a space builder . 
C:  Um , we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces 
C:  because , uh , you have somewhat the same things going on of , uh , things being accessible or not . 
C:  And so , i 
C:  it c it  it , uh I think if we did it right we might be able to get at least a lot of the same structure . 
C:  So that pulling something out of a discourse context is I think similar to other kinds of , uh , mental space phenomena . 
C:  Uh , I 've  I 've  I 've never seen anybody write that up 
C:  but maybe they did . 
C:  I don't know . 
C:  That may be all over the literature . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  So we would have it be in quotes in English . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  OK . 
C:  Oh , good , I love the formali 
C:  So that  that d that does sound like it 's co consistent with what we 're saying , yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Oh , OK , so this  this is worth some thought . 
C:  Well , but , uh , this is very good actually 
C:  cuz it  it  it  to the extent that it works , it y 
C:  it  it ties together several of  of these things . 
C:  No , but there 's  there 's a Gricean thing going on there , 
C:  that when you say " I think " you 're actually hedging . 
C:  Right . 
C:  So we don't have that in here either do we ? 
C:  Yeah , yeah . 
C:  So we probably should . 
C:  Confidence or something like that . 
C:  About . 
C:  Oh , that  in that use of " about " , yeah . 
C:  And I think  And I think  y if you want us to spend a pleasant six or seven hours you could get George started on that . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  No . 
C:  There 's all that stuff . 
C:  Yeah , let 's  I  I don't  I think  
C:  Yeah , I mean  
C:  Right . 
C:  Right , so , uh , this  this raises the question of what are our current purposes . 
C:  Right ? 
C:  Uh , so , um , 
C:  I  I don't know the answer 
C:  but  but , um , it does seem that , 
C:  you know , this is  this is coming along . 
C:  I think it 's  it 's converging . 
C:  It 's  as far as I can tell there 's this one major thing we have to do 
C:  which is the mental  the whole s mental space thing . 
C:  And then there 's some other minor things . 
C:  Um , and we 're going to have to s sort of bound the complexity . 
C:  I mean , if we get everything that anybody ever thought about you know , w we 'll go nuts . 
C:  So we had started with the idea that the actual , uh , constraint was related to this tourist domain 
C:  and the kinds of interactions that might occur in the tourist domain , 
C:  assuming that people were being helpful and weren't trying to d 
C:  you know , there 's all sorts of  God knows , irony , and stuff like  
C:  which you  isn't probably of much use in dealing with a tourist guide . 
C:  Yeah ? 
C:  Uh . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Whatever . 
C:  So 
C:  y uh , no end of things th that  that , you know , we don't deal with . 
C:  And  
C:  Go ahead . 
C:  N no . 
C:  No . 
C:  No . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  No , no . 
C:  Anyway , so  so , um , I guess 
C:  uh , let me make a proposal on how to proceed on that , 
C:  which is that , um , 
C:  it was Keith 's , uh , sort of job over the summer to come up with this set of constructions . 
C:  Uh , and my suggestion to Keith is that you , over the next couple weeks , n 
C:  don't try to do them in detail or formally 
C:  but just try to describe which ones you think we ought to have . 
C:  Uh , and then when Robert gets back we 'll look at the set of them . 
C:  Just  just sort of , you know , define your space . 
C:  And , um , so th these are  this is a set of things that I think we ought to deal with . 
C:  And then we 'll  we 'll  we 'll go back over it 
C:  and w people will  will give feedback on it . 
C:  And then  then we 'll have a  at least initial spec of  of what we 're actually trying to do . 
C:  And that 'll also be useful for anybody who 's trying to write a parser . 
C:  Knowing uh  
C:  Right , 
C:  " who might want " 
C:  et cetera . 
C:  So , uh  
C:  So a and we get this  this , uh , portals fixed 
C:  and then we have an idea of the sort of initial range . 
C:  And then of course Nancy you 're gonna have to , uh , do your set of  
C:  but you have to do that anyway . 
C:  So  so we 're gonna get the w we 're basically dealing with two domains , 
C:  the tourist domain and the  and the child language learning . 
C:  And we 'll see what we need for those two . 
C:  And then my proposal would be to , um , not totally cut off more general discussion 
C:  but to focus really detailed work on the subset of things that we 've  we really want to get done . 
C:  And then as a kind of separate thread , think about the more general things and  and all that . 
C:  Uh , without doubt . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  But what I want to do is  is  is to  to constrain the things that we really feel responsible for . 
C:  So that  that we say these are the things we 're really gonna try do by the end of the summer 
C:  and other things we 'll put on a list of  of research problems or something , 
C:  because you can easily get to the point where nothing gets done 
C:  because every time you start to do something you say , " oh , yeah , but what about this case ? " 
C:  This is  this is called being a linguist . 
C:  And , uh , 
C:  Huh ? 
C:  Right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  But anyway . 
C:  So , is  is that  does that make sense as a , uh  a general way to proceed ? 
C:  Exactly right . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  Yeah , uh  
C:  yeah . 
C:  Mm - hmm . 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  So let me  
C:  Yeah , right , right , right . 
C:  Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Yeah . So what I would like to do is separate that problem out . 
C:  So um , 
C:  my argument is there 's nothing you can do with that that you can't do by just having more constructions . 
C:  It 's uglier and it d doesn't have the deep linguistic insights and stuff . 
C:  Uh , 
C:  Right . 
C:  And so I  what I 'd like to do is  is in the short run focus on getting it right . 
C:  And when we think we have it right then saying , " aha ! , 
C:  can we make it more elegant ? " 
C:  Can  can we , uh  What are the generalizations , and stuff ? 
C:  But rather than try to guess a inheritance structure and all that sort of stuff before we know what we 're doing . 
C:  So I would say in the short run we 're not gonna b 
C:  First of all , we 're not doing them yet at all . 
C:  And  and it could be that half way through we say , " aha ! , 
C:  we  we now see how we want to clean it up . " 
C:  Uh , and inheritance is only one  I mean , that 's one way to organize it 
C:  but there are others . 
C:  And it may or may not be the best way . 
C:  I 'm sorry , 
C:  you had news . 
C:  Great . 
C:  W what  
C:  Yeah , sure , tell us what it is . 
C:  Mmm , 
C:  right . 
C:  Right . 
C:  Um , it sounds to me like you want P R 
C:  Beca - because it  b because  
C:  No , no , you can't . 
C:  See the  the critical thing about the PRM is it gives these relations in general form . 
C:  So once you have instantiated the PRM with the instances and ther then you can  then you can unfold it . 
C:  Well , no , but it matters a lot 
C:  because you  what you want are these generalized rules 
C:  about the way things relate , 
C:  th that you then instantiate in each case . 
C:  Yeah , and that 's  
C:  Yeah , that 's the only way it could work . 
C:  I  we have a  our local expert on P R 
C:  uh , but my guess is that they 're not currently good enough to do that . 
C:  But we 'll  we 'll have to see . 
C:  Uh  
C:  Yes . 
C:  This is  that 's  that would be a good thing to try . 
C:  It 's related to the Hobbs abduction story 
C:  in that you th you throw everything into a pot 
C:  and you try to come up with the , uh  
C:  No , there isn't a theorem prover 
C:  but there  but  but the , um , The cove the  the P R Ms are like rules of inference 
C:  and you 're  you 're coupling a bunch of them together . 
C:  And then ins instead of proving you 're trying to , you know , compute the most likely . 
C:  Uh  
C:  Tricky . 
C:  But you  yeah , it 's a good  it 's a  it 's a good thing to put in your thesis proposal . 
C:  So are you gonna write something for us before you go ? 
C:  Oh , you have something . 
C:  OK . 
C:  So , what 's  what  when are we gonna meet again ? 
C:  Yeah . 
C:  N no , I didn't mean y just the two of us . 
C:  We  obviously we can  we can do this . 
C:  But the question is do you want to , for example , send the little group , uh , a draft of your thesis proposal 
C:  and get , uh , another session on feedback on that ? 
C:  Or  
C:  Alright . 
C:  OK . 
C:  OK . 
C:  That - that 'll tell him exactly what 's going on . 
C:  Yeah , that  
C:  Alright .
