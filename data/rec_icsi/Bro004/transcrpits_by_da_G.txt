G:  Do we  Do we have that big new IBM machine 
G:  the , I think in th 
G:  And if we can do things on Linux ,  some of the machines we have going already , like Swede ? 
G:  Um It seems pretty fast . 
G:  But  I think Fudge is pretty fast too . 
G:  I is it um  mostly um the neural network trainings that are  um slowing us down or the HTK runs that are slowing us down ? 
G:  Because , um  I think that 'll be running Linux , 
G:  and Sw - Swede and Fudge are already running Linux 
G:  so ,  um I could try to get  um the train the neural network trainings or the HTK stuff running under Linux , and to start with I 'm  wondering which one I should pick first . 
G:  OK .
