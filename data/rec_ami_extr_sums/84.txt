A:  Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one . 

A:  And  take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . 

A:  and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , 

A:  So the popularity of the  since the popularity of the internet , 

A:  so the remote control should be only used for the the television . 

C:  <laugh> Right , so um I will talk about the the w working design and  

C:  So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do . 

C:  I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market 

C:  And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that . 

C:  So , wha what I think <laugh> for now <laugh> is <other> we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired 

D:  One is a communication . 

C:  and the the th red um  sorry the green one is is to  well , putting things together , 

C:  I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for <laugh> for the functionalities which is easy to to t 

B:  What is F_P_G_A_ ? 

D:  It's a field programmable gateway arrays . 

B:  So why's it  how is it different from the Bluetooth ? 

C:  Well , uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can  pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want . 

B:  So this are the  they have to work together ? 

C:  Well , th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send . 

D:  Or it's something like  isn't hardware the first one ? 

D:  Okay , and how about the battery power ? 

C:  I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the  

C:  And uh I I don't think it will need um <other> very uh much power to make it run , so  

B:  Mm . You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it . 

C:  It's a good idea . 

D:  Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . 

B:  Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ? 

D:  we do not want to make it P_D_A_ . <laugh> 

C:  Also , but but <laugh> I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote <laugh> control . 

B:  So I'm working on the technical functions design . 

B:  and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . 

A:  This are usual functionality  . 

B:  Ours is a bit uh different . 

A:  And they are small  . 

B:  O on the right I tried to play with <other> the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number 

B:  And then I I look at the user manual 

B:  and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end  in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ 

A:  What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ 

B:  Yeah , all the processing is done  the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the  <laugh> 

A:  So we should have specific T_V_ ? 

C:  We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too . <laugh> 

B:  <laugh> Yeah because  <laugh> are you just wondering what controller  okay . 

C:  I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that 

B:  So I come up with a simple design , 

C:  Yes , that's a good idea , I think . 

D:  Oh , but you have a catch there , 

C:  Well , then y you you go to the main menu 

B:  No , because you choose by channel , 

B:  so you don't have hundred channels to choose from . 

C:   but uh I I think i i  if you if you want to to make uh  well a a big jump <laugh>  but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could  

C:  but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , 

C:  we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that . 

B:  Uh it's gonna be small . 

B:  So it'll beep if you wanna find it 

D:  too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . <laugh> 

B:  you just uh shout  y h just  

D:   just  give it a name and we call him . 

B:  <laugh> And  responds to you , and  <laugh> 

D:  Okay , after having the inputs from <other> industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . 

C:  Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts 

B:  But I think if you  to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem . 

D:  Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . 

C:  And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons 

D:  It's going to be very slim . 

D:   it's not going to take much space also . 

D:  It has to be of course a very slim and small one . 

D:  And next one was the size of the remote control . 

D:  And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , 

D:  I mean we have to look for a trade-off . 

B:  <other> I no  I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost . 

D:  Little bit more if it's with extra features . 

C:  Yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think  

D:  I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . 

D:  but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . 

D:  And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages . 

C:  we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well  yes a microphone into the the remote control , so  

A:  What about lighting adaptive options ? 

D:  Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but <other> I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . 

A:  According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that . 

B:  but it's quite possible 

A:  So any things to to discuss ? 

D:  I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing . 

C:  Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? 

C:  Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh <other> about a way to to access the internet via the television . 

C:  Yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . 

A:  So you have to anticipate the the future ? 

C:  well , not not to implement it , 

B:  Yeah . Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital , right . 

A:  Okay . So let's go for the the lunch break ,
