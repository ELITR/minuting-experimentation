A:  Okay . So first , <other> let's uh see the prototype . 

C:  And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this <other> jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . <other> 

C:  So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume . 

C:  And we have speech recognition . 

D:  <laugh> Oh , these are strawberries . <laugh> 

C:  <other> Material , we want to stick to titanium . 

C:  So , we want to have <other> simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones . 

C:  And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours . 

A:  wh what are the strawberries for ? <laugh> 

B:  That's location sensors . 

A:  let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium . <laugh> 

D:  so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . 

D:  what do you think , is it fancy ? <laugh> 

D:  So here , two . Up . 

D:  d I think it's a one for that , at least . 

D:  Robustness , uh-huh . 

A:  It's um robust , yeah . 

D:  Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? 

B:  The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial . 

B:  And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this . 

D:  It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ? 

C:  we only address two main functions here 

B:  It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . 

D:  Okay , two . <laugh> 

D:  Up to three for that , 

D:  Colour and shape . 

C:  The case is silver titanium , no ? 

A:  <other> And what about the strawberries on the top ? 

C:  We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too . 

C:  Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and  

D:  I suggested three . 

D:  And uh the last one is adaptive . 

A:  Okay . <other> Let's go for one . <laugh> 

D:  Now we have to do the average . <laugh> 

D:  Two point one seven . 

A:  So now , it has to fulfil the <laugh> financial criterium ? 

C:  We need only one battery . 

C:  We have sample chip . 

C:  And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition . <other> 

C:  Yeah , I think we will go for a single curve , 

C:  Titanium . 

A:  How many push-button ? 

D:  Two . 

A:  The scroll-wheel , okay . 

C:  One L_C_D_ displayed . 

D:  So we are at seventeen dot eight . 

A:  <other> So think of what we can cut uh here . <laugh> 

B:  I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy . 

B:  to make electricity . 

D:  So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay , 

D:  We we win one . 

B:  So , put minus one there , please . <laugh> 

D:  <laugh> I'm not sure if this is legal . 

D:  Okay , we're uh on target . 

D:  Project evaluation , good . <sound indicating relief> 

A:  Mm . See mm how  <other> Are we a good team ? Mm . 

A:  Is there enough room for creativity ? 

B:  Yeah , yeah . 

D:  Team-work , very strong , I would say . 

D:  I think white-board is useful . 

C:  <laugh> Ah , we got new idea , speech recognition , location finding . New materials , new s uh this fancy strawberry design . 

C:  And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . 

A:  <laugh> I'm not convince . 

D:  <cough> Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year . 

A:  Apparently , we have to choose one or the other . <other> 

D:  if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_ 

D:  Are we supposed to cut things out now ?
