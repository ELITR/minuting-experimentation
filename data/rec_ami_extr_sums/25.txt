A:  Um <other> it's our conceptual design meeting 

A:  <other> our agenda , 

A:  I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , 

A:  Um these are our minutes from r the functional design . 

A:  and we said it's for all age groups , different um functions of it . 

A:  specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece <other> and a long-life battery or a charging station . 

A:  I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials <other> um and then the conceptual specification of user interface <other> and finally trend watching . 

B:  Components design . 

B:  The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . 

B:  um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . 

B:  and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , 

B:  for buttons we have um pushbuttons , 

B:  but we also have scror scroll wheels , 

B:  and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen . 

B:  or we could go all high-tech 

B:  <other> Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , 

B:  And then battery I think is where things get most exciting . 

B:  Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , 

B:  Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . 

B:  Um personal preferences that I was thinking through  

B:  And we wanna go for simplicity . 

B:  And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . 

B:  But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip 

B:  <other> Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , 

D:  Is double-curved like  would be like two hands kind of thing ? 

B:  I'm not sure . 

B:  but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures . 

A:  um the weight of these different elements , have you  

B:  no idea , no idea . 

B:  but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me or something . 

C:  I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device . 

C:  so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are 

C:  We have a number of different choices for a design concept um 

C:  Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , 

C:  <laugh> M we don't want lots of buttons , uh complicated features . 

C:  Here's a a fairly simple device . 

C:  Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen . 

C:  So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . Um 

C:  and I think i it looks pretty cool . 

C:  Uh it's nice and colourful , it's nice and bright . 

C:  if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which 

C:  I <other> I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . 

C:  we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , 

C:  there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , 

B:  So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ? 

C:  I think that's <other> that's one way to go , 

C:  Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display , 

C:  an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , 

C:  Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , 

C:  The alternative is to have a <other> an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . Uh 

A:  but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's  um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . 

B:  I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on . 

D:  we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching . 

D:  that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , 

D:  and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference , 

D:  they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . 

D:  <other> The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations . 

D:  And then ease of use was the third most important , 

D:  <other> And then <laugh> the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes , 

D:  and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . 

D:  Also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction , I'm a little hesitant as to <other> like , how these questions may have been worded , 

D:  but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most . 

A:  Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ? 

A:  could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? 

B:  If it's latex  if it's latexy  

B:  my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , 

B:  there's something to be said , I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to  R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things 

D:  I'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle , 

B:  <other> could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? 

A:  um couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something . 

C:  <laugh> I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? Uh like uh I dunno , like uh carrots or something . 

B:  Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . 

D:  What about the idea of like a round remote ? Instead of like a vertical up and down one . Like in terms of holding it . Like that's a f shape of a fruit . 

A:  would you think you you  do you think you'd be able to hold it ? 

D:  I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod . 

C:  or is it li more like a scroll thing ? 

B:  and you press the centre button , 

D:  I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . 

B:  I think an <other> L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice . 

A:  Um I've one more slide before we close , 

B:  Could  Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours , 

A:  and then like the the covers could be spongy latex 

A:  components concept . Energy , chip on print . 

A:  can you just explain what that is real quick ? 

B:  what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? 

A:  <other> I think it's awesome . I think it's really cool . 

C:  as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is , 

B:  I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . 

B:  which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . 

C:  Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think . 

B:  I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . 

A:  I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe . 

B:  if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , 

B:  Do we want a scroll wheel , 

C:  Um I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . 

A:  It would be nice for changing the volume , 

C:  you really need buttons for changing a channel . 

A:  We have five minutes left for the meeting , so . 

D:  and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as  I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . 

B:  When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . 

C:  I think  yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , 

B:  Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . 

D:  could it be hard , and then something around it ? 

A:  I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . 

B:  what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that <other> there's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . 

A:  Um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours . 

B:  and we want a curved case , 

B:  Or a double-curved ? 

C:  Um  And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 

A:  For channel surfing I think a scroll  an actual  like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , 

B:  I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case 

D:  I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , 

A:  we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons , 

A:  So we're gonna have like a menu button , 

A:  we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through . 

C:  uh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu . 

A:  Pre-set channels 

C:  I think maybe numbers seems  is kind of old-fashioned . 

A:  finishing the meeting now . 

A:  Let's go with a simple chip ? 

A:  Um did we decide on a chip ? 

D:  but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel .
