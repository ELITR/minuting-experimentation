A:  have noticed I 

C:   <laugh> <other> Okay . Get up stand up 

A:  minutes , and if I'm right , you two 

A:  with evaluation criteria ? Good . And we have a correct 

A:  at something which is less nice , the finance uh aspect , whether we 

B:  on the on the sides here under . 

C:  an idea about how to m th that could also be possible . Uh well 

B:  R_ now , but uh  Any 

B:  far ? <laugh> Yeah . Yeah . Oh y you  perhaps you should make 

D:  to be , 

C:  a  so . Do not forget it . To function it it doesn't really have 

B:  settings , et cetera . Yeah . Yeah . 

C:  uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work . Uh using the scroll button 

C:  uh y uh I uh um   Yeah , you push the scroll button and 

B:  and and use the the 

C:  available . For example uh T_V_ settings , uh remote settings , 

C:  pressing the uh scroll uh button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used uh  which should still be used and we think that 

C:  Yes . In an apart uh  In a separate button , yeah . <laugh> A sign , yeah , just like  Okay , indeed . Okay , we 

B:  which is pretty straight forward . We 

B:  , but  It's the button where you can switch channels .  

B:  , yeah . It has a name . And uh uh we put that in , I thought it would be handy there . Uh this the one number or two numbers 

B:  uh knop . Or at least it should look 

B:  Yeah . Well this about it , I think . Yeah . I will put it back on 

C:  much part of the screen , so it's very uh  when you uh <other> when you use it , doesn't uh become irritating to see . 'Cause if 

A:  typing  The R_R_ stands for ? Logo , okay . <laugh> Okay well 

B:  <laugh> Right . Yeah . <laugh> 

D:  we can evaluate the design of the remote control by 

D:  to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's 

D:  , and is it easy enough to 

D:  think ? But does it  

A:  the green colour . And the the curves which we decided , huh ? Only what happened to the 

A:  we spoke about last meeting ? <laugh> Well it might work one time 

B:  I would <laugh>  smart board . <laugh> Uh can I 

B:  . Yeah . So you just make the back of this part a bit bigger , so that it lays 

C:  uh at a bottom at a bottom . Uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes 

D:  <laugh> With two batteries , the whole print plate and t and 

B:  don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't 

D:  the elder people . I think  <other> Yeah , I have to agree , all 

B:  but  I would make it a two or something . Yeah . Huh ? Alright , 

D:  now , it's only design . And the design . So  A two 

A:  microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also . Very new thing . Well  Fancy 

B:  <other> Yeah , but  We should perhaps  That not . Yeah 

D:  Okay . Let's give it a 

C:  it's fancy . Yeah . <laugh> And 

B:  your screen . So you 

C:  ones  <other> Yeah . Take a harder 

D:  ? That was a big requirement of the old people . Are all 

B:  , I 

B:  . I would say yeah . Yeah . Yeah , 

C:  than on the regular remote controls where you have 

D:  easiest way to to to handle . True . I would rate it a  Yeah 

C:  you have to use the the the manual to understand most  Yeah . I think it's uh it's 

A:  have to  It's the 

D:  it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . I I 

D:  I don't think you can find the option button that easy . You can touch it . Yeah , okay , but you have 

D:  here , the teletext button , right ? Okay , then okay , good . Then I think 

D:  people . Young means sixteen to forty years . And elderly from forty eight 

D:  . The scroller a 

B:  the uh extra options , right ? So  Yeah 

C:  uh controls , li uh as you can see in the screen now , and 

A:  people ? And would it be easy for them 

D:  old , you're holding 

B:  Yeah , alright . <laugh> Because it it's not it's 

A:  to use the speech recognition ? Because that might  Yeah . Okay 

B:  to to the to the speech recognition , then you say the 

B:  think it would make it uh  I would make it two . Yeah 

A:  easy to use for them . I'd say three . Okay , so 

A:   <laugh> Another 

D:  . Tha that's a one 

D:  . No ? Oh yeah . Yeah , I think isn't , this 

D:  . True . Remote control has uh colours that different  that meet 

A:  one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything 

D:  groups . Yeah . That's true . Also with rubber ? Yeah , okay 

B:  feels like rubber , but  <laugh> Well 

A:  wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , can't you ? Whether it looks like 

A:  single colours , but you can also make uh a 

D:  one ? Okay . 

A:  , can't you ? Yeah . So that's 

D:  one , that's m rubber . Yeah 

B:  break it . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> Y 

B:  lose it , but it isn't 

C:  to lose , yeah it sh and it's easy to find . Isn't hard 

D:  lose it if you're sixty years old 

C:  , this this is hard to lose . This 

D:  . If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh  

D:  . Isn't hard to lose . Yeah . You can't lose 

A:  be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it . <laugh> A two . A two . 

B:  Uh well I  a a two . <laugh> It's 

D:  ? Very true ? No , I don't think 

B:  Let's make everything a two 

D:  have the colours . Um we have the buttons is  

D:  Okay , okay . I think 

A:  people especially , didn't we ? What do you think 

D:  features on this thing . L_C_D_ 

C:  control I think it i <other> it would satisfy those needs . Yeah , the speech possibility , 

B:  features  the microphone's feature and that 

D:  with their expectations . No 

A:   Yeah . Ours had other 

B:  change the options of 

D:  feature . Yeah , okay . I think 

B:  the remote 

B:  Yeah . Those are features . <laugh> Enough features 

D:  I think once you've  'cause you have 

D:  , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll thing extra . Make it make it a two . Or make it uh a 

D:   Has  oh yeah , do did have  nah y 

B:  R_ and R_ yellow I think . One d 

D:  yellow one . Maybe two . 

B:  navigate easier , because wi with the  you 

A:  front , so  a two , yeah , 

D:  . <loud inhalation of air> Yeah , tha that's so true . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah 

B:  a normal T_V_ uh remote 

C:  Instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button . Yeah , you can navigate . Uh . You're 

D:     I think it would 

D:  lower . <laugh> So okay , we have one three , 

D:  is quite good in my opinion . That  Ooh . 

B:  yeah . A f butterfly 

A:  little bit difficult to do in a group , but I am willing to try it 

A:  production costs , and if they are uh under or 

A:  very very quick I think , yes . Um I don't know if 

B:  I want to fill it in , but uh  But you 

D:  it . No prob 

A:  you to uh fill it in , so that I can also uh take 

A:  because for every button you have to 

B:  what ? Are we ? Oh 

B:  the  it's 

D:  sample speaker , do Oh 

D:  This one is  <other> 

C:  isn't curved in a l 

D:  . L_C_D_ 

D:  and a half , damn . We have 

B:   oh , right . <sound indicating displeasure> We 

C:  make it just a regular scroll wheel 

D:  with six points . Twelve 

D:  . We could use  I think we should 

B:  I think we should lose the 

C:  can't push 

C:  d with uh <sound imitating being tongue-tied> with uh the button . Normal scroll wheel . Lose <other>  Okay , so we don't exactly need the single  We don't need a curve . 

B:  , then it will  won't uh stand up 

D:  it four units . But w d wha Curved 

B:  . Sixteen point three . So we still  Could could we 

B:  to uncurved . No . Yeah , but it's t Yeah , but it 

D:  . Yeah , so that does doesn't doesn't 

D:  . Yeah , but 

A:  recognition . And then you can keep the curve 

A:  , but <laugh> I don't think that will 

D:  it i Yeah , it also  uh it 

B:  have that one too ? Th then we still have 

B:  Yeah , we we scrap 

D:  Yeah , okay , three 

A:  to drop the uh sample speaker . Yeah , but isn't it per remote 

B:  a colour . Don't make it wood 

D:  a scroll wheel . <laugh> 

C:  They don't sell green rubber plants . <laugh> 

D:  we can make it brown , 

B:  special colour than just rubber 

D:  Is it also  no that that's just normal colour  fruit 

B:  . You don't say here's green 

C:  . If we lose the scroll 

B:  should  you have to lose  No , it 

D:  we gonna make ? Five ? Then we 

C:  to make . And then you can <other> and then you can add to the colours . Special c 

C:  curve , for example . How d uh uh how 

C:  Yeah , but uh when you use more 

D:  uh black , titanium . Ah okay . Yeah , but the rubbers alls original black . 

B:  You co you could make it always black , like normal remote . Oh right , yeah . Yeah 

D:  you add  you have two special colours on top 

D:  they me mean they're special  Yeah , okay okay , true . True , true . We 

C:  , single curve . Uh . Huh . Okay . Undo , undo . <laugh> Undo . So , 

A:  . I hope . <laugh> So the battery 

A:  . So each remote with a special colour 

A:  . Because of  thing  Yeah , 

B:  that's a one if not , or not ? 

A:  with the speaker . We dropped the scroll wheel . And 

D:  It should've work . Yep .  just 

B:  . <laugh> Oh ignore that . <laugh> 

A:  afford . <laugh> Hmm ? No , I hadn't . 

C:  we lose the scroll wheel , the 

A:  work so hard at the 

A:  a new design , or what were you trying to do 

B:  . <laugh> Erase . When you saw 

A:  prototype now which we can afford and uh we 

A:  on to the production evaluation because of the time . Let's see , we can save this 

A:  , strange . Okay , well 

A:  save . Um and then 

A:  process ? How satisfied are we ? Mm-hmm . 

C:  here together , for example ? 

B:  . No . Yeah 

D:  if we worked a little bit together . Now we worked through each other , something he said  yeah 

B:  then you can work together too 

D:  I had in my presentation , they already 

D:  for such project . <other> Yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together 

A:  our individual uh work . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Well , probably 

D:  work separate . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah m yeah 

C:  uh different rooms ? Yeah . Huh , oh right . 

A:  process , huh , th  you can't have 

D:  or by , I dunno , chat , something , but now we're completely separated from each other . I don't think 

C:  one of those uh dig digital pens or 

D:  I do I think becau that's 

B:  . But  Well it is useful , 

B:  line is a bit off 

C:  to that keyboard over there . So you can draw uh  see it over 

A:  really useful or  Yeah , so it's maybe 

B:   Yeah . <laugh> <laugh> Yeah . I  

C:  three centimetres uh below . Alright . The project uh  because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh  have , you didn't have 

A:  . That wasn't me . Uh <laugh> so 

C:  uh  to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation . So you used uh this uh the different PowerPoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the  Oh . 

A:  ? Yeah , well I use it as 

D:  No  yeah . It is it is 

B:  it it does work . <laugh> 

B:  It doesn't really write normally . 

D:  in your computer . Yeah . Yeah . It's b bi little bit too big to 

D:  . Fat document , those . Team work was okay 

A:  , well I think so too 

D:  past each other . With 

B:  Yeah . <laugh> Well . Yeah 

A:  .  we  Yeah , but that 

D:  some things that was only problem , but  Yeah yeah 

A:  okay . And creativity 

B:  . You just sit there for ten 

D:  . Little bit uh lo yeah . 

A:  look at this 

A:  we have been creative , huh ? But  There was room 

C:  out . Yeah . The information uh was 

B:  ? Is it on there ? <laugh> Is it on there 

C:  <laugh> No , w I didn't know  Make a r 

B:  the  didn't look but uh  <laugh>

D:  , sometimes , in in in in the beginning I didn't understand what what to 

B:  Yeah , an Yeah , that will be handy . <laugh> Yeah . Yea uh so tha 

D:  yeah made a made a rec a remote control . Yeah , so  So , yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . 

A:  uh we are satisfied , but it it could've been uh better 

A:  . Yeah . Yeah , that was a 

C:   first point , but uh
