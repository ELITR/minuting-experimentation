A:  Um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting . 

A:  I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary , 

A:  Um if I'm right , there are three presentations , 

A:  And um we will also take a look at new project requirements , um if you haven't heard about them yet . 

A:  Um well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation . 

C:  I'll go first . Okay . I'll go first yeah . 

C:  I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . 

C:  Uh when you press a button , <other> uh that's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume , um a little connection is made 

C:  on a little print plate 

C:  Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal 

C:  And that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal 

C:  Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls , are that uh they are very easy to produce , 

C:  uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production 

C:  Uh and the technology's already available , 

C:  Uh I made a little uh uh animation of <laugh> about how a tran our uh remote controller works . 

C:  the sub-component , I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it's the button . 

C:  Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . 

C:  Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons . 

C:  Perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons 

B:  and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . 

B:  adjust volume , that kind of thing . 

B:  There are some uh examples of remote controls . 

B:  Um <other> I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , 

B:  A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that . 

B:  personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . 

B:  And then uh make it  I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . 

B:  you could reuse the buttons 

B:  And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . 

D:  <other> We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , 

D:  that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , 

D:  The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . 

D:  Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . 

D:  Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . 

D:  <other> Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , 

D:  Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , 

D:  The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , 

D:  Buttons . Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . 

D:  or in L_C_D_ screen . 

D:  because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . 

D:  but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . 

D:  The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . 

D:  And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . 

D:  Because they use the remote control often more often , 

D:  So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot  not that much on the younger pep younger people , 

D:  but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use 

D:  And it should be easy to use . Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . 

A:  <other> I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements ? 

A:  then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them 

A:  Um teletext does  has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . 

A:  Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , 

A:  And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , 

A:  according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions . 

B:  you said it should only uh work with one appliance ? 

A:  Yeah . Only be used for television . 

B:  Then it should have uh on , off , 

C:  Standby options , 

D:  the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it , 

B:  A button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers . 

D:  because some T_V_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , 

D:  I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that , 

D:  and that's that's not relaxed 

C:  But uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get 

A:  new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , 

D:  Uh younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen . 

C:  But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap . 

C:  A touch screen uh probably uh even more . 

C:  perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen . 

D:  you don't know how much it costs , the L_C_D_ screen . 

D:  I don't have any costs here , 

B:  But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ? 

C:  for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen 

A:  we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ? 

D:  I think it's the most easier thing , 

B:  but also on the older , 

B:  But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , 

B:  and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ? 

D:  But our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty . 

D:  but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger . 

D:  if it costs  gets too much , too expensive , then yeah , we should be sticking to rubber buttons . 

C:  I think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of L_C_D_ uh screens . 

C:  if you uh you receive an email about that , uh can you post it in the  

A:  But for now it's L_C_D_ . Okay . 

D:  it'll look fancy with L_C_D_ screen . <laugh> Yeah . <laugh> 

B:  They think it's ugly . When it has an L_C_D_ screen . 

D:  Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it . 

A:  what else does our remote need ? 

B:  A mute button . 

D:  <other> The most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection , volume con selection , 

B:  But shouldn't you put a button of  for teletext on the  for the people who want to use it ? 

A:  and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext . 

D:  And other other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , 

B:  they are less important , 

C:  but in a sub sub-menu or something like that . 

B:  Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off . 

D:  power supply is one of the most important things . 

B:  If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno . 

D:  because I don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it , 

C:  And go to standby mode when you don't use it , 

A:  And maybe a low battery indicator ? On the screen . 

D:  of put it in a recharger . Charger . 

A:  So we are going for the for the recharger . 

B:  I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days , 

C:  uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television , 

B:  <laugh> But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch 

C:  just a cable , or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on . Something like that , 

C:  Functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , 

D:  I think that this should be standard . Large button  large buttons . 

A:  And you said something about speech recognition ? 

D:  also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent . 

B:  twelve fifty , twelve fifty . <laugh> 

B:  I know let's do a speech . <laugh> 

B:  But they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something , 

D:  <other> I think an L_C_D_ screen <other> should be suf sufficient . 

A:  But when you look at the percentages  

A:  but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh . 

D:  I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen , 

A:  But would it be useful to imple implement both ? 

D:  Yeah , if the costs al allow it . <laugh> 

B:  but how would you like to implement that , 

C:  Certain systems already exist , I think . 

B:  Then you also have to have different languages if we go international . 

D:  But that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen . 

B:  you can use icons 

C:  it should be done . If it could be done , should be done . 

A:  so we only do this when we have enough money left . 

A:  I've written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , uh the digits from one to zero , huh . Um  or from zero to nine . Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator . 

A:  And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons 

B:  You also now have colours . 

D:  Curved ? 

D:  we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub-menus . 

A:  so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu , 

D:  We could check the other remote controls with technical functions . 

A:  Aren't we forgetting something very important ? 

D:  wide screen , high screen , different things you have , 

D:  it should be available , but then in separate screen settings or something . 

D:  Channel settings . 

D:  Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote , an expanded version . 

B:  and the buttons , should they have colours ? 

C:  Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the L_C_D_ screen . 

B:  Perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones <laugh> . 

C:  make it available in different colours , you mean ? 

A:  signal for las final five minutes . 

A:  we're having a a general menu with the most used functions , uh teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings , 

B:  Or do we have any buttons ? On the remote . 

D:  you only have channel button or volume button . 

B:  So we don't have any normal buttons 

B:  But that's also in the L_C_D_ , 

D:  Maybe only the on and o on and off button . 

B:  But isn't idea to use uh uh what you said , uh normal on and off button for the T_V_ , 

B:  But a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ , 

A:  maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ , 

A:  There has to be a on button on the remote , 

B:  No 

C:  because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on . 

B:  I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , 

B:  But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , 

C:  I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control . 

A:  So actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote . No buttons at all . 

A:  that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote . 

A:  postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting , 

A:  for now , we're having a lunch break ,
