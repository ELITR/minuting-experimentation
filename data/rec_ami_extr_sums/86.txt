A:  So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design 

A:  So let's see the  what did you prepare . 

B:  S so so I discussed with Guillaume . 

B:  and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , 

B:  One with and one without L_C_D_s . 

C:  Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . 

C:  <laugh> S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes <laugh> . 

C:  And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . 

C:  You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the <laugh> for the speech recognition system here . 

B:  The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . 

D:  Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? 

C:  Well so it's a microphone array . 

A:  Oh it's very costly , microphone array <laugh> . 

C:  it's just a single microphone , 

C:  I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to  

A:  How much does it cost this one ? 

C:  Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars 

A:  Ah it's above it's above the budget . 

C:  but uh it's just a prototype 

C:  the  and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars .  

A:  How many b battery is there ? 

B:  Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . 

D:  Is that two or one ? 

B:  <laugh> Actually uh it's a flexible thing . 

C:  So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger 

B:  I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , 

B:  This button is like the mouse  is like a joystick , 

B:  and it  the additi functions associated to all the actions 

B:  Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ . 

C:  So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . 

D:  Uh-huh and also the switch . 

C:  Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . 

D:  And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , 

D:  and if you disable speech recognition system then ? 

B:  W w I'll I'll come to that point later on . 

B:  in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah . 

B:  It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone 

A:  The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . 

B:  but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to  people are willing to pay more for good design . 

D:  but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . 

A:  The price of selling is twenty five Euros . 

B:  the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular 

B:  If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , 

D:  Something like customised . Yeah 

B:  for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it  put it back in , or you can use the other one , 

B:  It's pretty flexible in the yeah price <laugh> . 

C:  You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control 

C:  We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , 

B:  the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful . 

B:  that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here <laugh> . 

B:  it's very robust  , 

B:  and the material , what's the material again ? 

C:  The titanium 

B:  Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , 

B:  again you pay for what you get , 

B:  And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , 

B:  And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a  of T_V_ programmes by genre , 

A:  What's the price to p to produce ? 

C:  Well so the price to produce  For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . 

C:  The  without without the charger 

A:  We don't have all the options <laugh> . 

C:  so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars . 

B:  so you want more function you pay more . 

A:  it's below the the the budget . 

D:  I think we will just have a rough look 

D:  So the marketing made an evaluation criteria 

C:  since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons . 

C:  Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself 

D:  here you can find  these are the latest fashion updates , 

B:  you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy <laugh> . 

D:  Yeah so uh <laugh> so finally we have these three criterias . 

D:  So  and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , 

D:  so on this scale , if it is true , if it is  if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , 

D:  So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , 

D:  or if it is false , it doesn't  it looks uh  it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . 

B:  But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ? 

D:  according to you designers , 

D:  On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look  how does it look ? 

C:  I'll I'll say three or four . 

B:  <other> I think we can improve on the design . 

B:  Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh  <laugh> design . 

D:  So I take three on  with L_C_D_ ? 

C:  Uh four . 

D:  And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ . 

C:  Well it's it's the same for both 

B:  from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um <cough> the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , 

B:  and for now  and another innovation we have is simplicity 

D:  So without L_C_D_ ? 

C:  Mm for both it's the the same innovations . 

B:  So maybe I can put six to seven . 

D:  actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . 

D:  then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness . 

B:  Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ? 

C:  but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen . 

B:  We haven't really uh determined <laugh> what are  actually actually 

D:  I mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . 

D:  on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now . 

C:  If you have the L_C_D_ , 

D:  Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . 

B:  But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ . 

D:  So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? 

C:  Well I think both are really easy to use 

C:  and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so  

C:  so I will give a six for the easy to use . 

A:  No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ . 

D:  So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes 

B:  I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . 

B:  but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um  we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . 

D:  So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ? 

C:  Um six . 

D:  and it's going to be much simpler to use . 

C:  so let's go back to our laboratory and <laugh>  

B:  <laugh> To improve on the design . 

A:   what about the integration of speech recognition ? 

B:  The speech recogniser is a add-on module . 

D:  That's going to be an optional . 

D:  S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . 

A:  I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , 

D:  but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module 

A:  Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , 

B:  <cough> The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children 

A:  So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional  uh will be optional . 

B:  <cough> But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? <laugh> 

A:  I think it inc increase . <laugh> 

C:  because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but  

C:  it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the <laugh> functionalities um on the same module , but uh  

B:  Well well the other aspect is that if <other> in the  when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the  you're gonna keep the same customer , 

B:  i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . 

B:  attracting them to come back in again and again . 

B:  Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be  can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? 

D:  And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? 

C:  but we are also the um well the components will have to change 

D:  Or uh it could be like this  the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all . 

B:  What we can change is to propose the <other> customers with skins . 

C:  we can have the same global shape 

D:  I think you need to look into the material . 

D:  I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . 

A:  Project evaluation project satisfaction , for example . 

B:  <cough> Room for creativity . 

D:  This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations . 

A:  Yeah I think so <laugh> . 

A:  Uh the teamwork was very very good . 

D:  And new ideas found . 

C:  <other> Come up with new product <laugh> . 

C:  We achieved uh project goal I think . 

D:  that is within the budget . 

C:  yes , more or less . 

A:  Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . 

A:  Yeah thank you for your work and
