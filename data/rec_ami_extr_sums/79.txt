A:  <other> We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a  f for the beginning of new project um <other> uh remote control for the design for a new remote control <other> . 

A:  and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan , 

A:  Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design . 

B:  It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw . 

A:  Let's talk about money . 

D:  So . Twenty five Euro for a remote control . 

B:  <laugh> On the international market . 

C:  Yeah , we're to sell two million then . 

A:  Mm <other> for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum . 

A:  So any of you have experience in remote controls ? <laugh> 

A:  <laugh> So that could be a great um <other> application . 

D:  <laugh> but mainly it has to be very robust 

D:  colourful , maybe  

A:  No , that's a good idea . 

C:  Yeah even we can change colours , no ? 

C:  like the phones and these things we c yeah . 

C:  And it should be really  small and  . 

A:  Small also ? 

D:  <other> Should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control 

C:  at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like  . 

C:  Uh maybe we can change the colours that  at least the frame . 

D:  I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're  they never find a good button in the right place . 

B:  no screens , it's too complex . 

A:  Mm . So , some kind of idea uh with um um <other> cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what  

D:  <laugh> Too expensive for twelve Euro ? 

C:  Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working . 

C:  and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations . 

A:  may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah . 

B:  But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else . 

D:  but for instance when you change channels you can have  you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . 

C:  But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put  yeah , you can only have one bit . 

D:  And then back to the one I was before , 

A:  yeah , that would be cool . 

B:  Go back button is good . 

A:  Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes 

A:  <other> So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes . 

D:  So what does M_E_ means ? 

B:  Market Expert . 

D:  Uh that's me . 

D:  the user requirement specifications ,
