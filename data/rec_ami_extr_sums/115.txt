A:  Well , this is the agenda for today . 

A:  examples of the tool training , project plan discussion and the closing . 

A:  Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control . 

A:  Um , I  oh forget  I forget the whole acquaintance part , but we we all know each other . 

A:  Uh we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . 

A:  Okay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools . 

A:  This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now . 

A:  there's a document folder called um the sh <other> shared document folder . 

A:  so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . 

A:  There is a tool-bar over here . 

A:  It's like a very simple uh paint application . 

A:  and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button .

A:  well , we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . 

D:  I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , 

D:  Uh , so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with 

A:  And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um  what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ? 

D:  Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders . 

B:   I thought it was only for television . 

A:  Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well . 

A:  Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh  

A:  Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or uh  

A:  I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down 

A:  I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes . <laugh> 

A:  The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course , 

A:  The User Interface Designer <other> 

A:  the technical functions design . 

A:  We'll see each other in uh thirty minutes .
