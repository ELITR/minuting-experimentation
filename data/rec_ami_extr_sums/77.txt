A:  Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes . 

D:  Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control . 

D:  So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market . 

D:  seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly . 

D:  Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , 

D:  Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls . 

D:  And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most  by far the most used buttons on the remote control . 

D:  And basically they came  they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , 

D:  And fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . 

D:  In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , 

D:  So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market . 

B:  And speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive . 

D:  And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think , 

C:  Okay , so here is my presentation about technical function design . 

C:  Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands . 

C:  And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands 

C:  Okay , <other> uh about  what I found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh , usually there are two different methods uh to  for designing a remote control . 

C:  uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with  uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way . 

C:  And uh uh again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see . 

D:  Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ? 

C:  Uh , I don't think so , 

A:  And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same  have our remote control , for example ? 

C:  but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it 

B:  I have only a couple of things because I had  I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company . 

B:  so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication  for the I_R_ circuits and so on , 

B:  And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , 

B:  So , I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves 

B:  but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on 

B:  well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ , 

B:  But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the  what does it offer , you know . 

B:  If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle 

B:  And uh my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit , 

B:  And the price is fairly cheap for this . 

D:  because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red . 

D:  But I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are  prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves . 

A:  So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . Um 

A:  Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext . 

A:  Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , 

A:  the third one is uh about the the the image of the company . 

A:  It's  That mean we should use the colour of our company 

A:  So now we we should take the decision what we are going to  what function we will have on this uh on this remote control . 

D:  Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need . 

A:  I think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button . 

A:  So , turning channel , of course . Volume setting . 

B:  will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ? 

B:  Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . 

B:  so so we keep all these all these buttons . 

A:  Maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and  

A:  If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus . 

B:  So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you  

D:  We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel . 

D:  So we've got channel and volume . Um . 

D:  I mean there's always  we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , 

A:  <other> We should hide them somewhere . 

D:  I mean a power button's obviously 

B:  <laugh> This I was thinking . Do we need a power button at all ? 

D:  Uh , well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off . 

B:  Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? 

B:  Okay , so we should keep this button . 

B:  so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff , 

B:  Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be  

C:  A button is better . 

D:  What about things like the clock and um timers ? 

A:  If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , 

A:  I mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ? 

D:  Probably not . 

A:  W In my opinion we should have only useful thing 

A:  So , um . So now we are going for for a small lunch . 

A:  And uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works . 

A:  And uh you are going to work on your individual works .
