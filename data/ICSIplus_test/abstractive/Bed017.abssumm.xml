<sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.1">The first phase of the data collection has finished.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.2">There is a new wizard for phase two, during which subjects will be given more complex scenarios.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.3">Also finished are the modifications on SmartKom: the remaining glitches will take no more than a day to iron out.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.4">A big part of the meeting was covered by the presentation of the PRM of the proposed system.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.5">An alternative representation of the Bayes-net, it depicts context features as classes, and dependencies as relations between them.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.6">The current outputs show the desirability of a site, as well as its EVA mode.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.7">The fact that this model allows for instantiations of classes fits the research purposes much better than the extended belief-net.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.8">Following this, a visiting researcher presented an overview of a parallel project at the International University.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.9">It attempts to build a smart tutoring system for a computer science course.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.10">The assumption is that document searches can give more personalised results, if they take into account contextual parameters (user, situation).</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.11">Although no detailed linguistic analysis takes place, it was suggested that the use of FrameNet could be a useful approach.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.12">There were also further suggestions for meetings with ICSI researchers.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bed017.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.13">As the data collection is going into its second phase, more complex scenarios will be used to generate more intricate dialogues.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.14">Subjects can be recruited from within the Psychology department students, since such participation in experiments is compulsory in their syllabus.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.15">As the work on creating a PRM for the system has progressed, it is now necessary to find an implementation that can work as a PRM interpreter.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.16">There are no plans to build one from scratch, but it seems that other research groups at Stanford may already have one.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.17">Moreover, closer collaboration with the local PRM group will be pursued with additional participation in their meetings.</sentence>

</decisions>
<problems nite:id="Bed017.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.18">An early version of the PRM of the system presented the same problem as a flat Bayes-net: the CPT's become too large.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.19">Another PRM issue that arose and remained unclear was how the probabilities are specified (instead of learnt) on the actual relations between the classes.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.20">Furthermore, the lack of a PRM interpreter is an open issue.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.21">It is not within the remit of the project to build one from scratch, therefore, an existing implementation has to be found.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.22">On the other hand, the discussion about the smart tutoring system being built at the International University showed the importance of finding out  which context parameters are influential in a given domain.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.23">It is easy to hack up a system for a small domain, but making it scalable is much more difficult.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.24">Finally, there was a passing mention of problems encountered with the speech synthesis module of SmartKom.</sentence>

<progress nite:id="Bed017.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.25">The first phase of the data collection has been completed.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.26">Thirty subjects were recorded in total.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.27">Of those dialogues, ten have been transcribed.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.28">A new wizard will carry out the second phase.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.29">On top of this, a presentation of a PRM of the proposed system took place.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.30">The PRM comprises a set of classes, such as "user", "site", "route", "time" and "query" with relations between them.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.31">Another class incorporates a number of attributes ("money affordability", "travel compatibility" etc) modelling the intermediate nodes of the Bayes-net, as well as references to the other classes in the model.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.32">This model is much cleaner, and it also makes it easier to specify the CPT's.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed017.s.33">At this stage, the model makes two decisions (outputs): how much a site fits a user's needs and what the user intention is in EVA terms.</sentence>
