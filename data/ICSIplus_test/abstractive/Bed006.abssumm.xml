<abstract nite:id="Bed006.abstract.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.1">The data collection script has been slightly modified, so that it encourages more natural dialogue between the subjects and the "wizard".</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.2">Another trial run will take place, while a call to recruit subjects is being emailed to students.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.3">Meanwhile, the translation of the TV and cinema information system to english is almost complete.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.4">This was the basic requirement of the project.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.5">On the other hand, there was a presentation of the model that offers more elaborate action planning for SmartKom, of which Enter/View/Approach (EVA) modes are a part.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.6">These modes will form categories of complete XML schemas with information filled in from the language understanding in a more elaborate way than the current Object-"Go Action"-Object model.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.7">These categories will, in turn, be linked with action schemas, one of which is Source-Path-Goal (SPG).</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.8">Categories and action schemas can have -in theory- any number of blocks depending on the expansion of the domain.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.9">The notation provides for linking and referencing between different schemas.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.10">The model also allows for multiple action schemas to be triggered in parallel.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.11">However, the structure of the model is open for discussion, since its use was to elicit discussion and highlight issues.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bed006.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.12">As the data collection is about to start, a call for the recruitment of subjects is going to be sent out.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.13">The main pool of subjects is going to be the student community in the institute.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.14">Along with the "wizard", who is going to be an integral part of the experiments, another person needs to be hired as the instructor for the tasks involved in them.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.15">Meetings were rescheduled and are now going to take place on Fridays.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.16">For the next meeting, there is going to be a presentation of the modifications in the parser module of the basic system.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.17">Additionally, the proposed XML model will be put to the test with concrete data.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.18">Similarly, such examples will clarify issues relating to the binding and redundancy of features with common characteristics amongst the shcemas (eg "Container" for Enter and "Goal" for SPG).</sentence>

</decisions>
<problems nite:id="Bed006.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.19">Subjects in the trial runs of the experiment were given detailed descriptions of the tasks, which led to the subsequent dialogue being a re-iteration or re-phrasing of the instructions.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.20">Using pictures instead would be one way to deal with the problem, however, it was deemed too laborious and it would divert the focus of the experiment.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.21">As the original action planner of the SmartKom system only included a generic SPG schema, a new module was presented that allows for variety in the user intentions to be included.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.22">This being only a model, there are several issues that will need to be clarified in the future.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.23">How the model deals with redundancy of information among categories and action schemas, and whether a flat or a hierarchical model would be preferable are two of them.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.24">What is also clear is that as the domain of research broadens beyond the study of EVA modes, the complexity of the model will also increase.</sentence>
</problems>
<progress nite:id="Bed006.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.25">Another trial run of the data collection experiment is to take place, while subjects are being recruited.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.26">There have been some adjustments in the script.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.27">The prior description of tasks the subjects are going to be given is now going to be more schematic, although the intentions are still going to be clear.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.28">The lack of detailed, written explanation will hopefully encourage more natural and varied dialogue between subjects and "wizard".</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.29">On the other hand, the generator module of the system has been translated from german.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.30">Eventually, a user is going to be able to request and receive TV- and cinema-related information in english.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.31">This will satisfy the basic project requirements.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.32">The model of a new module for SmartKom was presented.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.33">It is an interface between the language understanding and the action planning modules.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.34">One layer of XML schemas creates a richer representation of the linguistic analysis, which is subsequently used to trigger one or more action schemas.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed006.s.35">The model keeps the concept of XML messages being sent between the modules of the system, although it is open-ended as to the number of schemas involved.</sentence>
