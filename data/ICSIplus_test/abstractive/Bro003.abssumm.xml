<abstract nite:id="Bro003.abstract.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.1">The main topics discussed were arrangements and objectives of an
upcoming field trip to visit research partners OGI; a number of
members reported their progress to date; if there are any tasks that
one member can help others with; an overall description of the Cube
project, a multi-lingual speech recognition system for use by the
cellular phone industry, along with consideration of some of the
issues therein, specifically disk and resource issues.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.2">Essentially the cube consists of three dimension: input features;
training corpus; and test corpus.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.3">Most important concerns are which
combinations of features to use, and what combinations of languages
and broad/specific corpora to use for the training</sentence>

</abstract>
<decisions nite:id="Bro003.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.4">The group will meet at the building at 6am to go to the airport for
their field trip together.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.5">Speaker me018 needs to discuss files that can be moved with speaker
mn007.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.6">For the OGI meeting they need to take a clear description of the cube
project, and an estimate of how long the entire process should take.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.7">At the meeting they should discuss what they will ultimately put
through the system.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.8">People are to consider what me034 could do on the project to speed
things up, though creating the phoneme superset is a possibility.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.9">Speaker me018 is to look into the machines that mn007 has been running
data on to find out what they are.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.10">Rather than consider level of normalization as a further dimension to
the project, whatever OGI finds the best will be used systematically.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.11">Need to use multiple machines and SPERT boards to run processes on
because they take so long.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.12">They will consider looking at articulatory features rather than
straight phonemes, though it wouldn't be perfect.</sentence>

</decisions>
<problems nite:id="Bro003.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.13">It is not clear what combinations of dimensions, which features,
should be run in the cube project.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.14">It is important to know because
the processes are going to be large and processor and memory hungry.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.15">To bear in mind is the fact that the cellular industry has an image of
speech recognition in that's what they are after.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.16">Must be careful if using a broad training source that is carefully
hand marked, because it would be unclear which is the reason for
improvement.</sentence>  
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.17">Memory is of concern, because final product needs to run potentially
one cheaper cell phones, which have limited memory capacity.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.18">OGI doesn't have a phoneme superset ready prepared, for they are
working with clusters, which may be good enough for digits, but not
for discriminating words.</sentence>

</problems>
<progress nite:id="Bro003.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.19">Speaker mn007 has been preparing the French digit database.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.20">Training
and testing with varying noise.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.21">speaker me006 has installed updated software for everyone.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.22">Working on
label files from TIMIT for training neural nets.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.23">Trying to figure out
what the input to the cube should be.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.24">speaker fn002 has been testing the Italian database on a net trained
on Spanish.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.25">She has had problems with incompatible labels though.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.26">Within the next year, the network is to be upgraded, and in a couple
of weeks, the group should have access to 4 new 36 gigabyte file
servers.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.27">Me018 has been copying some corpus stuff to a non-backed up
system, but not yet deleted originals.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.28">Current plan is to use a superset of phones for the cube project
derived from the various training languages.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bro003.s.29">HTK training currently takes 6 hours to a day, and the neural net
takes 1-2 days.</sentence>
