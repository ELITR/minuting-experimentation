<decisions nite:id="Bro027.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro027.s.6">Speaker me018 must confirm what is needed to work with the new software in terms of adjustments with someone further up the project chain.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro027.s.7">The system at it's current stage employs the neural networks and second stream, but the group leader would like the network investigated separately, incase it is hurting performance.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="Bro027.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro027.s.8">There are worries regarding the need to make adjustments so the new software can handle the group's different feature set.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro027.s.9">The system, whilst improved, also has increased latency, and while the limit has not been set, the group need to reduce it.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bro027.s.10">Likewise the number of features the use in their system, since this has been set at an arbitrarily low value.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro027.s.11">There has been an increase in the number of deletion in the errors, which is of some concern.</sentence>

<progress nite:id="Bro027.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro027.s.12">Speaker mn007 has been implementing a new voice activity detector on noise compensated data, and it performs much better.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro027.s.13">He has also been working on the tandem neural network.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro027.s.14">Speaker me013, along with a student, submitted work on reverberation for a speech workshop.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro027.s.15">Speaker me018 has downloaded and compiled the software he was asked to work with in the previous meeting.</sentence>
