<abstract nite:id="Bed011.abstract.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.1">The main focus of the meeting was firstly on the structure of the belief-net, its decision nodes and the parameters that influence them, and secondly, on the design of the data collection tasks.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.2">For the latter, there are already 30 subjects lined up and more are expected to be recruited off campus.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.3">It was agreed that making subjects select from categories of tasks, such as "big place", "service", etc. could provide a better range of data.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.4">The duration of each dialogue will probably be no more than 10 minutes.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.5">On the other hand, the organisation of the intermediate nodes of the belief-net and their properties is almost complete, although no conditional probabilities have been inserted yet.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.6">These nodes represent decisions that will function as parameters to action calls in the system.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.7">Their values will either be inferred from the user-system interaction, or -as a last resort- requested directly from the user.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.8">Finally, as to the semantic and syntactic constructions, work will start with more general and brief descriptions, before moving to exhaustive analysis of at least a subset.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.9">Similarly, the construction parser that is to be built within a year is expected to be relatively basic, yet robust.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bed011.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.10">As the data collection is ready to start, it was agreed that for the first ten subjects the interaction with the system/instructor will be along the lines of a basic response system.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.11">Tasks will be divided in categories ("tour", "attend" etc) and subjects are going to be asked to choose no more than one task out of each category .</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.12">This first run will probably take a couple of weeks, but the first results (audio files and selected highlights) will be discussed shortly, in order to decide whether more detail (complex spatial relationships, temporal planning etc) should be included in the design or particular constructions be elicited.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.13">Regarding the completion of the belief-net, the remaining details, mainly the properties of the ontology and discourse nodes, should be added.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.14">After building in the conditional probability tables, a working prototype of the net will be ready.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.15">Finally, the initial work on constructions should focus on a general overview of the dialogues with brief descriptions.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.16">Further analysis will follow from there in a top-down fashion.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="Bed011.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.17">Although there is an effort to include some of the key features of the belief-net in the design of the data gathering, not all of them can be built in.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.18">The tasks that the subjects will have to carry out will be categorised in ways that will indicate EVA intentions, however, this approach may limit the variety of possible constructions used within a single category of entities.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.19">On the other hand, generating more diverse dialogues may have an adverse effect from a speech recognition perspective.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.20">A minor problem has arisen with the laboratory where recordings are supposed to take place, but this is currently being sorted out.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.21">As regards the completion of the belief-net, no work has been done on the CPT's yet.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.22">Finally, it was noted that although a general overview of the pertinent constructions is attainable, no more than ten of them can be analysed in detail with the summer months.</sentence>

</problems>
<progress nite:id="Bed011.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.23">A detailed diagram of the EVA belief-net was presented and some of the intermediate nodes and their properties were discussed in depth.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.24">Some of the key features and properties are: "Go-there", which is binary, and defined by the user, situation, ontology and discourse models; "timing" (current/next tour); "reason" (business, sight-seeing, socialising); "transport"; "length of tour"; "costs"; "entity" (open, accessible) etc.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.25">The data collection that will provide relevant dialogues is moving along, with thirty subjects already lined up.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.26">They will be given a reading task, which will include some german proper names, and a series of tasks from the tourist domain to choose from.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.27">In order to get directions, they will then communicate with a computer system and a human operator, using a sketchy map as an aid.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.28">A different set of data are already available from the SmartKom system and similar sources.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed011.s.29">A preliminary study using this data has shown that a large number of syntactic and semantic constructions can be derived from a small sample.</sentence>
