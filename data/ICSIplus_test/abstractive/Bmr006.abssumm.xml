<sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.1">The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed research aims and corresponding concerns for future data collection.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.2">It was agreed that a substantial amount of meeting data is required from different domains, and comprising several speakers, to perform the types of discourse and acoustic analyses desired.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.3">Ongoing efforts by speaker mn005 to automatically  detect regions of speaker overlap were considered.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.4">It was suggested that speaker mn005 focus on a small set of acoustic parameters, e.g. energy and harmonics-related features, to distinguish regions of overlap from those containing the speech of just one speaker.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.5">Disk space issues were discussed.</sentence><sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.6">And, finally, the problem of speaker anonymization was explored.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bmr006.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.7">Recordings must be of existing meetings that are conducted in English.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.8">Participants should ideally consist of professors and doctoral students, but no undergraduate students, who are willing to record their meetings at ICSI.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.9">The Meeting Recorder corpus should comprise data from a large number of speakers representing different domains.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.10">Attempts should also be made to optimize the speaker population for generating good language models.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.11">Speaker me011 will pursue volunteers from the Haas Business School to record their weekly meetings at ICSI.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.12">A tentative decision was made to offer participants a recorded version of their meeting on a cd rom once the transcript screening phase is complete for that meeting.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="Bmr006.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.13">Non-native speakers with a low proficiency in English are problematic for language modelling.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.14">The prospect of creating another recording setup requires the elimination certain more complicated dimensions of the existing setup, e.g. the use of close-talking and far-field microphones.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.15">Speaker anonymization poses problems for the transcription proccess, and also discourse analysis, as it makes it more difficult to track who is speaking and to whom a particular utterance is being addressed.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.16">As the current version of transcriptions does not include speaker identification labels, no multiple speaker transcription conventions are in use.</sentence>

<progress nite:id="Bmr006.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.17">Research aims and corresponding concerns for future data collection were discussed.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.18">A student researcher will be working with speaker fe016 to investigate different strategies for automatically summarizing meetings, and identifying discussional 'hotspots'.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.19">Efforts by speaker mn005 are ongoing to detect regions of speaker overlap in the signal.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.20">A total of 230 regions of overlapping speech have been manually transcribed for a subset of meeting data.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.21">Supervised clustering and neural networks are being considered as means for classifying overlap.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.22">It was suggested that speaker mn005 focus on a small set of acoustic parameters, e.g. energy and harmonics-related features, to use the mixed signal to distinguish regions of overlap from those containing the speech of just one speaker.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.23">Future work may also involve focussing on additional signals, and using a Markov model to analyze acoustic parameters over larger time frames.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.24">Beam-forming was suggested as an alternate method of detecting overlapping speech.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.25">Efforts are ongoing to select an optimal method for anonymizing speakers.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr006.s.26">More disk space is gradually being made available for the storage of new Meeting Recorder data.</sentence>
