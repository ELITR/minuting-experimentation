<abstract nite:id="Bdb001.abstract.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.1">Two main options were discussed as to the organisation of the collected data.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.2">On the one hand, a bespoke XML structure that connects transcriptions and annotations (down to the word-level) to a common timeline.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.3">Its advantages are that it is easier to read, parse, map onto the Transcriber format and to expand with extra features.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.4">Phone-level analysis can be included in the same structure, or in a separate, linked file.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.5">The respective frame-level representation can be handled by P-files, a technology developed at ICSI, which also comes with a library of tools.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.6">Separation of levels of analysis makes files more compact and manageable.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.7">XML standards offer libraries that can be used for the development of search tools.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.8">On the other hand, the ATLAS (NIST) technology offers a very similar, but more generic organisational scheme based on nodes and links.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.9">These are labeled with domain specific types, like "utterance" or "speaker".</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.10">This option offer well-developed infrastructure and flexibility as to the type of data storage (flat XML files or relational database).</sentence> 
<sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.11">In either case, it is important for the chosen format to allow for fast searches, flexible updates and, if possible, be reusable in future work.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bdb001.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.12">In order to confirm the suitability of the data format provided by the ATLAS project, its current state of development will be investigated.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.13">More specifically, the issues that have to be ascertained are, firstly, whether the external file representation offers a format that would be appropriate for speech data, and, secondly, how the linking between the different annotations (eg, between word-level representations and prosodic-feature structures) can be achieved.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.14">Regardless of the actual format, however, there was consensus that keeping levels of analysis (words, phones, frames, etc) on separate, inter-linked files can make their management easier.</sentence>

</decisions>
<problems nite:id="Bdb001.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.15">Choosing a project-specific format for the representation of the data might not be optimal for future work.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.16">On the other hand, it is not yet clear whether a more standardised, but generic technology, like that of the ATLAS project, can accommodate all the requirements of speech analysis.</sentence> 
<sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.17">Regardless of the particular format, including all annotations (sentences, words, phones, frames, etc) in one file could result in unmanageable file sizes.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.18">Searching, updating or simply parsing a file for a simple task can become an unwieldy process.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.19">Even P-files, which are only for frame-level annotation, may be too verbose for the amount of data resulting from hour-long recordings.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.20">The actual mapping of word-level transcriptions to frame-level representations is expected to be problematic anyway.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.21">Likewise, problems will arise if, in the future, slightly different transcripts of the same data are annotated in formats that do not include time-marks.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.22">Trying to merge such annotations later will not be easy, because of the combination of transcription discrepancies with the loss of the underlying connection offered by the time-marks.</sentence>
</problems>
<progress nite:id="Bdb001.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.23">An XML scheme to build representations of the data is already available.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.24">It incorporates information regarding utterances, sentences, speakers, words, etc.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.25">All these features are linked together via time-marks that slot into a single, common timeline.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.26">This format also allows for linking to different levels of representation of the same data.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.27">For the frame-level representation, P-files is a readily available technology, developed at ICSI.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bdb001.s.28">Besides the appropriate format, P-files come with a library of tools and the respective documentation.</sentence>
