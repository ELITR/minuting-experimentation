<sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.1">The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed recognition results generated for 20 minutes of close-talking microphone data.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.2">Recognition performance was very good, indicating promising results for forced alignment procedures and the ability to analyze other important signal information, e.g. prosody and overlapping speech.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.3">It was decided that close-talking data should be downsampled and fed to the SRI recognizer to compare recognition performance, and that data from the far-field microphones should be tested on the recognizer as soon as possible.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.4">The group also discussed recording setup and equipment issues.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.5">A decision was made to purchase an additional head-mounted crown microphone.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.6">A tentative decision was also made to integrate the use of a hand-held wireless microphone to help compensate for the lack of available close-talking microphones.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.7">The collection of Meeting Recorder data is ongoing, and will include meetings by the Berkeley Even Deeper Understanding research group and, possibly, an organized discussion by members of the transcriber pool.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bmr012.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.8">Following close-talking microphone recognition procedures, it was decided that data from the far-field microphones (or PZMs) should be tested on the recognizer as soon as possible.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.9">Speaker mn017 will compare close-talking microphone recognition results with those obtained for downsampled data.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.10">The SRI recognizer will be set up at ICSI to enable researchers to run their own variants.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.11">The group decided to purchase one additional head-mounted crown microphone.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.12">A tentative decision was also made to acquire a hand-held wireless microphone to pass around to additional meeting participants should the installation of more close-talking microphones prove too difficult.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.13">The suggestion of incorporating the use of cross pads during meeting recordings received favorable comments from participants.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.14">It was also tentatively decided to elicit meeting data from members of the transcriber pool discussing the Meeting Recorder corpus.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="Bmr012.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.15">During recognition procedures, a fixable acoustic glitch was discovered that causes speech channels to become slightly asynchronized.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.16">Poorer recognition performance was yielded for speech recorded via the use of lapel microphones.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.17">Recognition errors were largely due to misrecogniton of the plural -s and out-of-vocabulary items.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.18">The current recording setup is limited in that not all BMR meeting participants have their own close-talking microphone.</sentence>

<progress nite:id="Bmr012.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.19">A 'no-frills' recognizer, trained on Switchboard acoustic models and both Switchboard and Broadcast News language models, was used to test data for one transcribed meeting.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.20">Despite a glitch affecting the synchronized output of remaining data, recognition results for the first 20 minutes were very positive.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.21">The recognizer was successful in making accurate gender distinctions among speakers.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.22">It is anticipated that subsequent forced alignment procedures will also generate good results, enabling the group to analyze other types of signal information, such as prosody and overlapping speech segments.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.23">Future work will involve getting assessments of forced aligned data from linguists on the accuracy of time marks.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.24">The collection of Meeting Recorder data is ongoing, and will include meetings by the Berkeley Even Deeper Understanding research group.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.25">Transcriptions are also ongoing, with nearly 10 hours of Meeting Recorder data transcribed so far.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.26">Future work will involve working out a system for getting subjects to approve transcriptions so that confidentiality agreements are upheld and data may be shared with other research groups.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.27">A visiting student from Norway is working with a member of ICSI to conduct a related project on echo cancellation for handling segments of overlapping speech.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr012.s.28">Finally, the group is expecting a visit from a representative of NIST.</sentence>
