<abstract nite:id="Bro005.abstract.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.1">The main topic for discussion by the Berkeley Meeting Recorder group was progress on the experiments run as part of the groups main project, a speech recogniser for the cellular industry.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.2">This included reporting the results, and making conclusions to shape future work.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.3">Also discussed were the details of the continued collaboration with project partner OGI.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bro005.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.4">Further investigation into the lack of difference using MSG features makes should not be made while they are on their current short time scale for results.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.5">Same goes for anything else that comes up and looks interesting, leave it for just now.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.6">Really should pick which results are looking the best at this stage, and take only them further.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.7">Someone should look closely at the non-TIMIT databases, their Viterbi alignments, and their phoneme strings to see is that is why TIMIT is better.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.8">Need to get OGI's system from them, and get it running like they do, before integrating into it.</sentence>

</decisions>
<problems nite:id="Bro005.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.9">It is unclear if the English TIMIT database is providing the best results because English is the best language or TIMIT is the most accurately labelled dataset because it was hand labelled.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.10">The results table was very large and difficult to follow; it was unclear which of the numbers were error or accuracy rate, and straight rates or percentages of the baseline.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.11">There is very limited training data, over only a few conditions.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.12">Test and real data is likely to encompass much more variability.</sentence>

</problems>
<progress nite:id="Bro005.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.13">Speakers mn007 and fn002 have made further progress into the series of experiments they have been running in previous weeks; results were varied.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.14">The main conclusions include that training on task data is good, and the best broad training data is the English TIMIT database.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.15">Other results show that MSG makes little difference, adding MLP improves when trained on task data, decreases figures when not, while using delta generally improves the situation, as does on-line normalization.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.16">Starting work with a new broad database drawn from English, French, TIMIT, SPINE and English and Italian digits.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.17">mn007 has also started work on multi-band MLP trainings, with large context.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.18">OGI have a block diagram explaining their system, and the group are trying to fit their work into it.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro005.s.19">Speaker me006 has been helping prepare data, but is mainly doing work for a class he takes, looking at modelling asynchrony.</sentence>
