<abstract nite:id="Bmr018.abstract.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.1">The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed the preparation of a data sample for IBM, the manual adjustment of time bins by transcribers, recognition results for a test set of digits data, and forced alignments.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.2">Participants also talked about Eurospeech 2001 submissions, and exchanged comments on the proceedings of the recently attended Human Language Technologies conference (HLT'01).</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.3">Preliminary recognition results were presented for a subset of digits data.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.4">Efforts to deal with cross-talk and improve forced alignments for non-digits data were also discussed.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bmr018.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.5">Subsequent manual adjustment of speech and non-speech boundaries will be delegated to the transcriber pool.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.6">A subset of Meeting Recorder data will be prepared (i.e. pre-segmented and manually adjusted) for delivery to IBM.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.7">The Transcriber interface may require modifications if it becomes necessary for transcribers to quickly switch among waveform displays.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="Bmr018.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.8">Transcribers risk overlooking speech that is deeply embedded in the mixed signal.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.9">Should transcriptions be derived from each of the close-talking channels or from the mixed signal alone?</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.10">The pre-segmentation tool does not perform well on short utterances, e.g. backchannels.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.11">The Transcriber interface does not allow the user to quickly switch among visual displays, i.e. multi-channel waveforms.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.12">Forced alignments were problematic for non-digits data due to cross-talk.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.13">This problem was reported to be particularly bad for cross-talk featuring more than one word.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.14">Echo cancellation was considered as a means of improving forced alignments, but was ultimately deemed to be too time-consuming given the dynamic aspect of adapting distances between speakers.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.15">Comparing error rates in terms of the recording device used, i.e. lapel versus wireless microphones, is tedious.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.16">Deleting segments of the recordings is expected to be very time-consuming for transcribers.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.17">More results are needed for generating adequate submissions for Eurospeech'01.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.18">Participants have complained that the head-mounted microphone is uncomfortable.</sentence>

<progress nite:id="Bmr018.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.19">One meeting recording has been channelized and pre-segmented for delivery to IBM.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.20">A sample of digits data is being prepared for IBM.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.21">Preliminary recognition results were obtained for a subset of digits data.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.22">The error rate distribution was multimodal, reflecting differences in performance for native versus non-native speakers, and also possible pre-processing errors.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.23">Future efforts will involve an attempt to get good forced alignments on digits data and generate a report for Eurospeech'01.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.24">A program has been developed for replacing sections of recorded speech with editing bleeps.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.25">The tightening of time bins for one NSA meeting was checked and judged to be highly accurate.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr018.s.26">Efforts are ongoing to improve forced alignments for a subset of non-digits data, including acoustic adaptation manipulations.</sentence>
