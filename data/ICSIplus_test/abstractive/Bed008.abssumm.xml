<abstract nite:id="Bed008.abstract.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.1">A detailed diagram of the belief-net had already been disseminated.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.2">Its structure was discussed during the meeting.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.3">There are several endpoints (User, Ontology, Discourse etc) with separate EVA (Enter/View/Approach) values.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.4">Details of how different inputs feed into them were discussed at length.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.5">Ideas mentioned included grouping features of buildings like "selling", "fixing" and "exhibiting", as well as creating a User-compatibility node that would take different values depending on the situation and the user status.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.6">Similarly, a Go-there (towards a building) node can be influenced by things like the user's budget and discourse parameters amongst other things.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.7">The latter are still ill-defined at this stage.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.8">The study of the linguistic constructions that people use in this kind of navigational domain is expected to be prove useful in that respect.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.9">As each node in the tree is the decision point of the combination of its parent nodes, which rules govern this combination is an important issue.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.10">There are several approaches ranging from simply averaging the inputs to using a hidden variable in order to weight them differently depending on context.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.11">If the latter architecture is used, the net could -to an extent- be trained with the data that is currently being collected.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bed008.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.12">Although this was mainly a brainstorming meeting, some minor tasks were allocated for the near future.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.13">Since the net architecture and possible decision algorithms were discussed, it is necessary to examine how much of this JavaBayes can accommodate and, if not, what modifications would be necessary.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.14">Additionally, the german partners visiting the institute will need to see some results of the new system design.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.15">Finally, the analysis of the linguistic constructions for the current research domain can begin even with limited data, as, at this stage, they need not be very detailed.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="Bed008.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.16">The is only a diagrammatic view of how the decision tree for the EVA task looks like.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.17">A lot of the details have been glossed over: the user model can potentially comprise a huge number of factors; a planning "go-there" node needs input from several other areas of the net; there are intricate interactions between discourse and the situation model.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.18">Similarly, what discourse properties are of importance and how they influence EVA probabilities is still a mystery.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.19">On a more general note, there is also the question of whether the net should be updated continuously or only when it is needed.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.20">No final decision was taken as to the rules of computation applying in the belief-net.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.21">The more interesting solutions would ideally require training data, and it is still debatable whether the current collection would be appropriate for this particular task.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.22">In any case, how different architectures can be implemented in JavaBayes and what modifications would be necessary for the purposes of this project also need to be investigated.</sentence>
</problems>
<progress nite:id="Bed008.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.23">A simulator of the set of influence links forming the belief-net was created and put up for discussion.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.24">Different sections of the analysis, such as the user model, the ontology and the discourse are represented as a layer of nodes each with its own EVA probabilities.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.25">They form endpoints to which other nodes like Go-there, User_Budget, User_Thrift and Prosody feed into.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.26">The second presentation concerned the set of computational rules that are to be used with the net.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.27">The simple way to decide on the final output is the majority vote (which E, V or A form the majority of the parent nodes' outputs).</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.28">This assumes that all inputs are of equal importance.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.29">Alternatively, each input can be weighted in a fixed way.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.30">A third option is to create a hidden variable that makes the decision of which of the inputs is more trusted in a particular situation.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed008.s.31">The same variable can potentially also change the weighting of each input.</sentence>
