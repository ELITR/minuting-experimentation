<abstract nite:id="Bmr015.abstract.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.1">Topics discussed by the Berkeley Meeting Recorder group included the status of the first test set of digits data, naming conventions for files, speaker identification tags, and encoding files with details about the recording.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.2">The group also discussed a proposal for a grant from the NSF's ITR (Information Technology Research) program, transcriptions, and efforts by speaker mn005 to detect speaker overlap using harmonicity-related features.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.3">Particular focus was paid to questions about transcription procedures, i.e. how to deal with overlooked backchannels, and audible breaths.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bmr015.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.4">A small percentage of transcripts will be changed to reflect mis-read, uncorrected digits.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.5">A speaker database will be compiled to establish consistent links between speakers and their corresponding identification tags.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.6">Sections of densely overlapping speech will require hand-checking so that overlooked backchannels may be manually segmented and labelled.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.7">The transcribers should only code audible breaths within a grouping of words, and not outside regions of continuous speech.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.8">It was further determined that audible breaths are an important facet of recorded speech, and that removing them from the corpus would be contrary to the aims of the project.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.9">Speaker mn005 will prepare his results for detecting speaker overlap and present them in the next meeting.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="Bmr015.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.10">During digits readings, subjects tend to chunk numbers together rather than reading each number separately.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.11">When working from the mixed channel, transcribers may select only one start and end time for overlapping speech, resulting in points of overlap that are less tightly tuned.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.12">Transcribers are likely to overlook backchannels in densely populated sections of speaker overlap.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.13">Speaker mn014 reported that this is also problematic for the automatic detection of speech and non-speech, as backchannels that are very short and not loud enough will inevitably be overlooked.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.14">Speaker mn005 reported problems distinguishing between possible harmonics and other frequency peaks, and creating an algorithm for obtaining the instantaneous frequency.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.15">The encoding of all audible breaths is too time-consuming.</sentence>
</problems>
<progress nite:id="Bmr015.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.16">The first test set of digits is complete and includes 4,000 lines, each comprising between 1-10 digits.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.17">New digits forms were distributed for eliciting different prosodic groupings of numbers.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.18">New naming conventions were discussed as means for facilitating the sorting process.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.19">Existing files will be changed so that all filenames are of equal length.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.20">Similar changes will be made to speaker identification tags.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.21">Files will also contain information specifying channel, microphone, and broadcaster information.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.22">A proposal is being drafted for a grant from the NSF's ITR program for extending the research initiatives of the Meeting Recorder project.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.23">Speaker fe008 is performing channel-by-channel transcriptions to create tighter time bins.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.24">Tentative plans are to assign single channels to the transcriber pool and then piece them together afterwards.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.25">Efforts by speaker mn005 are in progress to detect speaker overlap in the mixed signal using harmonicity-related features.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.26">For determining the instantaneous frequency, speaker me013 recommended deriving the maxima from energy multiples of a given frequency.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr015.s.27">It was also suggested that speaker mn005 should determine whether portions of the signal are voiced or unvoiced, as voiced intervals reflecting a relatively low fraction of energy in the harmonic sequence are likely to indicate sections of overlap.</sentence>
