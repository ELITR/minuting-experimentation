Hi , I'm David and I'm supposed to be an industrial designer . 
Um , I just got the project announcement about what the project is <other> . 
Designing a remote control . 
That's about it , didn't get anything else . 
Did you get the same thing ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Cool . 
There's too much gear . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
Okay . 
Can't draw . <laugh> 
Um . 
Yeah . 
Um , well anyway , 
I don't know , it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head . 
Um . Yes . Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals . 
Allergic to animal fur , 
so um fish was a natural choice . 
Um , yeah , 
and I kind of like whales . 
They come in and go <sound imitating devouring something> eat everything in sight . <laugh> 
And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting . 
<laugh> Tail's a bit big , I think . <laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
<laugh> It's an after dinner dog then . 
<other> 
Hmm . 
It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 
'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons . 
So , possibly . 
Hmm . 
Yeah . 
And you keep losing them . 
Finding them is really a pain , you know . 
I mean it's usually quite small , 
or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch 
or it's kicked under the table . 
You know . 
Yep . 
Mm-hmm . 
I think one factor would be production cost . 
Because there's a cap there , 
so um depends on how much you can cram into that price . Um . 
I think that that's the main factor . 
<laugh> Cool .
