<sentence nite:id="Bro014.s.1">The ICSI Meeting Recorder Group at Berkeley met to discuss progress on their main project, Aurora.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro014.s.2">They discussed a conference call with project partners, there have been some developments that should help speed up experiments, along with some progress made in the current area they are looking, voiced/unvoiced detection.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro014.s.3">A number of other members of the group also reported the progress they were making on their work.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bro014.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro014.s.4">Me018 will mail people with details about changes to their system in order to run code on the IBM Linux machine, along with the name of the machine.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro014.s.5">Mn007 is going to try and convince OGI to use his new filters, and enquire as to the setting of a standard for the system.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="Bro014.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro014.s.6">There was a conference call for the Aurora Project, but no one from ICSI was involved.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro014.s.7">Not only are the group unsure what if anything was decided, but project changes are being considered including changing the baseline and improvement weighting, though everyone has their own opinion on these matters.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro014.s.8">The group needs more female voices in the Meeting Recorder data, though fn002 does not consider herself very suitable.</sentence>

<progress nite:id="Bro014.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro014.s.9">Me018 has been attempting to make experimentation faster by reducing the iterations in the HTK training.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro014.s.10">These will can be reset once the system is finalised.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro014.s.11">He then wants to try and improve accuracy may increasing the number of Gaussian mixtures in the models.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro014.s.12">Mn007 reported OGI's work on spectral subtraction, as well as his testing his new filter.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro014.s.13">The latency is reduced, and improvement increased on well matched case, though decreased on mis-matched.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro014.s.14">Along with fn002 he has been looking into voiced/unvoiced detection, and they are still looking for features.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro014.s.15">So far they are using features which approximate important details, and they seem reasonably robust on noise.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro014.s.16">Me026 has decided against using the exact method of reverberation cancellation he previously discussed, because its output does not fit the current system.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro014.s.17">Me006 has been reading on a slight tangent looking at classic work on modulation spectrum, which has inspired some ideas for input.</sentence>
