<abstract nite:id="Buw001.abstract.1">
<sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.1">The discussion concerned mainly ideas about data collection and the nature and generation of queries on meetings.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.2">Meeting notes taken by participants as standard minutes or summaries, or on devices like CrossPads can provide useful information.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.3">There is also interest in the speech community for fusion of speech with visual data.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.4">Taking some photos of the whiteboard and the positioning of participants is easy enough to do.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.5">Another option would be the recording by participants of short oral summaries of the meeting.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.6">Summaries could be used to bootstrap for queries, the exact nature of which remained nebulous.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.7">Candidate types are keyword searches, action items, elaboration on points of interest, and agreement between participants.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.8">An initial prototype system to test any hypotheses can be pipelined.</sentence> 
<sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.9">The recorded data will be stored on CD-ROM's and sent to IBM for transcription.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.10">There is also work being done on the annotation of prosody.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.11">The corpus could be enriched with found data (public or collected by other projects), if those prove appropriate for use in the project.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.12">Finally, project web pages and mailing list are being set up and UW are going to investigate the suitability of their recording equipment.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Buw001.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.13">Within the piloting of data collection ideas, it was decided that CrossPads are going to be used for detection of "hot points" during the meeting.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.14">Other ideas to be tested are the use of summaries or minutes -if a group normally produce them- and the recording of oral summaries by individual participants after the meeting.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.15">Photographing the contents of the board and the positions of the meeting participants will provide extra information.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.16">For query generation purposes, all participants will also be asked for their highlight of the meeting.</sentence> 
<sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.17">The general goal regarding the corpus is to investigate the acquisition of further appropriate data through public sources or available collections of other institutions.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.18">As to recordings at ICSI, the group agreed that imposing rules of participation  in order to avoid speaker overlaps was not desirable.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.19">Instead, they will aim for collecting stylistically varied data (different group dynamics and types of meeting).</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.20">Further action will also be taken to close other pending issues: the web pages will be organised, the recording room will be finalised and UW will also test their recording infrastructure.</sentence>

</decisions>
<problems nite:id="Buw001.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.21">The recording of meetings and any possible additional tasks must be set up in a user-friendly way, otherwise it would be difficult to recruit volunteers.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.22">Asking participants to do more than they normally would in a meeting could put people off.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.23">The video-recording of meetings, apart from adding an extra level of instrumentation complexity, can also make people apprehensive.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.24">The usability and usefulness of CrossPads is not certain.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.25">Acquiring data from other sources will not be straightforward, as they may either not be suitable for this project or not publicly available.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.26">Querying is also a major issue: what users would ask from a system is not clear.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.27">How this system would resolve high-level queries (eg regarding agreement between participants) is also hard to tell at this stage.</sentence>
<sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.28">As transcription has not started yet, there was concern as to how IBM will deal with multi-channel data.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.29">The abundance of speaker overlaps may also affect the quality of the trascription.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.30">However, it was accepted that some problems with the transcription of jargon are, to an extent, unavoidable.</sentence>
</problems>
<progress nite:id="Buw001.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.31">Five hours of recorded pilot data are already available.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.32">IBM, who will be carrying out the transcribing, have been emailed the URL's for the online data set-up and for the transcribing tool.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Buw001.s.33">Some work has already been done with the annotation of speech features like prosody.</sentence>
