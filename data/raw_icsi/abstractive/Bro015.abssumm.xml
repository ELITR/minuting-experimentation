<abstract nite:id="Bro015.abstract.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro015.s.1">In a brief meeting the Berkeley Meeting Recorder Group discussed what little progress they had made in the last week.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro015.s.2">They also talked about visits from members of research partner OGI, and a conference call held by the Aurora Project collaborators.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro015.s.3">One member brought up some work that backs up some points he was making in previous meetings.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bro015.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro015.s.4">Nothing has so far happened about standardizing file sharing between groups, though the process has been started, and so this is a topic they will come back to after the meeting.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="Bro015.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro015.s.5">There were still no final decisions made in the conference call held to discuss the Aurora project.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro015.s.6">OGI will probably use a VAD, and everyone will probably be given the same one, and the results weighting scheme will probably be the same.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro015.s.7">Since some members of OGI's team are absent, me013 feels ICSI's side should pick up the slack a little, which they are not doing by mn007 and fn002 taking time out to write a report.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro015.s.8">Speaker me018 has so far not mailed anyone details of changing iteration or running HTK on the Linux machine, so no one has been able to take advantage of his work of recent weeks.</sentence>

</problems>
<progress nite:id="Bro015.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro015.s.9">Speaker mn007 has run the tandem system with MSG, but there was no significant improvement.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro015.s.10">He and fn002 have also begun to write up the report on their recent work, so aren't making much progress on experimenting.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro015.s.11">Me006 is still reading, getting some background on phonetics.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro015.s.12">Speaker me026 is considering looking at using phase for reverberation removal, as the work he is basing his on did not appear to consider it.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro015.s.13">Speaker me018 has not made much progress, since he has been dealing with technical issues, but he has been reading a paper which backs up his belief that reducing the iteration in the HTK training does no harm.</sentence>
