<sentence nite:id="Bro010.s.1">The Berkeley Meeting Recorder Group discussed the progress of several of their members.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro010.s.2">The progress being made on the group's main project, a speech recogniser for the cellular industry was reported.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro010.s.3">The group also touched upon matters that had broader implications for the work, such as the work of other groups on the same project.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro010.s.4">There were also some progress reports from group members working on other projects.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bro010.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro010.s.5">No one from the group attended a recent video conference about their main project, but they need to find out what was discussed in it.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro010.s.6">Until they do, they will continue on, assuming nothing major has been changed.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro010.s.7">Need to discuss any new investigation with partners to make sure work is not repeated.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="Bro010.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro010.s.8">There was a recent video conference meeting discussing the cellular project, but no one from the group attended and so do not know if it has any implications for their work, if any important decisions were made.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro010.s.9">This includes decisions on the desired latency for the system, since the group is currently at the limit.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro010.s.10">Spectral subtraction, which the group is currently investigating as a method of dealing with noise, may add to the delay time, but also it is hard to do with non-linear noise.</sentence>

</problems>
<progress nite:id="Bro010.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro010.s.11">Speakers mn007 and fn002 have been working on the groups main project, looking for bugs in the system, and trying to improve latency.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro010.s.12">The group's work currently has the highest latency on the project, and they are looking for ways to cut the delays.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro010.s.13">These include replacing FIR filters with IIR, and investigating spectral subtraction methods which do not require taking the future into account.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro010.s.14">Speaker me006 has put together a proposal to extend work on a multiband system using low-level detectors, and applying it to recognition.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro010.s.15">Speaker me026 has been looking at method for recognition using far mics, trying to deal with reverberation and echo-cancellation.</sentence>
