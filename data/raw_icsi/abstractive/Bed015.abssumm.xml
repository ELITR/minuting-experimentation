<abstract nite:id="Bed015.abstract.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.1">The discussion concerned the revised semantic specification and the construction formalism.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.2">The different levels of the latter focus on what construction types are encountered and what bindings there are between them.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.3">The notation maintains properties of both dependency and constituent-based grammars.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.4">The encoding of features is still incomplete: frame profiles, focus, adjectives, nominal expressions are phenomena in the process of being integrated.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.5">Similarly, ways to handle mental spaces will have to be added on top.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.6">On the other hand, the semantic specification structures information in terms of "scenario", "referent" and "discourse segment".</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.7">Each category comprises a number of slots filled in by information derived from the utterance.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.8">It is, essentially, a toolkit with which to create semantic constructions, as well as the bindings between them and with the ontology.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.9">Among the issues still being defined, mental spaces and context (eg pronoun references) present similarities that can be echoed in the specification.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.10">Work on both of these formalisms will continue with circumscription of the construction space that will be studied in more detail.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.11">Work on construal will use Bayes-nets, which will be fed information from other modules and implement general rules to infer how utterances are construed.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bed015.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.12">The semantic specification requires some adjustments.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.13">Amongst other things "cause" has to be added as another X-schema.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.14">Linguistic hedging will also be encoded as a demarcation of evidentiality or speaker confidence.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.15">Mental spaces can be tackled with mechanisms that can also deal with context issues (time, space etc.): creating a base space and rules of interaction with other interconnected spaces.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.16">However, the complexity of these mechanisms has to be bound as well: it is necessary to define the range of constructions to be studied.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.17">Given the domains currently used (tourist, child language learning), some features, like speaker attitude, are not of equal importance at this stage.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.18">On the other hand, it was decided for the inheritance between constructions to be left out for now, as the notation can be rendered more elegant later on.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.19">Finally, a preliminary presentation on the idea of how to use Bayes-nets for construal will take place in the next meeting.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="Bed015.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.20">The construction formalism is not yet complete as to the semantic constraints -the terminology has also been met with objections- and does not deal with mental spaces.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.21">On their own, constructions can only give limited information regarding mental spaces: forms can provide cues to create a different mental space, but the semantic nuances are defined by context.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.22">It is not decided at this stage whether the necessary values should be coded within the construction or as part of construal.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.23">Other issues concern focus and stress: focus is seen as an information structure device, but there has been no suggestion as to how to predict its effects or break it down in possible focused elements; as to stress, it may not be useful as a form value, as it shows the focus exponent, but not what the focus is on.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.24">Moving to the semantic specification, the analysis still needs mechanisms to deal with causality, as well as mental spaces and bindings between them.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.25">Additionally, how referring expressions are linked to referents or even how mental spaces affect this linking are still to lay down in detail.</sentence>
</problems>
<progress nite:id="Bed015.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.26">The revised semantic specification and construction formalism are more stable than the previous versions.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.27">In the latter, we find both construction types and meaning types along with formal considerations like verb subcategorisation, or the ones a "directed motion" construction would dictate.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.28">Semantic constraints also come into play.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.29">The semantic specification, on the other hand, is split into three levels: "scenario" is a list of schemas and bindings between them, which describes the current event in terms of Source-Path-Goal, Container, etc.; "referent" is about the entities in the discourse and includes grammatical information and pointers to the ontology; "discourse segment" comprises utterance-specific things.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed015.s.30">Apart from the presentation, JavaBayes can now run through the modified web page of the project.</sentence>
