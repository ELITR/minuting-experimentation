<sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.1">The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed digits data, recent ASR results, the status of transcriptions, and disk space and storage format issues.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.2">Approximately two hours of digits have been recorded, half of which have been extracted.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.3">Researchers doing ASR are looking into methods for generating a better channel-based segmentation to improve recognition results for close-talking microphone data.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.4">Transcription checking procedures were reviewed, and efforts to coordinate the channelization and presegmention of data with the tightening of time bins were discussed.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.5">The group also talked about downsampling and strategies for coping with low disk space.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bmr016.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.6">Digits forms will instruct speakers to read digits separately and not as connected numbers.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.7">A tentative decision was made to collect overlapping digits from speakers.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.8">Transcribers will be given channelized data that has been segmented for speech/non-speech boundaries to determine whether such pre-processing facilitates the transcription process.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="Bmr016.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.9">Participants have been slow in returning the relevant forms necessary for matching digits data with speaker IDs. Forms containing digits that were written out in English were unsuccessful for obtaining desired prosodic groupings.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.10">Acoustic adaptation is problematic for speakers who seldom talk during meetings.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.11">Speaker overlap causes recognition errors.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.12">The lapel microphone is problematic as it picks up overlapping background speech.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.13">More disk space is needed.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.14">Loading long waveforms in X Waves is very time consuming.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.15">The dictionary must be updated with forms introduced as part of speaker fe008's set of transcription conventions.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.16">The ongoing tightening of boundaries on time bins causes segment boundaries to change, indicating potential problems for other ongoing processing tasks.</sentence>

<progress nite:id="Bmr016.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.17">A test set of digits data totalling two hours is nearly complete.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.18">Digit extraction has been performed on roughly half of this data.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.19">Future work may involve experimenting with the reading of digits in different prosodic groupings.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.20">Preliminary ASR results were discussed.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.21">Subsequent efforts will involve generating a better channel-based segmentation, and possibly doing echo cancellation, to improve recognition on the close-talking microphone data.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.22">Filename conventions are being standardized.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.23">Transcription checking procedures have been formalized, including a spell check, producing an exhaustive list of forms identified in the data, attributing every utterance to the appropriate speaker ID, glossing spoken forms with their full orthographic counterparts, e.g. 'cuz' and 'because', transcribing acronyms, and encoding comments, i.e. glosses, vocalic and non-vocalic non-speech events, pragmatic cues, and the standardization of spoken forms, e.g. 'mm-hmm'.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.24">Scripts will be used to convert a channelized master copy into forms that are appropriate for doing both recognition and linguistic analysis.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bmr016.s.25">Coordinated efforts are in progress between the transcriber pool and speaker mn014 to fine-tune presegmented output to handle data from a variety of speakers and regions of speaker overlap.</sentence>
