<sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.1">The data collection running in parallel with the project can start shortly with recruiting subjects.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.2">Meanwhile, the german parser now works with english sentences.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.3">The parser's output modifies the XML used by the system to initiate actions and generate responses.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.4">The XML for Map requests also comprise a route, route elements and points of interest along the way.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.5">It is at this level that Enter/Vista/Approach tags will be added as action modes.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.6">As the project evolves, further enrichment of the ontology (actions, linguistic features) will be necessary.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.7">Similarly, object representations will include an EVA vector.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.8">This can be incorporated in the database entry for a particular building or inherited from the ontology of the building type.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.9">These elements will constitute only a small part of the inputs of the Bayes-net that determines the action mode.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.10">The actual number of the inputs can create a combinatorial explosion when setting the probabilities.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.11">Noisy-OR's can help avoid this by simplifying the probability tables and applying a deterministic function to produce their complete version.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.12">In any case, further to fulfilling the basic requirements (translating the parser and the generator into english), the project is entirely open-ended in terms of focus of research.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bed005.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.13">As the data collection is about to begin, there are some minor changes to be done in the design of the experiment, the script and the permission forms.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.14">Subjects can be recruited either from within the university or through other social circles.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.15">As to the system design, the next step is the translation of the generator into english.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.16">Moreover, it is important to test the system and its internal workings by adding new sentence types and modifying the parser.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.17">All further research will use the existing domain ("tourists in Heidelberg"), as this provides enough diversity for the purposes of the project.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.18">The german partners for the project will realise all the necessary changes in the ontology.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.19">It is therefore preferable for the group to exercise foresight and agree on the set of new tags they will need in the long run, so that they limit the number of change requests.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.20">Finally, on a more technical note, Noisy-OR's were discussed and considered a sensible approach to deal with the potential problems with the setting the conditional probabilities of the Bayes-nets.</sentence> 

</decisions>
<problems nite:id="Bed005.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.21">Although the parser has been modified to work with english, the details of its internal workings (calling functions, setting discourse variables, generating actions) are not yet clear.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.22">Understanding the parsed data is helped by the database of objects, people and events accompanying the system, but the mapping of referring expressions to database objects can still be a hurdle.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.23">On a different level, the Bayes-net used to generate the different action modes can easily become unmanageable as the number of features to be taken into account increases.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.24">This can be tackled with the use of the Noisy-OR technique.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.25">The deterministic functions this requires cannot be introduced directly into JavaBayes, although some runaround ways can be implemented.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.26">A final, high-level issue, that has not been dealt with yet, is the definition of the constructions and the construction grammar framework analysis behind the whole enterprise.</sentence>
</problems>
<progress nite:id="Bed005.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.27">The preparation for the data collection is almost finished and expected to start experiments within a couple of weeks.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.28">There is some additional TV and cinema data currently being translated from german.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.29">The german parser has been translated and it can now be used for a range of sentence types in english.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.30">On the other hand, the translation of some parts of the relational database accompanying the system has also been commissioned.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.31">EML have provided the structure for Map requests, the basic representation of the navigational goals upon which further action modes are going to be built.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed005.s.32">The same people are also creating a general, top-level XML object ontology that will include all types of buildings.</sentence>
