<sentence nite:id="Bro016.s.5">For next weeks meeting, speaker me018 will provide numbers on his experiments into adjusting insertion penalties.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro016.s.6">Speaker me013 feels that mn007 and fn002 should just put together the coherent bare-bones of their report, and move back to experimenting, leaving the report for the end of the project.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro016.s.7">He also feels that they should discuss some aspects of future work, for clarity's sake, with the visitor from OGI.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="Bro016.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro016.s.8">The main project the group is working on, Aurora, has a number of rules attaches as to what developers can and cannot play with, but this needs to be clarified.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro016.s.9">The rules are adhered to in the small community, but make no sense from a broader research perspective.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro016.s.10">While writing their report, mn007 and fn002 have noticed some tables contain only partial results, and there are things they do not recall the reasoning behind.</sentence>

<progress nite:id="Bro016.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro016.s.11">Speaker me018 has done a little initial research into the next area he is to look at, adjusting the scaling and the insertion penalties.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro016.s.12">Playing with the latter made little difference, though was coming from a different feature set.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro016.s.13">Speakers mn007 and fn002 have been working on their report, logically writing up everything they have done so far.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro016.s.14">Mn007 has also been working with a new dataset, preparing it for use as a more realistic source of noise, though it is not clear if this is allowed.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro016.s.15">Speaker me006 has continued to look at phonetic events, and has come up with a plan for his future work.</sentence>
