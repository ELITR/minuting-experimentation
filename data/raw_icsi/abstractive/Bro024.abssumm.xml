<sentence nite:id="Bro024.s.1">Another weekly meeting on ICSI's Meeting Recorder Group at Berkeley, though the members are joined by a visiting researcher.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro024.s.2">The groups regulars reported progress on their work on mean subtraction, noise estimation, voice activity detection and the Vector Taylor Series.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro024.s.3">While on these topics, related areas discussed included recognition window length, training versus test set sizes, artificial distortion and latency concerns.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bro024.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro024.s.4">Speaker fn002 is soon to be leaving the group, and so she will choose her best setup, run a complete set of experiments, and write up her work, procedure and results for next week.</sentence>

<sentence nite:id="Bro024.s.5">New filters introduced to reduce latency by mn052 , performed slightly worse than those they replaced.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro024.s.6">Whereas mn007 has added some latency to the process which he feels he can reduce.</sentence>

<progress nite:id="Bro024.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bro024.s.7">Speaker me026 has been working on mean subtraction, his most recent results are suspiciously poor, and he is attempting to integrate the method into the SmartKom system.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro024.s.8">Speaker mn052 has been looking at noise estimation, because he was getting better results with one data set than another.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro024.s.9">Speaker mn007 has been looking at VAD performance, and getting some good results, though nothing that hasn't been produced before.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro024.s.10">Speaker fn002 has been running VTS experiments, but her results aren't particularly impressive.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bro024.s.11">Speaker me006 has been working on the proposal for his thesis and outlined his idea.</sentence>
