<sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.1">The initial task of the EDU group is to work on inferring intentions through context.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.2">In the navigational paradigm used for the task, these intentions are to "see" to "enter" or to "get to the closest point of" a building.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.3">There will be purpose-designed experiments carried out.</sentence>  <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.4">However, the starting point is, through the use of existing data, to determine possible linguistic, discourse or situation features that define intentionality.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.5">These may include the type of building, time of day, particular phrases used or whether the user is a tourist or a native.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.6">Initially, these features will be hand-coded, but the goal is to find ways of extracting them automatically from the XML data.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.7">Consequently, they will be fed into a belief-net -implemented on a software package like JavaBayes- and the conditional probability of each intention calculated.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.8">A prototype system will be put together to test hypotheses regarding both the exact nature of the features and how intentions are derived from them.</sentence>

<decisions nite:id="Bed002.decisions.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.9">Inferring intentions in a navigational context is an appropriate task both in project and real-world terms.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.10">Its goals are clearly defined and contributre to a smarter system.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.11">Although there are some preliminary data to work on, task-specific experiments and recordings will take place.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.12">The XML format is going to be used has not been defined, although the SmartKom data can be used as a foundation.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.13">In the first instance, the group will have to decide on the software package to be used for the creation and manipulation of the belief-nets.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.14">Stability and ease-of-use -in addition to ability to handle XML- of the package are the focus at this stage, instead of the ability to handle large amounts of data.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.15">Experts in Bayes nets within ICSI can be consulted on the matter.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.16">The decision will be presented in the next meeting along with a first schema of the belief-nets themselves.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.17">Possible intermediate nodes can be added to the nets after this.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.18">The hypothesis that a set of features from which intentions can be derived exists has to be assessed, before moving on to how to extract these features from the data automatically.</sentence>

<problems nite:id="Bed002.problems.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.19">Curent navigation systems do not provide for the user's particular intentions when asking for directions.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.20">They always compute the shortest path between source and destination.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.21">The SmartKom parser, for example, does not mark up data with features adequate for the inference of these intentions.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.22">Although it is understandable that language, discourse and situation features will play a role in how they are weighed, the exact nature of those features is unclear.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.23">Also hard to evaluate at this stage, is how the assumed features will combine in a belief-net, in order to provide the conditional probabilities of the users' intentions.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.24">Even if these problems are solved, extracting the features from the data may prove to be a bottleneck.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.25">The existing data are appropriate only for preliminary work, as they don't include intention-related information.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.26">On the other hand, the details of the experiments that will have to be designed to get more appropriate data are not clearcut and are yet to be settled.</sentence>

<progress nite:id="Bed002.progress.1">
<sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.27">When asking for directions, a user of a navigational device may wish to either view, enter or simply approach a building.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.28">This was identified as an initial problem to be tackled through "deep understanding"-type inferences.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.29">There is a set of data to start work on from previous work.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.30">Similarly, the SmartKom data-format and an ontology developed for the tourist domain (both in XML-standard formats) can be used as groundwork for defining the features, which indicate the user's intentions.</sentence> <sentence nite:id="Bed002.s.31">For the creation and management of the belief-nets necessary for the task, there are readily available packages -such as JavaBayes- and tools that can provide the infrastructure for a prototype system.</sentence>
