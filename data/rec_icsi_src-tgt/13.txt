{"dialogue": "so they could all have a type at the beginning . ok , and then again semantic constraints here are justare just bindings .", "summary": "abstract: the different levels of the latter focus on what construction types are encountered and what bindings there are between them ."}
{"dialogue": "but , you know , we have theproperties of dependency grammars and some properties of constituentsconstituent - based grammar .", "summary": "abstract: the notation maintains properties of both dependency and constituent-based grammars ."}
{"dialogue": "i think that 's still in progress . other things we did n't <breath> totally deal with , um , well , we 've had a lot of other stuff that keith and i have them working on in terms of like how you deal with like an adjective . you know , aa nominal expression .", "summary": "abstract: the encoding of features is still incomplete: frame profiles , focus , adjectives , nominal expressions are phenomena in the process of being integrated ."}
{"dialogue": "so there 's going to be some extrayou know , definitely other notation we 'll need for that which we skip for now .", "summary": "abstract: similarly , ways to handle mental spaces will have to be added on top ."}
{"dialogue": "so you see it 's `` scenario `` , `` referent `` and `` discourse segment `` . the `` scenario `` box ,", "summary": "abstract: on the other hand , the semantic specification structures information in terms of `` scenario '' , `` referent '' and `` discourse segment '' ."}
{"dialogue": "and actually it 's just a list of various slots from which you would drawdraw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ?", "summary": "abstract: each category comprises a number of slots filled in by information derived from the utterance ."}
{"dialogue": "which is made up entirely of these things and , uh , bindings among them . and bindings to ontology items . so thatthat the who that this is the tool kit under whi out of which you can make a semantic specification . so this is an that anything you have , in the party line , anything you have as the semantic side of constructions comes , from pieces of thisignoring li but it 's got to be pieces of this along with constraints among them .", "summary": "abstract: it is , essentially , a toolkit with which to create semantic constructions , as well as the bindings between them and with the ontology ."}
{"dialogue": "yeah , but youdo n't we ultimately want to handle that analogously to the way we handle time and place , um , we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces so that pulling something out of a discourse context is i think similar to other kinds of , uh , mental space phenomena .", "summary": "abstract: among the issues still being defined , mental spaces and context ( eg pronoun references ) present similarities that can be echoed in the specification ."}
{"dialogue": "um , and we 're going to have to s sort of bound the complexity . but just try to describe which ones you think we ought to have . justjust sort of , you know , define your space .", "summary": "abstract: work on both of these formalisms will continue with circumscription of the construction space that will be studied in more detail ."}
{"dialogue": "um , imagine youyou write a bayes - net , um , completely from scratch every time you do construal . and that fills in your cpt 's with which you can then query , um , thethe net that you just wrote and find out how thing x is construed as an utterance u . you may have some general rules as to how things can becan be construed as what , so that will allow you to craft thethethe initial notes .", "summary": "abstract: work on construal will use bayes-nets , which will be fed information from other modules and implement general rules to infer how utterances are construed ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "decisions: the semantic specification requires some adjustments ."}
{"dialogue": "except for `` cause `` , that i forgot . causal stuff we absolutely need .", "summary": "decisions: amongst other things `` cause '' has to be added as another x-schema ."}
{"dialogue": "well we were just talking about this sort of evidentiality and stuff like that , right ? confidence or something like that .", "summary": "decisions: linguistic hedging will also be encoded as a demarcation of evidentiality or speaker confidence ."}
{"dialogue": "um , it 's often thought of asit is also considered a mental space , same thing . yeah , but youdo n't we ultimately want to handle that analogously to the way we handle time and place , um , we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces it 's likeit 's like what 's happeningthat , yeah , what what 's happening , uh , there is that you 're moving the base space or something like that , right ?", "summary": "decisions: mental spaces can be tackled with mechanisms that can also deal with context issues ( time , space etc . ) : creating a base space and rules of interaction with other interconnected spaces ."}
{"dialogue": "um , and we 're going to have to s sort of bound the complexity . but just try to describe which ones you think we ought to have . justjust sort of , you know , define your space .", "summary": "decisions: however , the complexity of these mechanisms has to be bound as well: it is necessary to define the range of constructions to be studied ."}
{"dialogue": "wewe do n't have to care too much about the speaker attitude , right ? soso we 're gon na get the w we 're basically dealing with two domains , the tourist domain and theand the child language learning .", "summary": "decisions: given the domains currently used ( tourist , child language learning ) , some features , like speaker attitude , are not of equal importance at this stage ."}
{"dialogue": "is this , uhwas it intentional to leave off things like `` inherits `` i did n't want to think too much about that forfor now . can we make it more elegant ? ``", "summary": "decisions: on the other hand , it was decided for the inheritance between constructions to be left out for now , as the notation can be rendered more elegant later on ."}
{"dialogue": "um , imagine youyou write a bayes - net , um , completely from scratch every time you do construal . but the question is do you want to , for example , send the little group , uh , a draft of your thesis proposal we can do it th - thursday again .", "summary": "decisions: finally , a preliminary presentation on the idea of how to use bayes-nets for construal will take place in the next meeting ."}
{"dialogue": "and so it was an issue whether constraintsum , there were some linguists who reacted against `` constraints `` , saying , `` oh , if it 's not used for matching , then it should n't be called a constraint `` . the wholethe mental space thing is clearly not here .", "summary": "problems: the construction formalism is not yet complete as to the semantic constraints -the terminology has also been met with objections- and does not deal with mental spaces ."}
{"dialogue": "you know , um , basically all of these so - called space builders that are in the sentence are going to sort of assuming that at any point in discourse there 's the possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different world scenarios , whatever , and the speaker 's supposed to be keeping track of those . the , umthe construction that you actually get is just gon na sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you 've already got going , um , you 're supposed to add structure to . but it does n't tell you like exactly what itwhat the point of doing so is .", "summary": "problems: on their own , constructions can only give limited information regarding mental spaces: forms can provide cues to create a different mental space , but the semantic nuances are defined by context ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "problems: it is not decided at this stage whether the necessary values should be coded within the construction or as part of construal ."}
{"dialogue": "ok , it 's likeuh , it 's notit might be that there 's a syntactic , uh , device that you use to indicate focus uh , soso i think that 's kind of nice to keep `` focus `` being an information structure term . i think that 's still in progress . but it didoneone implication it does f have for the other side , which we 'll get to in a minute is that i could n't think of a good way to say `` here are the possible things that you could focus on `` , but ii ca n't think of like the limited set of possible meanings that you wouldthat you would focu maybe you want to forget stress . canonically speaking you canif you look at aa curve over sentence , you can find out where a certain stress is and say , `` hey , that 's my focus exponent . `` it does n't tell you anything what the focus is .", "summary": "problems: other issues concern focus and stress: focus is seen as an information structure device , but there has been no suggestion as to how to predict its effects or break it down in possible focused elements ; as to stress , it may not be useful as a form value , as it shows the focus exponent , but not what the focus is on ."}
{"dialogue": "except for `` cause `` , that i forgot . causal stuff we absolutely need . mental space we need . andand so we 're , uh gon na have to , um , chain those as well . it 'sas far as i can tell there 's this one major thing we have to do which is the mentalthe whole s mental space thing .", "summary": "problems: moving to the semantic specification , the analysis still needs mechanisms to deal with causality , as well as mental spaces and bindings between them ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "problems: additionally , how referring expressions are linked to referents or even how mental spaces affect this linking are still to lay down in detail ."}
