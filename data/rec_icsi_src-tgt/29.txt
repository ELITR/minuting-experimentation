{"dialogue": "so the only agenda items were janewas jane wanted to talk about some of the ibm transcription process . uh , and you just sent off a eurospeech paper , so , we should probably talk about the ibm transcription process stuff that", "summary": "abstract: the main topics of the agenda were a paper submitted to eurospeech and the organising of the recording transcriptions to be done by ibm ."}
{"dialogue": "uh , the one was that thejust thethe amount of overlap but , even if you take out all the backchannels you still have significant overlap .", "summary": "abstract: the results presented in the former show a significant percentage of overlapping speech even without counting in backchanneling ."}
{"dialogue": "and we rescored things um , a little bit more carefully . and then the second one was just basically the <breath> the stuff we had in thein the hlt paper on how overlaps effect therecognition performance . but basically what we found is after we take out these regionsso we only score the regions that were certified as foreground speech , <breath> the recognition error went down to almost <breath> uh , thelevel of the non - overlappedspeech .", "summary": "abstract: additionally , the high error rate in the recognition of such overlapping speech by the sri recogniser was minimised simply by changing the scoring method used ."}
{"dialogue": "so at the end after a discourse marker or after backchannel or after filled pause , you 're much more likely to be interrupted <breath> than before .", "summary": "abstract: finally , a strong correlation between pauses and interruptions was confirmed ."}
{"dialogue": "no . well , according to the transcripts .", "summary": "abstract: all these measurements were based on the sample of available transcripts ."}
{"dialogue": "although that 'sii take it that 's something that uh don willwill look at", "summary": "abstract: other features , like prosody , will be studied in the near future ."}
{"dialogue": "and also , um , the other person that wants itthere is one person at sri who wants to look at the <breath> um , you know , the uhthe data we have so far , and so i figured that ftp is the bestapproach . so what i did is i um <mouth> <breath> @ @ i made a n new directory", "summary": "abstract: an ftp directory containing such experimental data is being set up for the benefit of other researchers ."}
{"dialogue": "so the only agenda items were janewas jane wanted to talk about some of the ibm transcription process . so , we should probably talk about the ibm transcription process stuff that", "summary": "abstract: regarding the transcriptions to be carried out by ibm , the discussion mainly concerned the format of the recordings that should be sent to them ."}
{"dialogue": "and , if the chunked files focused on the dominant speakers , <breath> then , whenwhen it got s patched together when it comes back from ibm , we can add the backchannels . and you just use the s the segments of the dominant speaker then ? forfor sending toto ibm but then we could just use thethe output of the detector , and do the beeping on it , and send it to i b without having her check anything . butbut iii haveanother suggestion on that , which is , <breath> since , really what this is , isisis trying to in the large , send the right thing to them and there is gon na be thisthis post - processing step , and we 'llwe 'll fix things up", "summary": "abstract: suggestions included sending only the channels with the dominant speakers for transcription , but it was finally agreed on sending the original files with minimal modifications , as there will be extensive in-house post-processing ."}
{"dialogue": "so that if youif you playback that bin and have it in the mode where it stops at the boundary , <breath> it sounds like a normal word . but my general goal <breath> when there wassufficient space , room , pauseafter itto have it bekind of a natural feelinggap .", "summary": "abstract: within this discussion , the rationale behind the coding of the time bins according to the flow of discourse was also explained ."}
{"dialogue": "we should probablyuhgive them the non - downsampled versions . but , umthey probably w want the originals .", "summary": "decisions: the files made available in the ftp directory will be the original ones ( before down-sampling ) , as these seem to be wanted by other parties ."}
{"dialogue": "yeah , in fact after our meeting uh , this morning thilo came in and said that <breath> um , there could beother differences between <breath> the uhalready transcribed meeting with the beeps in it and one that hasjust r been run through his process . so tomorrow , <breath> when we go to make the umuh , chunked file <breath> for ibm , we 're going to actually compare the two . and then we 're gon na do the beep - ify on both , and listen to them and see if we notice any real differences .", "summary": "decisions: moreover , as files may have been modified through different processing , tests will be carried out in order to ensure the generation of beep files in a consistent way ."}
{"dialogue": "so whatwhat we 're probably gon na do is just write a script , that if two , chunks are very close to each other on the same channel we 'll just merge them . but i like this idea ofuh , for our purposes for thefor the ibm preparation , <breath> uh , n having thesejoined together ,", "summary": "decisions: also towards this goal , some of the time bins will need to be merged ."}
{"dialogue": "uh , because we could use that to fine tune our alignment process i mean w i mean what i wouldi was interested in is having <breath> a se having time marks for the beginnings and ends of speech ii hand - adjusted two of them soso at some point we will try to fine - tune our forced alignment", "summary": "decisions: on the other hand , the two meetings where time bins have been hand-coded in detail will be used to fine-tune the forced alignments ."}
{"dialogue": "we need to give brian the beeps file , and we send it to ibm . the other one is <breath> we just run his thing and send it to ibm . send it off to ibm .", "summary": "decisions: recordings will be sent to ibm for transcription ."}
{"dialogue": "but then we could just use thethe output of the detector , and do the beeping on it , and send it to i b so thethe one suggestion is you know we <breath> we run thilo 's thing the other one is <breath> we just run his thing and send it to ibm . and that is <breath> if we go ahead and we <breath> just run his , and we generate the beeps file , then we have somebody listen beeps file . put the beeps file ,", "summary": "decisions: before that , the files will be automatically pre-segmented into speech / non-speech bins and the beeps will be inserted ."}
{"dialogue": "the other problem is , that when itwhen it uh d i on the breathy ones , where you get <breath> <breath> breathing , uh , inti indicated as speech . so , i could run this on those breathy channels , and what that 'll do is just cut the time a little further .", "summary": "decisions: in order to make things easier for the transcribers , breathy channels , which are erroneously marked as speech , will be re-classified correctly with other methods ."}
{"dialogue": "why do n't we check through a bunch of things by sampling it ?", "summary": "decisions: all this pre-processing will have to be evaluated first by checking a sample of the output files ."}
{"dialogue": "what can you do ? and we 'll correct it when it comes back .", "summary": "decisions: other issues , like whether and how synthesised speech off a laptop needs be transcribed , will be resolved during the in-house post-processing of the transcriptions ."}
{"dialogue": "we actually exceeded the delayed deadline by o another day , i hope they accept it .", "summary": "problems: there is a slight worry about the acceptance of the paper submitted to eurospeech as the deadline was exceeded ."}
{"dialogue": "well , we did n't get to look at that , yeah , i just wonder if you have to normalize by the numbers of speakers or something . i bet there 's a weak dependence .", "summary": "problems: as to the content of the paper , the overlap statistics have not been normalised against the number of participants in the conversation , although the dependency is probably going to be a weak one ."}
{"dialogue": "there 's no statement about cause and effect .", "summary": "problems: additionally , the correlation between pauses in speech and interruptions does not provide a cause-and-effect link for these phenomena ."}
{"dialogue": "yeah , in fact after our meeting uh , this morning thilo came in and said that <breath> um , there could beother differences between <breath> the uhalready transcribed meeting with the beeps in it and one that hasjust r been run through his process . that 's because of channel overlap .", "summary": "problems: the preparation of files for transcription by ibm is facing some minor difficulties , as some features ( hand-coded time boundaries , multiplicity of channels etc ) may complicate the generation of beep files ."}
{"dialogue": "but you know , i wanted to say , his segmentation is so good , that <breath> um , the part that i listened to with her yesterday <breath> did n't need any adjustments of the bins . i can'treallyhhh , tsk . ido n't have really representative numbers , i think .", "summary": "problems: besides this , the automatic pre-segmentation has been deemed to be good , but there are still no specific measurements to verify this ."}
{"dialogue": "and i <laugh> the speech - nonspeech detector just assigns randomly the speech toto one of the channels ,", "summary": "problems: the pre-segmentation tool also classifies synthesised speech used in a recording as `` normal speech '' and assigns a random channel to it ."}
{"dialogue": "a hand - transcriber would have trouble with that .", "summary": "problems: the transcribers at ibm may not be able to differentiate between the two ."}
