{"dialogue": "so . on friday we had our wizard test data test and um <outbreath> these are some of the results .", "summary": "abstract: a test run of the data collection design was very successful ."}
{"dialogue": "um , we have to refine the tasks more and more , which of course we have n't done at all , so far , in order to avoid this rephrasing , and uh my suggestion is of course wewe keep the wizard , because i think she did a wonderful job , umand also if she 's willing to take on the job of organizing all those subjects and stuff that would be wonderful .", "summary": "abstract: the group decided to hire the `` wizard '' and continue with the refinement of the design and recruitment of subjects ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "abstract: on the other hand , there was a presentation of a new version of the belief-net for the vista / enter / tango mode task ."}
{"dialogue": "so , what i did for thisthis isuh , a pedagogical belief - net and i grouped things according to whathow i thought they would fit in to uh image schemas that would be related . well , this is not a working bayes - net . but the uhthethe nice thing is that you know , it just is ais a visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple clearly have to be specified m more carefully", "summary": "abstract: it is not a working net yet , but identifying clusters of features that define the output mode provides a visual aid for further work ."}
{"dialogue": "is , if we just do this , we could wind up with a huge uh , combinatoric input to the mode thing . uh , we have a d a technical problem with the belief - nets that wewe do n't want all the com too many factors if weif we allow them to just go combinatorially .", "summary": "abstract: there are potential problems from a combinatorics perspective ."}
{"dialogue": "which is there are technical ways of doing it , and the other trick , which is not a technical trick , it 's kind of a knowledge engineering trick , is to make the neach node sufficiently narrow that you do n't get this combinatorics .", "summary": "abstract: these can be tackled either with technical adjustments or through careful knowledge engineering ."}
{"dialogue": "we have to add , you know , not too much about um object types and stuff , that 's another sort of thing `` ok , here 's aanother kind of minimal uh way of tackling this `` . add extra properties , a deterministic rule for every property", "summary": "abstract: a base solution for the task would be to simply add some extra action-mode rules in the smartkom system ."}
{"dialogue": "and umand here is exactly where what 's gon na be replaced with our bayes - net ,", "summary": "abstract: action modes , however , can be inferred more efficiently by feeding a collection of features -from the ontology , discourse history , parsing , etc . - into bayes-nets that would replace those rules ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "abstract: ideally , the results of this small task will give insights into the function of linguistic deep understanding ."}
{"dialogue": "so . what you 're trying to get out of this deep co cognitive linguistics is the fact that w if you know about sourcesource , paths and goals , and nnnall this sort of stuff , that a lot of this is the same , for different tasks . and thatuh there 'sthere 's somesome important generalities that you 're getting , so that if you have sources , you have trajectors and stuff like that , but what i 'd like to be able to do is to have the way that you extract properties , that will go into different bayes - nets , be theuh general . what you 'd really like of course is the same thing you 'd always like which is that you have um a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same o over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs .", "summary": "abstract: for instance , the final combination of features used in the current study may form a representation of the ontology , general enough to employ in any task that includes trajectors and paths ."}
{"dialogue": "s so if you just number them `` one `` , `` two `` , `` three `` it 's and uh my suggestion is of course wewe keep the wizard , because i think she did a wonderful job ,", "summary": "decisions: although the data collection test went well and it was decided to hire the `` wizard '' , there are minor amendments in the procedure to be carried out ( shortenting the preparatory reading , numbering tasks etc ) ."}
{"dialogue": "my idea on that wasuh , partly we 'll talk about system stuff for the computer scientists , but partly i did want it to get the linguists involved in some of this issue about what the task is and allum you know , what the dialogue is , and what 's going on linguistically , you just uh do `` this is what we did , and here 's thething , and here 's s some of the dialogue andand so forth . ``", "summary": "decisions: a presentation of the data collection design should be included in the forthcoming meeting with other research groups , along with some account of the system design and the use of belief-nets ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "decisions: the structure of the latter was a major issue during the meeting ."}
{"dialogue": "so the belief - net takes as input , a vector , and then we want to look up some more stuff in the ontology but also we definitely want to look up in the dialogue history um some s some stuff . there will be rules , but they are n't rules that come to final decisions , they 're rules that gather information for a decision process . my guess is it 'll be the same basic agent that um can go off and get information , run it through aa c this belief - net that", "summary": "decisions: their input vector is to be provided by information extracted from the various modules of the system , such as the ontology and discourse history , using standard rule-based methods ."}
{"dialogue": "and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones , then you would have to supply the parameters . and that may actually involve getting more information .", "summary": "decisions: the output action essentially provides additional semantic parameters for the x-schema , and , in turn , may trigger the collection of more features from the data ."}
{"dialogue": "i think weii can come up with aa code for a module that we call the `` cognitive dispatcher `` , which does nothing , but it looks of complect object trees and decides howare there parts missing that need to be filled out , and then collect uh sub - objects and then recombine them and put them together .", "summary": "decisions: the feature extraction could be carried out by a software tool checking object ( feature ) trees and filling them with appropriate values ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "decisions: for this concept to be put to work , further refinement of the belief-net variables is necessary , with particular attention on the combinatorics involved ."}
{"dialogue": "five minutes is just too long . s so if you just number them `` one `` , `` two `` , `` three `` it 's", "summary": "problems: after the trial run of the experiment , some minor issues , like the length of the preliminary reading and the need to order the tasks given to the subjects , were highlighted ."}
{"dialogue": "she also agrees that you know if it 's all just gon na be students the data is gon na be less valuable because of that", "summary": "problems: it is also possible that the pool of subjects ends up comprising almost entirely of students ; more variation in the sample is needed ."}
{"dialogue": "is , if we just do this , we could wind up with a huge uh , combinatoric input to the mode thing . uh , we have a d a technical problem with the belief - nets that wewe do n't want all the com too many factors if weif we allow them to just go combinatorially .", "summary": "problems: from a system design perspective , the progress so far has shown that the combinatorics of the bayes-net even for a simple task , like the choice of vista / enter / tango mode , could render it unmanageable ."}
{"dialogue": "so , what i did for thisthis isuh , a pedagogical belief - net well , this is not a working bayes - net .", "summary": "problems: the belief-net presented in the meeting is not a working bayes-net ."}
{"dialogue": "i mean , not necessarily in th in this meeting , but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are . so the immediate problem is just deciding w which aspects of the x - schema to add .", "summary": "problems: consequently , it is as yet unclear what the decision nodes in the net are , and what values these can take ."}
{"dialogue": "the harder problem is we decide what we want to use , how are we gon na get it ?", "summary": "problems: even if those were decided , how to extract the necessary information from the data , would still be an open issue ."}
{"dialogue": "and i do n't yet see how that goes .", "summary": "problems: looking at the bigger picture , the current task is yet to provide insights into more general ways to achieve linguistic deep understanding ."}
{"dialogue": "and uh see if we can find a way to present this to this linguists group thatthat is helpful to them .", "summary": "problems: with these intricacies in mind , it is not easy to put together a presentation of the project cohesive and attractive enough for the other research groups in the institute ."}
