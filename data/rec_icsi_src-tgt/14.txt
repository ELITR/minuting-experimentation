{"dialogue": "then i 'm also going to present a little talk at eml , about what we have done here then i 'm going to talk about the data ,", "summary": "abstract: the latter will present the work that is currently being done at icsi including examples of inference of user intentions and of the recordings of the on-going data collection ."}
{"dialogue": "e tell a little bitas much as ican about the ntl story . and then maybe talk about the big picture here , so x - schemas , then , i would like to do and then at the end about our bayes - net .", "summary": "abstract: the talk will also outline the theoretical ( x-schemas , image schemas , bayes-nets ) and neural background ."}
{"dialogue": "it basically says , well `` this is construal `` , and then it continues to say that one could potentially build a probabilistic relational model that has some general , domain - general rules and then the idea is to use ontology , situation , user , and discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational modelto do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what", "summary": "abstract: the thesis proposal , on the other hand , presents the idea of `` construal '' and makes claims as to how inferences are drawn in a probabilistic relational model by using information from the ontology , situation , user and discourse models ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "abstract: it was advised that more emphasis should be put on the role of construal in the understanding of metaphor and metonymy ."}
{"dialogue": "and to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal . but cover only base cases . but there are basic cases . w well we have , for example , a canonical use of something and y it 's , you know , we have some constructions and then it 's construed as something , and then wewe may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use that 's also relevant to theto the domain .", "summary": "abstract: base constructions deal with the norm , while further general domain mechanisms determine how the constructions are invoked depending on the context ."}
{"dialogue": "but `` walked into the cafe and ordered a drink , `` and `` walked into the cafe and broke his nose , `` but `` run into `` does . so `` in the bus `` and `` on the bus , `` we hadwe hadinitially we 'dstarted discussing the `` out of film . `` where is the castle ? i mean maybe the `` where is something `` question as a whole , you know , can be construed as , u i locational versus instructional request .", "summary": "abstract: several potential examples of polysemy were discussed in detail: `` walk / run into '' , `` on the bus '' , `` out of film '' , `` where is x ? `` ."}
{"dialogue": "but i think the argument should beuh , can be made that , you know , despite the fact that this is not the most met metaphorical domain ,", "summary": "abstract: however , none of them was an example of lexical polysemy resolved by construal straightforward enough to include in the proposal ; the tourist domain is not metaphor rich ."}
{"dialogue": "e tell a little bitas much as ican about the ntl story . and then maybe talk about the big picture here , oh , maybe the fmri stuff . well , the time to mention it , if you mention it , is when you talk about mirror neurons ,", "summary": "decisions: as the talk at eml will also refer to a theoretical framework , it was suggested that along with presenting ntl and the piece on mirror neurons , it also alludes to relevant fmri work ."}
{"dialogue": "the b the combination of the biology and the leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys ,", "summary": "decisions: the neural side of the research could be of interest to various groups ."}
{"dialogue": "therethetherewe 've got various i generations of slides that show language analysis , and matching to the underlying image schemas ,", "summary": "decisions: the language analysis itself will be introduced in terms of image schemas ."}
{"dialogue": "ok . so why do n't we plan to give you feedback electronically .", "summary": "decisions: on the other hand , it was arranged for more feedback on the thesis proposal to be sent by email ."}
{"dialogue": "current formalism thing that you presented .", "summary": "decisions: the latest version of the construction formalism will also be needed to complete the presentation ."}
{"dialogue": "i i it looks like the , uh , metaphor did n't get in yet . but cover only base cases . and to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal . w well we have , for example , a canonical use of something and y it 's , you know , we have some constructions and then it 's construed as something , and then wewe may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use that 's also relevant to theto the domain .", "summary": "problems: it was noted that the thesis proposal did not put any emphasis on metaphor or on the scalability achieved by combining constructions with general construal mechanisms: constructions cover base cases , while metaphoric and metonymic cases are resolved with the extra help provided by construal ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "problems: during this discussion , however , the suggested examples of polysemy , which is tackled by the proposed framework , were not straightforward enough ."}
{"dialogue": "but i think the argument should beuh , can be made that , you know , despite the fact that this is not the most met metaphorical domain ,", "summary": "problems: it was agreed that metaphors are not abundant in the spatial domain ."}
{"dialogue": "so `` in the bus `` and `` on the bus , `` we hadwe hadinitially we 'dstarted discussing the `` out of film . `` ok . can we think of a nice metaphorical use of `` where `` in the tourist 's domain ? a fixed expression , yeah .", "summary": "problems: some of the candidates discussed were phrases like `` on the bus '' , `` out of film '' , non-spatial uses of `` where '' or other fixed expressions ."}
