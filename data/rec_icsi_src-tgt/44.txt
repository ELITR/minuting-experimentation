{"dialogue": "when you say `` we have that `` , does sunil have it now , too , no . because we 're still testing . so we 'll perhaps <breath> <mouth> <breath> try to convince ogi people to use the new <breath> the new filters uh , hashas anything happened yet on this business of having some sort of standard , uh , source , not yet but i wi i will <breath> call them now they arei think they have more time well , eurospeech deadline is <breath> over", "summary": "decisions: mn007 is going to try and convince ogi to use his new filters , and enquire as to the setting of a standard for the system ."}

{"dialogue": "do you know who waswho wassince we were n't in on it , uh , do you know who was in from ogi ? but <breath> the points that they were supposed to discuss is still , <mouth> uh , things like <breath> the weights , i have no idea . so the points were thethe weightshow to weight the different error rates <breath> that are obtained from different language andand conditions . it 's not clear that they will keep the same kind of weighting . some people are arguing that it would be better to have weights on well , toto combine error ratesbefore computing improvement . and so , perhaps they will change the weights to well , i mean , the fact that it 's inconsistent is an obvious mistake . but the question is , do you average the relative improvementsor do you average the error rates and take the relative improvement maybe of that ? and the thing is it 's not just a pure average because there are these weightings . it 's just when youwhen you get all done , i think that they pro but i think they started off this process with the notion that <breath> you should besignificantly better than the previous standard . so they said `` how much is significantly better ? andand so they said `` well , <breath> you know , you should have half the errors , `` or something , `` that you had before `` . but it does seem like i i it does seem like it 's more logical to combine them first but there is thisthisis this still this problem of weights . whenwhen you combine error rate it tends togive more importance to the difficult cases , some people think that <breath> it 's more important to look at <breath> to have ten percent imp relative improvement onwell - matched case than to have fifty percent on the m mismatched , and other people think that it 's more important to improve a lot on the mismatch it sounds like they do n't really have a good idea about what the final application is gon na be . i mean , they don theythey don'tthey do n't reallyknow , i think . so the argument for that being thethethe more important thing , <breath> is that you 're gon na try and do that , <breath> but you wan na see how badly it deviates from that whenwhenwhen the , uhit 's a little different . the opposite argument is you 're never really gon na have a good sample of all these different things . i gather that in these meetings it 'sit 's really tricky to make anything <breath> ac <breath> make anypolicy change because <breath> < clears throat > everybody hashas , uh , their own opinion but there is probably aa big change that will <breath> be made is that thethe baselineth they want to have a new baseline , perhaps , and apparently , <mouth> uh , some people are pushing to still keep this fifty percent number . so they want <breath> to have at least fifty percent improvement on the baseline , so whose vad uh , they did n't decide yet .", "summary": "problems: not only are the group unsure what if anything was decided , but project changes are being considered including changing the baseline and improvement weighting , though everyone has their own opinion on these matters ."}
