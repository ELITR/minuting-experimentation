{"dialogue": "um right now it 's still kind ofin a toyversion of it ,", "summary": "abstract: the group discussed the first version of the bayes-net used to work out a user 's intentions when asking for directions from a navigation device ."}
{"dialogue": "the probabilitywhether the probability of a vista , tango , or enter .", "summary": "abstract: three intentions were identified: vista ( to view ) , enter ( to visit ) and tango ( to approach ) ."}
{"dialogue": "so then the features we decidedor we decided we weretalked about , you know . we had a list of things like `` to go `` and `` to visit `` and what not . uh thethe prosody , the discourse , verb choice . so there are certain cues that are very strongeither lexical or topic - based um , concept cues and some of them are sort of <breath> either world knowledge or situationalthings . is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee ,", "summary": "abstract: the structure of the belief-net comprises , firstly , a feature layer , which includes linguistic , discourse and world knowledge information that can be gleaned from the data ."}
{"dialogue": "so maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net , which has twohas it 's own middle layer . they ra may have there own hidden layerthat points to some ofthethe real hidden layer , um or the general hidden layer .", "summary": "abstract: it is possible for these variables to form thematic clusters ( eg `` entrance '' , `` type of object '' , `` verb '' ) , each one with a separate middle layer ."}
{"dialogue": "but the middle thing , we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out , like , the concept of whether they 're a touristorwhether they 're running an errand or something like that so then the hidden variableshair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry , but the other ones , the final destination , the whether they 're doing business , whether they 're in a hurry , and whether they 're tourists , they ra may have there own hidden layerthat points to some ofthethe real hidden layer , um or the general hidden layer . and then these should then connect somehow to the more plan - based deep space", "summary": "abstract: these feed , in turn , into the main middle layer , that defines more general hidden variables , such as the tourist / business status of the user ."}
{"dialogue": "so there are certain cues that are very strongeither lexical or topic - based um , concept cues so <breath> maybe whatwhatwhat happenedwhat might happen is that we do get this sort of task - based middle layer , entering or som you know like they might be more task - based .", "summary": "abstract: the feature layer can end up being cue-based , while the middle layers task-based ."}
{"dialogue": "so . the modebasically has three differentoutputs .", "summary": "abstract: the latter determine the final probability of each intention in the output layer ."}
{"dialogue": "it 's cra has a gui and it 's uh but uhit 's free . but actually it had an interface . and he 's updated it for an xml version of i guess bayes - nets .", "summary": "abstract: this first model of the belief-net was built in javabayes , since it is a free package , has a graphical interface , and it can take xml files as input ."}
{"dialogue": "like , we totally hand - tuned the probabilities , the probabilities and all are completely ad - hoc .", "summary": "abstract: at this stage , all the actual probabilities are ad-hoc and hand-coded ."}
{"dialogue": "but umin terms of specifying the scenario , <breath> umuhuhwe 've gotten a little further so we wanted just to collect data , to getthatthatthatelicits more , uh , that elicits richer language .", "summary": "abstract: however , there has been progress in the design and organisation of experiments , that will eventually provide data more useful and appropriate for this task ."}
{"dialogue": "so then our next idea was to add a middle layer , uhwe kept umthings from directly affecting the modebeyond the concept , but we just decided to keep all the things we extractedto point at the middle and thendown . i guess , the fact that thethere 's a complete separation between theobserved features and in the output .", "summary": "decisions: it is necessary for the belief-net to have at least one layer of nodes between the features and the final output ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "decisions: this makes the structure more flexible in terms of coding feature-layer probabilities ."}
{"dialogue": "is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee , so maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net , which has twohas it 's own middle layer . that would all f funnel into one node that wouldconstitute entrance requirements or something like that . they ra may have there own hidden layerthat points to some ofthethe real hidden layer , um or the general hidden layer .", "summary": "decisions: another technique to systematise the work is the thematic clustering of the features , each cluster forming a bayes-net of each own: for example features like `` admission fee '' and `` opening hours '' can feed into an intermediate `` entrance '' node connecting to the main middle layer ."}
{"dialogue": "so , um i suggest w toforto proceed with this inin the sense thatmaybe throughout this week the three of us willwill talk some more about maybe segmenting off different regions , identifyfour regions , maybe make up some features for each region", "summary": "decisions: the next stage is to refine the set of feature nodes and identify possible clusters ."}
{"dialogue": "so one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in theuse of `` admission fee discussion `` as a cue for entry , <breath> is thinking about the plans that various people might have . they 'reinin non in sort of more traditional ai kinds of plan recognition things you sort of have <breath> you know , some idea at each turn of agent doing something , i mean there are somesome of them are extremely elaborate ,", "summary": "decisions: although , in theory , traditional ai plan recognition techniques could also be helpful for inferring intentions , the schemas involved are too elaborate for this task ."}
{"dialogue": "yeah , another thing to do , um , is also to , umi guess to ask around people about other bayes - net packages .", "summary": "decisions: further work also includes discussing the possible advantages of bayes-net packages , other than javabayes , with experts at icsi ."}
{"dialogue": "we can maybe write an interface th for uh entering probability distributions easily , something likelike a little script . i think it mightit might be simpler to justhave a script that , you know", "summary": "decisions: if they continue using javabayes , a script to help with the inputting of probabilities in the nodes is needed , as the in-built method is cumbersome ."}
{"dialogue": "like we wannawe wan na be able to collect <breath> as much of the variables that are needed for that , so now i think we should maybe have at least one navigational task withwith sort of explicituh", "summary": "decisions: finally , it was decided that at least some of the experiments designed for the new data collection initiative will factor in the intentions studied in the current task ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "problems: the set of cues that form the feature nodes is not well-defined yet ."}
{"dialogue": "that 'sthatthat needs a lot of work .", "summary": "problems: especially with lexical cues ( verbs , modifiers etc ) , no one offered specific intuitions as to how they might contribute to the inference of intentions ."}
{"dialogue": "because we did n't know the probabilities ofor so that 's like a huge uh clue that they 're trying to enter the place rather than uh to tango or vista , like , we totally hand - tuned the probabilities , the probabilities and all are completely ad - hoc .", "summary": "problems: other features , like `` admission fee '' , may be intuitively linked with one of the outputs ( enter ) , however , any probabilities are coded in an ad-hoc fashion and are by no means realistic ."}
{"dialogue": "but you could see perhaps discus the `` admission fee `` going directly to the mode pointing at `` enter `` , well for instance , the `` discourse admission fee `` node seems like it should point directly to the or increase the probability of `` enterdirectly `` versus `` going there via tourist `` .", "summary": "problems: cases like this , where feature and output seem to be linked directly , bring the necessity of a middle layer in the belief-net to question ."}
{"dialogue": "reasons being , you know , it 'd be a pain to set up all the probabilities for that . if we moved onto the next step and did learning of some sort , uh according bhaskara we 'd be handicapped .", "summary": "problems: nevertheless , not having a middle layer would not allow for shifts in the discourse and would make the setting of probabilities and manipulation of the belief-net clumsy ."}
{"dialogue": "it might be that if you add a new thing pointing to a variable , you just likeit just overwrites everything . butthey 're not very friendly .", "summary": "problems: some issues with the use of javabayes also arose: the addition of new variables in an existing node overwrites all previous settings , and the native text file where the probability tables are set is not easy to read ; this makes adding and changing variables and nodes problematic ."}
{"dialogue": "i did n't think it did learning .", "summary": "problems: finally , it is unclear how much learning can be done on the created nets ."}
