{"dialogue": "n no , to just get the dem get the demos they need . so th the demo the demo requirements for this fall are sort of taken care of as of later this week or something .", "summary": "abstract: this is the first of two working demos required for the project ."}
{"dialogue": "but , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out .", "summary": "abstract: further than that , there are no restrictions on the focus of the research or its possible applications ."}
{"dialogue": "and so these issues about uh , reference , andspatialreference , discourse reference , uh - uh - uh - uhall this sort of stuff , uh , deixis which is part of what you were talking about , so we got ta do all this .", "summary": "abstract: for example , issues like spatial descriptions could be investigated ."}
{"dialogue": "on this scale , you have it either be ego or allocentric . so in addition to e ego and allocentric uh which appear all over the place , you also apparently have this proximal - distal thing which is very deeply uh embedded .", "summary": "abstract: the variety of linguistic conventions seem to develop around an ego / allo-centric and a proximal / distal paradigm ."}
{"dialogue": "by the way , theresomething that i did n't know until about a week ago or so , is apparently , there are separate brain areas for things within reach , and things that are out of reach .", "summary": "abstract: the latter is also reflected in neuro-physiological data ."}
{"dialogue": "so , i think as far as this group goes , um , it 's certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts .", "summary": "abstract: from an engineering perspective , the belief-net for the ave task should be completed within a few weeks ."}
{"dialogue": "and we went through this , and , i think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there .", "summary": "abstract: the majority of the nodes are already there ."}
{"dialogue": "ok ? what allyou know , what are the considerations and how and what are the ways in which they relate .", "summary": "abstract: this leaves the dependencies between them and the rules of computation to be set ."}
{"dialogue": "so `` ok , we 're not using their system . that means we need our system . `` but to do that we 're gon na need to make some decisions like ontology , i does uh either the uh smartkom project or one of the projects at eml have something that we can just p pull out , for that .", "summary": "abstract: since the whole system is going to be re-designed , there are major decisions to be taken regarding the parser and the ontology , as well as what can be re-used from past eml projects ."}
{"dialogue": "so the idea is there 's this uh , other subgroup that 's worrying about formalizing the nota getting a notation .", "summary": "abstract: in parallel , another team is working on formalisation and notation ."}
{"dialogue": "oh there 's yet another one of the incoming firstincoming first - year graduate students who 's expressed interest , and actually i talked today to a uh undergraduate who wants to do an honors thesis on this . and , while we 're at this level , uh , there 's at least one new doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project , either next week or the first of august , depending on the blandishments of microsoft .", "summary": "abstract: finally , more ideas are expected to come from students and their research ."}

{"dialogue": "so i 'd like to , for the summer turn into science mode . but , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out . uh . i mean there are a lot of issues , what 's the ontology look like , you know what do the constructions look like , what 's the execution engine look like ,", "summary": "decisions: after the demo , the focus of research can switch towards purely scientific goals , including issues on ontology , deep semantic constructions , execution engines etc ."}
{"dialogue": "so `` ok , we 're not using their system . that means we need our system . `` and so , uh , in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right , and the formalism and stuff , we 're actually gon na build something", "summary": "decisions: moreover , a new system will be designed for the project and at least some parts of it should be built ."}
{"dialogue": "cuz we 'rewe 're not only goingthe plan is not only to lay out this thing , but to actually uh build some of it . it looks like we 're now in a position that the construction analyzer that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyzer that nancy needs for the child language modeling .", "summary": "decisions: similarly , the construction analyser should be a single , general tool working for both the tourist domain and child language modelling ."}
{"dialogue": "and one of the things we need to do is the um , and this i think is relatively tighttightly constrained , is to finish up this belief - net stuff . so , i think as far as this group goes , um , it 's certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts .", "summary": "decisions: the focus for the next meeting will be on the belief-net , of which a working demo should be complete in the next few weeks ."}
{"dialogue": "so uh what we 're gon na do initially isis do design , and , i if you will , guess . but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise i think we 'll just design it .", "summary": "decisions: since there are not enough data , its connections and weights will have to be designed ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "decisions: although javabayes has been the tool of choice until now , the possibility that hugin could be a better option should be investigated ."}
{"dialogue": "and um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal `` group - ware `` server at eml , so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing andand generating and constructions w wewe sort of uh put it in there and they put what they do in there and maybe we can even um , get some overlap , get some synergy out of that .", "summary": "decisions: in order to promote the collaboration with eml , the group-ware server there will be updated with all progress being made in the two sites ."}
{"dialogue": "and so anyway we c uhwe can m undoubtedly get ami uh to give a talk at uh eml or something like that . while he 's inin uh a lot of interest . actually , either place , dfki or uh", "summary": "decisions: a talk on some of the issues will also be organised to take place at dfki ."}
{"dialogue": "e the versionthat is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work .", "summary": "problems: the german smartkom version available on the server does not work ."}
{"dialogue": "right now it 's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes onononon seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything . because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition running with this s siemens virtual touch screen , which we do n't have here . but it 's working now , and i g i got the feeling that we arethe only ones right now who have a running system . um . <outbreath> well it was just amazing toto see uh howhow instable the whole thing is ,", "summary": "problems: the english version , although still under development , does work , however , the system is still unstable as -apart from other reasons- it was initially built to work with a touch screen ."}

{"dialogue": "so uh what we 're gon na do initially isis do design , and , i if you will , guess . but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise i think we 'll just design it .", "summary": "problems: these will have to be guessed instead of learnt through data , as not enough data is available for such a task ."}
{"dialogue": "javabayes does not support that . ii also s would suggest not to d spend two weeks ininin changing thethe javabayes code .", "summary": "problems: finally , it has been noted that the javabayes gui does not satisfy all the presentation requirements for this belief-net and modifying the underlying code would be too time-consuming ."}
