{"dialogue": "i have a short thing about digits and then uh i wan na talk a little bit about naming conventions , so the only thing i wan na say about digits is , we are pretty much done with the first test set . uh , the last one wasthat you had there , was about naming ? we want some way of specifying , more than looking in the `` key `` file , what channel and what mike . what channel , what mike , and what broadcaster .", "summary": "abstract: topics discussed by the berkeley meeting recorder group included the status of the first test set of digits data , naming conventions for files , speaker identification tags , and encoding files with details about the recording ."}
{"dialogue": "uh , right , soso ii was just gon na talk briefly about the nsf itr . ok , so uh e l i guess , let me , uh , get mymy short thing out about the nsf . so this was , uh , a , uh , proposal that we put in so is i forit was a <mouth> proposal for the itr program , um , < clears throat > since we have such a short agenda list i guess i wi i will ask howhow are the transcriptions going ? andand i 'm tried toto , uh , adjust thetoto improve , eh , an harmonicity , eh , detector that , eh , ii implement . eh , and now i 'mi 'mi 'm trying toto find , eh , some kind of a , um <breath> of h of help , eh , using the energy toto distinguish between possible harmonics , andand other fre frequency peaks , that , eh , corres not harmonics . you 're trying distinguish between the case where there is , uhwherewhere there are more thanuh , where there 's more than one speaker and the case where there 's only one speaker .", "summary": "abstract: the group also discussed a proposal for a grant from the nsf 's itr ( information technology research ) program , transcriptions , and efforts by speaker mn005 to detect speaker overlap using harmonicity-related features ."}
{"dialogue": "that there 's one third thing i wanted toto ex raise as a to as an issue which is , um , how to handle breaths .", "summary": "abstract: particular focus was paid to questions about transcription procedures , i.e . how to deal with overlooked backchannels , and audible breaths ."}
{"dialogue": "seems like we should just change the transcripts", "summary": "decisions: a small percentage of transcripts will be changed to reflect mis-read , uncorrected digits ."}
{"dialogue": "that also brings up the point that we have to start assembling a speaker database so that we get those links back and forth and keep it consistent .", "summary": "decisions: a speaker database will be compiled to establish consistent links between speakers and their corresponding identification tags ."}
{"dialogue": "well so thenthen , maybe the answer is to , uh , listen especially densely in places of overlap ,", "summary": "decisions: sections of densely overlapping speech will require hand-checking so that overlooked backchannels may be manually segmented and labelled ."}
{"dialogue": "so i would say do n't tell them to transcribe anything that 's outside of a grouping of words .", "summary": "decisions: the transcribers should only code audible breaths within a grouping of words , and not outside regions of continuous speech ."}
{"dialogue": "i do n't knowthink it 'd be ideal . and breaths are part of real speech .", "summary": "decisions: it was further determined that audible breaths are an important facet of recorded speech , and that removing them from the corpus would be contrary to the aims of the project ."}
{"dialogue": "i will prepare for the next week eh , all my results about the harmonicity", "summary": "decisions: speaker mn005 will prepare his results for detecting speaker overlap and present them in the next meeting ."}
{"dialogue": "but , um , the other problem we were thinking about is if you just put the numerals , they might say forty - three instead of four three .", "summary": "problems: during digits readings , subjects tend to chunk numbers together rather than reading each number separately ."}
{"dialogue": "but , um , with the mixed , when you have an overlap , you only have aa choice of one start and end time for that entire overlap ,", "summary": "problems: when working from the mixed channel , transcribers may select only one start and end time for overlapping speech , resulting in points of overlap that are less tightly tuned ."}
{"dialogue": "once in a while a backchannel will be overlooked by the transcriber .", "summary": "problems: transcribers are likely to overlook backchannels in densely populated sections of speaker overlap ."}
{"dialogue": "yeah , but those backchannels will always be a problem i think . uh especially if they 're really short and they 're not very loud and so itit canitit will always happen that also the automatic s detection system will miss some of them ,", "summary": "problems: speaker mn014 reported that this is also problematic for the automatic detection of speech and non-speech , as backchannels that are very short and not loud enough will inevitably be overlooked ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "problems: speaker mn005 reported problems distinguishing between possible harmonics and other frequency peaks , and creating an algorithm for obtaining the instantaneous frequency ."}
{"dialogue": "um , aside from the fact that they 're obviously very time - consuming to encode ,", "summary": "problems: the encoding of all audible breaths is too time-consuming ."}
