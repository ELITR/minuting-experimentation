{"dialogue": "ok well , the , w uh as you can see from the numbers on the digits we 're almost done . and so , once we 'reit 's done it would be very nice to train up a recognizer and actually start working with this data .", "summary": "abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group discussed the collection status for a set of connected digits recordings that are nearly complete and ready to be trained on a recognizer ."}
{"dialogue": "yeah just by way of uh , uh , a uh , order of magnitude , uh , um , we 've been working with this aurora , uh data set . and , uh , the best score , on the , nicest part of the data , that is , where you 've got training and test set that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth , uh , is about , i think the best score was something like five percent , uh , error , per digit .", "summary": "abstract: anticipated results were discussed in reference to results obtained for other digits corpora , i.e . aurora and ti-digits ."}
{"dialogue": "one question i have thatthat i mean , we would n't know the answer to now but might , do some guessing , but i was talking before about doing some model modeling of arti uh , uh , marking of articulatory , features , with overlap and so on . one thought might be to do this uh , onon the digits , or some piece of the digits . so , i mean another way to look at this is to , is to , uh , do some stuff on switchboard which has all this other , stuff to it . and then , um , as we get , further down the road and we can do more things ahead of time , we can , do some of the same things to the meeting data .", "summary": "abstract: the group also considered the prospect of performing fine-grained acoustic-phonetic analyses on a subset of meeting recorder digits or switchboard data ."}
{"dialogue": "uh , oh yeah , um , <breath> i worked a little bit on theon the presegmentation toto get another version which does channel - specific , uh , speech - nonspeech detection .", "summary": "abstract: pre-segmentation manipulations that allow for the segmentation of channel-specific speech / non-speech portions of the signal and the distinction of foreground versus background speech were discussed ."}
{"dialogue": "also we discussed some adaptational things , uhyou know i had n't , uh , incorporated , a convention explicitly to handle acronyms , for example , and then , a similar conv uh , convention for numbers . so if they hear a breath and they do n't know who breath it is it 's better to put it in that channel than to put it in the speaker 's channel", "summary": "abstract: finally , speaker fe008 and fe016 reported on new efforts to adapt transcriptions to the needs of the sri recognizer , including conventions for encoding acronyms , numbers , ambient noise , and unidentified inbreaths ."}
{"dialogue": "and so thethe question is , should we have the transcribers do that or should we just do it ? and i think it 's ait 's a fine idea partly because , um , it 's not un unrelated to their present skill set , and then , hand off to jane , and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits .", "summary": "decisions: the group decided to delegate the extraction of digits to the transcriber pool ."}
{"dialogue": "well , you know , umi mean if we 're talking about , having the , annotators annotate these kinds of features , it seems like , so i mean i we 'll see wha how much we can , uh , get the people to do , and how much money we 'll have and all this sort of thing , so , i mean another way to look at this is to , is to , uh , do some stuff on switchboard which has all this other , stuff to it .", "summary": "decisions: a tentative decision was also made to delegate transcribers with the task of labelling a subset of digits or switchboard data for fine-grained acoustic-phonetic features ."}
{"dialogue": "it seems to me that it would be good to have , a few minutes fromfrom different meetings , so , as a first pass through , a first chance without having to do a lot of hand - editing , what we 're gon na do , is , i 'll run it through channelize , give them those data after i 've done the editing process and be sure it 's clean . and then we 'll see if the units that we 're getting , uh , with theat that level , are sufficient .", "summary": "decisions: speaker fe008 will run selected meeting recorder data through channelize and determine whether the resulting units are of a sufficient length ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "problems: with respect to encoding more fine-grained acoustic information in transcriptions , the question was posed: which features should be marked ?"}
{"dialogue": "there are some problems with the lapel mike . but , there are somesomeas i said some problems with the lapel mike ,", "summary": "problems: speaker mn014 reported problems pre-segmenting speech recorded via the lapel microphones ."}
{"dialogue": "then , the , yeah , there arethere are some problems withwithwith n with normalization , and , then , uh , there the system does n't work at all .", "summary": "problems: normalization of the energy measured across and within channels is problematic when performed for speakers who say little or nothing during meetings ."}
{"dialogue": "and , the thing is ii , then the evaluation ofof the system is a little bit hard , as i do n't have any references .", "summary": "problems: the evaluation of pre-segmented data is difficult without tightly transcribed time references to the individual channels from which the speech was derived ."}
{"dialogue": "it drifted into the afternoon , <inbreath> uh , concerning this issue of , um , the , well there 's basically the issue of the interplay between the transcript format and the processing that , they need to do for , the sri recognizer . and , um , < mike noise > their recognizer would prefer that the units not be overly long .", "summary": "problems: the sri recognizer requires that multi-channel format units not be too large , indicating that some additional pre-processing of unit lengths may be necessary ."}
