{"dialogue": "uh one of them is to work on the semantics of the belief - net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi the system uh making decisions . and we 're also , sort of uh in the same process , going to work with fey on what there should be in the dialogues .", "summary": "abstract: the main focus of the meeting was firstly on the structure of the belief-net , its decision nodes and the parameters that influence them , and secondly , on the design of the data collection tasks ."}
{"dialogue": "and umand fey has some thirty subjects lined up ? so weyeah we do n't know how many we can get next door at theuh shelter for example .", "summary": "abstract: for the latter , there are already 30 subjects lined up and more are expected to be recruited off campus ."}
{"dialogue": "and umand then they gon na have to f um um choose from one of these tasks , which are listed here . so ifif it 's one service , one luxury item , you know , one big - ish place , and so forth and so on , umthen my guess is thatthat the data is going to be easier to handle . that w maybe one thing we should do is go through this list and sort of select things that are categories and then o offer only one member of that category ?", "summary": "abstract: it was agreed that making subjects select from categories of tasks , such as `` big place '' , `` service '' , etc . could provide a better range of data ."}
{"dialogue": "i b my guess is it 's gon na be ten .", "summary": "abstract: the duration of each dialogue will probably be no more than 10 minutes ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "abstract: on the other hand , the organisation of the intermediate nodes of the belief-net and their properties is almost complete , although no conditional probabilities have been inserted yet ."}
{"dialogue": "and decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices for calls on other modules .", "summary": "abstract: these nodes represent decisions that will function as parameters to action calls in the system ."}
{"dialogue": "and that we can actually infer them to a significant de degree , or we ask . oreh so , y but there 's th but definitely a back - off position to asking .", "summary": "abstract: their values will either be inferred from the user-system interaction , or -as a last resort- requested directly from the user ."}
{"dialogue": "ok , because uhwe do wan na get them r u perfectlybut i think we 're gon na have to do a first cut at a lot of them to see how they interact .", "summary": "abstract: finally , as to the semantic and syntactic constructions , work will start with more general and brief descriptions , before moving to exhaustive analysis of at least a subset ."}
{"dialogue": "we are expecting johno to build a parser , uhhe 's g he 's hoping to do this for his masters ' thesis s by a year from now . uhlimited . well , the hope is that the parser itself is , uh , pretty robust .", "summary": "abstract: similarly , the construction parser that is to be built within a year is expected to be relatively basic , yet robust ."}
{"dialogue": "maybei suggest we make some fine tuning of these , getsort ofrun through ten or so subjects um but anywayyeah , so i thinkit 's a good idea to start with the sort of relatively straight forward res just response system .", "summary": "decisions: as the data collection is ready to start , it was agreed that for the first ten subjects the interaction with the system / instructor will be along the lines of a basic response system ."}
{"dialogue": "and umand then they gon na have to f um um choose from one of these tasks , which are listed here . that w maybe one thing we should do is go through this list and sort of select things that are categories and then o offer only one member of that category ? like at you know , `` attend a theater , symphony or opera `` isis a group , and `` tour the university , castle or zoo `` ,", "summary": "decisions: tasks will be divided in categories ( `` tour '' , `` attend '' etc ) and subjects are going to be asked to choose no more than one task out of each category ."}
{"dialogue": "sotrying to im umimplant the intention of going to a place now , going to a place later on the same tour , and see whether we wan na make it more complex or not , depending on whatwhat sort of results we 're getting . umii would say maybe two weeks . let 's plan next monday , ok , to have a review of what we have so far . this means audio , but but it would be great if you could , um , not transcribe it all , but pick out uh , some stuff . and then if we want to uhget them to start doinguhmultiple step planning with a whole bunch of things and then organize them tell them which things are near each other and we 're gon na start thinking a aboutuhwhat constructions we want to elicit .", "summary": "decisions: this first run will probably take a couple of weeks , but the first results ( audio files and selected highlights ) will be discussed shortly , in order to decide whether more detail ( complex spatial relationships , temporal planning etc ) should be included in the design or particular constructions be elicited ."}
{"dialogue": "see thisthisthisuhontology node is probably something that i will try to expand . and hopefully you can sort of also try to find out , you know , sooner or later in the course of the summer what we can expect to get from the discourse that might , you knowor the", "summary": "decisions: regarding the completion of the belief-net , the remaining details , mainly the properties of the ontology and discourse nodes , should be added ."}
{"dialogue": "uh robert and eva and bhaskara are gon na actuallybuild a belief - net thatthat , um , has cpt 's and , you know , tries to infer this from various kinds of information .", "summary": "decisions: after building in the conditional probability tables , a working prototype of the net will be ready ."}
{"dialogue": "ok , because uhwe do wan na get them r u perfectlybut i think we 're gon na have to do a first cut at a lot of them to see how they interact .", "summary": "decisions: finally , the initial work on constructions should focus on a general overview of the dialogues with brief descriptions ."}
{"dialogue": "whatever you need in order to uh , be able to then , uh , by hand , you know , explain , some fraction of the utterances .", "summary": "decisions: further analysis will follow from there in a top-down fashion ."}
{"dialogue": "so there 's a lot of things where we have no analogous tasks , andthat may or may not be a problem .", "summary": "problems: although there is an effort to include some of the key features of the belief-net in the design of the data gathering , not all of them can be built in ."}
{"dialogue": "and these are the data tasks where w we can assume the person would like to enter , view or just approach the thing . now of course you have this i guess possible danger that somehow there 're certain constructions that people use uh when talking about a museum that they would n't talk about with a university and stuff ,", "summary": "problems: the tasks that the subjects will have to carry out will be categorised in ways that will indicate eva intentions , however , this approach may limit the variety of possible constructions used within a single category of entities ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "problems: on the other hand , generating more diverse dialogues may have an adverse effect from a speech recognition perspective ."}
{"dialogue": "and um we 're still l looking for a room on the sixth floor because they stole away that conference room . umbehind our backs . david andand jane andand lila are working on that as we speak .", "summary": "problems: a minor problem has arisen with the laboratory where recordings are supposed to take place , but this is currently being sorted out ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "problems: as regards the completion of the belief-net , no work has been done on the cpt 's yet ."}
{"dialogue": "and ii me it would it would be completely out of the question to really do more than , say , like , oh i do n't know , ten , over the summer ,", "summary": "problems: finally , it was noted that although a general overview of the pertinent constructions is attainable , no more than ten of them can be analysed in detail with the summer months ."}
