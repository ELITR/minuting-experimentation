{"dialogue": "but um uh jose and i were just talking about <inbreath> the uh < page turn > uh , speech e energy thing , he washehe was taking everything over two hundred milliseconds and so i i hishishe 's making the constraint it has to be at least two hundred milliseconds .", "summary": "abstract: the berkely meeting recorder group discussed efforts by speaker mn005 to measure energy levels in cases of speaker overlap in which the time window analyzed was 200 milliseconds or greater ."}
{"dialogue": "right now , that he 's not really showing any kind of uh distinction , but uh um . and uh one is that uh this is all in log energy um andbut one thing he was pointing out is when hehe looked at a bunch of examples in log domain , it is actually pretty hard to see <inbreath> the change . and when he 's looking in the log domain he 's not really seeing it .", "summary": "abstract: preliminary results were presented showing that log domain analyses did not reveal a significant difference in mean energy levels for windows of overlapping versus non-overlapping speech ."}
{"dialogue": "and when he 's looking in straight energy he is , umbutsince <inbreath> uh your intuition from looking at some of the data , is that when you looked at the regular energy , that it did in fact usually go up , <laugh> when two people were talking , <inbreath> that 'seh you know , you should be able to come up with a measure which willmatch your intuition .", "summary": "abstract: in contrast , raw energy analyses were successful in showing the two groups to be distinct ."}

{"dialogue": "yeah this was the problem with these categories ,", "summary": "abstract: participants also reviewed the latest iteration of speaker forms , and discussed recent changes to the transcriber tool ."}
{"dialogue": "umanother is that he needs to play with thethe different uhuh temporal sizes . uh , and uh he 's going to vary that number and also look at moving windows , as we discussed before . um and uhand the other thing is that theyeah doing the <inbreath> subtracting off the mean and the variance in theuh and dividing it by thestandard deviation in the log domain , <inbreath> may not bethe right thing to do . so yeah theretheretherethere 's a good chance then given that different people do talk different amountsthat there istherethere is still a lot more to be gained from gain norm normalization with some sort uh . but we were agreed that in addition to thatuh there should bes stuff related to pitch and harmonics and so forth . um and then we w i think we 're agreed that pitch - related things areareare going to be aa really likely candidate to help . and then you can move on to the uhuh more < mike loud pop > pitch related stuff . and then that should give us some indicationbetween those , should give us some indication of whether there 's anything to be achieved f from energy at all . not consider the log energy . i think i would just sort of look at the energyand then get into the harmonicity asas a suggestion .", "summary": "decisions: continuing efforts by speaker mn005 to measure energy levels in cases of speaker overlap will not include additional log energy analyses , but rather an analysis of raw energy for normalized speaker dataacross windows of varying duration , followed by an examination of pitch- and harmonicity-related features ."}

{"dialogue": "but it is definitely true that we need to have the time marks , and i was assuming that will be inherited because , if you have the words and they 're roughly aligned in time via forced alignment or whatever we end up using , then you know , thisstudent and i would be looking at the time marks well , wewe would n't be able to do any work without a forced alignment anyway ,", "summary": "problems: time marks for transcribed or force-aligned data are needed to analyze types of speaker overlap ."}

{"dialogue": "but the problem with it is the drawing of those waveforms is so slow that every time you do anything it just crawls . just about anything , and itit was so slow it was not usable .", "summary": "problems: the new version of transcriber does not feature the waveform , as re-drawing of this window is too slow using snack ."}
