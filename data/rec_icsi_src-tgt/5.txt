{"dialogue": "so they 'll have a little bit more natural interaction ?", "summary": "abstract: the data collection script has been slightly modified , so that it encourages more natural dialogue between the subjects and the `` wizard '' ."}
{"dialogue": "and um we have a little description of asking peop subjects to contact fey for you know recruiting them for our thing however there is always more people in ain a facul uh in a department than are just taking his class or anybody else 's class at the moment and then we 're going to have anotherwe 're gon na have w another trial run", "summary": "abstract: another trial run will take place , while a call to recruit subjects is being emailed to students ."}
{"dialogue": "um , the basic requirement is fulfilled almost . you can speak into it and ask for tv and movie information", "summary": "abstract: meanwhile , the translation of the tv and cinema information system to english is almost complete ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "abstract: this was the basic requirement of the project ."}
{"dialogue": "then uh on to the modeling . in the future though , the content of a hypothesis will not only be an object and anan action and a domain object but an action , a domain object , and a rich action description ,", "summary": "abstract: on the other hand , there was a presentation of the model that offers more elaborate action planning for smartkom , of which enter / view / approach ( eva ) modes are a part ."}
{"dialogue": "inside of enter there will be roles that can be filled basically .", "summary": "abstract: these modes will form categories of complete xml schemas with information filled in from the language understanding in a more elaborate way than the current object- '' go action '' -object model ."}
{"dialogue": "the idea is , so , imagine we have a library of schema such as the source - path - goal well one of the types of action schemas is source - path - goal action .", "summary": "abstract: these categories will , in turn , be linked with action schemas , one of which is source-path-goal ( spg ) ."}
{"dialogue": "the idea is , so , imagine we have a library of schema so if you wanted to have a new type of action you 'd create a new type of category .", "summary": "abstract: categories and action schemas can have -in theory- any number of blocks depending on the expansion of the domain ."}
{"dialogue": "meaning we can reference . and link it to another one , and this not only within a document but also via documents ,", "summary": "abstract: the notation provides for linking and referencing between different schemas ."}
{"dialogue": "and then those actions can be in multiple categories at the same time if necessary . it 'sit 's crucially necessary , is that we can have multiple schemas and multiple action schemas in parallel .", "summary": "abstract: the model also allows for multiple action schemas to be triggered in parallel ."}
{"dialogue": "um and i agree that you know this is something we need to discuss ,", "summary": "abstract: however , the structure of the model is open for discussion , since its use was to elicit discussion and highlight issues ."}
{"dialogue": "um , so we 're about to collect data and um we have a little description of asking peop subjects to contact fey for you know recruiting them for our thing", "summary": "decisions: as the data collection is about to start , a call for the recruitment of subjects is going to be sent out ."}
{"dialogue": "however there is always more people in ain a facul uh in a department than are just taking his class or anybody else 's class at the moment", "summary": "decisions: the main pool of subjects is going to be the student community in the institute ."}
{"dialogue": "there the idea is now that next actually wewe need to hire one more person to actually do that job", "summary": "decisions: along with the `` wizard '' , who is going to be an integral part of the experiments , another person needs to be hired as the instructor for the tasks involved in them ."}
{"dialogue": "meeting time rescheduling . i n did n't you say something about friday ,", "summary": "decisions: meetings were rescheduled and are now going to take place on fridays ."}
{"dialogue": "so i mean clearly there 'si can talk about the um the parser changes on friday at least ,", "summary": "decisions: for the next meeting , there is going to be a presentation of the modifications in the parser module of the basic system ."}
{"dialogue": "andand this is onon aonon my list of things until nextnext week . yeah , wei will promise for the next time to have fleshed out nxml examples for aa run through andand see how thisthis then translates ,", "summary": "decisions: additionally , the proposed xml model will be put to the test with concrete data ."}
{"dialogue": "and um if you can get that binding point also maybe with a nice example that would be helpful for johno and me .", "summary": "decisions: similarly , such examples will clarify issues relating to the binding and redundancy of features with common characteristics amongst the shcemas ( eg `` container '' for enter and `` goal '' for spg ) ."}
{"dialogue": "um and then , secondly , we had , you may remember , um the problem with the re - phrasing , that subject always re - phrase sort of the task that uh we gave them ,", "summary": "problems: subjects in the trial runs of the experiment were given detailed descriptions of the tasks , which led to the subsequent dialogue being a re-iteration or re-phrasing of the instructions ."}
{"dialogue": "however , not only wasthe common census wereamong all participants of friday 's meeting was it 's gon na be very laborious toto make these drawings for each different things , so all of a sudden we 'll get descriptions of pictures in there .", "summary": "problems: using pictures instead would be one way to deal with the problem , however , it was deemed too laborious and it would divert the focus of the experiment ."}
{"dialogue": "and the problem is , is that the current system does not distinguish between goes of type `` going into `` , goes of type `` want to go to a place where i can take a picture of `` , et cetera . in the future though , the content of a hypothesis will not only be an object and anan action and a domain object but an action , a domain object , and a rich action description ,", "summary": "problems: as the original action planner of the smartkom system only included a generic spg schema , a new module was presented that allows for variety in the user intentions to be included ."}
{"dialogue": "well , i think we 're gon na hit a lot of interesting problems um and i agree that you know this is something we need to discuss ,", "summary": "problems: this being only a model , there are several issues that will need to be clarified in the future ."}
{"dialogue": "it 's also a question of the recursiveness andand a hier hierarchy um in there .", "summary": "problems: how the model deals with redundancy of information among categories and action schemas , and whether a flat or a hierarchical model would be preferable are two of them ."}
{"dialogue": "and it 's gon na get more and more complex thethe l complexer and larger our domains get .", "summary": "problems: what is also clear is that as the domain of research broadens beyond the study of eva modes , the complexity of the model will also increase ."}
