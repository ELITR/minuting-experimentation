{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "abstract: the focus of the meeting was on a presentation of the work done already on the building of the bayes-net ."}
{"dialogue": "that 's basicallyjust specifying thethe input for thew what 's it 's based on things like , uh , there 's gon na be a node for go - there or not , and there 's gon na be a node for enter , view , approach .", "summary": "abstract: the input layer deriving information from things like the user and situation models , feeds into a set of decision nodes , such as the enter / view / approach ( eva ) endpoint ."}
{"dialogue": "and somesome things will always be sort of toonot significant enough .", "summary": "abstract: in any particular situation , most of the outputs will not be relevant to the given context ."}
{"dialogue": "cuz , that 's whati mean , in the bayes - net you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node .", "summary": "abstract: therefore , they will either have to be pruned a posteriori , or only a subset of the possible decision nodes will be computed in each occasion ."}
{"dialogue": "i mean , maybe it does make a difference in terms of performance , computational time . so basically , you 'd have a decision treequery , go - there . and just basically do a binary search through the ?", "summary": "abstract: the latter option could could follow a binary search-tree approach and it could also be better in computational terms ."}
{"dialogue": "you won'tit 'll be hard to decide .", "summary": "abstract: in any case , on what basis the `` winner '' output is chosen is not clear ."}
{"dialogue": "and for the where - is construction , we know we need to l look at this node , that merges these three things together so my i so , if we were to it with a bayes - net , we 'd have to have a nodefor every question that we knew how to deal with , every construction .", "summary": "abstract: one suggestion was discussed: the particular constructions used can determine the pertinent decision ( output ) nodes ."}
{"dialogue": "and , um , finish up this bayes - net . and we present our results ,", "summary": "abstract: the complete prototype of the bayes-net will be presented in the next meeting ."}
{"dialogue": "ok . because then , once we have it sort of up and running , then we can start you know , defining the interfaces and then hook it up to some fake construction parser", "summary": "abstract: after that , it will be possible to define interfaces and a dummy construction parser , in order to test and link modules together ."}
{"dialogue": "every construction .", "summary": "decisions: the suggestion that the most appropriate decision node of the belief-net in each situation could be chosen as a function of what construction was used , was deemed unsuitable at this stage ."}
{"dialogue": "because there are interdependencies ,", "summary": "decisions: there are many interdependencies between the output nodes that this approach could not take into account ."}
{"dialogue": "sometimethis weekagain and finish up the , uh , values of this .", "summary": "decisions: the rest of the values for the bayes-net nodes will be built in within the week ."}
{"dialogue": "and , um , finish up this bayes - net . and we present our results ,", "summary": "decisions: the finished prototype will be presented during the next meeting ."}
{"dialogue": "as , if i understand it correctly , it always gives you all the posterior probabilities for all the values of all decision nodes . so , itn i meana all i 'm saying is , whatever our input is , we 're always gon na get the full output . whatwhatwhat i am thinking , or what we 're about to propose here is we 're always gon na get the whole list of values and their posterior probabilities . cuz , that 's whati mean , in the bayes - net you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node .", "summary": "problems: any set of inputs will provide either the whole range of output values of the bayes-net or an a priori selection of those outputs ."}
{"dialogue": "and the question is what to do with it , and now we need an expert system or belief - net or something that interprets that , well , eventually , you still have to pick out which ones you look at .", "summary": "problems: in both cases , what is needed is a way to single out the appropriate outputs for any given context ."}
{"dialogue": "so the person said , um , `` where is x ? `` we want to know , um , isdoes he want info ? or does he want to go there ?", "summary": "problems: for example , in the case of a `` where is '' question , whether the prevalent output should be `` go-there '' or `` info-on '' or even a third option has to be computed somehow ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "problems: in any case , there are many input values that have not been entered in the bayes-net at this stage ."}
{"dialogue": "yeah , i can worry about the ontology interface and you cankeith can worry about the discourse .", "summary": "problems: furthermore , no inputs for the ontology and discourse can be built in yet , as they involve research that will be carried out in the future ."}
{"dialogue": "also , i 'm somewhat boggled by that hugin software . i ca n't figure out how to get the probabilities into it .", "summary": "problems: finally , there has been a problem with adding probabilities in a net created with the hugin software , but this should be overcome very shortly ."}
