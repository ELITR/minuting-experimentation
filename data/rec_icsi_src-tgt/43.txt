{"dialogue": "um . <mouth> <breath> what are we talking about today ? uh , well , first there are perhaps these uh meeting recorder digits that we tested .", "summary": "abstract: the main purpose of the meeting of icsi 's meeting recorder group at berkeley was to discuss the recent progress of it 's members ."}
{"dialogue": "uh , well , first there are perhaps these uh meeting recorder digits that we tested . perhaps the point is that we 've been working on <breath> is , yeah , we have put the um the good vad in the system and <breath> it really makes a huge difference . yeah , and then we 've started to work with this of um voiced - unvoiced stuff . no , i w <breath> i begin to play <laugh> with matlab and to found some parameter robust for voiced - unvoiced decision . what 's up with you ? so i 've been looking at avendano 's work but it 'sit 's an approach to deal with <breath> reverberation or thatthe aspect of his work that i 'm interested in", "summary": "abstract: this includes reports on the progress of the groups main digit recogniser project , with interest on voice-activity detectors and voiced / unvoiced detection , work on acoustic feature detection , and research into dealing with reverberation ."}
{"dialogue": "uh , well , first there are perhaps these uh meeting recorder digits that we tested . theboth the uh <breath> the sri system and the oth y you doi think you read some of thethe zeros as o 's and some as zeros . is there a particular way we 're supposed to read them ? perhaps in the sheets there should be another sign for the i mean . i think people will do what they say . i mean in digit recognition we 've done before , you haveyou have two pronunciations for that value , `` o `` and `` zero `` . no , they just write andand people pronounce `` o `` or zero and you justthey just want people to read the digits as you ordinarily would", "summary": "abstract: there was also talk of comparing different recognition systems and training datasets , and a discussion of the pronunciation of the digit zero for the recording at the end of the meeting ."}
{"dialogue": "uh i 'll try to write up in my next stat status report a nice description of <breath> what he 's doing ,", "summary": "decisions: in his next status report , me026 will summarise the work he has been researching ."}
{"dialogue": "but to me it justit just meant a practical <breath> point that um if we want to <breath> publish results on digits thatthat people pay <breath> attention to we probably should uh cuz we 've had the problem before that you getshow some <breath> nice improvement on something that 'sthat 's uh , uhit seems like too large a number , and uh <breath> uh people do n't necessarily take it so seriously .", "summary": "problems: the digit recognition system is still not working well enough , they must get better results if they want to publish and be noticed ."}
{"dialogue": "our back - end isis fairly simple but until now , well , the attempts to improve it orhave fail i mean so to <breath> so there 'sthere 'sthere 's two things being affected . i mean . one is thatthat , you know , there 's something simple that 's wrong with the back - end . we 've been playing a number of states uh ii do n't know if he got to the point of playing with the uh number of gaussians yet but , yeah , so far he had n't gotten any big improvement , but that 's all with the same amount of data which is pretty small . perhaps it 's not related , the amount of data but the um recording conditions . i uh but i 'mi 'm almost certain that itit <breath> i mean , that it has to do with the um amount of training data . itit 'sit 's orders of magnitude off . let 's see , in thein these multi - train things did we include noisy data in the training ? i mean , that could be hurting us actually , for the clean case . you know , i do n't think there 's anything magical here . it 's , you know , we used a simple htk system with a modest amount of data . and this is aa , you know , modern <breath> uh system uh hashas a lot of nice points to it . so . i mean , the htk is an older htk , even . i mean , there 's <breath> even though it 's close - miked there 's stillthere really is background noise . um . and <breath> uh i suspect when the ti - digits were recorded if somebody fumbled or said something wrong or something that they probably made them take it over . it was noti mean there was no attempt to have it be realistic in anyin any sense at all . ti - digit isit 's very , very clean and it 's like studio recording whereas these meeting recorder digits sometimes you have breath noise", "summary": "problems: they have not really made many improvements , which may be due to their comparatively small training set , or the conditions the data is recorded under ."}
{"dialogue": "uh . the problem is that it 's very big and <breath> <mouth> we still have to think how towhere to put it uh either some delay and weif we put it on the server side , it does n't work , because on the server side features you already have lda applied <breath> from the f from the terminal side and <breath> so you accumulate the delay", "summary": "problems: the new vad is quite a large network , and adds a delay to the process ."}
{"dialogue": "so wha where did this good vad come from ? it 's um from ogi . this is the one they had originally ? yeah , but they had toget rid of it because of the space , but the abso assumption is that we will be able to make a vad that 's small and that works fine .", "summary": "problems: this caused ogi to drop it , though speaker mn007 is assuming that a smaller and equally effective system can be developed ."}
{"dialogue": "but the other thing is uh to use a different vad entirely . ii do n't know what the thinking was amongst thethethe <breath> the etsi folk but um if everybody agreed sure let 's use this vad and take that out of there they just want , apparentlythey do n't want to fix the vad because they think there is some interaction between feature extraction andand vad or frame dropping but they still <mouth> want tojust to give some um <breath> requirement for this vad because it 'sit will not be part ofthey do n't want it to be part of the standard . so there just will be some requirements that are still notuh not yet uh ready i think . but i do n't think we need to be stuck on using our or ogi 'svad . we could use somebody else 's if it 's smaller you know , as long as it did the job .", "summary": "problems: the alternative is to get yet another vad form somewhere else , though it 's not clear if they will even be required in the final system ."}
{"dialogue": "yeah , it 'sit 's another problem . if you look at this um spectrum , is it <breath> the mel - filters ? and what we clearly see is that in some cases , and thethe harmonics are resolved by the f well , there are still appear after mel - filtering , and it happens <breath> for high pitched voice because the width of the lower frequency mel - filters <breath> is sometimes even smaller than the pitch . so we were thinking to modify the mel - spectrum to have something thatthat 's smoother on low frequencies .", "summary": "problems: there are some problems with the voiced / unvoiced feature detection , because some pitches are slipping through the filtering ."}
