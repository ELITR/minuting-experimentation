{"dialogue": "so we were just discussing , since you mentioned that , init w driving in the car with morgan this morning , we were discussing a good experiment for b for beginning graduate student who wants to run a lot ofwho wants to get a lot of numbers on something which is , like , `` imagine that you willyou will start putting every co any coefficient , which you are using in your vector , in some general power . like sort of you take a s power of two , or take a square root , or something . because uh your uh gaussian mixture model , so you 're compressing the range of this coefficient , so it 's becoming less efficient . morgan was @ @ and he washe was saying well this might be the alternative way how to play with awith a fudge factor , you know , and i said `` well in that case why do n't we just start compressing individual elements , like whenwhen because we observed that uh higher parameters were more important than lower for recognition . and basically thethe c - ze c - one contributes mainly slope ,", "summary": "abstract: having discussed this with the icsi project leader , the ogi member told of some future investigation they had devised , which would look at the adjusting the importance of some features ."}

{"dialogue": "there is a plenty ofthere 're plenty of issues . like the voice activity detector , well and what happened was that they realized that if two leading proposals , which was french telecom alcatel , and us both had uh voice activity detector . and i said `` well big surprise , i mean we could have told you thatn n n four months ago , except we did n't because nobody else was bringing it up `` . obviously french telecom did n't volunteer this information either , cuz we were working onmainly on voice activity detector for past uh several months and everybody said `` well but this is not fair . we did n't know that . `` and of course uh theit 's not working on features really . and so then ev ev everybody else says `` well we shouldwe need to do a new eval evaluation without voice activity detector , or we have to do something about it `` . and in principle iuh iwe agreed . but in that case , uh we would like to change the uhthe algorithm because uh if we are working on different data , we probably will use a different set of tricks . but unfortunately nobody ever officially can somehow acknowledge that this can be done , because french telecom was saying `` no , no , no , now everybody has access to our code , so everybody is going to copy what we did . `` well our argument was everybody ha has access to our code , and everybody always had access to our code . we never uhuh denied that . we thought that people are honest , that if you copy something and if it is protectedprotected by patent then you negotiate , or something , butand french telecom was saying `` no , no , no , there is a lot of little tricks which uh sort of uh can not be protected and you guys will take them , `` which probably is also true . and i think they have to be honest in the long run , because winning proposal againuh what will be available th iswill be a code . so the uhthe people can go to code and say `` well listen this is what you stole from me `` the biggest problem of course is that f that alcatel french telecom cl claims `` well we fulfilled the conditions . we are the best . and e and other people do n't feel that , because theyso they now decided thatthatisthe whole thing will be done on well - endpointed data , still not clear if we are going to run theif we are allowed to run uh uh new algorithms , because uh we would fight for that , really . at least our experience is that only endpointing aa mel cepstrum gets uhgets you twenty - one percent improvement overall and twenty - seven improvement on speechdat - car", "summary": "problems: there was disagreement at the project meeting over two group development of voice activity detectors , particularly since one group makes their code available to all and the others do not ."}
