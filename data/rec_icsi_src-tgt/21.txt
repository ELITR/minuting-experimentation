{"dialogue": "well , um , i cangive you an update on thetranscription effort . because at present , < spike on / p / > <inbreath> um , because < spike on / b / > of the limitations of <inbreath> th the interface we 're using , overlaps are , uh , not being < spike on / b / > encoded by < spike on / b / > the transcribers in as complete < spike on / p / > and , uh , detailed a way as it might be , what our decision was is thatwe 'll go ahead with what we have with a not very fine time scale on the overlaps .", "summary": "abstract: the berkeley meeting recorder group talked about the ongoing transcription effort and issues related to the transcriber tool , which despite its limitations for capturing tight time markings for overlapping speech , will continue to remain in use ."}
{"dialogue": "thewe have greatgreat , uh , p steps forward in terms of the nonspeech - speech pre - segmenting of the signal . um , so , uh , what we basically did so far was using the mixed file toto detect s speech or nonspeechportions in that . but < spike on `` but '' > itit saves so much timethethe <spike> transcribers", "summary": "abstract: speaker mn014 explained his efforts to pre-segment the signal into speech and non-speech portions for facilitating transcriptions ."}
{"dialogue": "uh , maybe < mike spike > raise the issue of microphone , uh , um procedures well , let 'swhy do n't we talk about microphone issues ? but ii think that itit does n't hurt , uh , the naturalness of the situation to try to have peoplewear the microphones properly , if possible , so , anything to reduce breathing isisis a good thing . so you want it enough to the side so that when you exhale through your nose , it doesn'tthe wind does n't hit the mike .", "summary": "abstract: recording equipment and procedures were discussed , with a focus on audible breathing and the need for standards in microphone wear and use ."}
{"dialogue": "but , i mean , the other things that we talked about is , uh , <inbreath> pitch - related things and harmonicity - related things , you know , have ahave a couple markov models which is to say , do n't worry so much about the , uh , features . and , uh , try to indi try to determine , you know , w when is th when are you in an overlap , when are you not in an overlap . and let the , uh , uh , statistical systemdetermine what 's the right way to look at the data . and i hope thethe next week i will have , eh , some results and wewe will showwe will see , eh , thethe parameterthe pitch , <inbreath> eh , tracking inwith the program . uh , thehashas , uh , been exploring , uh , e largely the energy issue so far , um , uh , jose hashas been but it may begiven that you have a limited time here , itit just may not be the best thing to <inbreath> toto focus on for the remaining of it . th - they were suggesting going to markov models ,", "summary": "abstract: and , finally , it was determined that speaker mn005 's efforts to detect speaker overlap using energy should instead be focussed on pitch- and harmonicity-related features or be guided by a non-featural , statistical approach , i.e . via the use of markov models ."}
{"dialogue": "what our decision was is thatwe 'll go ahead with what we have with a not very fine time scale on the overlaps . then < spike on / th / > when they 're encoding the overlaps < spike on / p / > it would be nice for them to be able to specify whenyou know , the start points and end points of overlaps . and i hope that if we do a forced alignment with the close - talking mike , that will be enough to recover at least some of the time the time information of when the overlap occurred .", "summary": "decisions: in the interest of time , it was decided that the group should continue using the existing transcriber tool and perform a forced alignment on the close-talking microphones that will , it is hoped , help to recover some of the time information indicating where different speaker overlaps occurred in the signal ."}
