{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "abstract: the first phase of the data collection has finished ."}
{"dialogue": "um , and we found another uh , cogsci student who 's interested in playing wizard for us . here we 're gon na make it a little bit more complicated for the subjects , uh this round .", "summary": "abstract: there is a new wizard for phase two , during which subjects will be given more complex scenarios ."}
{"dialogue": "as for smartkom , i 'mthe last smartkom meeting i mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis , which as of this morning should be resolved . so maybe uh uh , when tomorrow is over , we 're done .", "summary": "abstract: also finished are the modifications on smartkom: the remaining glitches will take no more than a day to iron out ."}
{"dialogue": "something happened , inon eva 's side with the prm that we 're gon na look at today ,", "summary": "abstract: a big part of the meeting was covered by the presentation of the prm of the proposed system ."}
{"dialogue": "i sorta constructed a couple of classes . the red lines on the , um , graph are the um , relations between the different um , classes . this is more or less similar to the flat bayes - net that i have , you know , with the input nodes and all that .", "summary": "abstract: an alternative representation of the bayes-net , it depicts context features as classes , and dependencies as relations between them ."}
{"dialogue": "ok . so it only makes two decisions , in this model . and one is basically how desirable a site is and the other is the mode of the visit , whether th it 's the eva decision .", "summary": "abstract: the current outputs show the desirability of a site , as well as its eva mode ."}
{"dialogue": "i mean , the notion of instantiating your el elements from the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and does n't fit very well into the extended belief - net .", "summary": "abstract: the fact that this model allows for instantiations of classes fits the research purposes much better than the extended belief-net ."}
{"dialogue": "we have a visitor from bruchsal from the international university . good . then , we can move on and see what andreas has got out his sleeve .", "summary": "abstract: following this , a visiting researcher presented an overview of a parallel project at the international university ."}
{"dialogue": "and so , what i want to build is basically aa smart f a q system . so , i want to be able to model information like , um , so in thein the context ofin the context of developing distributed systems , of a at a computer science school , uh , i want to build a smart librarian , basically", "summary": "abstract: it attempts to build a smart tutoring system for a computer science course ."}
{"dialogue": "now , what you uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information now , what i plan to do is i want to uh sort of do a uhuhtry to improve the quality of the search results ,", "summary": "abstract: the assumption is that document searches can give more personalised results , if they take into account contextual parameters ( user , situation ) ."}
{"dialogue": "and i 'm guessing that youyou wo n't be doing that ? no . on the other hand , uh , framenet could well be useful .", "summary": "abstract: although no detailed linguistic analysis takes place , it was suggested that the use of framenet could be a useful approach ."}
{"dialogue": "the other person i thought of is dan gildea ?", "summary": "abstract: there were also further suggestions for meetings with icsi researchers ."}
{"dialogue": "uh in ain a smaller group we had uh , talked and decided about continuation of the data collection . here we 're gon na make it a little bit more complicated for the subjects , uh this round .", "summary": "decisions: as the data collection is going into its second phase , more complex scenarios will be used to generate more intricate dialogues ."}
{"dialogue": "she 's actually suggested to look um , at the psychology department students , because they have to partake in two experiments in order to fulfill some requirements .", "summary": "decisions: subjects can be recruited from within the psychology department students , since such participation in experiments is compulsory in their syllabus ."}
{"dialogue": "uh , so one of the things that eva 's gon na do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down .", "summary": "decisions: as the work on creating a prm for the system has progressed , it is now necessary to find an implementation that can work as a prm interpreter ."}
{"dialogue": "uh , we are n't gon na build our own interpreter , the people at stanford write papers as if they had one ,", "summary": "decisions: there are no plans to build one from scratch , but it seems that other research groups at stanford may already have one ."}
{"dialogue": "and supposedly , um , we 'll actually get s deepseriously connected toto their work somebody 'lluh , you knowif it 's a group meeting once a week probably someone 'll go down and , whatever .", "summary": "decisions: moreover , closer collaboration with the local prm group will be pursued with additional participation in their meetings ."}
{"dialogue": "and it turns out , you know , the cpt 's are really big , if i do that ,", "summary": "problems: an early version of the prm of the system presented the same problem as a flat bayes-net: the cpt 's become too large ."}
{"dialogue": "but i do n't remember reading how you specify i remember them learning when , you know , you do n't know the structure for sure ,", "summary": "problems: another prm issue that arose and remained unclear was how the probabilities are specified ( instead of learnt ) on the actual relations between the classes ."}
{"dialogue": "theyouyou did n't look at all yet to see if there 's anybody has a implementation . so w anyway . so that 's aa major open issue .", "summary": "problems: furthermore , the lack of a prm interpreter is an open issue ."}
{"dialogue": "uh , we are n't gon na build our own interpreter , uh , so one of the things that eva 's gon na do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down .", "summary": "problems: it is not within the remit of the project to build one from scratch , therefore , an existing implementation has to be found ."}
{"dialogue": "now , what i plan to do is i want to uh sort of do a uhuhtry to improve the quality of the search results ,", "summary": "problems: on the other hand , the discussion about the smart tutoring system being built at the international university showed the importance of finding outwhich context parameters are influential in a given domain ."}
{"dialogue": "now , the big problem that i 'm facing right now is um , it 's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly , thatthat works in the small domain , but the problem is obviously the scalability . cuz it 'sit 's very easy to whip up something quickly ,", "summary": "problems: it is easy to hack up a system for a small domain , but making it scalable is much more difficult ."}
{"dialogue": "as for smartkom , i 'mthe last smartkom meeting i mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis ,", "summary": "problems: finally , there was a passing mention of problems encountered with the speech synthesis module of smartkom ."}
