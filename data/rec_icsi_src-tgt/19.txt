{"dialogue": "um , that some people tend to be overlappedwith more often than they 're overlapped , andit would be , you knowof course , there 's also the question of what type of overlap was this , and w what were they , so , um then it becothoughsojustjust superficially to giveuma couple ideas of the types of overlaps involved , i have at the bottom several that i noticed . so , uh , the point is that , um <inbreath> overlap 's not necessarily a bad thing and that it would be imi useful to subdivide these further and see if there are individual differences in styles with respect to the types involved . so , the question is , you know , how many more overlaps <inbreath> do you haveof , say the two - person type , by adding more people . to a meeting , so it may be that having three people <inbreath> is very different from having two people or it may not be . but we should still be able to somehow say whatwhat is the added contra contribution to sort of overlap time of each additional person , or something like that . these werethese werebenevolent types , as peoplefinishing each other 's sentences , andstuff . and that it would be interesting to look atwhether there are these kinds of constraints that jane mentioned , that <inbreath> what maybe the additional people add to this competition that happens right after a turn ,", "summary": "abstract: efforts by speakers fe008 and fe016 are in progress to categorize and subcategorize types of overlapping speech and evaluate the contribution of multiple speakers in an interaction to the amount and types of overlap observed ."}
{"dialogue": "yeah , i 've been playing with , um uh , using the close - talking mike to doto try to figure out who 's speaking . so my first attempt was just using thresholding and filtering , that we talked aboutabout two weeks ago , ok and then the other thing i did , was i took <inbreath> javier 's speaker - change detectoracoustic - change detector , and i implemented that with the close - talking mikes , umso , at any rate , my next attempt , which i 'm in the midst of and have n't quite finished yet was actually using the <inbreath> uh , thresholding as the way of generating the candidates . but all of this is close - talking mike , what i 'm doing <inbreath> is trying to use the close - talking mike <inbreath> and just usecan - and just generate candidate and justtry to get a first pass at something that sort of works .", "summary": "abstract: speaker me011 described his attempts to automatically identify speakers via the close-talking microphone channels using thresholding and filtering methods and an existing speaker-change detection algorithm ."}

{"dialogue": "so , from the point of view of studying dialogue , i mean , whichdan jurafsky and andreas and i had some projects on , you want to know the sequence of turns . so , for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling <inbreath> it 'swe know that that 's wrong in real time .", "summary": "problems: for language and dialogue modelling , current methods of marking and segmenting overlap are abstracted from real time , as individual speaker turns are indicated sequentially ."}

{"dialogue": "so if you fiddle around with it a little bit and you get good numbers you can actually do a pretty good job of segmenting when someone 's talking and when they 're not . but if you try to use the same paramenters on another speaker , it does n't work anymore , it does work for the one speaker throughout the whole meeting .", "summary": "problems: while such parameters can be finely tuned for one speaker to achieve good results , extending the same parameters to another speaker is problematic ."}
