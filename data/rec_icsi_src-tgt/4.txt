{"dialogue": "one thing i was wondering , was , those functions there , are those things that modify the m - three - l basically ? i think each of those functions act on the current xml structure , and change it in some way , for example , by adding aa l a field to it , or something . there were other actions uh , thatthat s seemed to stepstate variables somewhere , which , in german , uh , takes these t sentence templates and produces xml structures .", "summary": "abstract: the parser 's output modifies the xml used by the system to initiate actions and generate responses ."}

{"dialogue": "uh , at some point we 're going to have to worry about the language end .", "summary": "abstract: as the project evolves , further enrichment of the ontology ( actions , linguistic features ) will be necessary ."}
{"dialogue": "ehso , youyouyou may orso , then you 'd have this little vector of , um , you know , approach mode or eva mode . it 's part of what you know aboutaan object , <breath> is its eva vector .", "summary": "abstract: similarly , object representations will include an eva vector ."}
{"dialogue": "if you know it for a specific landmark you put it there . if you do n't , you just go up the hierarchy to the first place you find one . if it 's that type of thing , and we want its eva vector , pppt - pppt ! it 's that . ``", "summary": "abstract: this can be incorporated in the database entry for a particular building or inherited from the ontology of the building type ."}

{"dialogue": "sonoisy - ors are a way to , uh , <breath> sort of deal with this . so we come up with these l little tables for each of those and the final thing is that , um <breath> <mouth> this is a deterministic function of these , th - c the full conditional probability tablewith some function .", "summary": "abstract: noisy-or 's can help avoid this by simplifying the probability tables and applying a deterministic function to produce their complete version ."}

{"dialogue": "and the next thing i would like to be able to do , and it seems like this would not be too difficult either , is <breath> to say , `` ok let 's now pretend we actually wanted to not only change the <breath> the mapping ofof , uh , words to the m - three - l but we also wanted to changeadd a new sentence type so , yeah . i definitely think it 's <breath> it 's worth the exercise of trying to actually add something that is n't there .", "summary": "decisions: moreover , it is important to test the system and its internal workings by adding new sentence types and modifying the parser ."}
{"dialogue": "it seems to me we can get <breath> all the complexity we want in actions and in language without going outside of tourists in heidelberg . so , at leastunless somebody else wants t to suggest otherwise i think <breath> the general domain we do n't have t to uh , broaden . that is , tourists in heidelberg .", "summary": "decisions: all further research will use the existing domain ( `` tourists in heidelberg '' ) , as this provides enough diversity for the purposes of the project ."}
{"dialogue": "none", "summary": "decisions: the german partners for the project will realise all the necessary changes in the ontology ."}
{"dialogue": "so it seemed to me , what we ought to do is get our story together . and think about it some , internally , before asking them to make changes . ok . what are the thl class of things we think we might try to do in a year or two ? this isthis is everything thatthat , um , <breath> you know , umwe might want to do in the next couple years .", "summary": "decisions: it is therefore preferable for the group to exercise foresight and agree on the set of new tags they will need in the long run , so that they limit the number of change requests ."}
{"dialogue": "sonoisy - ors are a way to , uh , <breath> sort of deal with this . i think we definitelyi think it 's a great idea tha toto pursue that .", "summary": "decisions: finally , on a more technical note , noisy-or 's were discussed and considered a sensible approach to deal with the potential problems with the setting the conditional probabilities of the bayes-nets ."}

{"dialogue": "although th the <breath> to get at them from a language may not be trivial . so , it 's a relational database with persons , events , <breath> and , um , objects .", "summary": "problems: understanding the parsed data is helped by the database of objects , people and events accompanying the system , but the mapping of referring expressions to database objects can still be a hurdle ."}
{"dialogue": "and , that 's a lot of probabilities to put here , which is kind of a pain .", "summary": "problems: on a different level , the bayes-net used to generate the different action modes can easily become unmanageable as the number of features to be taken into account increases ."}

{"dialogue": "there 's this whole framework problem that i 'm feeling really uncomfortable about .", "summary": "problems: a final , high-level issue , that has not been dealt with yet , is the definition of the constructions and the construction grammar framework analysis behind the whole enterprise ."}
