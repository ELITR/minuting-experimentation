If you 're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say It might even be one , a bit more complex L _ C _ D _ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions .
Yeah , yeah it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know .
and I think the fact that we 're wearing these things restricts it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate .
and and the time the time given also restricts In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a < other > quite a con confining framework to work within .
And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so But it 's not bad leadership , it 's just sort of s fairly strong , you know .
I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time , maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text .
I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it 's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and in a way everybody 's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we 're actually just each of us discussing something that 's in each of our own minds .
And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I do n't think , you know , we needed to actually it could have , we could have gone through it verbally , What about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ?
And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wan na have the urge to check something , you know , well you know it 's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you 're told you must now work away from your team .
I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on I really thi i I think maybe if we 'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c Oh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful .
well you know it 's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you 're told you must now work away from your team .

That 's a number pad .
Where are we gon na have the slogan ?
just like right inside there .
So we 're talking about ten centimetres .
< laugh > be about th three and a half .
what else can you do ?
Audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range .
for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ?
No can do .
No .
Do we have kinetic as well ?
And that 's because of cost restraints is it ?
Yep .
I rate that pretty highly .
Okay let 's go with five then .
Let 's go with two point five then .
high tech innovation .
so we 've had to remove a few of our features we wanted , but jog-dial Yeah about three , okay .
Style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design .
Okay , the blue the blue colours and do n't re do n't actually represent the colour , the the yellow is more representative of the colour , so we 'll go two .
I mean I 'd give that nearly a one .
We 've used mostly plastic in the end so it 's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price .
logo , we 've got it in there , have n't we ?
out of forty nine with with zero being the highest .
So it 's pretty good .
Oh they 're a bit clunky .
And o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually did n't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files .
We only actually needed one computer .
Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else .
It becomes tangible .
If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would 've been a lot easier .
Do we have kinetic as well ?
And that 's because of cost restraints is it ?
Yep .
So we want double-curved ?
So we 're w w quite far over .
something 's gon na have to go .

Um , there are a few changes we 've made .
the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they 're hidden in the sense that um they 're not in use .
Um they 're in the L _ C _ D _ panel and the jog-dial ?
The L _ C _ D _ panel just displays um functionally what you 're doing .
We 're gon na have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button .
Um apart from that it 's gon na be used as a confirm button for the L _ C _ D _ screen Oh we 've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ?
but um because we 've got the the L _ C _ D _ and the jog-dial we just thought we 'd um use that as the volume .
Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and And what else do you do with the jog-dial ?
Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them .
We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to um if we need to rethink anything at all .
The other thing could be that um you could take away the L _ C _ D _ panel and the advanced chip together , It It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there 's actually one button underneath , it 's just that the panel itself is a single panel .
and um design is simple to use , simple in features .
Um , < other > soft and spongy , have we achieved that ?
And um it 's within budget , yep .
Um well do you wan na um just individually say what you think about about these four points and < other > Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ?
so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual We 're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , answering the question uh in those terms I 'd say that actually there 's sort of a tease of creativity I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , The constraints do come in very fast .
it 's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , got ta cut everything out 'cause we do n't have enough money .
It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative .

<cluster_separator>

Um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside , this is gon na be an L _ C _ D _ screen , um just a a very very basic one , very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm Uh , apart from that , it 's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time .
this button um , because it 's red it 's sort of very prominent , we 're gon na use it as uh it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it 'll send a stand-by signal .
I 've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan , So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , and um we 've been asked to uh to collectively rate this , So the first one uh , stylish look and feel .
We are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five .
uh well next up then , because we 've done finance , is the project evaluation .
Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting .
, the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other .
Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting .
I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it 's uh the the s the structure in which we 've we 've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation , the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other .

<cluster_separator>

We need an advanced chip I think , yep .
I think we 're gon na have to skip the rubber .
Yeah I think it 's about five .
But I do n't I do n't think it means the room as in this room .
I think the interactions are very structured .
So you think maybe a little too controlling or Yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt .
I do n't think there 's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it , uh what about teamwork ?
I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard , and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think .
Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well , But I think the pen is v is very intuitive , So I think the pen 's good .
I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they do n't support collaboration , I think that 's the word .

<cluster_separator>

we said we were gon na have a snowman shaped remote control with no L _ C _ D _ display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gon na be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons , maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L _ E _ D _ s to shine through the casing , um hopefully a jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well .
< other > Well < other > we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that 'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand .
Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons .
We 've got push buttons as well .
Okay let 's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one .
or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons .
Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons , And now we 're under budget .
We 've got push buttons as well .
Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons , descriptions: Inform abst _ sum - decisions: The buttons will be normal colored .
Square buttons ?
