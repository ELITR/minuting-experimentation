Nature is beautiful and inspiring. I like green and yellow apples.
We should protect the trees. Fruit trees provide tasty fruits.
Green apples are tasty. Sun is a natural source of light. 
Staying in naure is great. Apples and pears are good fruits.
We need to plant more trees. Fires burn and destroy trees. 
Fires are very destructive. Staying in the sun tans the skin.
