looks like we 're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber
'cause i think we 're definitely going for the speech recognition
but that 's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand
and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ?
you 'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace
um we 're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five euros each
um and with that we 're aiming for a profit of fifty million euros
you 'll be looking you 'll be looking at the user interface concept
teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet
and uh the the l _ c _ d _ and and the scroll are inside
we 've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that i fell behind with
so when we scroll we need just some way to get the t _ v _ to respond
and what i would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay
what if it was flat and you just spun it<q>yeah i think the jog dial
do we have kinetic as well ? and that 's because of cost restraints is it ? yep
we could maybe even go as far as saying power button<q>l _ c _ d _
we could maybe even go as far as saying power button<q>l _ c _ d _
we could maybe even go as far as saying power button<q>l _ c _ d _
um for uh our industrial designer<q>you 're gon na be thinking about the components concept
i think we have to design one product th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same
and i 'll see if i can argue with boss about putting the we put the fashion in electronics
and and um we have the banana-based one too<q>i suppose for the younger audiences
and and um we have the banana-based one too<q>i suppose for the younger audiences
and that 's selling them on the international market<q>not just in the u _ k _
and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design
do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ? yeah
l let 's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and we can make it yellow
these are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down
as to where we 're going from here<q>you 're going to look at the components concept
are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? yeah
um because i mean it it 's tried and tested intra-red<q>so we could stay with tha
and you 're going to be the user interface<q>t _ a _ r _ i _ k _
we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey<q>let the public choose what they want
what requirements it has to has to fulfil<q>you 'll be just thinking about what it actually what
how the user interface might work<q>so we 'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality
the other thing could be that um you could take away the l _ c _ d _ panel and the advanced chip together
the other thing could be that um you could take away the l _ c _ d _ panel and the advanced chip together
so you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive
does n't that come after actually seen a product prototype<q>um you 're gon na look at product evaluation
so we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three and then<q>well this is on off button
um i think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape
remote control should only be used for the t _ v _<q>um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues
was there a questionnaire already sent ?<q>so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it
and uh we do n't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty euros<q>so fifty percent of the selling price
and also t plastic i 've seen can get really textured<q>so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand
we forgot to mention it 'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex<q>new material that we 've got
you 're gon na be working on you know the actual working design of it<q>um so inbetween now and then
we 'll come back to uh your evaluation just to give you an idea<q>um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well
if we take some of the ideas why do n't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ? sure
so we 'll go with speech recognition
so um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana<q>and it flips open on the side
um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there<q>um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable
is would be an inset um black and white l _ c _ d _ s touch screen
with recommendations that they the budget be increased<q>um it might have influenced our choice<q>it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning
with recommendations that they the budget be increased<q>um it might have influenced our choice<q>it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning
um we 're at sixteen point eight and<q>so we 're w w quite far over<q>something 's gon na have to go
um and we 've got the meeting survey and questionnaire
we really need to care about<q>so just stick to to regular<q>then i do n't think rechargeable is something we should you know
uh i know that the designers are gon na be working with play-doh on that
if we 're happy with the design there 's no point in spending money<q>so we could even add something<q>if we do n't have to
what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ?<q>i do n't know if we deal with that<q>and the i the instruction manual
and you could look into um basically how how it 's made i _ e _ like how you make it all in one<q>how what sort of materials are available to you whatever
the t _ a _ one one eight three five<q>which um receives input from the buttons<q>there 's a circuit board inside
there 's um actually no rechargeable option available<q>'cause some of the things that we looked at last time are n't un unfortunately are n't available
um one 's based on the banana<q>or as mm few buttons as possible
um one 's based on the banana<q>or as mm few buttons as possible
um so according to the brief um we 're gon na be selling this remote control for twenty five euro<q>i mean that 's um that 's about like eighteen pounds or something
um the black on the back is the slogan<q>which is the little black kind of line in the middle<q>but also we 're gon na have the company name on the front
rather than buttons ? like uh control pads<q>do you think they should have some sort of stick on it<q>used as a joystick as well
this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing<q>is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design<q>um plastic for some reason incurs no cost
we 've got the use of the l _ c _ d _
uh our next meeting 's in half an hour and what i would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay<q>um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches
of the glow in the dark material<q>and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well<q>if it 's not too expensive s i think it 's a good gimmick
putting fashion into electronics or something<q>the fact that it talks to you<q>i mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says
um this is where we all go off and do our individual work<q>um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product<q>how we 're actually gon na put it into practice and make it work
if it was a c _ or something like that<q>you could have it in a vague c _ shape that opens up kind of like a shell<q>i think that 's that sounds a really attractive idea
we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it<q>and now we 've we also decided on the inside<q>or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top
twelve point five euros per unit<q>and we 're hoping to sell them for twenty five<q>if we 're aiming for fifty million euros we 're gon na have to be selling an awful lot of them
so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? i like the rubber<q>so that that spongy latex rubber everything feel<q>s i guess we decided on material
i 'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape<q>um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand<q>and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need
i 'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape<q>um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand<q>and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need
so um i thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle<q>what do we think a good size would be for this ? kind of um<q>maybe more like a p _ d _ a _ kind of
were we happy with that ? w i think we were very creative<q>like glow-in-the-dark or something like that<q>these pens are are neat though
yeah but uh i mean e even though it has to be re original we should n't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones<q>because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems a big learning curve
so presumably that might be an idea to put into<q>what do we think a good size would be for this ?<q>so maybe we could think about colour ? so um i thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle
i think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea<q>so that not only it doubles as a stand<q>but um for using it as uh recharging it
i think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea<q>so that not only it doubles as a stand<q>but um for using it as uh recharging it
uh i 'll see you in half an hour<q>so we need to wrap it up now<q>um we 've got another meeting in thirty minutes
um looks like we 're gon na need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay<q>you 've got yourself and the industrial designer gon na be working quite closely at this stage looking from prototyping of some des description using clay
which is the the first one is that um uh the company 's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is<q>so we do n't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control
i mean do you think the fact that it 's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? well right away i 'm wondering if there 's um th th uh<q>like with d _ v _ d _ players
do we have kinetic as well ? and that 's because of cost restraints is it ? yep<q>um so then these just become normal coloured buttons<q>i think we 're gon na have to skip the rubber
what we 're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television<q>something trendy and also something user friendly<q>um we want it to be something original
so um i thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle<q>i think the the only ones that i 've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things yeah the universal ones<q>so presumably that might be an idea to put into
are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ? so extra functionalities<q>so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses
the other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic<q>something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form<q>something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand
further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is<q>i 'm thinking kind of japan<q>it 's gon na be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who 's sixty and also across the world if we 're aiming at the international market
okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition<q>we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost<q>there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature
so my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size<q>so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something<q>and then it must be easy to use
complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation<q>send me your presentations so that i can use them to make the minutes<q>what we have to do now is to go back to our little places
not the v _ c _ r _<q>um they 've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television<q>d _ v _ d _ or anything else
but if a person does n't like banana<q>because it 's hard to make a fruit good to look at<q>it might be trendy to some
with recommendations that they the budget be increased<q>if we if we 're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team 's working for<q>we can put in our recommendations for what we 've we 've found and what we the consensus that we 've come to as a result of the meetings
um what effects the product has to have<q>so we 're all gon na go off and do our individual things<q>um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product
we happy to go ahead ? i think we yeah<q>and i really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities<q>we could actually do much more to minimise that
as for the um as for the single curve<q>like i say it would be nice to have some curvature to it<q>um well this edge and this edge
which gives us an average of three<q>considering the price we had to get this in<q>um are people really gon na shell out twenty five euros for something that 's only marginally good ?
um get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other<q>discuss our own ideas and everything um now<q>we want it to be original
so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? you could have different kind of casings
it was function f _ eight<q>f _ five and escape 'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing<q>and if you just click that it 'll go ahead
th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there 's there 's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen l _ c _ d _ remotes with the price range we 're looking at<q>one thing i 'm aware of is<q>going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our absolutely prohibitive
like i said before i i think we should have the r _ r _ on the uh on the top function button<q>so we always need to remember that somewhere we 're meant to be getting the slogan on<q>possibly i 'm think i 'm not sure but i 'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used
um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we could n't use teletext<q>there 's um actually no rechargeable option available<q>it was n't gon na be a control for everything 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time are n't un unfortunately are n't available
how what sort of materials are available to you whatever<q>and you could look into um basically how how it 's made i _ e _ like how you make it all in one<q>so you do the looking around at other remote controls
one is that we want uh something that 's high-tech but we want it to seem easy<q>and in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side<q>i guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it 's got ta look good
it 's gon na have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour<q>um which there 'd be sort of a wide choice<q>either we 're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something
so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it<q>have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?<q>depending on the expense of it
you know like those phones that they have<q>so perhaps some sort of menu-based thing<q>where they do n't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that
can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ? we 're gon na need to put in a really good battery so people do n't have to charge their r remote control every few days<q>um energy what do you think that 's suggesting we 're how we 're powering the thing ? i really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you 'd have the back-up of the battery
if we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not<q>we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point<q>because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five
it could have a flip top remote control i think that 's a cost thing<q>you 'd you 'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white l _ c _ d _ thing anyway<q>i do n't i do n't know how for twenty fi
but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow<q>but you can maybe see through it<q>s so like cur slightly transparent case
um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased<q>do you think our budget includes everything<q>i think we 've done very well to get within budget
um would that include um access to say interactive functions on digital or cable ? i would say so<q>you want one wo y you want one that 'll do the job of all of them<q>i mean most of the uh of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation
it 's meant to be an eagle<q>we 're gon na practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board<q>i 'm going to tell you that 's supposed to be a tiger
i mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it<q>and that would k also give it kinda durability and ther that 's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast<q>'cause there 's gon na be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours
based on fruits and natural things like that<q>so you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing<q>but something ergonomically shaped and organic
is that kind of you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the d _ v _ d _ player and it turns the t _ v _ on and onto the right channel as well<q>one on button would turn on say the video recorder<q>but you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion
ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it 'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing we do have a budget limitation that we ca n't control ourselves<q>so i think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing yeah but um on on that again i just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it 'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is
um switch the channel up and down<q>i mean so far i 've got um on and off<q>and skip to certain channels with the numbers
when we did uh f fashions uh<q>do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? the rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co<q>and everything with fruits and vegetables
and profit aim is fifty million euros<q>we 've got a selling price at twenty five euros<q>which i do n't actually know what that is in pounds
decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five<q>and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan<q>and we decided that it was gon na be non-rechargeable battery-powered
it can still be single curved<q>um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs we really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it<q>could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness so i mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation
the minutes from the last time<q>and we were gon na think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost<q>it was n't gon na be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow
buttons will be the on the upper side<q>or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it does n't look too childish<q>like uh an hour glass kind of figure
i do n't know how much power an l _ c _ d _ would take<q>but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display<q>they 'll be looking at this screen and that screen um i think probably for the first couple of hours of using it
say is is obvious and visible<q>because just going back to mobile phones<q>i think it 's really good that this has been very market research based
they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design<q>also so um a notice i got not very long before the meeting<q>and the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh
so these are my personal preferences<q>whistle and it screams at you<q>i was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because
um we decided that um the voice recognition system<q>it was it was uh a voice voice recognition<q>though that did seem to be the favoured strategy
um we decided to use a kinetic charger<q>um 'cause it can come in various different sizes<q>um buttons with a combination of l _ c _ d _ and rubber according to the design
do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it<q>we happy to go ahead ? i think we yeah<q>or do we have to make further modifications ? i do n't think so
most t _ v _ s these days actually have menus anyway and then<q>if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort of menu navigation<q>i imagine as well that the actual l _ c _ d _ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality
and uh w some of the main functions would be switching on<q>uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels<q>or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel
so we have the energy source<q>do we need uh many buttons<q>i 'm responsible for working design
we could do the voice recognition for<q>because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product<q>i do n't see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now
should be good looking for the consumers<q>uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design<q>they find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control
um so i believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer<q>is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some<q>maybe they 're un they 're they 're they 're in a little area but covered up um
those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick<q>would be to say um the requirements that we 've um set out<q>i think to sum up the last meeting
remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan<q>of the glow in the dark material<q>so we 'll go with speech recognition
the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches i mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you 'd be doing all the time would would charge it up<q>'cause if we 're doing the kinetic thing should n't we do some market research on that first before we add it in it 's not something that 's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research<q>there 's the plastic which i think we were gon na go for anyway as the main case case housing so perhaps uh some something made of rubber
what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two<q>then cat 's going to present the evaluation criteria that we 're going to be evaluating this against<q>um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we 've been through
okay this is uh the working design<q>everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the t _ v _ or other appliance that it 's sending the signal to<q>or the channel um or the volume
also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an l _ c _ d _ display<q>'cause we said we might have a jog dial<q>what would we what would we achieve from it ? and the th the thing i could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings
the other option of course is that um the the clapping one<q>a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit<q>it would be a small transmitter
we 're gon na design a new remote control<q>this is the agenda for today 's meeting<q>the very broad overview is original
this is uh first meeting of this design project<q>um and i um like to show you the agenda for the meeting<q>this is the the plan for today 's meeting then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more
one euro left over for bits that we did n't foresee<q>was there a questionnaire already sent ? do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? i do n't see why you ca n't stay here<q>we 've got like five minutes left
and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control<q>um the shape of the control<q>um there 's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there
um most of it stems from the use of the l _ c _ d _ which i think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a l _ c _ d _<q>at which point we 've removed a large part of how we were gon na interface
um we 're not going to be using teletext<q>general t _ v _ controls do do video as well<q>i think maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it
uh in this meeting i i 'm going to discuss about the trend watching<q>but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market<q>and the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use
i was i was satisfied with with the leadership<q>but i mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting<q>and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the i mean especially with that last-minute alteration
twelve point five euros per unit<q>if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television<q>but i think we do n't have a specific audience
and there 's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone<q>it can still be lightweight plastic<q>you know ? something that 's easily moulded and produced
we can now have a little look at the the excel sheet and price listing<q>have we got battery ? we need an advanced chip i think<q>okay let 's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one
uh it 's gon na cost us fourteen point six euros<q>let 's just enter in the um evaluation criteria<q>um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance
'cause we said we might have a jog dial<q>somewhere on it where you just roll it ? the question is when you 're rolling it<q>like a nice just sort of round
so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it<q>you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle<q>on the bottom we were gon na have the rubber
um so according to the brief um we 're gon na be selling this remote control for twenty five euro<q>and uh we do n't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty euros<q>so fifty percent of the selling price
um and when the corporate colour is yellow<q>and the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? and that we 've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side<q>then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize
they should be easy to press<q>so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button<q>or really what the slogan is
do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels<q>should volume be important in the joystick<q>i i was thinking that the remote the um sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume
we are close to the budget<q>but if you take away the voice recognition<q>is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ? so we are under the budget
um so i believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer<q>so it you wan na group all the different kind of types of functions together<q>those could be something people set up very rarely
you think bananas are a safe thing to use ? it 's a bit um phallic<q>so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then i will explain the the user interface th uh things<q>as it is on the website
it 's got a menu display<q>you know the new phones that have kind of got a windows-based running system<q>but you know on a mobile phone
discussed the possibility of a macro facility<q>remote control should only be used for the t _ v _<q>we 'll start with the minutes of the last meeting
what i was thinking of a design which nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back<q>if it was a c _ or something like that<q>you know even though we 're using plastic
i liked the fact that we could say an idea and it 'd be suggested that that was n't the best idea<q>i think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we 'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out<q>although we did n't quite make the voice recognition in there
we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls<q>between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five<q>most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software
it could be one button for a menu or something<q>so perhaps some sort of menu-based thing<q>you know like those phones that they have
um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project<q>so we 're designing a new remote control and um um<q>my favourite animal would be a monkey
what are your experiences with remote controls ? i mean i 've got we got um we had three videos<q>a t _ v _ and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls<q>but that kept losing the signals but that was quite good
i think it 'll be the mid range to the high end market<q>um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we 're gon na be um who 's our our target audience<q>who wou who would have the money to spend
there 's the functional design of the the remote control<q>the method that we 're going to use to complete the project<q>we 'll pull it all together
um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on<q>and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching<q>were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology
and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that<q>or i mean in we can completely do away with buttons so so at this stage<q>i think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use
now we are here at the functional design meeting<q>by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group 's going to be and what the functions of the remote control you said uh targ target groups<q>would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? once we you do n't have to do it now but when once you go back
the t _ a _ one one eight three five<q>and i 'm gon na use the whiteboard<q>there 's a circuit board inside
so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went<q>but in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting<q>let 's just throw it together and do what we can
i think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we 'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out<q>we came to a very predic creative design<q>we 've done room for creativity
we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey<q>i think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape<q>like we could have a big banana shaped remote control
i 've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning<q>style reflects a fruit inspired colour<q>let 's go with two point five then
to produce our own mobile phones<q>you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you 've got any problems with it and they 'll fix it<q>if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets
should we give it a six ? um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm i mean i d uh i dunno<q>should we maybe say f a five so<q>i would say ? or maybe six
um one 's based on the banana<q>um will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news ? we made three for you<q>i like the feel of it
i have to look at the uh market potential for this product<q>seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly<q>uh then uh the methodology i adopted to find out all this was market survey
um we 've got the t _ v _<q>what other functions ? oh batteries<q>now there 's um i ca n't remember what it 's called
the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch<q>do we agree on the battery ? the kinetic<q>the l _ c _ d _ 's not cheap
so this is the um overall budget for our project<q>um we 're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five euros each<q>um and with that we 're aiming for a profit of fifty million euros
so most remote controls use graphical interface<q>the raised symbols i thought were good<q>but i think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons and we 've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you
um as well as uh characters<q>um different uh keypad styles and s symbols<q>like with d _ v _ d _ players
and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design<q>uh only control the t _ v _<q>just not to worry about teletext
so we 've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria<q>that 's way too expensive down here<q>i do n't know what special colour means
the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set<q>these are two leading um remote controls at the moment<q>have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? is that a function we want in the remote ? you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it 's got the voice recognition you could have it just
or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it does n't look too childish<q>i think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape<q>or a squash of some sort ? you do n't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape
we are going to have m maybe a g _ g _ u _ i _ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top we just took the input from the previous meeting<q>have icons or touch pad or whatever<q>to check on the customer needs and feasibility
you might hook it up to the p _ c _<q>you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television<q>but if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option
there 's um an l _ c _ d _ thing<q>but in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more<q>it 's a it 's great
actually mm some of my points might overlap with what william 's just mention<q>and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly<q>i would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that
i should just look at um the speaker<q>do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels<q>the y we 're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button
um so basically it 's the it 's the flip open thing again<q>you can still do the scrolling here<q>you ca n't really see it in the interface
my name 's cat um this is a rabbit<q>and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you 're doing that tell us your name<q>what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you 're taking in this project
i think we can do three<q>reduce the number of unused buttons<q>inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion
so this is the technical functions design<q>the clunky one is the one on the right<q>it 's got only the basic functions mm but um it 's the same size as the the hard to use one
okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general<q>uh top european fashion trend um that i read about says there 's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables<q>the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control
um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a l _ c _ d _<q>um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs or what we did was that we um we as in i as i was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure<q>which i think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure we 've got point two of a euro left over there
so you can have voice recognition and a regular remote<q>it 's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself<q>but imagine you got rid of the regular remote part
if we change it to the battery it 's that 's minus three<q>um we 've got plastic and rubber<q>i 've got finance here now
speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use<q>speech recognition is not good for this<q>that 's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well
answering the question uh in those terms i 'd say that actually there 's sort of a tease of creativity we 're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology<q>and then the work went on in isolation<q>reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting
um and uh i found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t _ v _ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use<q>i 'm i 'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a _ batteries but those can be quite bulky so i d i did n't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control<q>right ? well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones um
basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by<q>it 's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process<q>we average that and uh the criteria based on real reactions ' kinda goals and policies
we compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool<q>but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does<q>if we want something strong and sturdy
so you can have voice recognition and a regular remote<q>it 's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself<q>then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look
we 've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction<q>though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh computer ourselves<q>i think we needed a larger budget
this is a brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote<q>the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because i had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices i 've looked at looked at a num uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles<q>it creates a rather user unfriendly interface
fifteen minutes to discuss i think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh ka kate cat cat 's uh presentation was um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people<q>i would pay more for a voice recognition remote control<q>good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know
we have to decide on which functions we 're going to actually have<q>of the glow in the dark material<q>l _ c _ d _ interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons um so i mean a a the sort of inkling i 'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that i 'm getting sent is that they 're quite interested in a t _ f _ t _ display
take it down to just a scroll wheel<q>it can come in the same colour as the the case<q>in the l _ c _ d _ we can scroll
fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons<q>international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that 's a bit nicer looking<q>um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier
and i jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others<q>whistling recognition and rocket power um and lastly the transmission interface is uh<q>and uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote
another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? um maybe i could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories<q>so it you wan na group all the different kind of types of functions together<q>well i think i think es essentially what we 're doing right now is we 're categorising
remote control is n't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you 're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control no<q>but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition<q>tends to be people talking um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about
and is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features<q>i think we just say that it was gon na be the the most basic stuff possible<q>another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? um maybe i could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories
do we have any functions that um we 'd want on it ? i mean so far i 've got um on and off<q>things like channel and volume um are used all the time<q>um switch the channel up and down
now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control<q>i think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that 's fashionable and sleek and trendy<q>users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls
a basic principles and basic components that are needed<q>the basic thing is there 's a user interface you know<q>maybe you you wan na go back to what the functions are ? well
um i think plastic and rubber would be fine<q>um like you said time to market was a problem<q>um and the other components are logic chips
um and when the corporate colour is yellow<q>sort of feels right in your hand<q>so something quite curvy ? about how if you have a bright colour you 'll not lose it so much
we said we were gon na have a snowman shaped remote control with no l _ c _ d _ display<q>the the symbols of the various functions<q>but they 're hidden in the sense that um they 're not in use
i do n't think there 's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a<q>uh what about teamwork ? uh<q>yeah it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave
th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there 's there 's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen l _ c _ d _ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models<q>using the cable subscribed the cable providers<q>one on button would turn on say the video recorder
but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display<q>i hear what the marketing expert 's saying about um voice activated control<q>um voice activation could be an interesting idea but i think that our ind industrial designer would probably upon some research say that it 's maybe not feasible
this uh meeting is the conceptual design phase and is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of<q>and these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have<q>you know that they use in watches
uh um i was given a an h _ t _ m _ l _ file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs<q>where um the joystick 's uh left right left right for channels<q>i was n't very impressed by them uh nothing i saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we 're going for today
the noise for when you lose the banana<q>looks like we 're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber<q>say something like um lithium ion battery
most likely gon na be double curved<q>um um something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end<q>quite how the best way to do this is
um most of it stems from the use of the l _ c _ d _ which i think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a l _ c _ d _<q>then we can save point five of a euro here in that it 's not per push button<q>slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do
um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment<q>there 's um actually no rechargeable option available<q>'cause some of the things that we looked at last time are n't un unfortunately are n't available
so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it<q>depending on the expense of it<q>the l _ c _ d _ 's not cheap
me and william worked on a prototype<q>there 's be a standard transmission with the t _ v _ using using all the standard chips that we 've talked about<q>where where is the remote and it 'll shout back
was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company<q>are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? so it 's what we 've discussed in the last meeting<q>we 're going to use a seven point scale
final evaluation of the uh uh of our product<q>so now is the final evaluation<q>we will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements
also uh the remote control should be used only for television<q>the user interf interface communicates with the chip<q>so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it 's compatible with mot most uh televisions
uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels<q>um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set<q>um um among the findings i found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design
channel selection and volume selection are important<q>fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons<q>it 's um switching between channels
with um but with a t _ v _ remote it 's gon na be quite limited if we 're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five<q>it 's more like if you lost it and it 's down the sofa sometime<q>a and uh not to yell at it from the distance
so what we 're gon na do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design<q>left-handed people ca n't normally write right-handed<q>it totally meets with that requirement and seven is





















um so we want something to keep it from getting lost
um u _ i _ d _ the user interface concept
and you 're gon na do some product evaluation
and you 're gon na do some product evaluation
um is going to be looking more into the working design
and it 's the whole thing 's made of rubber
and we want um we want large buttons for the essential things
so we 're gon na have like a menu button
we will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition
we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it
and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff
the i _ d _ is going to work on the components concept
but it 's not the immediate thing that you 're used to
um and you 're gon na be working on the product evaluation
and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay
i _ um i _ d _ industrial design you 've your components concept
we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us
we 've got eleven point two<q>so we can go to production
so let 's not let 's uh not bother with the chip on print
we want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions
so um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner
and now we 're gon na complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary
and now we 're gon na complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary
let 's go with a simple chip ? um did we decide on a chip ?
um u _ i _ d _ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there
not sure that we 'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of
it 's got ta be ca n't cost any more than twelve fifty to make
so you 'll be hearing about different trends<q>uh about different things that people need
i need you to tell us what um we what the user 's gon na want
and do n't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo
i think um we could do l the logo in grey<q>as it is on the website
like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones
so we 're we 're not gon na have any sort of display i think uh
i 'm gon na put these initial ideas that we 've got in the um project documents
i 'm gon na put these initial ideas that we 've got in the um project documents
you know come up with the the user interface design<q>you 're gon na be working on
um using um prototype building materials um<q>um i need you guys to work together on making a prototype
we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out<q>as far as the uh whole visible light thing
voice activation might not be the best<q>i would say scra i 'd say scrap that straight off
um i 'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these powerpoint slides
should it be larger buttons in general<q>i think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles
i think if we had a a locating device with the small one<q>i think that seems way more advanced
and all three of us can have a chat about it<q>now we kind of have to come to some decisions
and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device<q>we we need a like homing device
from you catherine wi your y y you know you 're gon na be working on the the look and feel design
so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on<q>and another rote remote with all the special things
we 're gon na need a smart chip if we 're gon na make it multi-functional
the use of the laptops for receiving everything<q>now we 're gon na talk about the project process yeah
we 're all we 're all going we 're all liking that idea ? so we want it rub rubber double curved
we 'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million euro um from our sales
we 'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million euro um from our sales
um after the meeting we 're gon na each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries summary
like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television<q>that 's what we 're focused on
we should install a small backup battery<q>the solar power definitely would be but i think just to keep people from getting annoyed
um we so we do we 've decided not to worry about that for now<q>they 're gon na stick out
we 're gon na have a beep<q>but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps
this that 's that 's very good<q>we 're gon na go go back to um going with the kinetic thing
and if um if you 'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you would n't need to use every day
i 'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel<q>what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype
um in order to make a profit of this magnitude<q>we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty euro
but if we had all the buttons in black<q>that 'd be our corporate one<q>and a design in and the outside in yellow
um and i 'd like the um industrial designer to get ge think about what needs to be done<q>like what the basic function of it
because they only use ten percent of the buttons really
like that we know the battery 's working<q>is good to just to indicate<q>it 's sort of like a reassurance
like it 's an international market range<q>and because this is such this is for television it 's a we have a market range of internet
i guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w so technical function
we should probably consult with our legal department uh<q>i 'll see if i can get see if i can get hold of them for the next meeting
so maybe this we should look into this younger demographic<q>i 'm seeing that we 're gon na just basically focus on this young demographic group
we did n't bring it up yet<q>but we 're not gon na work with teletext<q>or at all in the meetings so far
if we 're gon na have pushbuttons<q>i guess maybe if we decided on like a simple<q>but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip
i 'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so i 'll put all that into the final report as well<q>or as much as seems like
but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new<q>w every everything else was fairly simple<q>not if you 're left-handed it 's not
with a touch screen for the basic functions<q>have we confirmed that we 're gon na go ahead with a uh touch screen um yeah i think that would be best
but the the functions that we 're sure that we want are that it can control the t _ v _
but you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone<q>or like a little cradle for your ipod<q>that 's that 's a good idea
i think we should just do um the recognition for when it 's lost<q>because people could just be talking and we do n't want it going off all the time
i think we should just do um the recognition for when it 's lost<q>because people could just be talking and we do n't want it going off all the time
and the uh the material like the plastics and so forth<q>we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel<q>just kind of the squishy feel
i 'm not sure that we 'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of<q>i i think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now
let 's just go for a lithium<q>this is where we need to make a final call on if it 's a lithium or do we wan na go triple a _ s
the i _ d _ is going to work on the components concept<q>and you 're going to do some trend watching
um and i think if we wan na keep our costs down<q>we 're gon na go with um type pushbuttons<q>we should just go for pushbuttons
i think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base i think if we had a a locating device with the small one<q>i think that seems way more advanced
we can make some some really good improvements<q>and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market<q>i think we can do some really in in that department
we can make some some really good improvements<q>and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market<q>i think we can do some really in in that department
like that we know the battery 's working<q>is good to just to indicate<q>it 's sort of like a reassurance
i think i 'm leaning towards the potato<q>the potato ? variety of colours are nice<q>that 's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down
the profit aims to make fifty million euros on it<q>what we 're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five euros<q>um but we wan na try to make it for twelve fifty
and um ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple
um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing<q>um alright first off we 'll just uh recap from our last meeting
i 'll just attach it to an email<q>can you e-mail your slides as well ? yes<q>um just including all the things that we talked about
for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it<q>i 'm a excellent project manager<q>and i 'm the marketing manager or something
um and finally there 's more marketing<q>while we 're gon na make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design<q>our corporate image has to be recognisable
my understanding of a latex case is that it 's in fact hard to protect stuff inside<q>al all circuit boards are pretty much the same<q>i do n't really know what to tell you as far as decisions
a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells but honestly if we cut that one piece out we 're actually coming in under budget and maybe move ahead with the project<q>i think unfortunately that 's our best option
like a little cut-out kind of um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact<q>so i was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be
like a little cut-out kind of um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact<q>so i was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be
um so we 're gon na try out our white board<q>so you want us to draw it and then talk about it ? or just draw it ? i think both<q>we ought to decide who starts and all that
what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? i think it 's awesome
let 's just go for a lithium<q>do i just put quantity being one battery<q>or this is where we need to make a final call on if it 's a lithium or do we wan na go triple a _ s
overall i mean i thought we did a good job like minus it being just merely a t _ v _ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it<q>and we 've all been a pretty congenial team here
our selling price goal is twenty five euro and profit aim is fifty million euro<q>and we will hope to sell this internationally<q>how many should we sell then ? well it 's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty
um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about<q>um so we 're gon na divide us up into three compa three parts<q>first the functional design which will be uh first we 'll do individual work
would it just be universal for everyone<q>like even technically non-technically challenged people are gon na use it<q>you think ? because i think even if something has large buttons
you two are gon na be working together on this<q>be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas
maybe make it like fruity colours or something<q>and um i 'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though<q>the power button could be like a big apple or something
shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns<q>so in milan and paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing<q>i do n't know if we really want to go with that
i 'm the um marketing expert<q>i 'm stephanie and i am the user interface designer<q>so this is our kick off meeting
i think it 's a lot to do with battery<q>which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional<q>so 's just the quality of the chip
like so you can clip it to your<q>and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um water resistant<q>maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it
we wan na make a multifunctional remote<q>um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss<q>expe our experiences with remote controls um
so no d _ v _ d _<q>we do n't need all those um play<q>so we 've pretty much pared it down to on-off
i 've put my files in the shared folder as well<q>i 'm gon na save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders
fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like<q>and then it has to also be technologically innovative<q>um we need easy to read like large buttons
um i 've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well<q>something we should take into account is um we 've got ta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit<q>it 's got ta d look like it 's in the r _ and r _
if we 'd had that sheet at the beginning should 've been like<q>i think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with<q>let 's just throw it together and do what we can
project aim is a new remote control<q>every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal<q>so is the agenda ? opening
um we 've got uh y the industrial designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic<q>um think we 're constrained to plastics based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let 's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased
where do you guys come up with these numbers ? um<q>that 's just off the top of my head<q>sorry about the uh lack of information on cost
i think we should forgo the whiteboard since we ca n't actually see what we 're writing<q>first we 're gon na start off by using our tools<q>um right now so we 're all gon na draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal
so our aim is to produce a remote control that is original<q>project plan and discuss then close<q>um so f here 's our agenda for today
i think all of them should have an r _ r _
i need you to tell us what um we what the user 's gon na want<q>um u _ i _ d _ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there um and i 'd like the um industrial designer to get ge think about what needs to be done<q>like what the basic function of it
and our profit aim is fifty million euro<q>um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five euro<q>we 're going to make this an international product marketed in the states
but you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone<q>battery ? do we need a long-life battery ? we should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all<q>or like a little cradle for your ipod
would it just be universal for everyone<q>like even technically non-technically challenged people are gon na use it<q>as long as they are not childishly large
i think we should also have a back-up plan of i 'cause i i i just think that it might be expensive to make something that we should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control<q>that just that is just for a t _ v _
never even have to see them and then you could like pull something out<q>that had like the main buttons like if it was just a simple<q>either this way or this way
nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news<q>so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote<q>first it 's only going to be a t _ v _ remote
typically a remote has either two double a _ s or four triple a _ s<q>uh i did n't get a chance to complete this one<q>um extra functions will probably need an additional chip
um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or no that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as i know<q>what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that 's really necessary ? i would say it 's if it 's simple to do
comes on every time you turn it on and then that 's it it seems like it would suffice to have just the r _ r _ on there<q>it 'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it 's loading i 'm wondering how we 're gon na get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device
in restricting us only to using a t _ v _ remote<q>we think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself
wan na make it different colours so anybody can choo like like so we could do like the pink range<q>you have a variety of colours<q>i would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere
the u _ i _ d _ the user interface design<q>you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay<q>the final say on what buttons get put
the i _ d _ is going to do the look and feel design<q>you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay<q>i think you 're going to get a lot of
uh since we 're going with batteries instead of solar power<q>i 'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex<q>and then we could give two latex covers to start
i 'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex<q>and then we could give two latex covers to start<q>uh since we 're going with batteries instead of solar power
turn the t _ v _ on<q>probably and a it just gives you a verbal response<q>but it 's gon na be the most expensive option
if we 're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control if it 's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job<q>the same basic non-remote kind of remote design<q>stick with the same kind of kinda yeah
so now uh we 're moving on to finance<q>um it 's not hand dynamo<q>we 've got eleven point two
um these are our minutes from r the functional design<q>specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost<q>our main objectives were simplicity and fashion
we ca n't kind of build it into other uh products<q>maybe a remote with changeable faces<q>for instance like a mobile phone or something like that
in restricting us only to using a t _ v _ remote<q>we think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself<q>we did n't have a whiteboard
'cause the i mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one<q>if uh uh if this means intuitive<q>rather than the way you 've got it
um i 'm just gon na have a little powerpoint presentation for us<q>i i 'll be the project manager<q>and then we 'll move into the project plan
um is going to be looking more into the working design<q>and the m _ e _<q>what does that stand for ? m marketing
but if it 's gon na be in a latex type thing and that 's gon na look cool<q>is that there 's uh like a hard plastic inside<q>and it 's just covered with the latex
maybe we do n't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age<q>i think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages<q>maybe people who have problems with technology
left-handed people ca n't normally write right-handed<q>um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people<q>which is like exactly the mirror image of this one
um we 're gon na do a little tool training<q>i will draw a little turtle for you all<q>and then draw your favourite animal my name is alima bucciantini
we 're gon na talk about project finances<q>we 'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television it 's a we have a market range of internet<q>like it 's an international market range
if we 're adding so much technology to this one remote<q>are we still gon na be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty euro you know goal for selling these things<q>i guess we 'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development we 'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ? but then again that costs as well
it needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal<q>so double or triple ? it 's okay<q>what kinda battery would we want to use ? double a _
um i 've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well<q>but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it 's one of our products<q>we are sort of beholden to them
you discussed either a lithium or a solar power<q>would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? um<q>we should install a small backup battery
take it down to just a scroll wheel<q>we 're point three over at the moment<q>the sample sensor will have to go
and i wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many other compromises<q>are we gon na use that as one of our functions ? i i would say no<q>and if the whole idea is you 're using a remote then why would you have voice
wan na make it different colours so anybody can choo like like so we could do like the pink range<q>and um i 'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though<q>the power button could be like a big apple or something
i feel like voice recognition would be<q>um there 's a sample sensor and there 's a sample speaker unit for so<q>and that 's just that there 's the new technology that they 've developed on the voice recognition
we 're making a remote control um we 've got to make something as fashionable as possible<q>and then finally we 'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what 's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go and then ov obviously uh the u _ i _ d _ and the i _ d _ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible
and the uh the material like the plastics and so forth<q>we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel<q>if you feel the the tip on this pen it 's a bit gives just a bit
and still have it be operational ? it 's never gon na be more than it 's never gon na be<q>as far as the infra-red signal<q>the the t _ v _
would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ? are we designing a remote control for a television only um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ? i 'll look into that<q>if it 's just a television then that it 's a bit simpler<q>if you have older people or people like me that are n't very co-ordinated hand-eye
uh and that would be infra-red<q>does n't have to go through a wall<q>it 's never gon na be more than it 's never gon na be
and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they 'd be interested in um voice activating<q>do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote<q>voice activation might not be the best
that 's gon na cost ten ten euro seventy cents a unit to make<q>and it 's made out of rubber<q>i can do this o on my own or i could do it with you
i did n't even get an email<q>though i did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day<q>i feel like that was slightly lacking when i was reporting about what each of us was doing i was often confused as to what you were doing um and then i also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was and then in the end i think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more
it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap<q>har how it works an and in marketing user requirements specifications<q>that 's that 's so you got ta you go
i think we should also have a back-up plan of i but also devices connected to the to the t _ v _<q>but it 's just a really good<q>so would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things
um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the d _ v _ d _ and v _ c _ r _ access and stuff<q>and the just the mute button<q>and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel
leather options or wood options or something as far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case<q>like if wood is an option<q>i thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin
and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device<q>you push the button to find it<q>we we need a like homing device
there 's the final questionnaire and meeting summary<q>is it started as a pear<q>this is the great product kids
just have like eight thousand buttons and you 're like<q>we have to remember our budget is twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device<q>would you have the screen on the thing
so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them<q>uh it should be technologically innovative innovative<q>i 'm just basically letting you know what 's happening in the markets so the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have
so is is the advantage of bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other that would mean you 'd need a television that has bluetooth in it<q>you have to make it new<q>they do n't really care whether
i think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology<q>and then it could start to beep but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that 's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button<q>a little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television
we did the project evaluation based on um sarah 's evaluation of on off switches though it was really technically an evaluation of the product<q>that 's the end of the meeting<q>we 've established that the costs were n't really within budget
this is our functional design meeting<q>what effects the apparatus should have<q>how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function
my understanding of a latex case is that it 's in fact hard to protect stuff inside<q>and it 's just covered with the latex<q>is that there 's uh like a hard plastic inside
so basic remote operation runs as follows<q>um contact discs for the buttons<q>integrated circuit which consists of a diode
is basically to send messages to the television set<q>the function of a remote control<q>it 's a lot more simpler
let 's have the prototype presentation<q>the base is gon na be gunmetal gray<q>the whole thing lights up if you press any button
they have two remotes ? yeah<q>but it 'd mean we 'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one<q>that 's i do n't see why that 's not possible
so just have a call button<q>um or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing<q>i think one thing is that it should be easy to find i mean you always know where your t _ v _ is
is the project evaluated ? yes<q>if i 'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables<q>i think we 've been successful i enjoyed making the prototypes
i had a look on the on the web uh to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls<q>uh there 's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control<q>so it 's one that 's got lots of buttons
we could just have the logo in yellow<q>audi audio settings and screen settings<q>just like yellow with the r _ r _
they have two remotes ? yeah<q>and everybody is using right-handed mouse<q>i have one thing about it
and we have to do it on a scale of one to seven<q>r _ s _ i _ is it good against ? yes<q>and seven being as in it does n't fit the criteria
so are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as ca n't we have different colours in the remotes<q>i i kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background<q>so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein
um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ? could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? um couple main ones being like<q>like that 's a f shape of a fruit<q>or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits
you have to make it new<q>like it does n't have to be<q>so is is the advantage of bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other that would mean you 'd need a television that has bluetooth in it
we 're gon na make a new remote control that 's um original<q>and we 're going to do individual work on that and then meet<q>get the actual schematics of the remote
but we think it 's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different<q>the thumb button is the power button<q>you 'll see what a nice thing we have going here
that one ? the only break-down that i was given in terms of age was the voice activation so it 's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that 's a good idea<q>if we 're gon na say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically<q>that 's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway
so i just wan na rather than going uh miss marketing and miss this and miss that wanted to know your names again<q>um this is gon na go a lot better than the last meeting<q>it 's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now
we 're not doing d _ v _ d _<q>what i 've just found out from the board but it needs to be television only<q>and it has to have the slogan
here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype i finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my it means i 'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting<q>the u _ i _ d _ and the i _ d _ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at<q>that would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users
i 'll give it a two<q>do we feel it 's very easy to use ? two<q>feel good meaning what ? physically
i 'm gon na describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device<q>we can then design the features around the concept<q>this is an an ipod from apple
the alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control<q>i think that 's that 's one way to go<q>so you 'd be advocating an l _ c _ d _ then ? we 'd either have a small l _ c _ d _ display on the device itself
we want them rubber as well probably<q>but then the buttons will be in special colours ? special form ? i think they 're fine<q>and it was rubber and special colour
does n't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything<q>then all the v _ c _ r _ stuff was here<q>it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes
you tape to your to your t _ v _ um that when you press it a little light beep goes off ? i think it would be difficult technologically<q>it 's gon na be somewhere that it can be seen<q>there might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something
we 're going for a basic television remote<q>but it could come in different colours and have the r _ r _ colours just somewhere<q>uh and that would be infra-red
it was inspired by the potato<q>you tape to your to your t _ v _ um that when you press it a little light beep goes off ? i think it would be difficult technologically<q>but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost
just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um<q>what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like um i hate when there 's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the t _ v _ 'cause i feel like you end up with multimedia overload<q>i could i 'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls
i guess now we just go to the project evaluation basically i was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product 's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do<q>does it respond to voice recognition ? um<q>are technologies up to where we hoped they would be is the design what we wanted it to do ? and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? um
but there 's two possible ways<q>it 's gon na be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this<q>um this is particularly geared towards children
touch screen equals many chips which equals many euro<q>i say that we provisionally go with the touch screen i mean<q>that 's just an estimate though
do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote<q>so seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly<q>for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab
we 'd either have a small l _ c _ d _ display on the device itself<q>or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television there 's no point having a television that you ca n't tune or that you ca n't set the contrast<q>so we need to find a way of including these somehow
could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? um couple main ones being like<q>um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ? could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? if it 's latex if it 's latexy my understanding of a latex case is that it 's in fact hard to protect stuff inside<q>like that 's a f shape of a fruit
is the project evaluated ? yes<q>let 's move on to the project evaluation<q>if i 'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables
the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality<q>i was i was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes<q>and so in the research that i was doing there 's basically two types of remotes
leather options or wood options or something as far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case<q>tomato shaped remote controls or anything<q>basically i was looking at what 's going on in the remote control market right now and what 's going on in other design fields
we ca n't kind of build it into other uh products<q>maybe like an l _ like a touch screen type of remote ? i think<q>like the faces that you can buy for phones
but a p a pen with a camera on it<q>i think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that<q>i i think um i just wan na put in as project manager the you know
so um i think maybe uh two batteries<q>i 'm gon na draw it on the board then<q>and still have it be operational ? it 's never gon na be more than it 's never gon na be
now we have courtney with the functional requirements<q>seventy five percent think they 're ugly<q>yet it needs to be high-tech looking
what about the just developed uh sample sensor ? i 'm just guessing<q>a it just gives you a verbal response<q>so that might be an idea of using the rubber
if we 're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things<q>are we going to use scroll buttons ? rubber buttons ? um it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber 'cause since we 're probably gon na be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case i think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons have we decided that we are gon na go with different style cases for different people ? because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit obviously<q>although i 'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions
um basically wan na send messages uh to a television set<q>uh switch to the next channel<q>here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation
and maybe a menu button and so forth<q>are they always gon na wan na use the voice recognition i think we 're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people<q>use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote
we need a chip that works well with the user interface<q>what we 're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function<q>this is our working design presentation
i 'm gon na talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um<q>a way i 'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product<q>it 's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television
um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery<q>a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches<q>like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power
so just have a call button<q>just have like eight thousand buttons and you 're like<q>i think one thing is that it should be easy to find i mean you always know where your t _ v _ is
does n't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything<q>if it 's just a television then that it 's a bit simpler<q>then all the v _ c _ r _ stuff was here
we 're gon na look a little bit at trend watching<q>shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there 's a preference for spongy<q>that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted
so i 'm continuing with the user interface uh topic<q>they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an m _ p _ three player like ipod<q>uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products
everybody 's used to using changing the channel<q>and pretty much they all think they 're hideous and not very useful<q>but the primary uses are really really basic
it would be nice for changing the volume<q>do we want a scroll wheel<q>or is it li more like a scroll thing ? i love the idea of the wheel like the ipod
um remote control works as follows<q>i 'm gon na turn over to the industrial designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation we 're gon na have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project<q>a user interface controls the chip
i ki i kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial<q>if we do a voice-activated locator<q>we 're gon na be looking at a more substantial chip
here 's a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today<q>has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses<q>having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh i again if we go with touch screen i do n't think that 's a big issue
people are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and i think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there 's too many buttons<q>um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly<q>people are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote
and the just the mute button<q>you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of t _ v _ and if you have whatever associated with t _ v _ the d _ v _ d _ player<q>we should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control
we have a couple new requirements but we 're not gon na work with teletext we did n't bring it up yet<q>because it 's gon na add too much to the price<q>are we gon na use that as one of our functions ? i i would say no
the main elements of remote controls in general<q>the circuit board with the chip and the battery<q>we could do a flat sh a flat case
do we want a scroll wheel<q>it would be nice for changing the volume<q>i love the idea of the wheel like the ipod
we 're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that 's curved and um we 're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu<q>we 're gon na use a kinetic battery um<q>we made three different prototypes our colours not are not fixed
is it functional ? i think it 's extremely functional<q>does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ? is it gon na be yellow ? we might wan na keep it yellow<q>i think i 'm leaning towards the potato
first we wan na know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective<q>and a design in and the outside in yellow<q>is it functional ? i think it 's extremely functional
the excel thing is pretty cool<q>what did i get through the corporate website ? it 's just inspiration about circuit boards<q>i did n't even think about adding slides
so it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market<q>you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted<q>so maybe this we should look into this younger demographic
there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer<q>our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources<q>it 's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running
based on what nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um i think<q>now we 're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on<q>and they said they wanted voice recognition
we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out<q>as far as the uh whole visible light thing<q>but i wrote the uh the company 's name on the telephone screen
what we need to discuss now is the finance of it<q>it 's a solar cell thing with a back-up battery ? the voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area<q>push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we 've got two push button interfaces and s i guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well
my one my one criticism is that we did n't have enough colours to work with<q>it 's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff<q>yeah re i thought it was like really creative actually




















kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it
so that we 'd be looking for the younger end
it has to have big user-friendly buttons
for u _ i _ d _ the technical functions design
well shall we look into that and just get back together
i guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever
we need the user requirements from the manag marketing expert
wan na make this um selling price of twenty five euros
you two are going to be playing with play-dough
but the television would be the display we actually use the television
eleven divided by eleven 's one so equals average of one
um your individual assignments are for um kate to do the components
it is gon na be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy
so so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back
we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something
um so everyone 's gon na go finish their questionnaire
and you 're gon na be doing protu product evaluation
and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility
so then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range
and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design
um the production is to only cost twelve and a half euros per item
um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys
so we 've got um the working design for i _ d _
we 've all got a note of it 's thirteen point seven
but that they want this remote control to only be for t _ v _
to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey
we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million euros
f for the next meeting kate will be looking at the the the s the look
so the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it 's at all possible
it looks like it single curve<q>you can do a banana in single curve
we could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume
and there 's no reason why we ca n't introduce um interchangeable uh covers
and we 've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary
and we 've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary
and this remote control has to be sold um we 're to sell it for twenty five euros
and they actually want a look and feel design<q>uh steph gets the user interface design
um the two of you get to play with a pla modelling clay um to do a prototype
like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it 's then it can live anywhere
powerpoint or any of this stuff<q>well i 'm not a big fan of any microsoft
and they actually want a look and feel design
but what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda
will be worked on the next thirty minutes<q>u _ i _ d _ the technical functions design will
just that sort of like joystick flat touch thing<q>like it could be a cool sort of you know
okay we have to fill in all this stuff<q>so i guess we 're supposed to write final reports
um and the total cost has been calculated as nine pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed
this is the first meeting uh for developing our<q>if everyone could go around and explain their role and um
do we have um ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ?
but on this basic one i 'm reckoning that we 're going for the basic model to be discussed here
and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five euro um
do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall we probably leave that
um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly<q>we 're looking at extreme simplicity
and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make ipod covers<q>so they kinda just stretch over
i was just wondering if that 's the um if fifty percent is normal um i would think would be more like sixty percent
i mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something<q>we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something
we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour<q>so i think if they were just all small round blue buttons
and so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic<q>just kind of a light non-descript grey
and infra-red um has been used quite successfully<q>i 've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote
i 'd like push buttons with<q>that will correspond to a menu on the screen<q>left and right with enter in the middle
same with conceptual design and detailed design<q>what kind of functional design we want to use<q>we can come together in a meeting and
the prototype making was very creatively stimulating it was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute<q>i thought we all worked very well together
numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together i 'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers
and like if the if the phone 's under the couch<q>you do n't need a light<q>you might not see the light
and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years
so i guess we 're supposed to write final reports<q>or is that just me ?<q>all of us ? i do n't know
the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet
and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ?<q>shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we 've got it now first
you 'd want it narrower than a mouse though<q>i was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape that 's almost like a mouse
there was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight<q>it looks like it single curve<q>you can do a banana in single curve
i 'll just review what we did in our last meeting<q>under marketing we targeted our audience<q>then we considered some design options with how it should look
um and also we should note that if we want an ipod-style wheel button<q>it 's gon na require a m qu slightly more expensive chip
do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside
do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside
then i think that we 've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting<q>do n't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary
apple machine and they have like the blueberry<q>like all the colours are named after fruits
um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it 's it 's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves
so maybe just a simple push button<q>so did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply ?<q>so we 're just gon na have the the rubber buttons
uh then when we come back after lunch we 'll have thirty minutes of individual work<q>so think about the things we 've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting
say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions<q>maybe that could be a little apple<q>and then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit
it actually has a sort of um stick on badge you could have your company badge and logo<q>i mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you 've got there
which would effectively be a stick-on badge<q>but you 've got the company logo on there<q>so whether whether that 's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity
and i think we 've come up with a product that 's fun and meets all the criteria<q>'cause i mean we 've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory
i mean i i still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself<q>we do n't have to have rubber buttons<q>and the buttons wha what is the buttons made of
so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be on the basis that if we 've got if we 're catering to the whole age range<q>you want something that 's easy to do
we 've got a rubber uh case materials supplements
so do we wan na go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone<q>so it would be a two part package
um and we also talked about materials we 'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary<q>last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that
and on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that 's on there<q>oh so so you 're saying the squishy part 's like detachable
specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach<q>for u _ i _ d _ the technical functions design
and and andrew of course the the product evaluation<q>and um andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control
we did find a new idea<q>especially not could got voice recognition computers<q>i mean sort of a kinetic remote control
personal music devices and all that<q>although they they may be buying um<q>or are they making purchasing decisions ? bu but what i was gon na say was
we uh are to get acquainted<q>i 'm the user interface designer<q>so does everyone want to say who they are ? i 'm robin
also our remote should be used only for television<q>um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this<q>and then i just wan na mention some new project requirements that came in
does anyone have costs on the on the web ? all it said was it gave sort of relative<q>it did n't give me any actual cost<q>but we need to find cost
shall we go for single curve<q>it seems like you 're gon na have rubber cases<q>yeah 'cause we wan na incorporate a bit of colour if we can
the uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design<q>uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production<q>uh what it uh what it must actually do
um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve euros fifty ? um manufacturing did n't actually give attach any prices to any of this<q>i 'm afraid i do n't have that information available
um the production is to only cost twelve and a half euros per item<q>we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold um we 're to sell it for twenty five euros
how do i put this so what happens it does n't work ? could you just plug it back into hers the cable might be a little loose or something<q>okay so now i need to press f _ eight<q>what is it ? what 's function ?
by the fact that we 've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source<q>i switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor
it 's better than my idea about solar<q>solar may not be so good when you 're watching t _ v _ in the night<q>that would be too heavy and it 'd cost too much
you know actually our our new project requirements<q>i 'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for d _ v _ d _ or just not internet type things<q>so i 'll i 'll check that and update you on the next
what if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ? 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold<q>although the broccoli is quite comfortable<q>like it 's an awkward position
what if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ? 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold<q>although the broccoli is quite comfortable<q>like it 's an awkward position
what if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ? 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold<q>although the broccoli is quite comfortable<q>like it 's an awkward position
rather than the uh the the traditional um something like this shape<q>we 're looking at a radically different shape<q>sort of something that you can that 's sort of a more vertical shape
we 're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff<q>you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons<q>i think we d i think we decided that w we 're actually going down both routes
a lot longer than an off the shelf chip<q>maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost<q>inevitably a b a custom design chip is gon na be more expensive
uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands uh this is the power key<q>uh that 's the little menu key<q>on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda
and uh kate and kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at<q>um and actually put what we 've discussed into something uh i was gon na say concrete
so decide we 've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it<q>how much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? if the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough
our next meeting will be in half an hour<q>will be worked on the next thirty minutes<q>u _ i _ d _ the technical functions design will
i guess we 're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of i felt like i was off-task all the time<q>what do you guys think of the pens ? they 're kinda hard to write with though
then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the t _ v _ but also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out
is whether we want to have v _ c _ r _ capabilities<q>i mean it 's gon na be d _ v _ d _ type<q>and and if we 're if we 're targeting young professionals and teenagers
well the locator is just chip that 's inside there<q>and the beeper 's also inside there too somewhere so you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed<q>yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset
we 've got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail<q>needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly<q>um then we 'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised
there were six true or ones<q>two s almost true or close to true<q>the average evaluation score is one point eight eight
uh then when we come back after lunch we 'll have thirty minutes of individual work<q>i do n't think it 's the wheel dealy<q>but the only thing is like
the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote<q>it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function<q>i think because there 's already um very good voice recognition technology out there
it 's a slightly curved around the sides<q>by the fact that we 've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source<q>and did we make it a cherry officially ?
and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility so if we were uh definitely gon na go with the the voice option we 'd probably have to design um our own chip<q>given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that it 's it 's never been done before<q>uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons
volume and everything else is is uh up to the designers<q>i think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist<q>that 's looking at age groups
s s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it um and has quite a you know<q>really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum<q>but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design
welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings the um th the the minutes of the last meeting uh i think we 'll take those as read
is this a mun multi-functional one i think you just said at the start it was a television remote control<q>so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise<q>i 'm not exactly clear on what we 're designing the rem remote for
we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million euros so we 're we 're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet and and we 're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent<q>it needs to cost twelve euros fifty to make
i mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something<q>and that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one<q>maybe other ones could be something else shaped
so i guess we have to look into the<q>and if that 's oh how they make the menu show up on the t _ v _ ? i believe it 's ins it 's got ta be inside the t _ v _<q>and then there 's also the concern about you know um how do you get to the menu if you wan na change the brightness of your television
i 'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers<q>you want something that 's easy to do<q>so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be on the basis that if we 've got if we 're catering to the whole age range
which wa uh is in the shape of banana<q>because we did make a another one<q>uh i had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic
we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber<q>we could make it that shape but just have different colours<q>i bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too
we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber<q>we could make it that shape but just have different colours<q>i bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too
did you get told what the company colour is or i 'm still not quite sure we 've established that<q>so long as our company 's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline<q>it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product
i think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four<q>well the worst ones were three point one<q>you could make the touch pad in th in different shapes
and um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria<q>i thought it was the other way round too<q>um we can do it separately and then discuss it we 'll just go in a circle
remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly and last but not least<q>the the remote control needs to be original<q>it it must make the company money
so we 've got new project requirements<q>um relating to the remote being only for t _ v _<q>right and the corporate image was the uh final thing
so anything that uh is to be added<q>and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out<q>such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is is critical
so anything that uh is to be added<q>such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out<q>s but probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras
it 's a television remote control<q>as a team we 're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control<q>to a generation that does n't want a simple plain kind of
but what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda if you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you 're actually holding in your hand<q>and then you could have like the banana squishy thing<q>oh so so you 're saying the squishy part 's like detachable
does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ? um<q>personal music devices and all that<q>although they they may be buying um
so they kinda just stretch over<q>and so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic<q>just kind of a light non-descript grey and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make ipod covers
is this a mun multi-functional one i think you just said at the start it was a television remote control<q>i 'm not exactly clear on what we 're designing the rem remote for<q>so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise
so i did some research on the internet the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users<q>um commands and mechanisms for the operation<q>and there 're just kind of a variety of choices
the the costings uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five i i think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget
from the website it looks it 's quite innovative<q>i think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project<q>i mean a remote control is n't the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing
we need to go fruit and vegetables<q>our fashion-watchers in milan and paris have decided<q>should we print the fruit stuff
the digital pens and all that kind of good things<q>i 'm not sure all the wires are really great though<q>and i 'd never heard of the kinetic energy before
and i did n't really like the powerpoint presentations<q>you guys had access to like they 'd put send you to sites and stuff yeah well mine was mostly made up but it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um<q>but l but uh i di i thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like it was kinda like okay
everybody 's supposed to try out the whiteboard<q>you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal<q>why do n't you try it first
i think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we 'll call it the banana<q>so what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two but that is n't actually recognisable as a banana<q>and of the two i really like i m i like the banana
so our design looks something like this<q>and then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them<q>according to your to suit your living room or whatever
which is even less than twelve point five<q>um if you wan na look in your project documents folder<q>which means we 'd be making even more of a profit
uh we actually had an option of batteries<q>i think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case<q>but dynamo the the fact with dynamo is
like all the colours are named after fruits<q>apple machine and they have like the blueberry<q>and on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that 's on there
uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and uh uh let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here<q>um in fact i suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires<q>um probably a duck uh 's horses
i think we 've actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um<q>kate and kendra now go away and uh pa play play with a bit of plasticine or play-dough<q>um and actually put what we 've discussed into something uh i was gon na say concrete
i i think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic<q>you were saying that the kinetic would be useful<q>i i in terms of workability
that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button<q>so if we 've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons<q>um then we 'd have to get a a more costly circuit board
um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design<q>be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them<q>um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up
if you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you 're actually holding in your hand<q>and then you could have like the banana squishy thing<q>and on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that 's on there
work has been done on uh this uh project where by um twenty five euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price<q>so we 're looking to sell internationally<q>and therefore making a profit margin of uh well not actually a profit margin it 's uh because obviously you 're gon na have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh from that to give you your profit margin per unit
standard parts include the buttons and the wheels<q>we should n't have a rubber case<q>and the rubber case requires rubber buttons
the detailed ones would be sort of brightness<q>saying that you want that particular thing tuned in<q>um are we gon na have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick
so we 'd have a simple circuit board and i do n't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it<q>but the way that i interpret that um it does n't seem to send out a signal to the telly<q>it 's it 's just an addition thing but maybe we maybe we 'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later
um we 're the new group uh to create a new remote control for real reaction<q>um this is the kick-off meeting for the day<q>discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total
i have been influenced by pictures of ipods<q>and uh and i definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber<q>i suppose rubber is the closest to spongy
i 'm going to draw a butterfly<q>right now it is an elk<q>i think my favourite animal would be a dog
the the costings uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five uh but i thi i think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we 've got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we ca n't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give
w welcome to the the first meeting of uh real reaction 's uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control<q>taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that 's possible for everybody<q>uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company
right so everyone 's to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there<q>so we 've got tool training<q>i guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works
press power again and use that as an enter um then you 'd have to have an off te off key<q>power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key<q>and so maybe um when you press power
um and the means for like the materials we used<q>powerpoint or any of this stuff<q>how convenient were they ? well i 'm not a big fan of any microsoft
i 'm the industrial designer and i 'll just be i guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control<q>what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view
welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group<q>mm that it it gets lost<q>um i 'll briefly go through the uh notes of the of the last meeting we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour
and it 's gon na have the logo imprinted on it uh in there<q>this is the one that i made<q>but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus
well we do n't want the screen i guess<q>are we still on the screen idea ? it seems like you would need a screen<q>but the screen can come up on the telly
an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television<q>that 's the components of the<q>um so having researched the existing models within the market
seemed to discuss things pretty well i think we 've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows<q>is the project evaluated ? we 're we 're all happy that it it meets all the criteria<q>um are the costs within budget ? yes
next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that<q>i i have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and i prefer fruits to vegetables<q>we need to go fruit and vegetables
true is one and and false is seven<q>right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we 've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start<q>and we we have therefore in total um we have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated
we are doing just the television<q>um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo<q>possibly no buttons at all um
where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels<q>and then you could have additional features you 'd have model one<q>th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about
right well um from the last meeting i was trying to send you the minutes<q>but uh it did n't work out too well<q>a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted
which is if every time you 're done using the remote you put it on a charger<q>and i do n't know much about what these things cost<q>then you then it has a place
with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million euros<q>you 'd have to sell four million<q>you 're making twelve and a half euros each
uh you were saying about um it could technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could maybe have like an activation um i do n't see why we should n't go for voice recognition<q>so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need a button on it or or something just to identify that you 've lifted it up and it 's use<q>i can i can see technical problems with that in terms of the
if we 're gon na have lots of different interchangeable components<q>spongy is gon na be difficult<q>i suppose rubber is the closest to spongy
the the the battery will last um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control<q>they 'll kick into this battery<q>do n't they have sort of a combination of the two
this my presentation about the uh technical functions design and i basically just tried to focus on um just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user<q>you know keeping buttons together that like close together that um are used in the same way<q>and i think we can find something that 's more fun to look at and use than either of those
so agenda of the first meeting<q>the designers of this uh this device<q>which is to um basically to come up with a new r remote control device
a sort of a an l _ c _ d _ menu for other functions on the remote control<q>um we could maybe come up with a menu<q>that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition
the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the t _ v _<q>which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote<q>okay so this is on the working design
you can do a banana in single curve<q>to the rubber being added and the buttons wha what is the buttons made of<q>it looks like it single curve
so we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions<q>so do we wan na go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? it 's easy to implement<q>to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey
one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they 're gon na be uh there 's audio functions<q>you 're also gon na have the channel tuner<q>that is that is a good idea actually so so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back
this is a meeting on functional design<q>for the minutes of the first meeting<q>um i know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes
wan na make this um selling price of twenty five euros<q>thing we need to address is our financial department<q>absolute maximum of twelve euro and fifty cents
this is just about the technical functions<q>there 's a user centred one and an engineering centred one these are the two different ones<q>this one um this is the user centred
you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons<q>the important ones are the volume ones<q>and the the channel is in blue
we basically have the same kinda lay-out here you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand<q>on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll<q>uh this is the power key
for me to open the meeting<q>um each of you made your presentations<q>then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um sarah present the evaluation criteria
um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set<q>it 's got nice big buttons<q>so that a desired function is performed
if you 're thinking of the design of it now<q>you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you do n't use very much ? um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it 's like a mobile phone thing<q>and then there 's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is
we 're now on to project process<q>having that and the digital pens<q>only thing you find is in a manufacturing process
this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system<q>we 're gon na try to talk about<q>um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this ipod-ish remote control
they only use ten per cent of the buttons<q>um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory custome customers and users do n't like the way remote controls look<q>in order to see what the functional requirements were to be found
we 're just simply on batteries<q>if i get the uh spreadsheet up<q>let 's have a look at the um f finance
um and and they want it only to cover televisions<q>the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet<q>i 'll shortly ask for for three three presentations
like 'cause if you just have like one menu button<q>that works like with a you know<q>so like you 're if you 're on t _ v _
you have a in plastic rather than rubber<q>you could keep your sample sensor<q>you 've actually got three colours of buttons
wherever the remote actually is yeah<q>you lose that and you can ring it<q>we 'd have t that would mean we 'd have to put two products together as well
what if we included the batteries in the cover ? oh yeah<q>then we get new new covers on the market and<q>um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it 's it 's even better
like the buttons on one side for the channel<q>avoid too many buttons and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button<q>just kind of minimise the clutter
uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated uh into uh light signals which are then seen by the t _ v _<q>basically i just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do<q>i 'll just be talking about the components design
this is the beginning of the third meeting<q>the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point<q>um our agenda should be um that we 're opening the meeting
but they do n't look as sleek as other models<q>from looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute<q>th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about
we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote<q>um i 've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market that we 'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them<q>there should be some technological innovation
i 'll just do my presentation on the working design uh<q>the the t _ v _ or the d _ v _ d _ player or whatever<q>uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system
say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions<q>and then have the standard rubber buttons as well<q>yeah 'cause we wan na incorporate a bit of colour if we can
but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important<q>and this is all over the catwalks<q>this is really interesting change from past years
you know how they always take two a _ a _ batteries could it be possible to have uh<q>it 's better than my idea about solar<q>like an m _ p _ three player does ? with that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever
could just buy a new one every year<q>we can have the face plates<q>and uh whatever happens next year
it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions<q>people concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons<q>people people were n't quite so keen on speech recognition
and then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote<q>an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television<q>um the various functions used for changing channel
and one for the d _ v _ d _ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else<q>i think one in b bright colours would be good<q>you can go in and say mute or or volume
this is my report on trend watching<q>the data 's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer<q>and uh the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy
have a a a lithium whatever battery in<q>the the the battery will last know<q>they 'll kick into this battery
but we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme<q>are n't we ? you could have your company badge and logo<q>to something which is maybe more universal
thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group<q>a _ um as uh a trendy remote control<q>um the the the problem with existing remote controls
would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here<q>well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time<q>eight and nine ? i think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough
we 've b built in the the speech<q>i think it made we met all of the consumer uh is it complicated ? no<q>uh suitable for the consumer ? yeah definitely
basically i do agree with what sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences<q>it also has seems to have channel up and channel down<q>everything to do with this has to be revolutionised
which was uh current cost of the competition devices<q>first thing i want to address is um one of the points that florence brought up<q>of the uh of the market
the scroll wheel required the regular<q>the display requires an advanced chip and note that the push button just requires a simple chip<q>so effectively we 're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? i suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires
um we need to come up with some specifics of the components<q>things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things<q>they want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use
it could be a combined remote<q>is this just a television remote ? or t _ v _ d _ v _ d _ combined<q>so i guess we 're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time so uh any any thoughts ? um i with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so maybe we make something with uh easy to press buttons
what what does it look like ? what do the buttons look like ? that 's where the user interface is really coming into its own<q>and the main components in there are the the th the chip that translates button presses into a message<q>we want an energy source and we 've got to think about what that might be
remotes that come with t _ v _ players and t _ v _ s and d _ v _ players<q>would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls<q>something that looks looks does n't look like remote control
these are functionality requirements from the our our guys down in the the research lab<q>took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see<q>fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons
uh you were saying about um it could technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could maybe have like an activation if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say i mean i 'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote<q>um buttons or or buttons as an option<q>i was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use
uh the materials we 're gon na need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator<q>however that 's gon na cost more<q>inevitably a b a custom design chip is gon na be more expensive
the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes and<q>th the the design that i 've got<q>um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control
i think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools<q>one of the the biggest issues i found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls and i think that this is an opportunity to really take real reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device<q>fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons
who 's actually buying televisions or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? we sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it<q>we 're not gon na get any resolutions by the end of the day<q>personal music devices and all that
we got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver<q>they 're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here<q>what the current state of the art in components is
which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing<q>and uh and i definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber<q>including m _ p _ three players
um we 're down to the prototype presentation<q>this is the one that i made<q>i guess this one is obviously fruit shaped
two ? um are there excess buttons ? that is false<q>we 'll say we 'll say uh false<q>i think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy
but we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that 's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is<q>did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together i think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number<q>so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in
um next step is basically the the way the remote 's gon na work is still the same idea as before<q>that that related to the actual buttons<q>we have um an integrated push button
and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we 've formulated<q>incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer<q>say about a three maybe ? product is a recognisable real r uh reaction product ? woulda said two would seem reasonable

















i guess you 've got you know one through nine
maybe you might use a a _ a _ battery actually
are the costs within the budget ? not the original budget
and then marketing will look and see what uh what people want
the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan
um ryan you 'll be working on the user interface design
and that that now twelve euros is the is is the price
and the user interface designer to work on the user interface concept
um the remote 's only gon na be for the television
and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content
you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes
okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh
okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh
so it 's like special colour well we 'll have two colours
'kay then the case is a probably it 's double curved
manuel you 'll be working on the look-and-feel design
more interesting for our company of course<q>to get at a international market
and further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email
um well the most the most costly components are gon na be the chip
you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there
it 's something that we 're supposed to sell for about twenty five euros
with the buttons being grey or black<q>yellow it 's nice and bright
that 's not a special colour<q>it 's a specially ugly colour
if we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent
um we want something that 's simple<q>we want it to be something simple
uh m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need
we put the fashion in electronics<q>so it has to be a fashion remote control
it 's um based on a mango ?<q>it 's a pretty simple design
and definitely if it could have less buttons<q>still maybe the same number of um functions
and ryan you work on um how how well they 'll work with the us with the user
and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market
with the wheel on the top and to control<q>but when the banana is curving like that
it will uh be a an international remote control<q>so really the remote control to be international
manuel you 're going to work on the components for for what we 're gon na use
the selling price of the product will be twenty five euros<q>i think it 's quite good price
i was gon na say thirty five to fifty
alright so based on this evaluation<q>do we average them out sorta thing ? yeah it is one point nine
we have yeah twelve point five euros uh per uh per r _ s r _ c _ we ca n't
we need to know what are the user requirements<q>and first before um designing the func thinking about the functionalities
so our total is fifteen point five<q>you could maybe take out the l _ c _ d _ dis display even
um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve euro and fifty cents
given speech recognition i think w you should go for the less fancy chip<q>today we you can do that with regular chip
for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons<q>and then add a couple of buttons
i think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well<q>i think we can keep the wheel
and so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process yeah<q>but eight months is really long
are we going for the ipod type ? yeah i think so<q>which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ?
first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it 's it 's getting used less and less
we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit i guess
um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers okay<q>we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype
would probably be like a scrolling<q>like a wheel on your mouse<q>talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad
which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television<q>let 's add one of those features and say yes
you will have as the i _ d _ i do n't remember what is industr industrial designer to put um pon component component
well we only have one button so really we should n't be charged
such as the colour and s the slogan<q>and also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product
such as the colour and s the slogan<q>and also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product
maybe it would be interesting if you could look um for the cost inventories of other devices<q>if you 're using speech recognition or something like that
if you do not multi function then there is no p point in having l _ c _ d _
when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap
but it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent<q>but we 're talking about in cost is gon na probably double
you need to record the channels<q>of course it should have a on off button
uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five euros
and then with younger customers i mean people uh below the age of forty<q>but w we 're targeting i think on more on the on the twenty to forty group
okay so we can get rid of it i think
and also um i will ask the market expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements<q>what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user
so i 'd say what we 're stuck with really is um the basic battery<q>energy source i think we 've
so so i will ask the industrial designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed<q>okay so try to find that for next meeting
and um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit<q>a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ?
so have a wheel for incremental<q>maybe we can include that also<q>have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed i would say the wheel is better
i think we can keep the wheel chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use<q>i think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well
buttons are accessible from your thumb<q>and we have the company logo here it 's in the middle of one of the little r _ s<q>and then the other one is the power
try to create something new and to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that do n't exist in the mm existing remote controls now
and also the remote control will only be used for television<q>you wo n't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that
but we could n't figure out what button is important enough to put there<q>so you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where 's my remote
and of course i did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon<q>and it 's a little uncomfortable to use but i guess it works<q>yeah comfortable headsets would be nice
let 's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two-piece<q>so one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand
which turns out to be on budget exactly<q>my m my supervisor will be glad that it 's fifty cents cheaper than he expected<q>and that that now twelve euros is the is is the price
basically just be working on the prototype<q>and the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh maybe and and get us a prototype<q>uh we 'll accomplish your other two actions
you need to record the channels<q>of course it should have a on off button<q>you 'd need the usual ones
it 's more of a su it 's more of a supplement maybe<q>with perhaps that 's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it<q>so i guess the case would be plastic
we have to ask the quest of that 's uh design to the uh industrial um designer<q>that 's very original and that 's can uh improve<q>okay so try to find that for next meeting
w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that 's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment
the the fact that is lighted or not<q>so then i will ask the user interf interface designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons<q>and what would be convenient for the user
so it 's a good evaluation<q>the the evaluation give satisfying result as well<q>so this prototype is quite nice
where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them<q>and we 'll i 'm sure we 'll up something good you can also browse through all the standards you know
we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and i show you the the working design<q>my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control
and the cost ended to be ten point seven euros<q>because we had a price gap of twelve point five euros<q>we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if
um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive<q>okay when it comes to the chip-on-print<q>the the more advanced features you want
um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap<q>um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power<q>so depending on what we want our functionality to be
so it 's better to use internet then teletext<q>the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we do n't really want to use the teletext anymore<q>because now everybody has internet at home
so right details th that we 've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel<q>okay so we 'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber<q>with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff
so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all<q>so that 's w we should make our our our r _ c _ as trendy as possible but it should also be uh have a reliable image
banana is also yellow so you you ca n't lost your remote control then<q>i think it 's the box that should be spongy<q>you can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company
and when uh s six sit six are good it 's a good uh p product<q>we have a good price so this prototype is quite nice<q>so having this at twenty five euros is uh quite attractive
sh i think there was plenty of room<q>it was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was<q>we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit i guess
um and we 're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme<q>like banana could be black and yellow<q>the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit
um the agenda for this meeting is um we 'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers<q>and then we will evaluate it<q>given the criteria that um that we gave gave it
we uh we will wait for anna<q>so i will try to get my presentation running<q>does n't appear on the screen here
i think it 's innovative to use the mm the wheel because i think no one else has<q>with the wheel on the top and to control<q>but when the banana is curving like that
our uh the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable it 's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it<q>yeah so um taking that away
causes a problem um for left or right-handed people actually<q>it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person<q>instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person
and there is a fashion watchers in paris and milan that have detected the following trends<q>maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form and the mm the material is expected to be spongy<q>uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes
so right details th that we 've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel<q>just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip<q>just so you know i think i mean it was my understanding that before we were gon na stay in the mid-market range
okay so we 'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber<q>i think if you can have the base station with a with a locator<q>with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff
okay so we 'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber<q>i think if you can have the base station with a with a locator<q>with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff
but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside<q>okay so we 'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber<q>just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip
but um if we were to<q>we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing<q>which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television
so here the uh financial objective of our project<q>that is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million euros<q>original i d fulfil the user needs
a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? and um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit<q>with perhaps that 's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it<q>so i guess the case would be plastic
maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form and the mm the material is expected to be spongy<q>maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh<q>maybe pear yeah or something like that
i mean i 'm just just thinking maybe if it was um circular um with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had<q>with the way that was more like that<q>so one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand
we can give them smooth keys<q>the keys is that it 's small<q>it may change the look of the thing also to the people
so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device<q>so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well<q>maybe we can sell uh all that together
and the cost ended to be ten point seven euros<q>for the financial aspect it 's okay<q>we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if
no it 's not in there because i had the computer problem and i i i cou i could n't create it<q>and it 's a little uncomfortable to use but i guess it works<q>yeah comfortable headsets would be nice
i do n't know exactly what the increased cost is gon na be<q>but i have no numbers to give you<q>though we have n't got to a stage where we 're ready to pin down the price of components
i suppose the l _ c _ d _ c _ display 's the one that 's pushing it up a bit though<q>so our total is fifteen point five<q>what if we completely took out the the one single button we 've got on
so i will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board<q>it 's an abstract drawing of an orangutan<q>maybe i can draw like a very simplified cow
because of it 's stability really<q>um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be<q>um the ball is a nice idea so we 'd have to have it flat on one side at least
it 's not a one though<q>it 's all just stolen technology when it comes down to i do n't know that we are that innovative<q>um i would say we 're probably at four
but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a t _ v _ remote control according to new requirements i received from the management because i received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on t _ v _ more where it seems that the market is more important
and um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit<q>but uh give it like the surface of an orange
basically this is about a uh a new c remote control<q>well that 's the product i i need<q>people uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think
one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price<q>do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gon na fit in our budget better<q>let let 's say next meeting w you produce two designs
so i just look at some current designs uh on the web<q>of usually more complicated remote controls<q>w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two
um we 're using a regular chip<q>so we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing<q>it 's cur it 's double curved
let 's start with the cost aspect i look at the aspect discussed last time<q>to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it uh to feel spongy<q>and the cost ended to be ten point seven euros
i i do n't see the logic in elimination of teletext<q>just i i would i would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands<q>i think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext
when it comes to the ergonomics<q>yes that 's definitely more beautiful than your average<q>i mean i much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form
and uh just before starting the detailed discussion<q>i 'm marketing and you are in the u use user interface uh design<q>maybe we are the marketing guy ? or
and it kind of just went down incrementally<q>from the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more<q>as far as speech recognition goes
but we decided to go against it<q>we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger and we we do n't wan na accidentally be hitting the power button like that so but maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling<q>and um there 's one other feature that we were debating
the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase<q>and the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this<q>the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape
we have a technical problem uh<q>could you just describe by hand ? with the the whiteboard ? um i dunno if you can open the short-cut to ami shared folder ? maybe you can send it to me by email<q>so i 'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control
and our corporate colours are grey and yellow<q>i was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements<q>um the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan
possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ? personalise your remote<q>um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables<q>so they at least get the idea that they 're getting something that 's new and modern and sleek and we brought up the idea of having two pieces
the buttons uh that will be on it<q>i i think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting<q>twenty five euro you expect a quite
well the obvious thing is a banana<q>banana is also yellow so you you ca n't lost your remote control then<q>so we will just use a a standard battery ? i think it 's the box that should be spongy
we we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five euros and make i make profit<q>the cost is in the budget<q>so i th i think we can now uh open champagne congratulations to the team
our our agenda is the opening<q>project plan discussion and then closing<q>we are putting together a new remote control
the only limitations i see to this is that we 're focused on television only<q>well one of one of the thoughts that i had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ?<q>they do n't take it back
let 's add one of those features and say yes<q>we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing<q>which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television
and they say basically that the s _ r _ system would be uh something like three francs per item three euros<q>so the the cost is actually a bit more<q>that 's on top of the sixteen
and then when you open it out<q>but that 's of course a weak point<q>d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ?
i think it has to be yellow<q>so with the set box you you can connect internet with your t _ v _<q>does n't need to be completely yellow
now we get to do the budget numbers<q>we want a fifty percent profit on this<q>we should n't be charged anything for the the button supplements
like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something<q>i think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work<q>h when there 's something like spee speech recognition
so we do n't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that so anyway we do n't have to include this feature because it 's it 's not used any more by users
after lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting<q>uh m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market<q>and we 'll i 'm sure we 'll up something good we uh we can have lunch now
ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs<q>i will start by the the basic one that uh fits into uh eight euros actually<q>but uh it 's like a surf board
evaluation criteria is next in line<q>we 're gon na be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we 've just seen<q>so basically the lower p the lower the points the better
next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes uh<q>just just for the next meeting<q>uh i would like to get this wrapped up you know now the basic the basic things
the tool training is to try out the white board<q>you have to draw a rat if you want a rat<q>it 's a it 's a cat
uh i i i it is a very futuristic<q>it 's like uh it 's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future<q>yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone
eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy<q>uh the buttons have are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks<q>so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly and uh remote controls are bad for r _ s _ i _ so you we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah
or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ? and i guess th th the question th th that you 're being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product<q>uh without special or increased marketable features i do n't believe the product has a consumer demand<q>there 's nothing about that product that makes me wan na choose that product over other products that are out there
you have a standard t _ v _ remote where you have just a on<q>this is the standard one with without any fancy thing like i it does n't have teletext option<q>but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows
i think that perhaps the project evaluation 's just supposed to be completed by me<q>uh h what did you think of our project process ? yeah i think we did quite well<q>i had some problem with the pen i think
we have some uh forty minutes uh to complete this uh<q>today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design<q>i suggest we start the meeting uh without matthew uh he 's uh obviously late for some reason
those things just refer to each of each of us<q>ami what 's the difference between user interface design d industrial design ? i suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it<q>it is how the object will look like
and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert<q>i have a scale of uh seven points<q>i made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users ' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings
so so i will ask the industrial designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed<q>what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user<q>the the fact that is lighted or not
the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology<q>where you can program questions into such devices<q>um i was sent some information from the company saying that they
basically we we st went with the colour yellow<q>it 's a quick on-off button<q>it 's basically designed around a banana
that 's the end of my presentation<q>a simple chip is required to operate push buttons<q>we have these very technical um descriptions here
when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget<q>i do n't know if it 'll fit into our cost of twelve point five euro you know<q>one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price
and in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we do n't need and it become even simpler<q>uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case<q>uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way
i mean i guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable<q>if i were to make a decision<q>a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? i would say
we 're gon na be doing it based on a seven point scale<q>okay we 'll say two point four two<q>did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? did we make it simple for new users ? um
the last meeting we went over um who was responsible for what<q>i 'm responsible for leading the meetings<q>uh we want it to be a universal remote um we want to be modern
um i 'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting<q>and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we 'll need to make<q>um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles
we need to have something that looks interesting<q>that was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative people have to then think about it and say got something there that i want<q>it needs to be something that 's very different from everything else out there
our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition<q>it it it you 'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and i mean it 'll if somebody says up in the middle of a television show<q>it 's gon na change the channel
then we would n't have been able to afford that<q>and like solar power backup and everything<q>to go about our design task
we we designed the two uh items<q>i think we can put on the here<q>it is important for him to be here uh
it 's something that we 're supposed to sell for about twenty five euros goals for profits are i think somewhere around uh fifty million euros<q>what they wan na make on it<q>also since we 're partners of the international remote control association
everybody does long remote keyboard type shape<q>we want it to be a b a ball<q>so we 've got our sort of keyboard kind
so you can go up and down the channels<q>how can you change from v _ c _ r _ to uh t _ v _<q>if you have a video or something you can forward
this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel<q>um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design<q>and thirdly the remote would be easy to use
this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we 're gon na use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment<q>the most important by far was the look and feel of it<q>do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready ? i think yeah the matthew it is it 's important that matthew yeah is here there is matthew
welcome at uh at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project<q>w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here<q>uh then we will uh discuss and uh wh what uh what our new product should look lite like
uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve euros<q>because i i 'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve euro and fifty cents<q>do we think these ideas an and my uh sp speech recognition
do you think you as the user interface designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control<q>you think it 's possible ? yeah<q>and just to have uh an idea
i would say thirty five to forty<q>though we have n't got to a stage where we 're ready to pin down the price of components<q>so we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to
i think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting<q>i do n't know whether that 's possible<q>maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow
the first i will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote t _ v _ control<q>a very good example is google<q>it 's maybe difficult to have both
so is the two piece idea out ? well we sort of rid of that because gon na use a battery<q>having one of them be a base station<q>okay when it comes to the chip-on-print
one thing i would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product<q>or making it less b because at the moment it 's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons<q>the only limitations i see to this is that we 're focused on television only
um i had a talk to the design people about this<q>this is basically talking about just the the feel of it<q>drawing on the fashion trends at the moment
i 'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes<q>our marketing expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users<q>i believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be
so so here 's a look inside your really old-looking remote control<q>this is a eighteen pin um uh chip i dunno<q>and you 've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate so you 've also got um you 've got your chip here
but first we will do some uh tool training<q>and we have here a a a a white-board<q>i guess we 'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share
basically we have a a battery a power supply here<q>i would say uh about eight months to have the first results<q>after that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip
but i think the wireless problem is more the um david jordan 's problem<q>there 's a wire with remote control ? i think it should be wire wireless re remote con and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you<q>do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? do you think it will be cheaper ? could you answer please ? have to think about the question
um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control<q>we know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel<q>and uh and uh uh u useable buttons
and also the remote control will only be used for television<q>new information about the product requirements<q>such as the colour and s the slogan
people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later<q>i 'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it 's about what is the user going to do<q>basically the idea is to send a message to the t _ v _ set
there is a voice recognition remote control<q>the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an ipod where you just sort of control through the menus<q>where if it was to have a speech recognition thing
then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control<q>where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them<q>but i do n't think we 're trying to make a universal remote here
we 're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation<q>what new ideas have we found ? well we had the favourites list<q>yeah comfortable headsets would be nice
we wan na small r remote control one side because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed<q>so something looks good and uh is not too prone to get lost<q>uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial
what i found is we want to do fashion and i think<q>the big chunky remotes are died in the eighties<q>there 's no need to have that in the remote
we we really want a l _ c _ d _ other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market<q>there 's no way we can get it in there<q>um or we could even replace them by buttons actually
and this is uh the previous channel which has come back<q>volume control maybe switch t _ v _ on and off i discovered that when i did a quick look<q>not a a wheel but a ball
uh do we stay uh to to television only<q>and our our current customers are mainly forty plus younger people like trendy trendy designs<q>the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you ca n't go back or do we uh uh go further as matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices ? um
but that 's seven basic buttons right<q>this would this would be cutting the speech recognition<q>okay so we can get rid of it and it 's looking like we ca n't afford the l _ c _ d _ display
they have to sell at least four million to make a profit i think w when we are working on the international market<q>um our project uh finance uh thing<q>it has to be user friendly
i will uh present here agenda with with with with slides to you<q>first uh just to mention i will take notes uh of this meeting i 've also made notes of the previous meeting and um i was about to send them you but then uh i had to go to this uh meeting so y you are the secretary also<q>and then uh we will close this meeting uh and after this meeting we 'll uh we 'll have a lunch
younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote<q>it 's a gimmick factor that they like at first<q>like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something
okay so we can talk about finance now<q>uh can be made for a similar price to uh an l _ c _ display<q>we only need the uh the regular chip on print
they said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls<q>and eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy<q>of course channel selection is used the most frequently
people will be using the main functions<q>today we have uh um teletext and all those things<q>we need to know what are the user requirements
the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever<q>uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff<q>and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house
what your what your role is um<q>and the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design<q>i am corinne whiting and i will be the marketing expert in the function design phase i will be talking about user requirement specification
you know a bulb and an infrared bulb<q>you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control<q>i propose a nifra infrared base i think it 's cheaper than laser
so we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control<q>then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it<q>so uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points
so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device<q>maybe we can sell uh all that together<q>that 's very original and that 's can uh improve
you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control<q>uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button<q>but i just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor
so they can choose what colour the outside is<q>a lot of them have the changeable covers<q>going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones
in like on the way to channel sixty five<q>you press a plus button ? i 've never heard of that kind before<q>we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype
so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple<q>so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well<q>maybe we can sell uh all that together
uh something that in a sense will sell itself<q>'til you spoke and when i wrote this<q>i do n't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing
um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition<q>basically you want you do n't want to store all the channels in the remote control<q>if you have a multiple functionality
you have a l _ c _ d _ display<q>you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display<q>giving a cover to that actually
i will give a a five<q>i give it a i give it a five<q>maybe we all have to agree on a common uh i do n't know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f if it 's better or we can choose what we want
you want to have those kind of functionalities<q>these are kind of next generation functionalities<q>video over-demand or what we call it as
programme and operate an electronic device remotely<q>here here 's just two pictures of remote controls<q>the major findings market researchers have said
and we can not add an l _ c _ d _ screen<q>the details of the components ' design<q>um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well
let 's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have<q>we want it to be um a t _ v _ remote or i i mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ? i suppose you c try make it a universal remote but<q>they all sorta have the same role changing channels
there 's nothing about that product that makes me wan na choose that product over other products that are out there<q>uh without special or increased marketable features i do n't believe the product has a consumer demand<q>i give me a lower price
to make it marketable i believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty euros<q>the only limitations i see to this is that we 're focused on television only<q>one thing i would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product
is uh fifteen point eight euros<q>production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department<q>and the buttons are all gon na be rubber
it will uh be a an international remote control<q>and the product costs will be not more than twelve euros and fifty centimes<q>i think it 's quite good price
v _ c _ r _<q>instead of having three keys separately for four keys<q>and uh uh you are having a universal remote control and you want to uh you do n't know really which functionality is now
we need some kinda of power d power source<q>and we 've some basic components that um our remote is gon na need<q>just basically every remote 'll need 'em
you can use a basic battery<q>so here are options for our power sources<q>so that 's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy
does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user<q>i mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype are n't the colours that i think we would 've necessarily chosen<q>but you do n't have to buy batteries
do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? we want it to be a b a ball<q>everybody does long remote my idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape<q>and batteries go weak as well
and eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy<q>i think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed<q>they said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls
a user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages<q>like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something<q>and of course that 's controlled
we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote<q>we want something that looks good<q>we want it to be something simple
uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot<q>there 's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control<q>just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control
the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed<q>and uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um is gon na focus on the working design of the the remote control<q>can you can you get back to it ? the receiver is of course already in the television so we we must adapt to the to the receiver
they have to actually need it as well<q>and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like uh keys like that there 's lot there 's lots of pretty mobile phones<q>so your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance we we 're not building a universal remote
there is a a set of components in a in a remote control the the components in themself do not cost a lot there are two uh different types of uh um two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control<q>electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because it 's easier to mass produce and assemble<q>uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver
were the three important components um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic<q>these are the things we identified as being important<q>ma ma ma ma maybe say say five but uh still i will give four in that case the way we have designed it 's like the surf as you say and the other one ? i think it 's slightly better
we we could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip<q>but if you have the near the l _ c _ d _ you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio<q>that is the sample sensor and sample speaker
people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext<q>some sort remote control that can work with the internet there is the opportunity that 's presented<q>are looking for that 's uh that 's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product
but but but but with the the remote is is used for television<q>it really should be in there<q>but i t i think what the the management recommendation was less that there 's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we should n't have it
we have t we have to change the end cost<q>replaceable batteries we 'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote<q>instead of having instead of having
you 're not gon na go for just a television remote<q>which is a pretty basic function that w we 've opted out of<q>the stereo system and all that
i i do n't see the logic in elimination of teletext<q>although teletext may become outdated w there 's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it does n't affect the price<q>people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext
so our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle ? do we go basic or do we go for features ? uh d does anyone really wan na do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ? well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ? yeah<q>it 's gon na need to be more expensive because of the cradle<q>well it 's it 's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do
ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control<q>you think it 's possible ? yeah<q>because it 's too many buttons and so on























we can transform the double curve into single c yeah
so another important part of the project is about money
uh marketing expert uh have to go to product evaluation
w in my opinion we should have only useful thing
um so you have to work on the component uh concept
and the the marketing expert will do the first project evaluation
mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty euros maximum
but if we select the hand dynamo it 's okay
i think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller
an but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button
which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million euros
which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million euros
so each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform
we expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty euro
the last point we decided it 's infra-red
the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control
the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control
and uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world
and uh our m market expert sammy benjo uh on the trend watching
the user interface uh uh mana uh manager will work on the user interface device
maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ?
so we should target selling price of twenty-five euro for this remote control
so we should target selling price of twenty-five euro for this remote control
and um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do
uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay
it will be about the conceptual design uh<q>so today is um our third meeting
uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control
you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control
so uh the the industrial manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design
um mark the user interface design<q>which i which are for rama uh wil design
is this a stand-alone unit that we 're gon na be selling ?
i mean there 's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere
google and fancy ? so maybe we 'll just focus on the google controller plus the fancy controller
so so we keep all these all these buttons<q>so we 've got channel and volume
and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to t _ v _
uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five euro euro
maybe yeah even we can change colours<q>no ? like the phones and these things we c yeah
uh of course the u _ i _ d _ mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept
is there enough room for creativity ? yeah<q>see mm how are we a good team ? mm
are we supposed to cut things out now ?<q>so think of what we can cut uh here
and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies<q>we do n't go for speech recognition technology
so i it looks like we 're going completely to forget about the l _ c _ d _ thing
we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that<q>if we if we add the time
well we decided against the solar cells so i think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing
which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel
and it should be really small and<q>small also ? at least it should hold in your hand n properly
you 're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons
so i mean if we 're if we 're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that
so first thing is we need power source for the remote control<q>so this is going to be about the component design
well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh
uh i think automatic on off control uh it 's not possible
because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home<q>and actually it 's not useful to have teletext
so if we use s solar cells<q>um where is the sun if someone 's watching t _ v _ inside ?
some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what too expensive for twelve euro ?
i think there 's a problem with the push push button<q>an but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button
that we have an uh an l _ c _ d _ with uh information<q>mm i think it 's what we say
and we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser<q>and then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition
wh what are the strawberries for ? that 's location sensors<q>and what about the strawberries on the top ?
and eighty percent of the people they are always l i mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy
we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy<q>which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small
to work uh in a in a first prototype<q>uh i think you should work together<q>s you uh hamed and peter
will we use only two buttons<q>or or like numbered buttons ? because it 's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number
it should be clear that the corporate image<q>that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product
they are no more for channel or vol volume<q>once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext
we 're to sell two million then<q>twenty five euro for a remote control<q>mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty euros maximum
we just make a small charger<q>you can put it on the charger when uh you when you do n't need to use it
so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the l _ c _ d _ and all the buttons and stuff
pricing is was a factor so that 's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip<q>so we have the regular chip on the print
so you will have baba and david jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control
in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana
should should discover the other buttons<q>i think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it 's easy to make that
and what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control<q>do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ? uh
but plastic is i think is the most appropriate one<q>it 'll bring the cost down yeah but it 's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood
um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for t _ v _
so um you have to work on the on the working design
means fifty million euros is the profit which we want make<q>i dunno if the traditional user is gon na buy a a banana remote but you know our targets are very high
so using some l _ c _ d _ s we can touch<q>so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh
but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control<q>i think we will only concentrate on t _ v _ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah
especially on the easy to use but i d m i think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple<q>it need maybe some wo further work
so let 's try the whiteboard<q>it 's gon na be not my favourite one but the one i can draw<q>um so any of you who want to go
so you will have to work on the look and feel design<q>powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition<q>to have the easy to use
it 's it 's uh it 's about the weight of a banana<q>and we have put these different colours so that people do n't mistake them mistake it as a banana
so let 's go for a small l _ c _ d _
we will get information and then we 'll come back in<q>i think that 's the the things to do and uh to uh reflect about it and uh discuss it in the next meeting
uh you will have to work more<q>on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control
you have to uh work on the look and feel uh design and you have to work on the user interface
it was a little confusion about my uh okay<q>a design is basically for industrial design and the user interface<q>and and you norman ? uh
so maybe we can stay with wood<q>just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood<q>maybe try to mix them these two concepts together
um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and i think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be
then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it 's not broken directly into pieces<q>i guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy
should it be um specific remote control to some specific device ? should it be a universal one ?<q>so um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go
it will be very e expensive<q>but the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer<q>and speech recognition in remote unit
should should discover the other buttons<q>you open a plastic cover and you see some u _ s _ b _ interfaces<q>is it is it possible to do that ? if you see it 's like peeling
and uh i want you to mm work on these ideas and try to make a uh the ones<q>make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we do n't want
we want to stick to titanium<q>stuff for strawberries and different colours<q>maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges
we 're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about uh this new project we 're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes<q>um so i will be uh sebastian the project manager
you want one for for the channel<q>but i think it 's important<q>to have two scroll wheels because
just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood<q>maybe try to mix them these two concepts together
it looks more like a pineapple<q>but i d m i think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple<q>let 's say it 's a pineapple now
even if it 's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping<q>this is a way of finding the remote<q>it might be useful to have some kind of base station
we have to choose one or the other<q>uh it 's the l _ c _ d _ and the speaker<q>i 'm not sure if this is legal
we we might check with our r _ and d _ department to see if they have this product ready for market
that it 's out of date now because of internet<q>i have been told that we uh do n't consider teletext<q>and we have um maybe we have to we say
we are asked to to make uh uh a new remote control for television<q>so people can can use it without any any problem
and then it should be double curve<q>with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we can not have double curve<q>the s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve
then uh there are different kind of chips<q>one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip<q>pricing is a factor for us
just beeps ? i i heard of devices where you just uh whistle them because of the the frequency they they just answer to that<q>you shout and it answers is i 'm here ? or but that 's ex that 's expensive
uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame<q>maybe i think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working<q>and if i 'm left-hander i use this switch to follow the main operations
so in in a given room there might be more than one remote control<q>think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them<q>we would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings
just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood<q>maybe try to mix them these two concepts together
we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of l _ c _ d _ screen on on the remote control because of costs<q>uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point
and the additional so solar cell<q>then it 's okay for l _ uh speech recognition and l _ c _ d _
every design should have a turbo button<q>i 've also included this turbo button because i think<q>skip over t channels if uh
uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red<q>it looks more like a pineapple<q>it 's looks like some mushroom
so we need to close the meeting<q>you have to uh work on the technical functions<q>um you will receive some information by emails
it seems the the first thing that they 've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wan na make<q>but i guess if that 's if that 's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket
can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ?<q>but then we should move to another target b because at twenty five dollars<q>so i would i would like to know if there 's any chance of of increasing the uh of increasing the unit price
but are we set on the banana idea ? the shape of a banana is not it 's not really handy<q>it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me<q>like but like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top
so we have the regular chip on the print<q>make it plastic instead of rubber<q>and we have three push buttons
another thing is the logo is missing still<q>uh f like y we can we can put some uh double r _ so maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side<q>it 's yeah but it i do n't think it 's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere
could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to l _ c _ d _ on the remote control ? the l _ c _ d _ is still on disc is still open to discussion
are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ? probably not<q>we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that<q>what about things like the clock and um timers ? if we if we add the time
and i think we do n't need lighting adaptive<q>yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting<q>but i think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it 's not really required
this is this maybe does n't really fit with the wooden design<q>so maybe we can stay with wood<q>but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? plastic-like
uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five euro euro<q>and uh our expected profit will be around fifty million euro<q>we expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty euro
and uh to uh reflect about it and uh discuss it in the next meeting<q>we will get information so maybe we 'll meet in maybe five minutes ? and we 'll discuss the other other aspects<q>i think that 's the the things to do
but first i would like quickly to uh to decide of to give a name to the project<q>any ideas ? uh the powerstick<q>maybe a spanish name would work well
since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control i think we will only concentrate on t _ v _ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah<q>and we have um maybe we have to we say
it 's looks like some mushroom<q>it looks more like a pineapple<q>so we call it mushroom design
so um uh we should we should keep uh the the product should be recognisable<q>it 's that mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company<q>we put fashion of in electronics
uh uh have we decided that we 're gon na use this t _ f _ t _ screen ? how big is it in reality ? usually when they say seven inch i think it 's the diagonal<q>so so for the same price we have four screens now<q>but i i think we can we can cut it
do they want an l _ c _ d _ d display<q>do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control<q>um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes
i guess you could build that in<q>but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done<q>you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control
do we need a power button at all ? uh<q>should should should n't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? should we make it a button<q>well i think when they say power button they mean to turn the t _ v _ on and off
they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control<q>the more frequent buttons should be larger<q>so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels
they could be chargeable batteries if there 's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells<q>one is the usual batteries which are there<q>when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it 'll be pretty uh innovative kind
no eight or eight or ten hours of working<q>i do n't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station<q>if you are just leaving like that it 'll be much longer
i think you can transform the wood into plastic<q>we could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black<q>an but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button
i dunno if it can fit with the technology<q>the screen has to be square ? but if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches<q>it 's like more more expensive to have shape like that
i hope you 're ready for this uh functional design meeting<q>i will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation<q>um uh we want to know to at the end to know the new project 's requirement we need uh to know the the user uh needs we want to know how it going to work third part uh i do n't remember let 's go for the three presentations
we 'll have a base station extra uh on the side<q>and your tur turbo turbo uh button<q>and and you have two wheels
i think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard but i think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control<q>does n't need to be completely yellow<q>maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options
no l _ c _ d _<q>and also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost<q>uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two
want me to draw my favourite animal<q>so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings<q>i do n't really have a favourite animal
so you 're having the basis station and there is a button<q>if you press that button wherever the remote it 'll start beeping so you know where the remote is<q>yeah but i 'm a bit worried about the budget
um i want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber<q>are we confident enough on creating trends ?<q>w we can use something like you know the whole body 's titanium but there are some rubber or i dunno some rubber parts we want to follow general trend
we we might check with our r _ and d _ department to see if they have this product ready for market<q>but i d i do n't know it 's if it is feasible because i do n't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy
user i interface could be of two types<q>limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote<q>that increases the the cost also
i think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels<q>you know these days we have hundreds of channels<q>for instance if i want to go to directly to channel twenty five
the second 's a conceptual design<q>as usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company<q>it is in three step as you know
my first idea is because our colour is more yellow<q>with the colour of our company<q>and well it 's it 's definitely the obvious choice
so what i have f found is that i think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because i think solar energy wi wo n't work in a cluttered uh uh environment<q>for the case uh well uh i think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it 's trendy for the interface uh i think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons
seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something<q>i think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large<q>but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that
no ? if you use colour l _ c _ d _<q>i think i think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that<q>uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler
may need more than three mm three button<q>but for standard actions you usually what do you do<q>and if i 'm left-hander i use this switch to follow the main operations
who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? i 'm doing the interface<q>i think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager<q>b did you send us an email about this ? do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? or you can put it in the shared folder
so we must users must say i if it 's true or is or if it 's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven<q>i constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements<q>why this strange factor of seven ? because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale
we 're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for the design for a new remote control<q>and we speak about this tool we 're going to design and try to make a project plan<q>um i think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it 's functional design
um we 're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh i want you to mm work on these ideas and try to make a uh the ones<q>so um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes<q>make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we do n't want
we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control<q>i 'm fabien cardinaux and uh i i guess you can present yourself<q>so i 'm going to be the project manager of this uh project
a graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures<q>so the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system<q>the idea is to represent buttons as figures
i 've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our potential funky-looking uh remote control but i mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need<q>i guess you need an on and off switch<q>but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe
it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you 're more often uh things like that the remote that knows you<q>since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use so it could be smart in that way<q>but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ? are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? i just want to say it should be real smart
we are going to have a meeting about the functional design<q>let 's have a look to the agenda today<q>um so first before starting i w just going to uh to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting
uh to choose uh content s or channels<q>either t _ v _ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme<q>there 's a option you can choose
um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine<q>the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator
like uh s simple speech recogniser on our d _ s _ b _ chip<q>switch on or some like the user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume or or it will be something like volume<q>because we have only very few words like like power
we have buttons and using l _ c _ d _<q>you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume<q>and you can choose colours on your day for each day
pricing is was a factor so that 's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip<q>well we decided against the solar cells so i think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing<q>make it plastic instead of rubber
but then uh loo but then i found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons and they are small<q>and then i i look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick<q>so you so you move to the next the next one
so we need to take some de decisions about um about what we 're going to do<q>and your tur turbo turbo uh button<q>so we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis
um well we are going to calculate the production costs<q>we should we should be below twelve point five<q>so might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything which 'll go so we have margin for that stuff
i think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh b did you send us an email about this ? do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? or you can put it in the shared folder<q>i think it 's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information<q>so there are three kinds of designs
i this whole fruit thing with the banana<q>but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana ? you know<q>if you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana
or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help yeah<q>on the t _ v _ screen the uh how to use your remote<q>in the case where they need help
ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion<q>it has to fulfil the financial criterium ? so we are at seventeen dot eight<q>so what i propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven
so i 'm working on the technical functions design<q>switch the next channel and so on and so on<q>so so i found on a webs on the internet and uh and i found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set
uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one<q>so the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet<q>so i think uh teletext becomes outdated
and we need to have the t _ v _ connected to internet so we end in order to access the t _ v _ programmes by x _ m _ l _ so we should have specific t _ v _ ? well<q>so it 's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years<q>so you have to anticipate the the future ? well
than our can handle because it 's designed for a coffee machine<q>a _ s _ r _ has been ruled out<q>so this is out of discussion
that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers seven seven inch t _ t _ f _ t _ screen<q>so there will be some circuit uh for the power<q>uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres
so i think the costs are within the budget<q>the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for<q>so did you enjoy your clay modelling ? yes
and also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy<q>um as opposed to a functional look and feel<q>i think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature
but full assembly we 'll use mainly for titanium and also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or the problem is with this design we found that we ca n't use double-curved shapes<q>maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium<q>so maybe titanium it 's not a good idea
we maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface<q>like s uh you you you say we can use speech<q>i i think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly
i think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the about the design or well<q>w we want to have a new re remote control for for t _ v _ distribution i guess<q>this will be something different from the other remotes remote controls
we are talking about the project plan<q>so what is the goal of this project ? is to design a new remote control<q>so it 's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way
now we are on the conceptual design meeting<q>first rama then mark and then sammy<q>um um we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes
we 'll have um first the project presentation by our user interface designer<q>the first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece<q>so there are several key features of our pr prototype
but i do n't know if the budget would be large enough<q>the incorporation of a l _ c _ d _ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting<q>but most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology
you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel if you want to turn the ball<q>one to twenty ? but this this has to stay on the table<q>you ca n't use it and turn
well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button<q>from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button<q>ask our r _ and d _ department
so so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price<q>you could have um the start time you know where it 's up to<q>so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control
it means that it can recognize<q>is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords ? it 's it 'll recognize uh i guess keywords<q>so i received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit
um so basically i just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we 've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world<q>um so f from our market research basically we 've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel<q>and also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy
that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers seven seven inch t _ t _ f _ t _ screen<q>and if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there<q>we must use additional source of energy
because all the t _ v _ sets will be digital<q>in an in an easy manner<q>but well what about the the new project 's requirement ? i i i think we should give up with teletext
it 's called the millennium remote control<q>generally i developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface<q>i do n't know really where it is
most remote controls are used by more than one person<q>for right and left handed people<q>well maybe it could be a universal design
so we can go to through to project evaluation<q>no we have a product which none of us would buy<q>yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen
but one possibility is to download program information into the l _ c _ d _ screen so this is something else we might wan na consider<q>is really kind of limiting the number of buttons<q>but i think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important
do you think it can come in several colours ? i would make a backlight of the l _ c _ d _ screen with different colours<q>uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff<q>uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler
what i found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device<q>i investigate deeper the preference of the users<q>more or more important it 's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel
we need to calculate the production cost<q>we have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip<q>we can transform the double curve into single c yeah
not teletext ? uh i think automatic on off control uh it 's not possible<q>we 're now going to l have the lunch break<q>then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work
so i propose the easy to use uh prototype<q>what do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the t _ v _ yeah<q>yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay
it should not uh consume lots of energy<q>so i am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use<q>that we should n't need to learn how to use it
so here is my presentation about technical function design<q>they are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves<q>usually there are two different methods uh to for designing a remote control
so i have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the i _ r _ circuits and so on<q>i have only a couple of things because i had i struggled a bit with the software that i 'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company<q>i would like also preferably to use r _ w _ circuit
so we 're not gon na have a remote control in the shape of of a banana<q>vegetable textures and all this kind<q>probably the only thing is a banana that i can think of
i uh i prefer um remote control working with radio waves<q>so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control<q>f four or f six buttons
but it has a scroll wheel on it<q>the scroll wheel could be used without an l _ c _ d _ screen<q>okay so um while uh researching this this topic i first of all just thought of a couple of things that i would like to see in a remote
user i interface could be of two types<q>i 'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five euros everyo everyone will s will buy it<q>one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology
and fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons<q>so we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes<q>and also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls
we have to take decisions about the component concepts<q>just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood<q>maybe try to mix them these two concepts together
some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what too expensive for twelve euro ? maybe i think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working<q>may need more than three mm three button<q>and then back to the one i was before
just keep the v navigation buttons<q>so i come up with a simple design<q>the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator
tod uh for this meeting i will take the notes and do the minutes<q>found that rem remote the remote controls that they 'd used in the past were ugly<q>whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device
yeah even we can change colours<q>may need more than three mm three button<q>so any of you have experience in remote controls ? so that could be a great um application
okay so i think i will do my presentation on the components concept the first thing uh i have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control<q>is it kind of a rechargeable or it does n't matter ? yeah the um that 's the point<q>we did n't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote
just to meet the user requirements i would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what 's the fashion in general i 've checked more than only the remote control market<q>um user really really want a fancy look and feel<q>it 's important that it 's easy to use
and you can turn it so maybe it 's techno technologically innov innovative ? yeah<q>one to twenty ? oh yeah<q>so you can capture s voice from different directions
we should have an l _ c _ d _ on the rem remote control<q>yeah of course it 's fancy trendy and so on i mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy<q>it 's the same menu as we have saw that ipod remote control
is it easy to use ? eh<q>from one to seven ? three<q>the other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative
so um i will talk about the the w working design and and um well i i will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television<q>wha what i think for now is we do n't want to have a remote control w which is wired so uh i think we u we can use a battery for the<q>then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication
we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy<q>could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to l _ c _ d _ on the remote control ? for twenty five euro ? i think it 's impossible<q>we do n't go for speech recognition technology
i i think i will let uh our user interface designer speak first<q>so first one it 's a google controller<q>the last uh concept is intelligent
people do n't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out<q>we just make a small charger because you are using because you are using bluetooth<q>th the f _ p _ g _ a _ will produce the the data to send
if it was change my remote control of my d _ v _ d _ player for a mando banana then i would be more inclined to i 'd say a three<q>of course i 'll buy the banana<q>i find it quite cheap actually
after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface<q>and to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested<q>then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines
uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff<q>do you think it can come in several colours ? i would make a backlight of the l _ c _ d _ screen with different colours<q>uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler
will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one<q>the l _ c _ d _ you know lighted buttons what about the touch scr touch screen ? for example<q>in which which which kind will be the the different bu button
so it switch ons the switch ons the t _ v _<q>they are no more for channel or vol volume<q>so there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape
i think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large<q>then it 's okay for l _ uh speech recognition and l _ c _ d _<q>or so we add also the speech recognition device
that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session<q>people want to have a power button<q>so we 've listed a couple of uh functions
you t you put a lock onto the remote<q>and the third problem was to find the remote control<q>but you can have an button for child lock
you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition<q>most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels<q>you can just uh just just uh speak something such as
you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition<q>but as the um expert told us<q>you can just uh just just uh speak something such as
well i think when they say power button they mean to turn the t _ v _ on and off<q>should should should n't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the l _ c _ d _ and all the buttons and stuff<q>like uh discovery channe like documentary channel
some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality<q>let 's ask people who are users of remote controls what they like<q>and uh they are bad for r _ s _ i _ but uh i do n't remember what is r _ s _ i _
and um i am responsible for user interface design<q>we should only make a remote control<q>the t _ v _ turns on
what we want on this portable device<q>i am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices so now i 'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control<q>like uh s simple speech recogniser on our d _ s _ b _ chip
or we can use traditional solar cells mm and the material we can have plastic<q>rubber which is good for this r _ s _ a _ and then uh titanium<q>we we would like to use push buttons instead of l _ c _ d _ s y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology
currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like paris and milan<q>and finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it 's not so important that it 's useful as a remote control<q>i 'm going to talk about trends and um i hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control
we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables<q>we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again<q>could we make a titanium shape ? i mean fruit-shaped
we maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface<q>there 's a option you can choose<q>either t _ v _ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme
for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes<q>but only for the numbers on the channel<q>and the fourth one was the teletext in various languages
integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button<q>so s basically this deals with special users<q>but this interface are kind of confusing
i think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by t _ v _ programs<q>but i i i think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers<q>it will be difficult to say just the name of the channel





















in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser
our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half euros
the that of course uh i will convince the management to do that
you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches
once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff
it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it
so let 's go back to our laboratory and to improve on the design
so let 's go back to our laboratory and to improve on the design
so let 's go back to our laboratory and to improve on the design
this thing we are gon na um uh design is a new remote control
um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber
a selling price is uh twenty five euros<q>we um for our remote control
so the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one
that brings us to the chip<q>so it 's got ta be advanced
and uh let 's leave it to the ed for later for once production is over
um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that 's the teletext
and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape
so we 're just gon na have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us
we 've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for t _ v _
so so you are the working design<q>so you have a working design and then a functional design
and uh the u _ i _ d _ is supposed to uh come up with the user interface design
um i just realised one thing<q>in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser
it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols
and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification<q>and what we just discussed in general
um what we 're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept
would you mind um at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides ? yes
l _ c _ d _<q>it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it
if we 're able to really bring an innovative product<q>which would explain a button if you press it
the industrial designer that 's you<q>it 's it 's uh mainly technical-functional design
and then um uh for the for the led<q>for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green
and with uh the little screen in it<q>you could i think we n it would be a lot easier to
to come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with ed<q>and how it 's going to be work
but they 'll also really drag up the production costs<q>so think we 'll have to see about that too
i think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control<q>it makes it a lot easier as well
you can come up with the the prototype<q>maybe what you can do is uh
so why do n't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is
it 's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote<q>so check out the corporate website maybe
uh if you need some uh the technical feedback<q>i can recommend you some companies like uh intel or i _ b _ m _
so we make one for the volume<q>ca n't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?
because i think what we 're going to design now is for people above sixty<q>now you 're talking about sixty to eighty for example
but i think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good<q>let me just choose for the battery
let me just choose for the battery<q>but i think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good
and i think we all agreed on that<q>that that 's that 's gon na be most cost-effective and the best thing
is it n the two a _ a _ s batteries in it
participant can draw their favourite animal<q>tool training try out the white board<q>you wan na go eileen and and remember you have to press so it works
uh i think teletext can be uh um can be a function as well<q>but only if uh if it wo n't higher the the cost
which is n't the the docking station is n't even in this c s schematic<q>it 's not even taken into the price
then uh you can evaluate the product<q>i think he can promote the the brand value and the product value<q>l uh let 's wait for the production
it should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have<q>maybe it should different colours or materials or you know
but uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a t _ v _
in this meeting we will discuss our final design<q>but first um we will do the this is prototype presentation<q>this is what me and richard came up with
i mean maximum we have another four point three euros i mean four thirty<q>so we 're just gon na have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us
uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive it 's blue in colour uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons
i mean maximum we have another four point three euros i mean four thirty<q>so we 're just gon na have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us
check with the v r _ and d _ department the capability of recogniser<q>and also the cost for the speech recognition
and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product
because it 's just uh some extra information<q>i personally think the l _ c _ d _ screen we wan na use<q>i think nobody has anything against it
we we just say we just say that 's universal remote control<q>and uh also for the v _ c _ r _ and uh d _ v _ d _ player
things with maybe a little cloth on them<q>and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular<q>they are more back into soft feel
i think it 's it 's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it 's not complicated um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect
my method is uh i 'm interested in what the competition is doing<q>and wan na see how we can make ourselves different from the competition<q>um and my findings from this is that
if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that<q>do we agree on on that in principle<q>like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not
and i 'm uh an user interface and i 'm a marketing person<q>um uh my role is industrial designer and as you already know i am betty<q>i am the project manager for today
uh actually my laptop does n't work<q>how does this work ? press f _ eleven<q>it 's a bit slow you can see
we have to ask these question<q>but but i think it 's okay for us to work with<q>this room is a bit small
is the company company recognisable ? yes it is<q>and they wan na put fashion in their products<q>uh in the slogan of the company
to get uh the production cost less<q>so what uh i will do is i will try to negotiate with the vendors
to get uh the production cost less<q>so what uh i will do is i will try to negotiate with the vendors
everybody 's okay with the changing covers ? i think that 's a good uh good option<q>uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case
looks like we are well within budget<q>um i just realised one thing<q>i mean maximum we have another four point three euros i mean four thirty
the same goes for the conceptual design<q>here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve<q>that is it 's gon na be individual work and then at the meeting we 'll discuss what uh we have come up with
well or yeah or if it 's really<q>i think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap
did we move through the right phases<q>that brings us to the project evaluation<q>you think ? along the process ? think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier
how much it 's cost as extra for uh the display<q>do you wan na take an action item to go find out ? once we get a price on it then we can market it<q>then meantime you can come up with the price
to to add a little display like this uh ? do you wan na take an action item to go find out ?<q>i mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for do you know how much it costs
if we 're n gon na make a scroll-button anyway it 'd be more for the younger people than for the older people<q>just put it on the market for everybody<q>so maybe we should just re-focus
if we 're n gon na make a scroll-button anyway it 'd be more for the younger people than for the older people<q>just put it on the market for everybody<q>so maybe we should just re-focus
because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems<q>but but i what i 'm uh very very much doubtful how how uh far it will work<q>so to get a good recogni recognising system
how to use the scroll wheel<q>if you scroll you will see the numbers on the l _ c _ d _ display
yeah and also more well uh more seriously i think it 's it 's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that
and eliminate them later in the process<q>'cause w our meeting time has run out<q>i think we should do as many features as uh start with all of them right now i think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting
i 'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote<q>but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half euros<q>maybe it 's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little
supposed to work on the user interface concept<q>um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach<q>and eliminate them later in the process
we can make the normal one also a normal light<q>it 's the same as the telephone<q>maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push
the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more<q>you can take it you can put it put it back in<q>for example the l _ c _ d _
india but you do n't wan na exploit uh labour in um third world countries<q>but we can get a production in<q>we 'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gon na get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes
have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay<q>and the marketing expert with the product evaluation<q>you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches
you also have the the the two other modules for the parental control h here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch t _ v _<q>up they come up with their modules<q>we also have this module for uh old people with big buttons
you can come up with the the prototype<q>maybe what you can do is uh<q>how much it 's cost as extra for uh the display
if we do some more research<q>do we agree on on that in principle<q>if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that
okay now on the financing we bring up the um kinetic source so that 's in the energy source that 's all we need<q>simple chip on print ? i guess it 's double curved<q>looks like we are well within budget
d _ v _ d _ player<q>i if we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television<q>stereo and v _ c _ r _
i think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long<q>maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button<q>or pressing down a a number long
uh the teamwork was very very good<q>yeah and also more well uh more seriously i think it 's it 's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that
and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder<q>so when you finish watching your t _ v _ and you the you t you turn off the t _ v _<q>uh and then there 's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger
so how it looks like technically and uh how it look like uh the real<q>then uh you can evaluate the product<q>l uh let 's wait for the production
um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working<q>our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip uh are we all in agreement that that 's about what we discussed last time ?
we 're gon na have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything<q>my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control ? that 's a good question<q>because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television
um for m for me uh the marketing expert<q>a d _ v _ d _ player<q>do i need to think as a user
s s oh i think it 's better to have this without l _ c _ d _<q>what about the integration of speech recognition ? that 's going to be an optional
so no more changes will be made<q>but in the project we have no redesign time and<q>so we will introduce m this model and uh let 's introduce in the market and let 's take the feedback from the customers
i just made a a simple uh presentation<q>are we going to uh this agenda of our meeting<q>uh we 're going to make uh a remote control
so the thing is you can find out how much an l _ c _ d _ will cost and also the cost for the speech recognition<q>ask our r _ and d _ department<q>so for my part i will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use
um uh my role is industrial designer and as you already know i am betty<q>i am the project manager for today<q>uh i think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody 's name and what your function is ? yeah
her speech recognition feature would be a supplement<q>that that 's that 's gon na be most cost-effective and the best thing<q>what kind of energy do we foresee ? i think i think battery
to get uh the production cost less<q>so what uh i will do is i will try to negotiate with the vendors<q>so then we can save some money
i think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire<q>i think i 'm going to make our final presentation now<q>are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ? uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire
but uh le let 's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept<q>a customisable and and um i think we 've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case<q>so the the advanced chip on print is what um what we 've we 've deci we 've determined
you 're gon na have to go back the management and s be more s precise<q>so they they do n't want certain facilities<q>what do they want ? the management says
it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also<q>like uh the remote control which we use for t _ v _<q>at um twelve fifty euros per well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that
so we just can skip the l _ c _ d _ r on the remote control<q>uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly<q>i i think we can speak
i think you need to look into the material<q>uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? and uh what 's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape what we can change is to propose the customers with skins
like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners<q>like uh the remote control which we use for t _ v _<q>it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also
and um and it should have multi-purpose<q>like uh the remote control which we use for t _ v _<q>like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners
if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus<q>it it 's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now<q>it 's i think we 're just gon na go for another standard remote
uh should you put it in a recharger but yeah<q>because maybe it 's too expensive<q>it 's probably it 's still the best way just to put batteries in it
can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone<q>or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ? well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um if we do some more research<q>if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that
and um the the forty plus people<q>the new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty<q>but younger people i think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext
we have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting<q>a d _ v _ d _ player<q>do i need to think as a user
so i think it 's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan<q>and how we are going to compete in the market<q>then it will help me to discuss with the management for further
now we have included another feature that is the mute button now uh we have included the switch on and off button<q>now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button
fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface<q>uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel<q>instead of the current functional look and feel
and uh first of all with your user acceptance<q>i mean my job from what i understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable<q>how it looks like and how it 's going to be work in the market
doing something plastic would be harder<q>i can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset and to keep the design basically sleek and simple<q>if it 's got simple remote speech remote uh control
you can see there are a few cameras here<q>they 'll record uh our actions and you 'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice<q>let 's start off um with a little presentation
but the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year<q>the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy<q>but maybe th that 's al definitely a good idea
what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five euros<q>the production cost are about half the price of selling price
we have uh a new uh age of forty plus<q>i i think we can speak<q>because it 's not reachable for twenty five euros
i use te teletext every day<q>um uh when you use teletec teletext<q>you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one
so i think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event<q>there might be some motion pictures that are coming out um that are coming out on d _ v _ d _ that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it<q>that 's actually good place to advertise it too
i do n't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five euros<q>and uh also for the v _ c _ r _ and uh d _ v _ d _ player so a lot of buttons on the remote control
why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? so then we were thinking about um rubber<q>but um unfortunately that 's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it 's brittle it gets brittle after a while<q>nevertheless um they 've eliminated all of our options except wood
i think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap<q>well or yeah or if it 's really<q>and i i think uh voice or clapping it 's not specific enough
uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself<q>i do n't know if you 've noticed<q>but uh we 're working for real reaction
i think her presentation was good<q>uh any comments on uh her presentation ? well<q>um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there
but do you need the buttons for one to zero<q>maybe we can implement the scroll button ? or a joystick like ? but i do n't think i think if you 're gon na make a remote control only to operate a t _ v _<q>you there 's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible
uh the teamwork was very very good<q>we achieved uh project goal i think<q>without without l _ c _ d _
the industrial designer that 's you<q>and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification<q>so so you are the working design
and um the the forty plus people<q>to make it more like a mobile phone<q>the new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty
so let 's go back to our laboratory and to improve on the design<q>what about the integration of speech recognition ? the speech recogniser is a add-on module<q>that 's going to be an optional
we could make tons of money<q>we can target the real elderly people<q>if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind
um and we 're supposed to talk about those things as a team now<q>yes i think uh shape is one<q>uh one being good and seven being the worst
what i can uh suggest to you<q>to add this feature in this project<q>i can recommend you some companies like uh intel or i _ b _ m _
wood is a lot more expensive to produce<q>or both ? um but i think it will attract elderly people who wan na have something exclusive<q>uh if we wan na choose for wood or the black and grey
then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go<q>i mean i think it 's a good idea<q>if we 're trying to keep costs down
uh profit aim for the company is fifty million euro<q>here 's the project finance um selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro<q>things you would like to improve with this thing
personally i think uh i 'm pretty happy<q>yeah i d i do too i think we worked well together as a team<q>and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ? i think you 've done a good job
well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh<q>it should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh the competition<q>they have to first say i like this
or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers<q>then it g turns to that channel<q>that would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also
at the budget that we 're looking at and at the price point we 're looking at<q>we should be able to make it work the t _ v _<q>the v _ c _ r _
i think if we are gon na use a touchscreen uh we 're gon na go way above the twelve and a half euros<q>uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen<q>um i do n't know if that will rise the cost too much
and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product<q>and according to to higher management the it should only control the t _ v _<q>can can i at this point interject um something ? um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered
it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly<q>i just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a t _ v _ remote control only<q>the um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people
and s uh and so on<q>well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the t _ v _ you can uh well write a code or choose a category<q>yeah i think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included
you also have the the the two other modules for the parental control that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do<q>up they come up with their modules<q>what 's the material again ? the titanium
well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh<q>i i have not begun working on the design<q>and um i understood that that was the project goal
it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols<q>and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape<q>i think voice recognition is our big selling point i think we have to
it 's because of the finance sheet<q>was there room for creativity ? not too much<q>you two of you with the uh last phase ?
we 're going to talk about the conceptual model<q>i just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes<q>we just talked about it looks
the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or but um i do n't think there are many t _ v _ s that can switch channels that fast<q>maybe we can implement the scroll button ? just look if you look at telephones<q>if we 're gon na focus on elderly people they 'll have to adapt
you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel<q>but they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios<q>i think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide
and on top of that the l _ c _ d _ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use<q>i think nobody has anything against it<q>maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition
we we might check with our r _ and d _ department to see if they have this product ready for market<q>it will be difficult to say just the name of the channel<q>but i d i do n't know it 's if it is feasible because i do n't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy
and we 've incorporated the l _ c _ d _ screen on the flip panel as part of the design<q>well then you just take it off<q>if we figure out it 's too expensive
and uh i want to introduce myself<q>my name is agnes and i 'm an user usability user interface designer<q>nobody in the market marketing is uh
how it looks like and how it 's going to be work in the market<q>the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design<q>so then we can discuss about uh further things
steel or titanium is n't really economically viable<q>for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay<q>if you can add other facility
it 's the conceptual design meeting<q>and a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components<q>uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts
management come with the new proposal<q>uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded<q>with this new project or new product
could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep<q>and in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in<q>but it might be a good idea to make a docking station
kinda like you submit a custom car order<q>and then they could submit their orders<q>i think that people will might really want to design their own cases
so i think i i mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case<q>here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity<q>instead of having two mute buttons
that you just have to press one button but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel<q>i never use those buttons to to to call if i do n't do it<q>but um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ? if i use my telephone
uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery<q>nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all<q>uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it
uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control<q>the effects of the functional design<q>that 's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface
i think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long<q>holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero<q>with only five buttons on it
and what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote<q>i would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser<q>this could be uh one feature which could be sellable
uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels<q>you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel<q>i think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide
uh this is just production cost<q>to get uh the production cost less<q>we have to have a profit of twenty-five euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit eu euro profit
take a risk on the market ? something that 's gon na cost more<q>the management to spend some more money on the project<q>you 're gon na have to go back the management and s be more s precise
right before the eur the world cup<q>d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for t _ v _ remote control sales ? would it be the christmas season by any chance ? the sports time<q>i 'm just ig uh pointing out a uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing pri and then to launch um at a a major sports event that 's actually good place to advertise it too
should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include<q>i think we should do as many features as uh start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process<q>it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features
but in the project we have no redesign time and<q>the problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we have n't thought of<q>so no more changes will be made
and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps<q>and when we 're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere<q>and s uh and so on
you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station<q>i think it 's very important in the in the design<q>it should be possible we 're just gon na focus on the extras ? i think so
what we can change is to propose the customers with skins<q>i think you need to look into the material<q>they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh i have a new skin and looks better
we can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars<q>it 's below the the the budget<q>say we start from four dollars to produce such a device
user interface concept and user interface design<q>first is functional des uh design<q>uh the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design
um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or<q>it 's really up the the design that we 're gon na use<q>but it raises the price and it does n't really fit the image
so i think it 's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it<q>but um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles<q>is anybody um really against teletext ?
uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the l _ c _ d _ ? but you have the same programme on the t _ v _ screen<q>according to what i understand from your model is
and uh how about the batteries ? uh should you put it in a recharger ma maybe a home station<q>but i do n't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing<q>because maybe it 's too expensive
and your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple<q>but we need to really think about how useful it 's gon na be so<q>if we 're trying to keep costs down
because more buttons is more confusion<q>we have to have as few buttons as possible<q>um alright now other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now
the whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons<q>i i think uh the batteries will be uh a little we have a recharger in it<q>we can make the normal one also a normal light
so we have to understand what patterns are used to<q>i i use a universal uh remote control<q>to an automatically search function for each television
and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control<q>and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes<q>but uh it 's just a prototype the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars
like before we uh i have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting it should have nine channel buttons<q>uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote<q>uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore
it 's very uh difficult to to to do it<q>i think it would be better to implement l _ c _ d _ as well<q>if we implement uh speech recognition
should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include<q>i think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting<q>'cause we 've thrown a lot of features onto the table
this is a model of the remote control which we are going to build<q>now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button<q>and then um uh for the for the led
we can try to make it special<q>or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem<q>why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? but it 's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it
it 's the cheapest one we need<q>here we have the single curves<q>so maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low
uh uh um i would uh like to explore the possibility of using um alternative um delivery and sales channel which would be um to use the internet for promotion and ordering and then to drop-ship the p product to the customer 's residence<q>you can do a shipping centre somewhere<q>i do n't think that 's uh not possible
uh f i think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget<q>you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there<q>but i think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good
so thanks for coming for the meeting first of all<q>just twenty-five minutes to discuss about uh this project and the the project initiation<q>we 'll have to simply we 'll have to work on it together
we 're making the remote control<q>what is the goal of the project ? uh the goal of the project i think maybe i 'll uh hand out to the ed<q>something uh visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product
uh teletext options are only four buttons or something<q>it 's the same as the telephone<q>uh when you use teletec teletext
we we also have to have a led li led light on it ? ai n't it just to to indicate that it 's transmitting ? red 's l shows up like something 's wrong<q>the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed<q>the method i used is uh search the web
you can use this screen instead of the big se screen<q>i and so it 's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think so for my part i will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use<q>well i think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look but well i think l _ c _ d _ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results
and uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands you you say that wo n't add too much to the budget ? no no no<q>it wo n't uh i do n't think it will be like<q>do you think there 's any chance of um having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ? because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of silly for children
so no more changes will be made<q>but in the project we have no redesign time and a lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped<q>let 's proceed with this model
talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody<q>we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands<q>i think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours
as uh user interface designer i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote<q>and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age<q>then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children can not view that channel
you just plug in and it works<q>it 's pretty flexible in the yeah price<q>you want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you do n't wan you pay less for the system you see
and uh the receptor in the t _ v _ senses the pattern<q>the chip um uh is producing the pattern<q>to an automatically search function for each television
nevertheless um they 've eliminated all of our options except wood<q>use some of uh some really exotic woods<q>kinda like you submit a custom car order
we have to have a profit of twenty-five euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit eu euro profit<q>our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which means that uh if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year<q>so now i 'm gon na scare everybody out of this project
does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control uh if if we want to make it special<q>you can um have uh the basic things on the same place<q>uh i i set something on paper already
i also have uh copied a different type of remote<q>looking for next generation of innovation<q>there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it
however uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group<q>talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody<q>i think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours
it takes the power from a battery and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device<q>in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller<q>like a t _ v _ or a air conditioner
it 's just a black thing with some buttons on it<q>we ca n't make it smaller than the things we see now i think<q>why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small
is the design innovative ? i think so<q>on a scale of one to seven ? we all go for six ? um<q>these are seven factors times seven is forty something
with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one<q>it 's a very nice elephant<q>what we 're going to do first is um you have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen
i had uh to make a sort of a design<q>that 's on on the display<q>they can put the basic buttons
there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television<q>i would give more emphasis on the interface<q>the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel
india we 're here to design<q>take it off and put on another face and then they sold millions<q>it was uh nokia that came out with this changeable colours
and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them<q>i think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control<q>the problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component
l _ c _ d _ does n't work for uh twelve and a half euros i think<q>and and and does it have to work only in english<q>or in dutch too or that 's a problem
i have just brief uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction<q>on the scroll and the push-button<q>this is a normal remote controller
i think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements<q>and uh in the market the people are not really interested with l _ c _ d _<q>and we can finalise the product based on this discu so the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings
uses the infrared to send a signal to the t _ v _<q>the remote determines what button it is<q>and uh when a button gets pressed
uh the older people prefer dark colours<q>by innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls<q>uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room
a selling price is uh twenty five euros<q>move along to the project finance<q>uh our profit aim is fifty million euros
i think the best time to sell it is as a christmas present<q>we should be able to make it work the t _ v _<q>and then i found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible
i 'll invite uh christine to discuss about uh the functional design<q>uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button<q>course i never wan na replace the battery
i 've been looking at uh the user interface of it<q>this is uh quite simple uh remote control<q>use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device
gon na use a different line width<q>you can undo a little uh piece of drawing<q>here is a simple tool bar
our budget was uh twelve point five euro<q>so then let 's come to the finance uh<q>i have some uh calculations which i made uh as for uh the budget
it has been done in italy uh italy and in uh another country in europe<q>uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features<q>the second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative
a _ a _ rechargeable batteries<q>and you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button<q>so we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration
say that we have a seven point scale<q>so and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these<q>on on this scale the l _ c _ d _ remote control
what about your uh the industrial design plan ? are you have a design already on this product or uh you 're still working on the design ? um no<q>and uh how is going to the market<q>and what 's the time frame you 're looking
so what i uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the christine<q>how much it 's gon na sell for<q>do we already have a cost limit on this
with a production price of uh twelve and a half euro<q>i was looking for a a remote control to have a s i have a sales price of twenty-five euro<q>just to to give an idea what the management is looking for
both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing<q>um and then what the remote control should look like<q>you have a much simpler remote control that i think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed
we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components<q>it has to it has to hear the speaker so it could be in the television set<q>in instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition
and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control<q>it 's a very very simple design<q>'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right
you have to be able to turn the t _ v _ on and off<q>the yellow button you have is the on off button<q>let 's talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype
uh now we 're going um into the functional design<q>uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly<q>uh you 're going to have a presentation
in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control<q>uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wan na use and the market we wan na reach with our product<q>i suggest let 's have a discussion on the control functions
uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface<q>finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control<q>that 's w what i what i want to uh uh to do in uh our design
and i think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use<q>that brings us to the discussion about our concepts<q>so if that would increase the price for which we 're selling our remote control i would greatly advise not to do it
uh the help goes to the l _ c _ d _ screen<q>with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume<q>that 's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh you um came in uh page uh one hundred
uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly<q>i 've used a marketing report on uh the site<q>remote controls are bad for r _ s _ i _
but um we have elderly people<q>basic buttons ? that 's the only th the only thing you need<q>uh uh the p uh next and previous
























and then you can and then you can add to the colours
and the production cost should be the half of the selling price
uh the user interface designer has to look at the technical functions
well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure
and go to standby mode when you do n't use it
we wanted to make it from rubber uh got a single curved uh rubber
and i have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes
menu button access the menu in the l _ c _ d _ screen
you all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work
um the marketing expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification
and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty
the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million euros
uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote i think are in my department
um the the the industrial uh designer has to uh look at the working design
the parental control will be incorporated<q>but it must be not too complex
but the voice recognition are not<q>like f voice recognition is too much
uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? yeah
so i think it 's better when th the t _ v _ shuts down
it 's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing
uh the remote control should only be used for the television<q>otherwise the project becomes more complex
makes three point one one one one one one one<q>so we 're better than average
of put it in a recharger<q>so we are going for the for the recharger
uh i think we we got wrong information at the wrong time<q>i think that was the m biggest problem
we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy<q>uh the case would be doubly curved
so the only option is an hand dynamo<q>let 's let 's go for the hand dynamo then
and then you can keep the curve to drop the uh sample speaker<q>but is n't it per remote
with with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing<q>we need one integrated button for everything then
so the games uh are in it<q>but it must be not too complex<q>the parental control will be incorporated
uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you 're done watching television
my name is uh danny wolfs<q>i 'm the user interface designer<q>um my function is the marketing expert
we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker<q>it 's kind of weird that we we get this information now
and especially notice that uh the industrial designer and the user interface designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board
and then you can keep the curve to drop the uh sample speaker<q>but is n't it per remote with the speaker
and uh i 'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to<q>let 's see what we got to do
this industrati industrial designer should produce a working design<q>uh the use of the industrial designer can work on the working design
and we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech menu button access the menu in the l _ c _ d _ screen
so we put this on top<q>and then make the corporate logo yeah okay<q>so on the on the top is better
yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you do n't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow
it has to be twelve and a half<q>so we 're at twenty five<q>you 're going to redesign something
uh uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will all will receive uh at the uh the the email
i did n't get any information about that so<q>but i i 'm not sure what this is gon na cost
it it could be like a nokia<q>so that should be hard plastic<q>just hard plastic ? the case is just a plastic one
to function it it does n't really have settings<q>and you could also touch uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work
but our marketing range is uh<q>so we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh we can sell our r remotes to
uh i _ d _ and u _ i _ d _ work together on prototype drawing on smart board<q>that 's for the next one
well we have n't had time to design that<q>and h how does the second level come out ? uh it slides uh along ?
and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ? i thought that was a quite good uh got a single curved uh rubber
the case will be double-curved and uh rubber<q>in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that with cover is removable
we have decided uh in the the channel buttons<q>there 's a little uh colour around it<q>there 's also colour light behind it
our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products<q>which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design
can we just put it speech recognition in it as well<q>probably we need a uh advanced chip then<q>it it would be would be a good feature feature
and we could make an a a separate menu on the l _ c _ d _ uh screen for teletext<q>so not too much teletext support
if the costs al allow it<q>so we only do this when we have enough money left<q>but would it be useful to imple implement both ? yeah
it also uh it special colour than just rubber is it also no that that 's just normal colour fruit<q>you do n't say here 's green
the user interface designer can design a menu for all these function and i think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the
make it in in yellow or something<q>uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what 's it called uh scroll wheel<q>just like the colours of real reaction
mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are<q>um the on-off button is a bit bigger<q>it 's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel
um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet<q>so that 's uh the first thing we i think we should pay less attention to uh teletext
we 're going for an l _ c _ d _ screen ? i think it 's the most easier thing
but it also needs to have corporate identity<q>so the the logo has to be uh present yeah<q>and uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control
but uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard<q>next thirty minutes to design something so so we 're gon na work here ? on this sketchboard ?
and will they use it if it only has an l _ c _ d _ screen ? but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger
so that it lays is n't curved in a l<q>so you just make the back of this part a bit bigger<q>or ca n't you ? or make it
um was there uh enough room for creativity ? but only the the financial parts uh not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself<q>but also in explaining it to the other people
chip on print with a with a simple uh a sim not a simple but a<q>but the p print plate of l _ l _ c _ d _ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate
hey is it interesting for users if we put led lights under the buttons ? so that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up
f you 're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me<q>so these are the um last notes we i made<q>if anything does n't look right
i think we should lose the ca n't push<q>then it will wo n't uh stand up<q>so we still could could we
and we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech so what does the screen do ? for for the advanced functions i think<q>my guess is it 's it 's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions
uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty<q>which is the customers below forty<q>the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen
or no it means curved in two dimensions<q>so double curved is like this<q>so uh w single curved ? uh let 's say would be a b square box
so the energy uh is the recharger<q>we still want to have a recharger<q>do n't we ? re recharger
perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off<q>if you have an l _ c _ d _ screen that 's burns all the time i dunno<q>power supply is one of the most important things
you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic<q>you could you could use a battery that you 'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves<q>i i uh i would prefer uh both uh too
the buttons will be uh touch-screen<q>uh but there may not be too many buttons<q>we discussed it in a previous meeting
you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic<q>the combination between battery and kinetic<q>i i uh i would prefer uh both uh too
so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen<q>and uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons
yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device<q>for those that did n't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext<q>only for t _ v _
so he 's layout and you 're function<q>is n't that more the the u uh the user interface part ? i think that 's a that 's a good separation<q>yeah we have to kind of work together
the the industrial uh development uh centre and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype<q>and uh will drawing it on the smartboard<q>the marketing expert will uh will uh ke he will be keeping busy with the product uh evaluation
uh i _ d _ and u _ i _ d _ work together on prototype drawing on smart board<q>but you definitely get a specific instruction<q>that 's for the next one
which uh does not make the remote control in your room<q>um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible<q>and i think and certainly for for the for the lower age groups
hey what 's wrong with my computer ? i think you have to uh change your desktop uh yeah my computer is not functioning properly<q>did you plug in the power cable when you come back ? you pressed alt f _ four ? no no no
it has to be twelve and a half<q>uh first of all i 'll start with the costs<q>you 're going to redesign something
there are more people who like speech recognition than an l _ c _ d _ screen<q>so we 'll just have to use it for everything
the least uh possible amount uh of buttons<q>but on the other hand they need many buttons<q>you do n't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons
uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings<q>and teletext is so outdated that it it 's i should not be used uh any more in the future<q>uh teletext but we can skip that because i saw the newsflash
so actually we 're going to create a a button-less uh remote<q>so we do n't have any normal buttons i think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you do n't have any buttons on the s on on remote control
and the marketing uh expert should come up with user requirements<q>for example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support<q>um therefore we have to to do some internet search
but should n't you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it ? and we could make an a a separate menu on the l _ c _ d _ uh screen for teletext<q>but that is not of the question
and we wo n't include a a pen<q>if they think it 's handy to use a pen<q>because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you ca n't use yeah o yeah
so it were all positive questions<q>so the it tells us something<q>but there are no negative questions i guess
but just in two d _<q>i think it 's okay if you just keep it a bit square<q>but maybe you can just round up the corners a bit
um i personally think it has to be multi-purpose<q>uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes<q>uh the user interface designer has to look at the technical functions
um from the finance department i have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five euros<q>and the production cost will be twelve euro fifty max<q>and we 're hoping for a aim of fifty million euros and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market
but then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the t _ v _
but if you want to download it to your computer<q>just old fashioned kinda blackboard style<q>well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with
i i think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them<q>but you 'll ne need several other buttons for a video player<q>and um reserve the possibility to add other features
and um well maybe we can look out if there 's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda t _ v _ it is<q>but have the opportunity to uh have more options<q>th th those things are nice
and teletext is so outdated that it it 's i should not be used uh any more in the future<q>for those that did n't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext<q>but we can skip that because i saw the newsflash
maybe it 's better to to include rechargeable batteries we already decided that on the previous meeting<q>uh we also thought about that already<q>uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop
so we have to decide if we 're going to use real hard rubber<q>like like like a a eraser or something<q>yeah it 's quite hard but you can press it in
always display the primary buttons clear and visible<q>the main concept is um take one big touch screen<q>keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time
uh the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million euros<q>um we can sell them at twenty five euros<q>we have a financial aspect to this project
but uh what i did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder<q>is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote<q>i dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be
this one is for the presentations<q>uh and this is uh only for uh drawing<q>the powerpoint presentations or the word presentation of whatever you uh you had
maybe it 's better to to include rechargeable batteries we already decided that on the previous meeting<q>if the badg the batteries are dead then you can re you can uh change them<q>normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop
welcome to the conceptual design meeting uh uh<q>and we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts<q>also this time there will be uh three presentations
you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen<q>so then it 's uh very handy to to scroll down<q>and i think i would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television
you do n't say here 's green<q>if we lose the scroll should you have to lose no<q>but the rubbers alls original black
i looked at uh some similar devices<q>and um sports and gaming device style characteristics<q>and it is well curved square
i did get a bit more done than the last time<q>and also with i do n't know how to use powerpoint<q>so it takes me forever to get something done with it
uh how to use the things here<q>then we have a meeting to discuss the results<q>um we 're supposed to develop a new remote control
thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah<q>you have basically a button menu<q>i w i should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display
so we have now a lunch break<q>uh after the lunch break uh it 's back to uh individual work<q>you all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work
that we need just the functional display and four cursors<q>most of the time you have one button in the middle<q>i thought but this is really your department
what i did was i dissected uh uh current remote controls and um i viewed how how they w looked<q>uh what kind of components are involved<q>i 'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project
the most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection<q>and other other less important things are screen settings<q>perhaps we should we should focus on that l _ c _ d _ screen
let 's make everything a two have the colours<q>make it make it a two<q>features the microphone 's feature and that with their expectations
uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved<q>so then you have double double curved in some way<q>well we could make a compromise between that
and the new product should reach new markets<q>by the way where did you guys get that newsflash from ? i receiv the mail but you do n't<q>yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device
next meeting starts in thirty minutes<q>the the industrial uh development uh centre and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype<q>and uh will drawing it on the smartboard
i mean we have to drop on everything<q>but but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons<q>but instead use only the up and down arrows
um one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results<q>i have some uh new findings on uh marketing expert level<q>the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent um sixty five
are we doing the the speech recognition ? okay<q>you have a different chip for speech recognition<q>we 're gon na use the advanced chip then
so it 's a bit square<q>but it 's also a bit uh round<q>perhaps you could find something in the middle
adds a new feature to the market<q>you got some cheap uh remote controls there<q>you got a dozen of 'em
um that 's what you will need for our first exercise<q>to do it on a blank sheet<q>because i 'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal
so so here are multiple speech buttons<q>so how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ? yeah<q>you need options to configure it
but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control<q>because uh for example sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen uh teletext<q>and on the other side uh just n uh regular television
uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five euro<q>for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half euro<q>uh ultra modern uh kinda remote
uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance<q>uh this is the agenda for today<q>uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control
we have to aim at a mu at the main audience<q>like speak uh speech recognition and stuff<q>to customise your own remote control
you can make a very sensitive microphone<q>but then you should also find a place you could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something<q>because a microphone is very small thing
little uh little kinda exercise to uh know each other<q>every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal<q>it 's the white rabbit from the matrix
let 's have a look at this one here<q>because recharge is not on the list<q>but but is it inc does it include a a homestation or can we make that for uh h twenty cents ? the b the button supplements
you do n't know how much it costs<q>the l _ c _ d _ screen<q>i do n't have any costs here
uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control<q>i 'm gon na talk about functional requirements<q>well uh some research has be done uh has been done
knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge<q>first thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management<q>uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is uh like that
but uh the two basic sources that i found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic<q>i i ch prefer rubber because it feels uh yeah<q>the costs are n't that much higher
adds a new feature to the market<q>uh so not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a d _ v _ d _ and radio um i personally think it has to be multi-purpose<q>uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose
it 's quite a simple l _ c _ d _ screen<q>but it the the remote control has to know whether you 're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume<q>i think they do n't need that big of c _ p _ u _
i had a i had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh real reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing<q>it it 's just like a uh globe in internet explorer<q>you see a kind of a just like when you telephone
what 's the standard colour ? we have different colour<q>something like this this colour or something<q>it 'll be a banana yellow
uh because i think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen<q>the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen<q>uh and uh the the the the other functions
yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour<q>do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ? well i guess i we 'll have to go for single curve then<q>and uh do the special colour for the buttons
the board and uh powerpoint and word and stuff like that<q>uh i uh have no idea how powerpoint works<q>mm so and the uh about the board digital pen ? digital pen is better than the smartboard
we need one integrated button for everything then<q>the okay button uh v let 's say we only have the four arrows<q>so we 'll just have to use it for everything
uh the use of the industrial designer can work on the working design<q>the functional design uh ? after that we are going to the conceptual uh we have meeting<q>is it gon na be a multimedia control centre ? do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? i think that is the user requirements part
well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect<q>and the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use<q>most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel
it sends a signal to a chip<q>well my presentation is a bit uh sucky<q>which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies
i spent a lot of time thinking about what i was gon na do and then a couple of minutes before this i get my function you know the information that i need<q>this presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause i had n't time to intergrate tha the information yet so well my presentation is a bit uh sucky<q>and well the info on the website which came too late
um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons<q>this the easy one i think we have to to combine them<q>and uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples
we have to put our real reaction logo as well on the on the remote control<q>you can make um different fronts on it<q>maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black
the the the new uh new modern uh remote controls<q>basic remote control from normal plastic<q>it it could be like a nokia
and you said something about speech recognition ? also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five<q>twenty six to thirty five years<q>so we only do this when we have enough money left
the other buttons and on here the top<q>if you make the screen vertical it does n't matter<q>i think it 's it 's easier to have it something like oh a button uh minus here
there has to be a on button on the remote<q>in the l _ c _ d _<q>uh normal on and off button for the t _ v _
first one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated uh second one is also important uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television<q>at the functional design meeting um uh i had an email from the from the management board but there were four points uh which uh i think are very important<q>uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older
i 'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting<q>and my uh function is user interface design<q>we 'll do a little tool training with these two things
i think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present<q>pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control<q>one one uh very important thing i was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option
uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard<q>you know how to the documents work<q>how to select the next or colours were under format a fox yeah
but an l _ c _ d _ screen<q>so the buttons sh should be that small<q>you do n't have to make it that hard to learn or to use
and for the elderly people just plain old<q>like the l _ c _ d _ screen that 's quite innovative and the third thing is it should be easy to use<q>they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow
so welcome to the marketing presentation once again<q>well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect<q>um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public
um what they like in design uh and material nowadays<q>take parental control to a new dimension<q>i went to uh paris and milan for some trend-watching
i think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five<q>we have to impro improve the most used functions<q>i think you will get the most revenue from i from it
they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control<q>seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly<q>but it 's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet
because we are going to look at the finance and i have a nice excel sheet to do that<q>little bit difficult to do in a group<q>and um i 'm not sure if production costs
you will switch to your television and back to text<q>there is one uh function i use uh daily<q>maybe we use this button for the okay
what i did was uh i i checked uh remote controls and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared<q>connected to the t _ v _ ? i actually i figured that would be that would be rather nice<q>and those uh have a transmitter that 's also focused on infrared
you are working on the technical functions<q>we must first agree on uh what we 're going to m going to make<q>we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it
you are working on the technical functions<q>we must first agree on uh what we 're going to m going to make<q>we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it
we just made a word file with the basic elements<q>simply a square with uh round corners<q>uh the material should be hard plastic
and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting<q>and and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well<q>so you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video
what the elderly people liked about shapes<q>the trends from the past years<q>they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow
and i looked at uh technical functions design of the remote<q>with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use<q>of how they uh they look
i said uh we 're working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a to design a new remote control which uh has to be original<q>you can give a presentation on them<q>all of these phases consists of two parts
yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this okay uh we 're still gon na go for the fancy colours ? yeah we we can just uh use this one<q>well i have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far<q>the frame has a special colour
you mean uh these to the low ? except from the on-off button<q>by just putting the volume on the side<q>they sh those should be on top
no it means curved in two dimensions<q>i 'm dealing with the components design<q>uh for example the energy source
i have batteries to supply energy<q>that are the the basic options for a remote control<q>you wan na ch ch flip the channel but you might wan na use teletext also
so we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together<q>was there room for creativity ? mm uh i yeah<q>this this is just the idea phase
we each have a specific task<q>uh the user interface designer should specify the technical functions<q>this industrati industrial designer should produce a working design
that i do n't think that is i had in my presentation<q>uh so uh to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation<q>they already then you can work together too one of those uh dig digital pens or i do i think becau that 's
the pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is<q>and then make the corporate logo i mean this is basically numbers<q>so we put this on top
if we use an l _ c _ d _<q>uh you can just make them around the buttons uh uh the battery contacts<q>but i think we have to make the case transparent
put that on the button bottom<q>do we s keep that ? it it would be would be a good feature feature<q>it does n't make a difference
so we can uh ev evaluate our model<q>and we have to test the criteria from one to zero<q>so we give ourself a three or something
uh i 'll i 'll just explain a bit of the components<q>uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button<q>well uh did the button be pressed
a lot of buttons which you do n't use not user friendly<q>uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly<q>it 's time uh for some discussion
it uh has a new feature<q>i think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels<q>what you think might be uh a useful uh new feature
we have to do the project uh evaluation<q>well you did become more assertive the the second time round<q>so that um was there uh enough room for creativity ? but only the the financial parts uh not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself
they do n't sell green rubber plants<q>so we do n't exactly need the single we do n't need a curve<q>three to drop the uh sample speaker
i 'll be talking about the components<q>you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic<q>what i did was i reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups
uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station i thought a little bit about the interface<q>they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something<q>and uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons
um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting<q>i wanted to explain the working design of the remote control<q>the switch is ter is uh is switched on
in an apart uh in a separate button<q>you two are going to give a prototype presentation ? are n't you ? yes<q>have noticed i uh created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder
we 're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote<q>that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control<q>remote control has to have to have a low power usage
you you can make it uh make the colours with leds uh beneath the the buttons<q>so okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open<q>well yeah the the idea of it was
and top down is more with uh channel changing<q>but just not on the top<q>we have to make a decision
uh the remote control should only be used for the television<q>and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty<q>one till two zero numbers on it
welcome everyone to our next meeting<q>um in the same order as last time ? components design<q>um today we once again have uh three presentations
because we decided to have two kind of remotes<q>you could you could uh change the colours<q>and the l _ c _ d _ screen was uh rather small
i think energy were batteries the docking station<q>maybe i should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision<q>those points um energy question mark
we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users<q>okay to to the to the speech recognition<q>than on the regular remote controls where you have easiest way to to to handle
okay to to the to the speech recognition<q>but you can also make uh a one ? okay<q>remote control has uh colours that different that meet from the results
on to the production evaluation because of the time<q>work now ? perhaps it is e yeah process<q>but the technology was uh fantastic
and th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions<q>uh the case would be doubly curved<q>you can make a trigger button or something like that
uh the remote control displays the corporate logo<q>uh the trends from the marketing research<q>well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale
um what 's my opinion about what 's most important to combine the design<q>so if you um going to design a remote that looks good<q>i 'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions
they ca n't switch to uh violent uh channels or is that possible to use or no ? that actually depends on the television<q>would n't it be better to make just one big touch screen<q>it uh it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote
i think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh tim uh came with<q>and the parental control are well<q>you do n't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings


























so it 's gon na be sold world-wide
uh i do n't know what product evaluation exactly means
some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original
some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original
i was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it
all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work
i think we have to keep the l _ c _ d _
we were gon na what look take a look at the last sheet
we were gon na what look take a look at the last sheet
what did you think about the smartboard ? it was a complete disaster
if we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick
and um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve euro fifty
um i will put the minutes i just made in the project documents folder
the selling price of our remote control is gon na be twenty five euros
and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve euro fifty per remote control
and uh we 'll have to decide s things on our own i think
you 're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the smartboard
uh a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing
but that 's not really innovative<q>because uh you have to shake it
it 's a two point six<q>which is uh quite a great score
because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years
um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff
well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved
do you know how how i can wake it up ? i 've lost my screen
do you know how how i can wake it up ? i 've lost my screen
you 'll see in you email<q>what are we going to do now ?
maybe you can look how how much it is for the l _ c _ d _
now we put uh rubber around it<q>and around it hard uh around it rubber
um the remote should work on different t _ v _ s or even different devices ?
um the remote should work on different t _ v _ s or even different devices ?
uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty
um i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the uh components concept
uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours<q>and also they like curved round shapes
and of course this low part<q>this is the l _ c _ d _ screen
so we have to use the ditch the titanium<q>look at the costs at this point
um maybe sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution
i 'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching
but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards<q>maybe just bring it out in different colours
welcome to the detailed design meeting<q>we 're gon na have a prototype presentation first
oh you always have in the centre an okay button<q>l _ c _ d _ window
well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year
so we will go back to our own uh work<q>you know your o your individual actions
the the easy to use r _ c _ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us
i think we can launch a couple of packages<q>yeah but you you can have some basic colours
maybe maybe like clapping in your hands<q>because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds
if if you look if if this this is thick<q>th th then it that it lies over your hands
soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said
i have a little problems with my laptop<q>and uh s s s so i had a little less time to complete
and i think they 're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user
well y we do n't have to do it<q>but what that would just have a lack of key features
so it 's better to uh put our attention to the the design<q>so you can pick up and use it
and you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger<q>it 's not good to use
and do we even uh prefer the sound above the the leds<q>the lightning uh function ? i i think so
they 're p f uh power friendly leds also<q>they 're uh they 're a little bit more expensive
i 'm gon na wri uh write some stuff down i 'm gon na make some minutes or take some minutes
so it must be very bright<q>well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year
that 's that 's what i 'm gon na write b between now<q>i 'm going to finish my end report
welcome at the functional design meeting<q>and i 'm gon na show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me
the under uh the under side uh of it<q>the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium
just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons<q>i think it 's the same as in the cell phone
and then uh uh ten uh rem a mute and a teletext and a menu<q>th in that way we have like only the numbers
we go with the l _ c _ d _ screen ?<q>and if if that 's gives you a little bit of sta status information
are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ? well i think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes
and only nils well the the well that 's a reason to to to put the l _ c _ d _ screen uh of course on the upper side
the buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times<q>and uh lots of people complained they kin ca n't find their remote control
i think we should go further with the idea of a removable front<q>but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company
so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip<q>but we do use an l _ c _ d _ screen
it 's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions<q>just a round uh button should be the trick
we have to evaluate the product yet<q>do we change the the order ? or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ? finance is um first uh yes
um now the new project requirements<q>well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products<q>and they do n't want it
why why do n't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium<q>dumb remote that that no-one would buy<q>th then you have a ugly
and uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge<q>then there would n't be uh a big problem
could be uh something special to our uh remote control<q>but it only cost a bit more<q>i looked up on was uh the l _ c _ d _ displays
we go with the l _ c _ d _ screen ? uh well i think so<q>and if if that 's gives you a little bit of sta status information
and then the front is made of plastic<q>well a case ? uh that 's me<q>yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote
this new product we are are g are going to develop<q>um and first of all it should be original
the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five euros<q>uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million euros
it 's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling<q>that 's uh regarded very highly too<q>uh the last point is easy to use
slogan from company on the back with logo and logo also on the front<q>ah the logo should be on the top i think
do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple if we um include other uh innovative functions uh then they uh might<q>'cause young people uh like new features
well it 's just uh about our first ideas now so i think individually we 'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera
i do think we have to put that underneath a clip<q>but you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section<q>th that 's a bit uh waste
y hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough<q>but it does n't have a really really tough look<q>so but the feel of plastic is n't strong
um the remote control should only be used for television<q>but we should not um support teletext in the remote<q>the corporate image should be recognisable in our product
well it 's just uh about our first ideas now<q>so i think individually we 'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera
uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly<q>i like user-centr centred uh uh also the best<q>so we have to uh change a little bit uh to that
uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly<q>so we have to uh change a little bit uh to that<q>i like user-centr centred uh uh also the best
are we going to uh do it like uh on mike 's screen with uh one button that says i 'm going to do a t two number digital ?<q>alright so no button for that
and the button that you can go to a _ v _ for your video<q>but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh
i do n't think it 's a very special colour<q>and if you say it 's just a r uh normal colour normal colour<q>and then uh we move the the colour
personally i think we should infra use infrared<q>uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse<q>we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board
when you want an other colour on the front<q>and it does n't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front<q>but you know b titanium is very basic colour
but we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part<q>well the speaker and the microphone<q>are the same uh little hole thingy
we have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape<q>th so there 's this part um which is made of hard plastic<q>and uh we 're we 're using different colours
solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls<q>which i thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah
there 's the minutes from the first meeting<q>you find them in your in the map in the from the group<q>you 'll find the next minutes also there
i had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes<q>the the s the next minutes wo n't be a problem<q>but i 'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too
i think that 's enough for the next phase<q>phase two is the conceptual design
we will see what 's possible concerning the the costs<q>you could when that 's when it 's too costly<q>you could probably skip the recharger
like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it<q>you gon na we 're probably gon na have like two type of materials<q>but wha th our basic idea y i mean
part of the titanium uh titanium part<q>and we thought about the logo big in the middle<q>we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo
uh like just th the channels uh one till nine<q>there are l at least uh basic functions<q>three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly
well our user interface you can uh maybe uh i do n't know what your specific instructions will be<q>but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote
um it 's not really speech recognition<q>no it does n't does not do anything<q>then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left
then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left<q>um it 's not really speech recognition<q>no it does n't does not do anything
the user interface connected to a chip<q>which is connected to the sender<q>and the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a t _ v _ set
the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control<q>and uh the third point there in this uh order if of importance<q>is a high ease of use
so will be p just ordinary keyboard<q>you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the in the shared folder<q>from now on i wo n't use my pen anymore
we 're just developing this product<q>and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public<q>i think it 's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store
so we might want to build in a feature to uh support them<q>if it 's possible within the costs and all that kind of things<q>m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function
i th i thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh<q>and i do n't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions<q>maybe it 's com becoming less trendy or something like that
we ca n't just leave the teletext button off<q>so the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button<q>i think that may be so
and then the front is made of plastic<q>will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ? yeah<q>well a case ? uh that 's me
and then below is the l _ c _ d _ screen ? those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? yeah<q>and oh i think as you can see so
well we make it more expensive to buy<q>then we have two dollars less profit<q>i 'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that 's trendy d these days
it 's uh two and three nine two and one third<q>come back to the presentation now<q>that 's a pretty low rating
now uh we have a product<q>and it 's not really a s joystick uh thing<q>we have the l _ c _ d _ we have two scroll-wheels ? or one ? one
i 'm afraid we do not have any more time<q>so we will go back to our own uh work<q>um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um
but there 's a cost limitation too<q>i think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it 's not going to be a high high-end product<q>the cost price is very low
it 's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot<q>a lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room<q>uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it 's it 's too uh too difficult to learn
we m have to make a new remote control<q>and then after that a detailed design<q>so we will get back th on that
so we might want to build in a feature to uh support them<q>i do n't think people would bother walking to the t _ v _ and press that button because they lost the their remote<q>there 's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment
blinking leds and all that kind of fancy stuff<q>and um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques<q>it should be an easy interface with not so much buttons
blinking leds and all that kind of fancy stuff<q>and um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques<q>it should be an easy interface with not so much buttons
like the the the different channels<q>should be uh yeah well not in reach<q>and uh and that the less important uh buttons
the the con the the the<q>the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here<q>i think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons
uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million euros<q>the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five euros<q>and um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve euro fifty
i know that the younger people will most likely have a d _ v _ d _ player they want to<q>th th the user requirements of the the the new project requirements told us not to but just the basic functions
well i think the meeting will be over within a minute<q>you 'll see in you email<q>you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the in the shared folder
we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market<q>so if we make a trendy design<q>as i uh quoted here from the uh results
uh yes do we make a menu ? i think it will be um q quite easy to use<q>to have uh uh four arrows<q>uh the well um i think separate channels
uh is the device good-looking ? easy to change channels ? the uh device is easy to find if you lose it ? are there enough technology ? are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? is the material attractive ?<q>that 's gon na be done at the end of seven point skill criteria
that 's about uh i thought it was fifty per cent<q>um research shows that they like to have a little l _ c _ d _ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device<q>uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls
it 's still uh an advanced chip ? or it 's then a regular ? the advanced chip was for the l _ c _ d _ if we lose the l _ c _ d _<q>but if you lose the joystick
the selling price of our remote control is gon na be twenty five euros<q>and our profit aim is fifteen million euros<q>this is uh something about the project finance
i think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it 's not going to be a high high-end product<q>because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product<q>so that 's a big problem
uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design<q>uh uh i think that plastic is the is the best with rubber<q>which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy
we we 're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic t _ v _ functions<q>but i in a way we have to be uh uh special<q>we we 'll make w this one trendy
for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting<q>but i want um the kind of functions<q>when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control
um i think um a logo<q>slogan from company on the back with logo and logo also on the front<q>and the slogan should be or could be uh i i 'd say only the logo
we 're going to um uh talk about working design<q>it 's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television<q>uh bat batteries and uh uh led lights
we 'll see each other in uh thirty minutes<q>the user interface designer the technical functions design<q>and the management expert of uh the marketing expert
we need to have the the l _ c _ d _ screen<q>it 's it 's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing<q>hey but uh i think you 'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen
to give it some just to give it some extra special feature<q>it w it wo n't tell<q>no no uh there 's still there 's still someth concept and something special left
the chip uh produces morse code<q>um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed<q>and the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip
the l _ c _ d _ screen does look better uh at the lower end
this is the l _ c _ d _ screen<q>and of course this low part<q>three of us agree and only nils so let it be like this at uh at this moment
i think two scroll buttons uh are n't easy to handle<q>that 's not expensive than uh joystick is better<q>a joystick ? but how expensive it is ? for the young peoples i think scroll button 's good
it uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read<q>i want to say i 've i 've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder<q>so will be p just ordinary keyboard
the younger market likes uh well<q>the themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material<q>uh i think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself
for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting<q>but i want um the kind of functions<q>but keep the programme and the volume
and for the teletext uh then the the the nine uh channels<q>uh the volume uh uh at the side<q>we place them in the middle
i think it should be at the top<q>we do n't want them to look like a calculator<q>yeah but with with the l _ c _ d _ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural
but we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station then the docking station is n't relevant for this project anymore<q>but the problem now is that the there 's no such thing as a docking station in this list
i thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting<q>but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more<q>and i was a i was also very uh unhappy
so first to we have to make a small painting<q>first you can save the documents<q>we all have to use this one
they 're willing to pay uh that<q>and lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour<q>the mai i think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours
can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with l _ c _ d _ or without ? i got it on my screen and it was uh higher<q>but i do n't know uh how much higher<q>the display requires a advanced chip
cell phones have uh integrated bluetooth also and<q>it 's use uh a lot of uh well does it ? i know it from the cell phone<q>maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or but then bluetooth uh might be problem
but i do n't know if that 's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half euros<q>then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know<q>but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five euros on a remote control and it 's a basic remote control
then the costs will uh be much higher<q>and that might uh bring back the costs uh and if we put an l _ c _ d _ thing on it<q>and i think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news
we work together on a project<q>really teamwork were you two uh<q>and it 's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed
i think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber<q>as well ? but it it then it uh you ca n't throw it it<q>it will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff uh
but now we 're going to evaluate our project<q>are we satisfactory about our creativity ? well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best<q>uh leadership well it 's it was very democratic
we we had some trouble with the pen<q>uh he he knows how it works<q>i it 's the same concept as the pen
we we had some trouble with the pen<q>uh he he knows how it works<q>i it 's the same concept as the pen
uh the buttons of course rubber<q>but solar energy is not very practical inside a house<q>uh i uh suggest uh the basic battery
they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet<q>the remote control should only be used for television<q>we ca n't just leave the teletext button off
now we have a few new product requirements<q>we have internet now so we do n't need the teletext anymore<q>i uh personally think uh teletext is a good option
first we have a prototype presentation by g _ and g _<q>in combination with the finance i um uh i received uh a an uh an excel uh file which we have to fill in later on<q>once again i 'm uh gon na take minutes
i think it 's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store<q>it 's not for uh for uh for uh philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product<q>are we ? do n't have the information for it
the project aim is to design a new remote control<q>and we uh close it with a meeting<q>this is the agenda for today
and i um uh thinked of the button sizes and i 'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small well<q>i think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons<q>we have the possibility to make the buttons larger
uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber<q>in the same colour as the side<q>a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it
and the cushions as well should be in another colour<q>it 's a g a little bit too flashy<q>because it has to be flashy
um research shows that they like to have a little l _ c _ d _ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device<q>it 's going to be expensive<q>research has shown that um it 's a high interested uh in features
i thought it was only for television<q>but most television remote controls support other functions as well<q>i think it should be good to include functions for v _ c _ r _ s and d _ v _ d _ players
i thought it was only for television<q>but most television remote controls support other functions as well<q>i think it should be good to include functions for v _ c _ r _ s and d _ v _ d _ players
it has to be used on every television<q>it 's like you see uh one to twenty<q>i think the younger people will have newer televisions
as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo<q>well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour<q>i would uh recommend a yellow case
or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it<q>maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing<q>but i in a way we have to be uh uh special
my uh presentation is about trend-watching<q>they uh watch in uh cities like uh paris and milan<q>material ? that should feel have uh a spongy feeling
cell phones have uh integrated bluetooth also and<q>um uh d i think the device should either be rechargeable very easily um or it should not consume too much um power<q>it 's it seems to work uh quite okay
so um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board<q>ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose<q>and a new pen width uh also format
i i did n't think so<q>we work together on a project<q>really teamwork were you two uh
um and there will be uh a lot of features like l _ c _ d _ or the the the speech uh f recognising<q>if we aim for the younger people<q>it 's hard to uh get the younger group
the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control<q>the themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material<q>i 've done some research again about trends on the internet
like uh some kind of rubber on it<q>uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control<q>so you do n't wo n't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks
has anyone got um a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ? maybe like this pen<q>you should like make alessi or something design it<q>the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote
is it gon na be a remote control that 's um what it can be used for different kind of equipment<q>i do n't th i do n't think the four of us got problems with remote controls<q>like your t _ v _ and your home stereo ? or someth something special
people in every country can recognise<q>furthermore it 's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world<q>so it does n't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh
we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost<q>special uh is the special colour ? yeah<q>but we want to make uh the wood colours
vegetables vegetables maybe it 's too much<q>like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit<q>but how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in christ 's sake with remote control ? no
i th i thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh<q>there are l at least uh basic functions<q>and i think they 're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user
i think uh the creativity uh was good enough<q>and uh had the final vote<q>you were the project project manager
i think uh the creativity uh was good enough<q>and uh had the final vote<q>you were the project project manager
i think it 's im it 's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors<q>we uh we make ? and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a d _ v _ d _ player<q>and stereo uh s uh audio installations
um i i do think it 's time now to to discuss uh mm some things<q>um sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications<q>um there are other things like um how to make it trendy
i think the best option is to use uh the basic battery<q>then we have the uh regular chip<q>it 's more expensive or less expensive
well then uh the serious uh stuff<q>we 're we want to sell it at twenty five euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars<q>it 's it 's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls
to the right is volume up<q>i ask you to presentate the prototype<q>and the joystick is for the volume and the channels
i think we we should use something like this um to um the the channel up and channel down button ? yeah<q>channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb<q>but i think it 's very important to make um the power
did we want to have a m mute button ? alright<q>especially we looked at the form<q>the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control
i think we we should use something like this um to um the the channel up and channel down button ? yeah<q>channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb<q>but i think it 's very important to make um the power
for the new remote control ? the weight<q>yeah well that 's that are good ideas<q>for our own remote control we have to think how do we make it
fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room<q>there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people<q>we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market
a d _ v _ d _ player<q>they are uh not easy to use<q>uh what are your experiences with remote controls
i 've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah<q>you can have f four kind of push-buttons<q>it 's only uh when you use push-buttons
i think the best option is to use uh the basic battery<q>at first we will uh i will f uh say something about what younger people want<q>about uh what battery is in it
the remote control should only be used for television<q>new products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty<q>they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet
if we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick<q>i do n't think it 's a very special colour<q>we ca n't lose the advanced chip
first we 're gon na um uh gon na try some different things with the tools we have over here<q>so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools<q>every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics
it all by pushing a button on the remote<q>um i thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to have some influence on the t _ v _ set<q>well these are two uh remotes
we uh we do n't get a docking station<q>we can really can do the docking thing<q>but for two euros and thirty cents
you just scroll up and click on the button<q>it 's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse<q>there are also uh simple chips
i in in the base we could like make uh a button<q>you have to put it on its so it 's like a vase or uh something you put on a table<q>the remote control itself s makes noise
regular chips the simple chip is e enough i i think<q>we should know how many simple chips<q>it will uh cost a a bit more
now we have to decide what controls do we need<q>well a power button ? uh the well um i think separate channels<q>but then we come to the costs
or we can ki do the kinetic cells<q>instead of the rechargeable kinetics are n't uh nowadays only used in watches and that 's because you 're always walking<q>with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing
or we can ki do the kinetic cells<q>instead of the rechargeable kinetics are n't uh nowadays only used in watches and that 's because you 're always walking<q>with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing
we ca n't lose the advanced chip<q>if we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick<q>i do n't think it 's a very special colour
but maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell<q>because of different shapes of uh uh devices<q>that 's uh that 's true
i still do n't have any information about user requirements<q>i was thinking about just uh the basic functions and i got uh oh<q>i do n't know if that 's a good idea
i 'm going to finish my end report<q>because uh there must be some kind of end report<q>was it included in the cost ? i do n't think so
in the in the docking station<q>but i still think i it it all t _ v _ s in some ways support it<q>because we have some uh cost issues still to come
um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here<q>you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button<q>you can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to
i would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things<q>maybe the time for sebastian to show his presentation<q>and the technical possibilities and impossibilities
we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey<q>those are the technological colours actually<q>so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple
the remote control has got a really trendy look<q>the the the buttons of the one<q>we 've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever
do we want to um use an l _ c _ d _ display<q>you 're not gon na watch your remote control<q>well well what would you display on it then ? uh
we can make it single-curved or uncurved<q>a docking station but you can use rechargeable batteries anyway<q>what do you think about uh putting a battery in it
do we want to um use an l _ c _ d _ display<q>you 're not gon na watch your remote control<q>well well what would you display on it then ? uh
we can also um make something like the nokia um mobile phones<q>just like with the nokia uh mobile phones<q>and i just uh have one more idea
when we talk about uh components design<q>um it 's really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of<q>solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls
this is with an l _ c _ d _ ? no<q>everybody has them uh has them already<q>it has to be used on every television
we 're only four euro over budget<q>uh we 're on uh twelve and a half euro<q>a docking station but you can use rechargeable batteries anyway
uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe<q>first i 'll uh i 'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose<q>the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off
i would g give the word to um g _ and g _ for the prototype presentation<q>we we want a more adult version<q>we decided to use a single touch-screen
like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit<q>we we have to um there have to be the the the the firm colours<q>vegetables vegetables maybe it 's too much
how i see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a windows log-on screen with parents<q>you do n't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings<q>you could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem
uh and we will have a discussion<q>the waiting is for our marketing expert<q>uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes
on which you can see functions ? but it it can be quite simple<q>always uh clear the the the paint on it<q>um you said something about visibility in the dark
we have to uh design a new television remote control<q>we 'll discuss about our first ideas about the project<q>i 've uh made a presentation uh but uh i 'll open it on the smartboard
the remote control is designed for people with age below forty<q>now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh to the past requirements<q>but the most uh easy to use is just with one button it is r it is rather easy to use
now uh it 's about time to uh talk about uh this project<q>people will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it<q>the the idea of the touch-screen is uh new ideas about uh the working of this software
discuss on the remote control functions<q>that means we can uh well d yeah<q>we we 're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic t _ v _ functions
that 's dependent on the television<q>but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television<q>there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like uh d i call it teens and twenties
the remote control the remote control 's relevant buttons are prominently visible<q>i would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant<q>we 're gon na evaluate that design according to a few points
we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component<q>why a special colour ? because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings<q>i think we uh we have special colours
the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list<q>but for two euros and thirty cents<q>like i think the advanced chip maybe
that 's dependent on the television<q>but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television<q>it it it works uh if you have n't got uh a special button for it
and you can make it another shape<q>but that 's not uh very recognisable<q>well we we could make more more oval or something
i think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um well it 's just uh about our first ideas now so i think individually we 'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera<q>i w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course<q>the buttons should be uh rubbery i think uh
only twelve euro fifty i think uh we will make it<q>it 's about the working of the remote control<q>and uh the teletext uh button
and uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons<q>they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls<q>so i 'm uh gon na have a presentation about um the market
we have to decide on the concept<q>and the one with with a menu has an l _ c _ d _<q>maybe one of you can paint it on the board
we gon na do the evaluation now<q>uh based on um our marketing strategy<q>we have a seven point scale from uh true
