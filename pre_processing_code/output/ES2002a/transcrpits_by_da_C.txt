Hi , I'm David and I'm supposed to be an industrial designer . 

Um , I just got the project announcement about what the project is <other> . 

Designing a remote control . 

That's about it , didn't get anything else . 

Did you get the same thing ? 

<laugh> 

<laugh> 

Cool . 

There's too much gear . <laugh> 

<laugh> 

Okay . 

Can't draw . <laugh> 

Um . 

Yeah . 

Um , well anyway , 

I don't know , it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head . 

Um . Yes . Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals . 

Allergic to animal fur , 

so um fish was a natural choice . 

Um , yeah , 

and I kind of like whales . 

They come in and go <sound imitating devouring something> eat everything in sight . <laugh> 

And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting . 

<laugh> Tail's a bit big , I think . <laugh> 

<laugh> 

<laugh> 

<laugh> 

<laugh> It's an after dinner dog then . 

<other> 

Hmm . 

It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 

'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons . 

So , possibly . 

Hmm . 

Yeah . 

And you keep losing them . 

Finding them is really a pain , you know . 

I mean it's usually quite small , 

or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch 

or it's kicked under the table . 

You know . 

Yep . 

Mm-hmm . 

I think one factor would be production cost . 

Because there's a cap there , 

so um depends on how much you can cram into that price . Um . 

I think that that's the main factor . 

<laugh> Cool . 

Okay 

Right 

<other> Um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project . 

Um <laugh> and um 

this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes . 

Um so first of all , just to kind of make sure that we all know each other , 

I'm Laura and I'm the project manager . 

<laugh> Do you want to introduce yourself again ? 

Okay . 

Great . 

Okay . <laugh> Um 

so we're designing a new remote control and um  

Oh I have to record who's here actually . 

So that's David , Andrew and Craig , isn't it ? 

And you all arrived on time . 

Um yeah so des uh <other> design a new remote control . 

Um , as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . 

Um so that's kind of our our brief , as it were . 

Um and so there are three different stages to the design . 

Um I'm not really sure what what you guys have already received um in your emails . 

What did you get ? 

Mm-hmm . 

Is that what everybody got ? 

Okay . 

Um . 

So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it . 

And repeat that process three times . 

Um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . 

Um . 

<laugh> So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . 

So who would like to go first ? 

Very good . <laugh> 

Mm-hmm . 

<laugh> 

Yeah . Yeah . 

Right . 

Lovely . <laugh> 

<laugh> 

Right . 

You can take as long over this as you like , 

because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss . 

Ok oh 

we do we do 

Don't feel like you're in a rush , anyway . 

Ach  why not  

We might have to get you up again then . 

I don't know what mine is . 

I'm gonna have to think on the spot now . 

<laugh> 

Is that a whale ? <laugh> 

Ah . 

Okay . 

God , I still don't know what I'm gonna write about . 

Um . 

I was gonna choose a dog as well . 

But I'll just draw a different kind of dog . 

M my favourite animal is my own dog at home . 

<laugh> Um  

That doesn't really look like him , actually . 

He looks more like a pig , actually . 

Ah well . 

Do you ? 

Oh that's very good of you . 

<laugh> 

Uh . 

Um he's a mixture of uh various things . 

Um and what do I like about him , um  

That's just to suggest that his tail wags . 

Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , 

and very kind of affectionate 

and um <other> 

uh 

and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can  doesn't take up too much space . 

Um 

and uh  And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well , 

which is quite amusing , so  

It is . I think it is . 

He only does it after he's had his dinner 

and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room . 

Yeah , 

so uh  

Yeah , 

maybe . 

Maybe . 

<laugh> Right , um where did you find this ? 

Just down here ? Yeah . 

Okay . 

<other> Um what are we doing next ? Uh um . 

Okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . 

Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , 

um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro . 

Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . 

And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . 

Sure . 

All together . 

Um I dunno . 

I imagine  

That's a good question . 

I imagine it probably is our sale actually 

because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . Um . 

But I  I don't know , 

I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? 

Think it will ? 

Um . 

<other> Hmm . 

Oh yeah , 

regions and stuff , yeah . 

Yeah . 

Okay . 

Yeah . 

Well for a remote control , do you think that will be  

I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is . 

Yeah , yeah . 

Okay . 

What , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ? 

Like how much money people have to spend on things like ? 

Aye , I see what you mean , yeah . 

Marketing . 

Good marketing thoughts . 

Oh gosh , 

I should be writing all this down . Um . 

Mm . 

Yeah . 

Yeah , yeah . 

Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost . 

Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something , 

isn't it ? 

Or no , 

is it as much as that ? 

Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds . 

Um , I dunno , 

I've never bought a remote control , 

so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . Um . 

But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky . 

Um right , okay . 

Let me just scoot on ahead here . 

Okay . 

Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all ? 

Thin 

No , actually . 

That would be useful , though , 

wouldn't it , 

if you knew like what your money would get you now . 

Mm-hmm . 

Yeah , yeah . 

Oh . 

Five minutes to end of meeting . 

Oh , okay . 

We're a bit behind . 

Yeah . 

Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know , 

do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ? 

Mm-hmm . 

<other> Yeah . 

Or even like , you know , notes about um what you wanna watch . 

Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a 

Oh that's a good idea . 

So extra functionalities . 

Mm-hmm . 

Hmm . 

Um okay , 

uh I'd wel 

we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . 

Um I'll just check we've nothing else 

. Okay . 

Um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used , 

what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ? 

You keep losing them . 

Okay . 

Yeah . 

W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . 

There  

I mean is that something we'd want to include , do you think ? 

Dunno . 

Okay maybe . <other> 

<laugh> 

My goodness . 

Still feels quite primitive . 

Maybe like a touch screen or something ? 

Okay . 

Uh-huh , okay . 

Well I guess that's up to our industrial designer . 

It looks better . 

Yeah . 

Okay . 

Okay . 

Right , well um 

so just to wrap up 

the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . 

So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . 

Um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it 

so y you know what you're doing there . 

Um for user interface , technical functions , 

I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about , 

what it'll actually do . 

Um and uh marketing executive , 

you'll be just thinking about what it actually  what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil 

and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , I guess . 

Um . 

Yeah , so it's th the functional design stage is next , I guess . 

<other> 

And uh 

and that's the end of the meeting . 

So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would , so  

Mm-hmm . 

Uh-huh , yeah . 

Th 

Okay , 

well just very quickly 

'cause this  we're supposed to finish now . 

Um I guess that's up to us , 

I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it , 

so um , you know  

Yeah . 

Mm-hmm . 

Yeah . 

Okay . 

Right , okay , we'll that's that's the end of the meeting , then . Um 

So , uh 

thank you all for coming . <laugh> 

Um I'm Craig and I'm User Interface . 

Yeah . 

 

Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey . 

<laugh> 

Then they're small cute and furry , 

and uh when planet of the apes becomes real , <other> I'm gonna be up there with them . 

<laugh> 

<laugh> 

<laugh> 

<laugh> 

<laugh> 

<laugh> 

<laugh> 

<laugh> 

<laugh> 

<other> Yeah . 

I know um  

My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house . 

So um for them it was just how many devices control . 

Uh .
