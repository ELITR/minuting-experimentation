Mm-hmm . 
Great . 
And I'm Andrew and I'm uh our marketing 
expert . 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . Yeah , that's that's it . 
Yeah . 
I will go . That's fine . 
Alright . So  
<other> <whistling> 
This one here , right ? 
Okay . Very nice . 
Alright . 
My favourite animal is like  
<whistling> 
<laugh> 
A beagle . 
Um 
charac favourite characteristics of it ? Is that right ? 
Uh , right , well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . 
And , yeah that they have lots of personality 
and uh be fit and in robust good health . 
So this is blue . 
Blue beagle . 
My family's beagle . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles . 
Boy , let me tell you . <laugh> 
Impressionist . 
<laugh> 
<laugh> Alright . 
Mm . 
Superb sketch , by the way . 
<laugh> 
Yep . 
I see a dog in there . 
Yep . 
<other> 
Now I see a rooster . 
What kind is it ? 
<laugh> 
<laugh> 
Is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing ? 
<cough> 
Hmm . 
Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned . 
<laugh> 
'Kay . 
Um , can we just go over that again ? 
Uh , so bas at twel 
Alright , yeah . Okay . 
So cost  like production cost is twelve fifty , 
but selling price is  is that wholesale or retail ? 
Like on the shelf . 
Our sale our sale anyway . 
Yeah , okay okay . 
Okay . 
Mm-hmm . 
Alright . 
Yes . <laugh> 
Mm-hmm . 
Mm-hmm . 
Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones . 
Um f frequencies or something 
um as well as uh characters , 
um different uh keypad styles and s symbols . 
Um . 
I don't know . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . 
I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so  
Just a chara just a characteristic of the  
Just  
Or just like , basic product podi positioning , 
the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London , 
might not be such a big hit in Greece , 
who knows , 
something like that , yeah . 
<other> 
Yep . 
Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here , 
thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic , 
something other than just standard . Um 
so I'm wondering right away , 
is selling twenty five Euros , is that sort of the  
thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or  
Uh-huh . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yep . 
Yeah , 
I'd say so , 
yeah . 
No . 
Yeah , 
yeah . <cough> 
Mm-hmm . 
Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other 
other <other>  
Yeah . 
Mm-hmm . 
Yeah , interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l 
as you point out , 
I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits . 
It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something . 
It just comes along . 
Do you know what I mean ? 
Like so sort of like how do you 
I I mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls . 
Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something . 
But  
Right . Right . 
Okay so  
Right , 
so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses  
I think so . 
Yeah , yeah . 
Yeah . 
Well like um , 
maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . 
They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , M_P_ three players , telephones , 
everything , agenda . 
So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , 
such as the lighting in your house , or um  
Yeah , 
yeah . 
An 
Yeah . 
Like , p personally for me , at home I've I've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my D_V_D_ player and my C_D_ player . 
So they w all work actually function together 
but I have different remote controls for each of them . 
So it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there 
um 
you know , the sound and everything it's just one system . 
But each one's got its own little 
part . 
Mm . 
Mm . Mm . 
Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
Yeah . 
Yeah . 
That's just really good id 
Yep . 
Uh , <other> 
sure . <cough> 
I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . 
Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_ 
and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something . 
And um , you know , 
when I think about what they are now , it's better , 
but actually it's still kind of , I dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table . 
Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . S 
Something like that , yeah . 
Or whatever would be technologically reasonable . 
'Cause it could b it could it could be that f 
it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , 
but that just the appeal of of not having  
You know , these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , you know . 
Um , nicer materials 
and might be 
be worth exploring anyway . 
Okay . 
<other> 
Um . <cough> 
<other> 
Before we wrap up , just to make sure we're all on the same page here , 
um , do we  
We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something , 
right ? 
Well , 
um 
are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? 
Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ? 
I I don't know . 
Yep . 
Yeah , sure . 
Okay . 
Okay , yeah . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Okay . 
Alright . <other> 
<cough> 
<laugh>
