B:  <laugh> 
D:  Um charac favourite characteristics of it ? Is that right ? Uh , right , well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . And , yeah that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health . So this is blue . Blue beagle . My family's beagle . 
B:  Yeah . Yeah . 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  Right . Lovely . <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> 
C:   Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey .

D:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Right . 
A:  Cool . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  There's too much gear . <laugh>

D:  Impressionist . 
B:  <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  Can't draw . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Is that a whale ? <laugh> 
A:  Um . Yeah . Um , well anyway , I don't know , it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head . Um . Yes . Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals . Allergic to animal fur , so um fish was a natural choice . 
B:  Ah . 
A:  Um , yeah , and I kind of like whales . They come in and go <sound imitating devouring something> eat everything in sight . <laugh> 
C:  <laugh> 
D:  <laugh> <laugh> Alright . 
A:  And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting . 
D:  Mm . 
B:  Okay . God , I still don't know what I'm gonna write about . Um . 
D:  Superb sketch , by the way . 
A:  <laugh> Tail's a bit big , I think . <laugh> 
B:  I was gonna choose a dog as well . But I'll just draw a different kind of dog . M my favourite animal is my own dog at home . <laugh> Um  
D:  <laugh> Yep . 
B:  That doesn't really look like him , actually . He looks more like a pig , actually . Ah well . 
D:  I see a dog in there . Yep . 
C:  <laugh> 
B:  Do you ? Oh that's very good of you . 
D:  <other> Now I see a rooster . 
C:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  <laugh> Uh . 
D:  What kind is it ? 
B:  Um he's a mixture of uh various things . Um and what do I like about him , um  That's just to suggest that his tail wags . Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very kind of affectionate and um <other> 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <laugh> 
B:  uh and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can  doesn't take up too much space . Um 
D:  <laugh> 
B:  and uh  And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well , which is quite amusing , so  
A:  <laugh> 
D:  Is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing ? 
B:  It is . I think it is . He only does it after he's had his dinner and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room . 
D:  <cough> Hmm . 
A:  <laugh> It's an after dinner dog then . 
B:  Yeah , so uh  
D:  Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned . 
B:  Yeah , maybe . Maybe . <laugh> Right , um where did you find this ? Just down here ? Yeah . 
D:  <laugh> 
A:  <other> 


B:  Okay . <other> Um what are we doing next ? Uh um . Okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro . Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . 
D:  'Kay . Um , can we just go over that again ? 
B:  Sure . 
D:  Uh , so bas at twel Alright , yeah . Okay . So cost  like production cost is twelve fifty , but selling price is  is that wholesale or retail ? Like on the shelf . 
B:  All together . Um I dunno . I imagine  That's a good question . 
D:  Our sale our sale anyway . Yeah , okay okay . 
B:  I imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . Um . 
D:  Okay . Mm-hmm . Alright . 


B:  But I  I don't know , I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? 
D:  Yes . <laugh> 
B:  Think it will ? Um . 
D:  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 
B:  <other> Hmm . 
D:  Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones . Um f frequencies or something um as well as uh characters , um different uh keypad styles and s symbols . 
B:  Oh yeah , regions and stuff , yeah . Yeah . Okay . 
A:  Hmm . 
B:  Yeah . Well for a remote control , do you think that will be  I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is . 
D:  Um . I don't know . Yeah . 
A:  It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons . 
B:  Yeah , yeah . Okay . 
D:  Yeah . 
A:  So , possibly . 
D:  Yeah . And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so  
B:  What , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ? Like how much money people have to spend on things like ? 
D:  Just a chara just a characteristic of the  Just  Or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London , might not be such a big hit in Greece , who knows , something like that , yeah . 
B:  Aye , I see what you mean , yeah . Marketing . Good marketing thoughts . Oh gosh , I should be writing all this down . Um . 
D:  <other> Yep . Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what
