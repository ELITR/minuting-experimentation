we also want to limit the number of buttons um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ? <EOS> we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . <EOS> so we 'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . <EOS> so we 'll go with speech recognition , yeah ? <EOS> um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . <EOS> glow in dark . <EOS> if it 's not too expensive s i think it 's a good gimmick . <EOS> and also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . <EOS> <other> <EOS>
and i 'll see if i can argue with boss about putting the we put the fashion in electronics <EOS>
so we 'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . <EOS> so we 'll go with speech recognition , yeah ? <EOS> um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . <EOS>
we also want to limit the number of buttons um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . <EOS>
and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . <EOS> um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . <EOS> glow in dark . <EOS> if it 's not too expensive s i think it 's a good gimmick . <EOS>
now , it was function f _ eight . <EOS> <other> f oh sorry f _ eight . <EOS> and if you just click that it 'll go ahead , one at a time . <EOS> oh you wan na go back ? <EOS> just escape . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no signal . <EOS> computer adjusting , yeah . <EOS> um , f _ five and escape 'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing . <EOS> oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing . <EOS> so i plug it in , press f _ five ? <EOS>
uh in this meeting i i 'm going to discuss about the trend watching , we have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . <EOS> the second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . <EOS> and the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . <EOS>
when we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . <EOS> do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? <EOS> the rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co <EOS>
okay , so the interface concept um . <EOS> um so the method , we looked at existing designs , <other> okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , um and we also found that there 's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing . <EOS> but i think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons and we 've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you . <EOS> this one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse , um and but i 'm not exactly sure how you 'd use that , but the one below that has got like <other> a little scroll function on the side . <EOS> but i presume that the functions must come up on the t _ v _ screen . <EOS> again that 's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , i think on that one . <EOS> um this one i thought was really cool . <EOS> it 's w it 's got the programmability function that we talked about . <EOS> and it 's quite an organic shape yeah , i m i mean the one thing i think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um <other> , i 've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . <EOS> so like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever . <EOS> and this one , the over-sized one , i do n't know about you , but i think it 's a bit too gimmicky . <EOS> i like <other> some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , the raised symbols i thought were good , and the mouse one , i thought it was a good idea , child-friendly , i thought this was good , <EOS>
there 's um an l _ c _ d _ thing , i thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . <EOS> and i 've just got <other> an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . <EOS> i think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . <EOS> you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , the l _ c _ d _ , it does look smart , but i think maybe for our budget , 'cause i think we 're definitely going for the speech recognition , but in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , it 's still it 's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . <EOS> i 'm not sure if the if <other> for twenty five euros uh per uh twelve euros fifty m manufacturing cost , . <EOS> although , th i mean to be to be sure they have got i mean they are going crazy with the l _ c _ d _ technology now , and one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so i think i 'm not sure about the l _ c _ d _ . <EOS> it 's a it 's great , it 's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we 're trying to go for eas easy to use , it 's not the thing we should go for , i think . <EOS> we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , i think . <EOS> well , si since we 're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , i think your lemon was n't that far s <laugh> i like i like the colourful buttons as well . <EOS> i like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . <EOS>
i guess there are a lot of options that we 're gon na have to choose from among , and i 'll i 'll give you the uh , <other> i guess , technical considerations for those . <EOS> and i 'm gon na use the whiteboard , just 'cause we have n't used it <other> . <EOS> the way i 'm gon na do this <other> is uh we 're gon na take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , and then we 'll throw in our new innovations um <other> um you open it up , there 's a circuit board inside , and there 's a a chip , a processor , the t _ a _ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the uh to the l _ e _ d _ light , um . <EOS> so you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what 's it gon na be , processor , um we 'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail i got from our manufacturing team uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , um latex , double-curved , curved . <EOS>
um you open it up , there 's a circuit board inside , and there 's a a chip , a processor , the t _ a _ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , <EOS>
well , i mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , and that would k also give it kinda durability and ther that 's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . <EOS> so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? <EOS> i like the rubber , the stress balls , i think , w like , 'cause there 's gon na be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours <EOS>
so multi-coloured buttons . <EOS> or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it does n't look too childish , perhaps . <EOS> <laugh> although i mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . <EOS> i mean double-curved sounds good to me if we 're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , like uh <other> an hour glass kind of figure , uh i could put the microphone here . <EOS> <laugh> so should the microphone be just anywhere on it or button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . <EOS>
okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> <laugh> how would you point it ? <EOS> we could have a little l _ e _ d _ s on each end . <EOS> y i 'm i 'm not sure about the banana idea . <EOS> it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . <EOS> <other> i think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . <EOS> so maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? <EOS> you do n't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , <other> or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . <EOS> there 's a good man . <EOS> there 's a good idea . <EOS> yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? <EOS> <other> do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it 's a fruit ? <EOS> <laugh> l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , i dunno , an apple . <EOS> we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . <EOS>
i think we should a rechargeable <other> battery will be a good idea . <EOS> having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . <EOS>
uh our next meeting 's in half an hour and what i would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . <EOS> <laugh> um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches . <EOS>
and what i would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . <EOS>
so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? <EOS> i like the rubber , the stress balls , i think , s i guess we decided on material , so that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , <EOS>
<other> or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . <EOS> there 's a good man . <EOS> there 's a good idea . <EOS>
but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , because al already we 're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . <EOS> so again i mean like we could have , uh i mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different i mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . <EOS>
'cause i think we 're definitely going for the speech recognition , uh speech recognition , i think , <EOS>
i think we should a rechargeable <other> battery will be a good idea . <EOS> having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . <EOS>
or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it does n't look too childish , perhaps . <EOS> <laugh> although i mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . <EOS> y i 'm i 'm not sure about the banana idea . <EOS> it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . <EOS> <other> i think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . <EOS> so maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? <EOS> you do n't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it 's a fruit ? <EOS> <laugh> l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , i dunno , an apple . <EOS> well , i i 'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , and i think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , so you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . <EOS> so again i mean like we could have , uh i mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different because al already we 're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . <EOS> i mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , <EOS>
um <other> will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news ? <EOS> we made three for you . <EOS> um one 's based on the banana , one 's based on the tomato or as mm few buttons as possible , so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , mainly speak recognition . <EOS> if you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there 's some there , <cough> well i like the feel of it , i like the feel of it . <EOS> but that 's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . <EOS> um the black on the back is the slogan . <EOS> but also we 're gon na have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . <EOS> these are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . <EOS> it does actually feel quite ergonomic , it would have to be a bit bigger . <EOS> <laugh> um , obviously i do n't think that 's real sized . <EOS> um that 's a speaker at the top , oh that 's the charging base prongs at the bottom . <EOS> and um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . <EOS> and and um we have the banana-based one too . <EOS> this one is uh , i suppose for the younger audiences . <EOS> <other> so are there any um improvements or issues or <laugh> <EOS>
um one 's based on the banana , one 's based on the tomato so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . <EOS> if you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there 's some there , <EOS>
these are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . <EOS>
and and um we have the banana-based one too . <EOS> this one is uh , i suppose for the younger audiences . <EOS>
um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance . <EOS> uh , let 's just enter in the um evaluation criteria . <EOS> the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it 's gon na cost us fourteen point six euros . <EOS> <other> so basically , um in order to save our two euros um i was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . <EOS> does n't save us quite as much . <EOS> w why is the uh double curved two of them ? <EOS> oh , good point . <EOS> i think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . <EOS> and why why i 've got it two , i do n't know , but you think it should be one . <EOS> <laugh> um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us eleven uh eleven euros sixty . <EOS>
so we could even add something . <EOS> ah yeah , we could add things . <EOS> yeah , if we 're happy with the design there 's no point in spending money , if we do n't have to . <EOS>
uh room for creativity , were we happy with that ? <EOS> w i think we were very creative . <EOS> leadership , great leadership . <EOS> <laugh> uh teamwork . <EOS> i thought went well . <EOS> yeah , everyone got enough input , i think . <EOS> <other> these pens are are neat though . <EOS> <other> yeah , these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that . <EOS> so just general thumbs up for all of us then . <EOS>
so now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . <EOS> whether it meets our standards or not . <EOS> w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . <EOS> we will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . <EOS> then trends , whether it is as fashion trends or not ? <EOS> then marketing strategy of the company . <EOS> now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . <EOS> what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ? <EOS> it had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . <EOS> <other> seven is good , yeah , is n't it ? <EOS> true or false ? <EOS> uh one is means highest ranking , so it 's one for from your point of view . <EOS> i 'm gon na give it a two . <EOS> oh , i 'll go for a one . <EOS> <other> uh for me personally it is everything fine , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , but if a person does n't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . <EOS> so we are showing our preference for particular fruits , is that no is that not trends ? <EOS> because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , but in electronics , i think , it 's not q always quite so um you do n't always have so many choices as with chocolates . <EOS> we are doing a very wrong thing . <EOS> we 're gon na average them ? <EOS> i have taken it very wrongly . <EOS> about one point f one point eight . <EOS> well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , i would give it um , so i would actually give it a three . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> as far as the uh technology it its ' got the latest trends in speech technology , um but it does n't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . <EOS> it might be trendy to some , but i 'm just not swallowing the fruit , it is cus spongy also . <EOS> uh personally i wi uh i think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , so what about company strategy ? <EOS> well , i think it 's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy . <EOS> pretty much kept to the company strategy , so i would go for a a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by uh overall we are getting two something , so we can launch it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'cause we 've evaluated and we are within budget . <EOS>
um one 's based on the banana , one 's based on the tomato so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . <EOS>
and and um we have the banana-based one too . <EOS> this one is uh , i suppose for the younger audiences . <EOS>
um the black on the back is the slogan . <EOS> but also we 're gon na have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . <EOS>
but that 's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . <EOS>
we forgot to mention it 'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we 've got . <EOS>
so we can launch it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'cause we 've evaluated and we are within budget . <EOS>
it might be trendy to some , but i 'm just not swallowing the fruit , but if a person does n't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . <EOS> like we are having only two , three designs , uh for me personally it is everything fine , well , because it 's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , <EOS>
so , this is uh first meeting of this design project . <EOS> um and i um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , this is the the plan for today 's meeting then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more . <EOS> um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we 'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . <EOS> um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um come up with some preliminary ideas about it . <EOS> so we 've got twenty five minutes to do that , <EOS>
what we 're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . <EOS> um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . <EOS>
the method that we 're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . <EOS> there 's the functional design of the the remote control . <EOS> the way we 'll do that i think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . <EOS> um similarly with the conceptual design , um and then the detailed design will come after that . <EOS> we 'll pull it all together . <EOS> i 'm a bit confused about uh what 's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? <EOS> uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as i understand it ? <EOS> i think it th w we 're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you 'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . <EOS> it 's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? <EOS> um i think we 'll we 'll start that initially with the functional design already but then <EOS>
um what i 'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we 're using for <other> for the project , each person in turn , i 'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you 're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you 're taking in this project . <EOS> <laugh> so , my name 's cat um this is a rabbit . <EOS> <laugh> i am the marketing expert <other> i 'm gon na be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design <other> um so my name is maarika . <EOS> i 'm the interface designer in this project but i do like dogs . <EOS> um so um in the different um <other> stages of the design , so at first i will be responsible for um for <other> yeah , designing the technical functions of the um <other> um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage i need to um come up with uh interface concept um my name is gaurav . <EOS> my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , so i 'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , i 'm jen . <EOS> it 's a gecko . <EOS> and i 'm your project manager for today and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . <EOS>
okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project . <EOS> um we 're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five euros each . <EOS> um and with that we 're aiming for a profit of fifty million euros . <EOS> and that 's selling them on the international market , not just in the u _ k _ . <EOS> um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half euro so that we can reach that profit target . <EOS> does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we 're thinking of this remote control ? <EOS> i 'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . <EOS> but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that <other> are out of the ordinary . <EOS> <other> i think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . <EOS> although i do n't think that um it 's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , i mean we can think about all these little things , <EOS>
so i 'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they do n't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . <EOS> so perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or like i mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your t _ v _ , right ? <EOS> something that 's a little less crowded than this , but what do most people do ? <EOS> they turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . <EOS> <other> there is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , it could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . <EOS> and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . <EOS> <other> because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems yeah but uh i mean e even though it has to be re original we should n't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , a big learning curve , yeah . <EOS>
so we need to wrap it up now , um <other> we 've got another meeting in thirty minutes , you 'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , uh i 'll see you in half an hour . <EOS>
and for you it 's the user requirements specification , <EOS>
but im basically you 're looking at the working design , <EOS>
you 're looking at the technical functions design , <EOS>
you 'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , <EOS>
um we 're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five euros each . <EOS>
um and with that we 're aiming for a profit of fifty million euros . <EOS>
and that 's selling them on the international market , not just in the u _ k _ . <EOS>
so i 'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they do n't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . <EOS> so perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or something that 's a little less crowded than this , it could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . <EOS>
yeah but uh i mean e even though it has to be re original we should n't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems a big learning curve , yeah . <EOS>
so we need to wrap it up now , <EOS>
now we are here at the functional design meeting . <EOS> um <other> hopefully this meeting i 'll be doing a little bit less talking than i did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you 've been doing individually . <EOS> the agenda for the meeting , i put it in the sh shared documents folder . <EOS> um <other> i 'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , the main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you 've been preparing during the time , um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . <EOS> at the last minute , then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group 's going to be and what the functions of the remote control you said uh targ target groups , what does that mean ? <EOS> as uh who it is that we 're going to be trying to sell this thing to , yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? <EOS> once we you do n't have to do it now but when once you go back , just so that i do n't have to scribble everything down . <EOS>
<other> so n uh with uh with regard to the <other> uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh i 've identified um <other> a few basic uh components of the remote and uh <other> se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w i c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since i 'm dealing only with the technical aspects , i would need feedback from the marketing person uh and <laugh> uh from the user interface person . <EOS> uh we 'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level these were the basic findings from today . <EOS> the last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . <EOS> as i told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um <other> and how the parts uh communicate with each other . <EOS> also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . <EOS> and the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . <EOS> also the management wants that um our design should be unique so <other> it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . <EOS> <other> okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . <EOS> there 's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . <EOS> the user interf interface communicates with the chip , if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . <EOS> there is a user interface here . <EOS> <other> so whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . <EOS> so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically . <EOS> i in my personal preferences um <other> i 'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . <EOS> this would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . <EOS> and uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um <other> uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it 's compatible with mot most uh televisions . <EOS> do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ? <EOS> <other> no , i do n't have any idea about what each component costs . <EOS> 'cause that 's something to consider , i guess , if we 're if we 're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . <EOS> we definitely need to operate within our constraints , <EOS>
i think since since we were discussing some um design issues then i i i would like to continue so i 'm going to speak about technical functions design uh my method was um to look at um other <other> um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web and then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what i found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities . <EOS> um so the findings uh were <other> um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , and uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm <other> uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . <EOS> and and also the volume is very important . <EOS> um um among the findings i found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm <other> functionalities um in their design , like operating a v _ c _ r _ , but they do n't seem to be able to deal with d _ v _ d _ players , but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . <EOS> so my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . <EOS> and then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . <EOS> but then um other functionalities um <other> could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um <other> done through the menu . <EOS> the last question i had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . <EOS> but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it 's important to include video and d _ v _ d _ , i could get back to them and see . <EOS> and also it 's it 's um other question is uh because there are so many different and there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and d _ v _ d _ there are the mm um video c _ d _ s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . <EOS>
and uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm <other> uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . <EOS> and and also the volume is very important . <EOS> but then um other functionalities um <other> could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um <other> done through the menu . <EOS>
so my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . <EOS> and then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . <EOS>
and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . <EOS> um well , i think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use , or i mean in we can completely do away with buttons so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify <other> so in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . <EOS> i mean um what other options would you have ? <EOS> a little screen or something , but this would be really kind of i think a lot of learning for the user and and i mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly , not to spend time in like um giving several orders um i dunno . <EOS> i think i th i would i would think the put the buttons , uh i think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . <EOS> so well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that . <EOS> uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an l _ c _ d _ display because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . <EOS>
so what i have , wh where i 've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire . <EOS> what they found is that people do n't like how current remote controls are , um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . <EOS> uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control . <EOS> um current remote controls , they do n't match the user behaviour well , um i dunno what zapping is , it 's um switching between channels , sort of randomly going through . <EOS> but you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what 's on . <EOS> um okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , so that 's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , they just make it look ugly . <EOS> um so this is my little graph thing . <EOS> what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that 's used most is the channel selection . <EOS> what you ca n't see is volume selection , it 's a little bit higher than all the others . <EOS> so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that 's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance , you know , and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it 's not quite so essential , apparently , <laugh> um and everything else , i think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . <EOS> uh that they get lost , that the uh you know , they 're not intuitive and that they 're bad for repetitive strain injury . <EOS> you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . <EOS> so you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they 're a bit more sceptical about it um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but um you know i d i do wonder how well that would work given that a t _ v _ , you know , tends to be people talking and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching t _ v _ . <EOS> so these are my personal preferences . <EOS> <other> so you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that 's , you know , a bit cool . <EOS> um you know , functional , so it 's useful , but minimalist . <EOS> so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and um , you know , i was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . <EOS> um and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or some kind of a ring , whistle and it <other> screams at you , yeah . <EOS> <laugh> so yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , <EOS>
so these are my personal preferences . <EOS> <other> so you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that 's , you know , a bit cool . <EOS> um you know , functional , so it 's useful , but minimalist . <EOS> so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and um , you know , i was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . <EOS> so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or some kind of a ring , whistle and it <other> screams at you , yeah . <EOS> <laugh> so yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , um and then like a locator , <EOS>
so , we 've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss <other> i think one of the very interesting things that came up in um <other> uh ka kate cat cat 's uh presentation was um <other> uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people . <EOS> so if we need to have a target group um then uh <other> i think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and uh you know , good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know , people who are comparatively elderly . <EOS> i mean that 's the thing is that it did n't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , then again i guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the i do n't know how often they 're buying televisions . <EOS> i would 've thought it 's it 's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they 've got their first job and they want their nice toys and wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was seventy six point three percent . <EOS> but i mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income i mean like it is an age group to target , really , i think . <EOS> and if we 're if we 're talking twenty five euros as a price , that 's not unaffordable , even for young people . <EOS> but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a t _ v _ <laugh> to use its full and be a bit strange to have a fancy <laugh> rome remote . <EOS> i think i think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , i would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . <EOS> but at the same time i think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , because actually i mean they 're all still re young people . <EOS> yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , <EOS>
but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition . <EOS> is that gon na have a an implication for the technical specs ? <EOS> but voice recognition itself i 'm not very sure about , with um but with a t _ v _ remote it 's gon na be quite limited if we 're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , tha that should be relatively simple . <EOS> y you 'd maybe need a code word . <EOS> but like so you 'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . <EOS> but maybe if you wan na look into that just to just to check . <EOS> w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but i think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons what wh uh <other> what i was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on t _ v _ and how they are numbered on the remote control . <EOS> if we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say , i want to watch uh i _ t _ v _ one instead of saying that i want to go onto channel number forty five . <EOS> so that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great . <EOS> it 's more like if you lost it and it 's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it <laugh> and it 'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . <EOS> yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control is n't <other> as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you 're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control no , but i i i was just defending the <other> the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance . <EOS> so uh <other> wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the t _ v _ , so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it 'll beep , so we we can probably come to know where it is . <EOS> but if we go away with that that kind of general um <other> specification in mind that we 're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it 's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it 's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . <EOS> <other> what we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , send me your presentations so that i can use them to make the minutes , and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . <EOS> um i 'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but i 'll send you an email when i do it , so that you know . <EOS> you 'll be looking <laugh> you 'll be looking at the user interface concept , and you 're watching trends to see how we go as to where we 're going from here , you 're going to look at the components concept . <EOS> w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . <EOS>
what we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , send me your presentations so that i can use them to make the minutes , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . <EOS>
you 'll be looking <laugh> you 'll be looking at the user interface concept , <EOS>
and you 're watching trends to see how we go <EOS>
as to where we 're going from here , you 're going to look at the components concept . <EOS>
but um you know i d i do wonder how well that would work given that a t _ v _ , you know , tends to be people talking um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching t _ v _ . <EOS> but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition . <EOS> is that gon na have a an implication for the technical specs ? <EOS> but voice recognition itself i 'm not very sure about , with um but with a t _ v _ remote it 's gon na be quite limited if we 're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , tha that should be relatively simple . <EOS> y you 'd maybe need a code word . <EOS> but like so you 'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . <EOS> but maybe if you wan na look into that just to just to check . <EOS> w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but i think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons so that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great . <EOS> it 's more like if you lost it and it 's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it <laugh> and it 'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . <EOS> yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control is n't <other> as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you 're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control no , but i i i was just defending the <other> the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance . <EOS> but if we go away with that that kind of general um <other> specification in mind that we 're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it 's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it 's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . <EOS> <other> <EOS>
this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . <EOS> what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you 've been working on so diligently . <EOS> it does look very cool . <EOS> <laugh> then cat 's going to present the evaluation criteria that we 're going to be evaluating this against . <EOS> then i need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it 's within the finance criteria . <EOS> um and then we 'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from cat and the financial limits . <EOS> um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we 've been through . <EOS>
so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then i will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and <other> okay . <EOS> so um basically going with our trend of vegetables and <laugh> we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . <EOS> <laugh> you think bananas are a safe thing to use ? <EOS> it 's a bit um phallic . <EOS> <laugh> well , but it 's it 's just an a approximation . <EOS> <laugh> so i would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . <EOS> <laugh> yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? <EOS> um it could be made a bit smaller , and it 's <other> with the the black and yellow you 're even in the right colours . <EOS> yeah , i think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . <EOS>
<laugh> um so basically it 's the it 's the flip open thing again . <EOS> and it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . <EOS> and we have the user interface o in here and uh <other> the the l _ c _ d _ and and the scroll are inside . <EOS> and it 's the whole thing 's made of rubber , is that so <laugh> so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the <other> on the cover we just have the very basic things . <EOS> so we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three so it 's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . <EOS> and then , well this is on off button . <EOS> and and also the colour is quite often red , and then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and and and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . <EOS> the volume is is scrolling . <EOS> on the side , and and and it 's it 's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . <EOS> and and you have the mm <other> spinning wheel with options to choose . <EOS> oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button . <EOS> well , we 'll have this on the screen , on the display . <EOS> on the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . <EOS> uh on the l _ c _ d _ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . <EOS> yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? <EOS> if it 's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? <EOS> but if you hold it in , <other> and okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it . <EOS> you ca n't really see it in the interface . <EOS>
so what we 're gon na do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design . <EOS> <other> um so we 're gon na be using a seven point scale , so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really does n't , we need to go back and start again . <EOS> um , you know . <EOS> basically , what i did was i went through all the like user requirements and things that we 've done and we 've worked on and like made a list of them . <EOS> so for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . <EOS> i did have a _ , b _ , c _ , and d _ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but if you can imagine that they say a _ , b _ , c _ , and d _ , then that would be really good . <EOS> okay um uh what i 've done on the next page is i 've set it up so we just put the marks in . <EOS> if you take a note of them , left-handed people ca n't normally write right-handed , um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? <EOS> so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m <other> model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . <EOS> so maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , i would say ? <EOS> or maybe six , it might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , i th i think the alternative is flipping from the top . <EOS> yeah , but we which makes it kind of really big , yeah . <EOS> or are we saying we 're gon na stick a locator on the t _ v _ ? <EOS> th there 's the locator dot . <EOS> mm that you stick on t _ v _ . <EOS> so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , to make it beep . <EOS> so that 's seven , yeah . <EOS> if <other> uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things i 'd say six , 'cause the i mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you 've got it . <EOS> but it 's not the immediate thing that you 're used to . <EOS> but uh it 's a good technology , i mean once they get used to it . <EOS> so , should we maybe say f a five so possibly for left-handed . <EOS> investigate . <EOS> but otherwise it 's superb . <EOS> so , should we give it a six ? <EOS> um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm i mean i d uh i dunno , i mean the the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , and moreover it it has um <other> l _ c _ d _ and everything , so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . <EOS> okay , so we give that a six , g _ technologically innovative . <EOS> it 's the most sophisticated remote that i ever seen . <EOS> <laugh> well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it 's kind of new . <EOS> all of the components have been used in other things before . <EOS> they 're never been used i they 've never been using remote remote control before i do n't think . <EOS> what do you reckon , five , six ? <EOS> six . <EOS> put fashion in electronics . <EOS> fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . <EOS>
maybe give it a five , i would say ? <EOS> or maybe six , it might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , i th i think the alternative is flipping from the top . <EOS> yeah , but we which makes it kind of really big , yeah . <EOS> so that 's seven , yeah . <EOS> if <other> uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things i 'd say six , 'cause the i mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you 've got it . <EOS> but it 's not the immediate thing that you 're used to . <EOS> but uh it 's a good technology , i mean once they get used to it . <EOS> so , should we maybe say f a five so , should we give it a six ? <EOS> um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm i mean i d uh i dunno , i mean the the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , and moreover it it has um <other> l _ c _ d _ and everything , so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . <EOS> okay , so we give that a six , what do you reckon , five , six ? <EOS> six . <EOS> so , we need the average here , so i think we 've done very well , the average is about six and something . <EOS> <other> six point five , yeah . <EOS> that 's pretty good , i think . <EOS>
so we 've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . <EOS> and now we have to calculate the production costs . <EOS> so i 've got an excel spreadsheet to help us do that . <EOS> um i started filling it in , no hand dynamo , right ? <EOS> one simple battery . <EOS> the chip , we 're going for an advanced chip on print . <EOS> we also said the sample sensor and sample speaker . <EOS> um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . <EOS> case material we said rubber . <EOS> i do n't know what special colour means . <EOS> i think something coloured , but rubber comes coloured , does n't it ? <EOS> you know . <EOS> <other> maybe it 's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it 's different . <EOS> or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , we have pushbuttons , scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? <EOS> and we have l _ c _ display and button supplements . <EOS> yeah , but what do we ha we have l _ c _ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel we 've got more than one pushbutton though , that means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total does n't it ? <EOS> that seems unlikely . <EOS> whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we we have to count all of them , i do n't think that makes sense . <EOS> if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it 's a scroll wheel so we we 've put it 's pushbutton and scroll wheel and l _ c _ d _ display , so , as we can see , that 's way too expensive down here . <EOS> our budget 's twelve point five . <EOS>
yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that 's the most expensive thing on there . <EOS> so that has implications though for the . <EOS> uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . <EOS> when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello . <EOS> but that 's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , is n't it ? <EOS> mm <other> and the locator also goes away . <EOS> well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . <EOS> a also i in the case i 'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it 's just rubber , so it 's probably a flat surface rubber . <EOS> right , so we need one fifty off . <EOS> take it down to just a scroll wheel . <EOS> in the l _ c _ d _ we can scroll , right ? <EOS> how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the l _ c _ d _ ? <EOS> but how do we make a selection if we d can not push the button . <EOS> you can push this one , but we do n't have a pushbutton uh we ca we do n't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . <EOS> so that 's point three . <EOS> and i thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . <EOS> the scroll wheel is on the side . <EOS> we 're point three over at the moment . <EOS> unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume . <EOS> instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down . <EOS> oh look , we 're way under budget yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , could n't we ? <EOS> <laugh> <laugh> or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . <EOS> so did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ? <EOS> no , i do n't think so . <EOS> because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep l _ c _ d _ display . <EOS> instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . <EOS> <other> but we lose the locator . <EOS> so we still have the locate . <EOS> we 're gon na have a beep . <EOS> it can come in the same colour as the the case . <EOS>
so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they 're designing a product . <EOS> as far as creativity is concerned , yeah i think there was there was room for creativity . <EOS> the only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . <EOS> i think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . <EOS> if we 'd had that sheet at the beginning should 've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let 's just throw it together and do what we can . <EOS> but in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of . <EOS> i think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . <EOS> yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used . <EOS> the whiteboard digital pens . <EOS> <laugh> we like the pens . <EOS> <laugh> but that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the powerpoint , new ideas found . <EOS> not quite sure what about . <EOS> well it 's it 's it 's pretty new , i think we 'd like to think the ideas were new , <EOS>
i was i was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah . <EOS> yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the <other> i mean especially with that last-minute alteration . <EOS> i mean that was fairly tight anyway , but yeah , but i mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah . <EOS> you were n't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good . <EOS> and then the teamwork i think i think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah . <EOS> did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> i guess it was a fairly small group , so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah . <EOS> and my main difficulty was the the time pressure . <EOS> sometimes it 's like a little bit rushed . <EOS>
costs are within budget , one euro left over for bits that we did n't foresee . <EOS> um we 've evaluated the project . <EOS> can you put that in the project documents file ? <EOS> and the process wheel did n't really have any major problems with . <EOS> we 've got like five minutes left . <EOS> but if we 've finished , then we 've finished . <EOS> yeah , it was a pleasure working with you . <EOS> so i would say that 's the end of that meeting . <EOS> right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . <EOS> was there a questionnaire already sent ? <EOS> do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? <EOS> i do n't see why you ca n't stay here , really . <EOS>
right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . <EOS> was there a questionnaire already sent ? <EOS>
<other> okay . <EOS> so um basically going with our trend of vegetables and <laugh> we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . <EOS> and it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . <EOS>
and uh <other> the the l _ c _ d _ and and the scroll are inside . <EOS>
so we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three and then , well this is on off button . <EOS> the volume is is scrolling . <EOS>
yeah , i think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . <EOS>
one simple battery . <EOS> the chip , we 're going for an advanced chip on print . <EOS>
um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . <EOS>
and it 's the whole thing 's made of rubber , is that <EOS>
but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . <EOS> we 're gon na have a beep . <EOS>
left-handed people ca n't normally write right-handed , um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m <other> model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . <EOS> it might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , <EOS>
'cause the i mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you 've got it . <EOS> if <other> uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things but uh it 's a good technology , i mean once they get used to it . <EOS> but it 's not the immediate thing that you 're used to . <EOS>
but it 's not the immediate thing that you 're used to . <EOS>
so , as we can see , that 's way too expensive down here . <EOS> yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that 's the most expensive thing on there . <EOS> take it down to just a scroll wheel . <EOS> right , so we need one fifty off . <EOS> we 're point three over at the moment . <EOS> unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down . <EOS> the only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . <EOS>
i think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . <EOS> if we 'd had that sheet at the beginning should 've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let 's just throw it together and do what we can . <EOS>
so is the agenda ? <EOS> opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing . <EOS> project aim is a new remote control . <EOS> it 's original , uh trendy and it 's user-friendly . <EOS> try out the whiteboard , every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal . <EOS> so , i guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working . <EOS>
okay , project finance , selling price twenty five euros , profit aim fifty million euros . <EOS> market range internationally sold . <EOS> it 's got ta be ca n't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . <EOS> right , who 's got experiences with remote controls then ? <EOS> is this a t _ v _ one we are supposed to make ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah it 's a t _ v _ remote control . <EOS> are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that 's that 's big and i mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of t _ v _ and if you have whatever associated with t _ v _ the d _ v _ d _ player , or something like that , but like at the same time you do n't wan na really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . <EOS> 'cause i i i mean i was thinking something that 's got different like maybe a a an l _ c _ d _ display on it that 's got different pages for different devices , but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . <EOS> and then after we after we 've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not . <EOS> so would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . <EOS> could n't we have like one that comes out ? <EOS> you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically . <EOS> um have uh one very complicated one on one side with <other> all the d _ v _ d _ and v _ c _ r _ access and stuff , and then on the other side o <other> one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and <other> minus , and the just the mute button , for example . <EOS> i 'm not sure if it 's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . <EOS> no , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . <EOS> <other> d _ v _ d _ players , things like that . <EOS> but also devices connected to the to the t _ v _ , i mean , be able to operate i think we should also have a back-up plan of i 'cause i i i just think that it might be expensive to make something that but the the functions that we 're sure that we want are that it can control the t _ v _ , we should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just that is just for a t _ v _ , but it 's just a really good , nice one . <EOS> but what 'll make it what 'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? <EOS> have it be like ergonomic so it 's comfortable to use , or maybe even so something that 's for disabled people or big buttons for touchy buttons for <laugh> i think a flip up thing , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , <EOS>
user interface designer , that 's that 's so you got ta you go , you 're you 're gon na be the one that 's working out what what buttons we need . <EOS> um . <EOS> industrial designer , you are the one , you know , you 're gon na be working out kind of box it goes in , i guess so , um mm . <EOS> har how it works an and in marketing user requirements specifications . <EOS> do you think our two kind of overlap , because yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap . <EOS> you two <other> you two are gon na be just , i think , you just double up , you know , you working together . <EOS> you 're the one that 's got ta go and find out do th do the research , <EOS>
selling price twenty five euros , <EOS>
profit aim fifty million euros . <EOS>
market range internationally sold . <EOS>
it 's got ta be ca n't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . <EOS>
like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , <EOS>
but the the functions that we 're sure that we want are that it can control the t _ v _ , but also devices connected to the to the t _ v _ , i mean , be able to operate <EOS>
i think we should also have a back-up plan of i 'cause i i i just think that it might be expensive to make something that we should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just that is just for a t _ v _ , but it 's just a really good , nice one . <EOS>
so would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . <EOS> but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . <EOS> i think we should also have a back-up plan of i but also devices connected to the to the t _ v _ , i mean , be able to operate d _ v _ d _ players , things like that . <EOS> 'cause i i i just think that it might be expensive to make something that we should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just that is just for a t _ v _ , but it 's just a really good , nice one . <EOS>
um have uh one very complicated one on one side with <other> all the d _ v _ d _ and v _ c _ r _ access and stuff , and then on the other side o <other> one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and <other> minus , and the just the mute button , for example . <EOS> i 'm not sure if it 's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . <EOS> no , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . <EOS> <other> <EOS>
so i just wan na rather than going uh miss marketing and miss this and miss that <other> wanted to know your names again . <EOS> okay , right , welcome to meeting b _ . <EOS> um this is gon na go a lot better than the last meeting , basically , uh 'cause i know what i 'm supposed to be doing now . <EOS> and , uh yeah , i 'm just here to sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and i 'm gon na be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . <EOS> what this meeting is all about is um i 'm gon na have some presentations from all three of you , we 'll we 'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . <EOS> so i want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that . <EOS> this meeting it 's not very long . <EOS> it 's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . <EOS> um if you have n't done a powerpoint thingy , it does n't matter , <EOS>
i 'm gon na draw it on the board then . <EOS> so um <other> the idea is that we 've got the energy source um , so um i think maybe uh two batteries , then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . <EOS> is a battery like the only way of no 'cause like cha 'cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying . <EOS> swi i th i th i think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the t _ v _ , and still have it be operational ? <EOS> it 's never gon na be more than it 's never gon na be , you kno unless you 've got a t _ v _ the size of a football pitch , it 's not does n't have to go that far , well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . <EOS> yeah , yeah i d it sounds like you you w do n't wan na overcomplicate things . <EOS> how about bluetooth ? <EOS> does n't have to go through a wall , because you 're not gon na be looking through a wall . <EOS>
yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , i was i was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . <EOS> and so in the research that i was doing there 's basically two types of remotes , i mean people want a remote that 's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but um so things that <other> seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting i kind of gathered that that 's what we were going after , so , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . <EOS> um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or no that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as i know . <EOS> what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that 's really necessary ? <EOS> i would say it 's if it 's simple to do , and what i did n't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design . <EOS>
um i 've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred <other> well , something we should take into account is um we 've got ta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . <EOS> it 's got ta d look like it 's in the r _ and r _ . <EOS> uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , <EOS>
well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , so seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . <EOS> um <other> current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . <EOS> um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . <EOS> i was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . <EOS> um <other> has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . <EOS> and also we asked them whether they wanted <other> whether they 'd be interested in um <other> voice activating . <EOS> what about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? <EOS> most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , it 's older generation , they 're the ones that have gone out and but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote . <EOS> <other> voice activation might not be the best . <EOS> i would say scra i 'd say scrap that straight off . <EOS> um also with um with buttons , <other> a thing called r _ s _ i _ , i think we can do some really in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . <EOS>
we 've decided that it 's gon na be , you know uh , we 're going for a basic television remote . <EOS> i think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , uh and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries . <EOS> uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . <EOS> um . <EOS> <laugh> so are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as i i kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , well , it 's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders . <EOS> ca n't we have different colours in the remotes , and this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , so , i mean , we are sort of beholden to them . <EOS> so we have to have it one colour . <EOS> not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . <EOS> but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it 's one of our products so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps . <EOS> but it could come in different colours and have the r _ r _ colours just somewhere <EOS>
we should probably consult with our legal department uh . <EOS> i 'll see if i can get see if i can get hold of them for the next meeting . <EOS>
energy source , that would be batteries . <EOS>
um i 've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred <other> well , something we should take into account is um we 've got ta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . <EOS> it 's got ta d look like it 's in the r _ and r _ . <EOS> so , i mean , we are sort of beholden to them . <EOS> not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . <EOS> but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it 's one of our products <EOS>
<other> voice activation might not be the best . <EOS> i would say scra i 'd say scrap that straight off . <EOS>
and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , i guess . <EOS> um . <EOS> i think we can do some really in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . <EOS>
uh and that would be infra-red , yeah , yeah i d it sounds like you you w do n't wan na overcomplicate things . <EOS> it 's never gon na be more than it 's never gon na be , you kno unless you 've got a t _ v _ the size of a football pitch , it 's not does n't have to go that far , does n't have to go through a wall , because you 're not gon na be looking through a wall . <EOS>
as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the t _ v _ , and still have it be operational ? <EOS> it 's never gon na be more than it 's never gon na be , you kno unless you 've got a t _ v _ the size of a football pitch , it 's not does n't have to go that far , well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . <EOS>
um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or no that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as i know . <EOS> what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that 's really necessary ? <EOS> i would say it 's if it 's simple to do , <EOS>
and also we asked them whether they wanted <other> whether they 'd be interested in um <other> voice activating . <EOS> what about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? <EOS> most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , it 's older generation , they 're the ones that have gone out and but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote . <EOS> <other> voice activation might not be the best . <EOS> i would say scra i 'd say scrap that straight off . <EOS>
uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , i guess . <EOS> um . <EOS> i think we can do some really in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . <EOS>
<laugh> so are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as ca n't we have different colours in the remotes , i i kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , well , it 's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders . <EOS> and this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , so , i mean , we are sort of beholden to them . <EOS> so we have to have it one colour . <EOS> not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . <EOS> but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it 's one of our products so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps . <EOS> but it could come in different colours and have the r _ r _ colours just somewhere <EOS>
um alright first off we 'll just uh recap from our last meeting . <EOS> um <other> which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , <EOS>
<other> um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches , you can have a kinetic provision of energy , or you can use solar cells , but i 'm not sure about that indoors , really , but well , there 's sometimes combinations , i mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power . <EOS> and uh if we want something fancier , i think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . <EOS> <other> for the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . <EOS> you can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , <other> um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . <EOS> and th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium , you ca n't use it for if you if we 're choosing a double curved case , we ca n't choose titanium . <EOS> but if we 're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . <EOS> so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um l _ c _ d _ , which gives you a display . <EOS> um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . <EOS> um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be if we get an advanced chip which is um used for the l _ c _ d _ , the display thing , then that 's even more expensive . <EOS>
so that might be an idea of using the rubber , and also it does n't break as easily maybe , rubber , we 're all we 're all going we 're all liking that idea ? <EOS> mean so what 's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ? <EOS> <laugh> let 's have rubber push buttons , hey . <EOS> <other> is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which i presume is like one p _ c _ b _ and that 's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ? <EOS> well , if if it 's not chip on print then , i guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and does n't include the infra-red . <EOS> if it 's something that 's inside the the unit . <EOS> <other> i it does n't affects whether the customer 's gon na buy it or not . <EOS> so let 's not let 's uh not bother with the chip on print . <EOS> what about the just developed uh sample sensor ? <EOS> i 'm just guessing . <EOS> but it 's gon na be the most expensive option , probably and it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the t _ v _ on like , turn the t _ v _ on , and i turns comes on , a it just gives you a verbal response . <EOS> oh , then forget about it . <EOS> so rubber rubber keys , yeah . <EOS> so we want it rub rubber double curved . <EOS> <laugh> but the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-r _ s _ i _ ps specific <EOS>
okay , so i 'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . <EOS> uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . <EOS> they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an m _ p _ three player like ipod . <EOS> so i already mentioned the speech recognition interface . <EOS> i guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . <EOS> but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . <EOS> i can give you an example here of uh , good layout and bad layout so this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a v _ on both of them , so uh uh this is the example of the giant remote that 's impossible to lose . <EOS> uh so i was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . <EOS> i did n't i did n't think the spinning-wheel or the uh l _ c _ display were were crucial for us . <EOS> so we 're we 're not gon na have any sort of display i think uh . <EOS> i think we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , i mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . <EOS> it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . <EOS> um it seems like we would n't wan na make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , yeah , i would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , i i guess <other> the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . <EOS>
well , i 'm just basically letting you know what 's happening in the markets so the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have . <EOS> <other> um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . <EOS> next year 's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . <EOS> okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them . <EOS> and as it 's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , yeah , we 're we 're ahead of the game there . <EOS>
now the trouble is is we 've already decided that we 're going with the stuff that works already , that 's cheap . <EOS> i mean it 's different , but i would n't say like a rubber remote is fancy . <EOS> that 's why i was thinking , bluetooth , 'cause bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is <laugh> , they do n't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . <EOS> of course , they do . <EOS> so is is the advantage of bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other that would mean you 'd need a television that has bluetooth in it , which no no television does , well , if you 're looking at <other> if you looking at something that 's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . <EOS> like it does n't have to be , you know , bluetooth , if we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have <EOS>
and um i 'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though . <EOS> maybe make it like fruity colours or something . <EOS> the power button could be like a big apple or something . <EOS> um like i 'm just thinking bright colours . <EOS> wan na make it different colours so <other> anybody can choo like like so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they 're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing . <EOS>
from you catherine wi your y y you know you 're gon na be working on the the look and feel design . <EOS>
um gabriel , you 're gon na be working on , you know come up with the the user interface design . <EOS>
then basically , you two are gon na be working together on this . <EOS> come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas . <EOS> um and i think you are gon na get a chance to play with some clay . <EOS>
um and you 're gon na be working on the product evaluation . <EOS>
let 's have rubber push buttons , hey . <EOS> so rubber rubber keys , yeah . <EOS>
rubber , we 're all we 're all going we 're all liking that idea ? <EOS> so we want it rub rubber double curved . <EOS> <laugh> <EOS>
so let 's not let 's uh not bother with the chip on print . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> <other> yeah , this that 's that 's very good . <EOS> right , we 're gon na go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , <EOS>
so we want it rub rubber double curved . <EOS> <laugh> <EOS>
so we 're we 're not gon na have any sort of display i think uh . <EOS>
well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ? <EOS> what about the just developed uh sample sensor ? <EOS> it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the t _ v _ on like , turn the t _ v _ on , and i turns comes on , i 'm just guessing . <EOS> but it 's gon na be the most expensive option , probably and a it just gives you a verbal response . <EOS> oh , then forget about it . <EOS>
yeah , i would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , wan na make it different colours so <other> anybody can choo like like so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they 're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing . <EOS>
that 's why i was thinking , bluetooth , 'cause bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is <laugh> , they do n't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . <EOS> of course , they do . <EOS> so is is the advantage of bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other that would mean you 'd need a television that has bluetooth in it , which no no television does , well , if you 're looking at <other> if you looking at something that 's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . <EOS> like it does n't have to be , you know , bluetooth , <EOS>
and um i 'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though . <EOS> maybe make it like fruity colours or something . <EOS> the power button could be like a big apple or something . <EOS> um like i 'm just thinking bright colours . <EOS>
we 've got a cool prototype . <EOS> everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , double curved . <EOS> um but also something that was gon na jump out at people , so uh i think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you 'll see what a nice thing we have going here . <EOS> so , basically , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , <other> the thumb button is the power button . <EOS> your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , um and then then you can also there 's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . <EOS> but we think it 's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different . <EOS> that certainly does . <EOS> i think it 's , well , if the r _ r _ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , i 'd say that could be quite fashionable . <EOS> and it 's got the b the black and yellow and blue . <EOS>
i have one thing about it , but it 's a small thing , but it 'd mean we 'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one . <EOS> but , that 's i do n't see why that 's not possible . <EOS> like i was just thinking if there 's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ? <EOS> yeah , i know i know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer <other> for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse . <EOS> i think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so but we can have both uh have them in stock . <EOS>
one thing i do need to do we need to look at , is the costs . <EOS> i could do you know , i can do this o on my own or i could do it with you , but it 's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we 're going for the kinetic power . <EOS> so the case , we 've gone for the double curved . <EOS> and it 's made out of rubber . <EOS> well they 're in diff special colours , special form , we 're under budget . <EOS> that 's gon na cost ten ten euro seventy cents a unit to make . <EOS> and our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty . <EOS>
so we evaluate each criteria . <EOS> and we have to do it on a scale of one to seven , one being true , so it 's it 's more like it 's fits the criteria , and seven being as in it does n't fit the criteria . <EOS> so the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ? <EOS> i would give it a seven . <EOS> as in it 's not . <EOS> oh sorry , one , d yeah . <EOS> second criteria , new technology . <EOS> well , the kinetic thing , yeah . <EOS> maybe three , yeah . <EOS> so criteria three is is it easy to use ? <EOS> if we 're gon na have one left-handed and one right-handed then i would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two . <EOS> <other> 'kay , criteria four is costs . <EOS> it 's come in under budget . <EOS> so that 's a definite one . <EOS> amount of buttons . <EOS> contains only the necessary buttons . <EOS> r _ s _ i _ is it good against ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> very good . <EOS> does it get lost ? <EOS> i do n't think it 's gon na get lost easily . <EOS> but it is smallish . <EOS> i mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but <EOS>
w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new . <EOS> not if you 're left-handed it 's not . <EOS> so that 's the evaluation , <laugh> we 've , we 've done well . <EOS> number one product . <EOS>
okay , i i think um i just wan na put in as project manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they 've worked on it , during our design i mean there was some s some heated heated discussion , but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , and be you know , has been good communication going on . <EOS> <other> now you guys have been a a great team . <EOS> and i think we 've co we have come we 've come up with something new , something that has n't been done before , i think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know . <EOS> um how does everyone feel about the technology that 's been used in this ? <EOS> the sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ? <EOS> i love it . <EOS> <laugh> i love it . <EOS> <laugh> i think it 's cool . <EOS> um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , i do n't think it 's such a new thing . <EOS> it would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it 's not it 's literally that 'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text . <EOS> i think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it 's just the first step . <EOS>
but it 'd mean we 'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one . <EOS> but , that 's i do n't see why that 's not possible . <EOS> like i was just thinking if there 's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ? <EOS> yeah , i know i know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer <other> for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse . <EOS> i think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so but we can have both uh have them in stock . <EOS>
good morning everybody . <EOS> um i 'm just gon na have a little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . <EOS> my name is rose lindgren . <EOS> i i 'll be the project manager . <EOS> um our agenda today is we are gon na do a little opening and then i 'm gon na talk a little bit about the project , then we 'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise . <EOS> and then we 'll move into the project plan , do a little discussion <EOS>
um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . <EOS> um so we 're gon na divide us up into three <other> compa three parts . <EOS> first the functional design which will be uh first we 'll do individual work , come into a meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting . <EOS>
um we 're gon na do a little tool training , so we are gon na work with that whiteboard behind you . <EOS> um introduce yourself , and then draw your favourite animal my name is alima bucciantini . <EOS> and i guess i 'm the industrial designer on this project . <EOS> i will draw a little turtle for you all . <EOS> my name is iain uh and i 'm the user interface designer for the project . <EOS> um . <EOS> it 's a whale <laugh> , yes . <EOS> i 'm jessy . <EOS> briefly , it 's supposed to be a seal . <EOS>
we 're gon na talk about project finances . <EOS> we 'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television it 's a we have a market range of internet , like it 's an international market range , um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty euro . <EOS>
just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , i could i 'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like um i hate when there 's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the t _ v _ 'cause i feel like you end up with multimedia overload . <EOS> especially , like you know if i 'm watching t _ v _ i have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , you know , one for the t _ v _ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . <EOS> um . <EOS> and also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , uh too too sort of too sort of complicated they 've got too many buttons on them and that there 's not too many buttons , they are not too small , like are there some remotes that don do n't require like batteries but it 's possible we could use like a lithium battery it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . <EOS> i guess we have to define what what we 're aiming for . <EOS>
it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . <EOS> does n't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off , so it 's like if you 're looki if you 're trying to get the t _ v _ on that 's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , i dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we 're gon na make it , but if it 's like all the t _ v _ stuff was here , then all the v _ c _ r _ stuff was here , all the whatever else we have programmed into it it 's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , and if um if you 'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you would n't need to use every day . <EOS> would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ? <EOS> are we designing a remote control for a television only um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ? <EOS> <other> i 'll look into that . <EOS> if it 's just a television then that it 's a bit simpler , if you have older people or people like me that are n't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it 's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it . <EOS> so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . <EOS>
<other> i 'll look into that . <EOS>
um the industrial design , alima will be doing um the working design . <EOS>
um the user interface designer , that 's for . <EOS> technical functions , i guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons . <EOS>
um user requirements um , so you 'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need , <EOS>
can you e-mail your slides as well ? <EOS> yes , i yes , i think i can . <EOS> i 'll just attach it to an email . <EOS> and probably email those out to all of you . <EOS> um just including all the things that we talked about . <EOS> um . <EOS>
we 'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million euro um from our sales <EOS>
we 'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million euro um from our sales <EOS>
and because this is such this is for television it 's a we have a market range of internet , like it 's an international market range , <EOS>
um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty euro . <EOS>
so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . <EOS>
and if um if you 'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you would n't need to use every day . <EOS>
it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . <EOS> does n't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off , so it 's like if you 're looki if you 're trying to get the t _ v _ on that 's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , i dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we 're gon na make it , but if it 's like all the t _ v _ stuff was here , then all the v _ c _ r _ stuff was here , all the whatever else we have programmed into it it 's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , and if um if you 'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you would n't need to use every day . <EOS> so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . <EOS>
would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ? <EOS> are we designing a remote control for a television only um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ? <EOS> <other> i 'll look into that . <EOS> if it 's just a television then that it 's a bit simpler , if you have older people or people like me that are n't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it 's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it . <EOS>
this is our functional design meeting . <EOS> our agenda today um um . <EOS> i 'm gon na do an opening , did you all get the minutes ? <EOS> i e-mailed them to you . <EOS> i 'm also putting 'em them in the shared folder . <EOS> so um then i we 'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations . <EOS> um i 'll talk about the new project requirements i 've just received , and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions . <EOS> uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . <EOS>
i do n't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online or if i 'm the only one who is . <EOS> we 're just gon na talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked . <EOS> they had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had . <EOS> focusing on their desires , um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly <laugh> , seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote . <EOS> and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , that being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes . <EOS> i think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration . <EOS> people are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and i think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there 's too many buttons , it also mentioned something called r _ s _ i _ and i was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what r _ s _ i _ is , repetitive strain injury . <EOS> so i guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , um looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people 's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour . <EOS> people are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote . <EOS> people also zap like to change the channel , about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use . <EOS> so we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , the idea of an l _ c _ d _ screen was brought up although they did n't have any details on what people 's preferences on that were , also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting is n't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that 's used a lot more often . <EOS> and basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , <EOS>
i 'm gon na talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um . <EOS> we need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . <EOS> it 's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , it sends a message to the television first thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . <EOS> so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does , and what the end-user is gon na want from this product . <EOS> a way i 'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about h how well these particular prototypes work , when a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . <EOS> so in some sense we 're gon na we 're gon na have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design but i think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . <EOS> uh the first of these is is technological uh we need to find a balance between features and price . <EOS> things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product . <EOS> um personally wa what i want from a remote control is a device that 's simple , uh it 's got big buttons for doing the things i do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel . <EOS> that 's ergonomically designed . <EOS> i think there 's there 's certainly a market for technology that looks cool . <EOS>
i had a look on the on the web uh to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . <EOS> in analysing these we can consider what what things what 's good about them , um how we can improve on the designs that that that i found here 's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum . <EOS> um on the left here we 've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control , so it 's one that 's got lots of buttons , the one on the right is a lot more basic . <EOS> it would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , uh there 's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control . <EOS> everything you might possibly want to do is there , <EOS>
this is our working design presentation . <EOS> um i had a bit of some issues with this , because i was n't able to find everything i needed , what we 're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function . <EOS> um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder . <EOS> because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work . <EOS> so you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function . <EOS> the findings that i got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that um the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data , the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that 's gon na m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that 's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that 's gon na let us move the data to the receiver . <EOS> and <laugh> personal preferences , besides the fact that i ca n't spell , we need a long-lasting energy source , we need a chip that works well with the user interface , and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal , <EOS>
requirements . <EOS> we have a couple new requirements but we 're not gon na work with teletext we did n't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far , what 's teletext ? <EOS> uh , it 's a british thing . <EOS> i suppose it 's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser . <EOS> this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it . <EOS> and it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what 's on t _ v _ next and share prices and that kind of thing . <EOS> it 's earl it 's pretty old technology . <EOS> like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera . <EOS> just for television . <EOS> that 's what we 're focused on . <EOS> um otherwise becomes to complex , um and finally there 's more marketing , i think , um , our corporate image has to be recognisable . <EOS> while we 're gon na make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design . <EOS> it 's it 's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics . <EOS> and we have that the emphasis on the r _ s in um looks like , yeah , kind of a yellow and black it 's like double r _ . <EOS> we need to talk about our functions and our target group . <EOS> you um in your analysis of different market um of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things if we 're gon na say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically , i think , a sort of younger group that that 's who 's gon na be attracted to this . <EOS> i do think , who 's gon na have the money to buy that also , that one ? <EOS> at least right now what we 're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself , the only break-down that i was given in terms of age was the voice activation so it 's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that 's a good idea . <EOS> that 's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , that 's all specific for speech recognition . <EOS> are we gon na use that as one of our functions ? <EOS> i i would say no , because it 's gon na add too much to the price . <EOS> and i wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many other compromises . <EOS> but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement ? <EOS> everything we 're talking about is ease of use and simple if someone 's looking to buy a new remote , do n't they want like an upgrade ? <EOS> or we can look at um user-friendly . <EOS> and we also need to talk about if we 're only gon na have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , 'cause then 's like people who do n't wan na ever look at them , never even have to see them what are we emphasising ? <EOS> i what in this project ? <EOS> which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , si simplicity and fashion . <EOS> what can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , i think it 's a lot <other> to do with battery , so 's just the quality of the chip . <EOS> so our target group , we 're saying , fifteen to thirty five ? <EOS> i dunno how useful that number is if we 're not doing s voice recognition , and if the whole idea is you 're using a remote then why would you have voice , like you know what i mean and then it 's like you would n't need a remote it 's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , i mean if i get m more numbers , i 'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages . <EOS> but i th i think regardless we 're we 're aiming for the under sixty five or something . <EOS> can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families ? <EOS> it 's it 's hard to narrow it down . <EOS> i think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages . <EOS> so it 's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , maybe we do n't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age , so maybe it 's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is do we want some kind of thing to find it if it 's lost ? <EOS> like a button on a t _ v _ you can press it would be relevant to like the overall goal i think , um so we want something to keep it from getting lost . <EOS> and <other> we want um we want large buttons for the essential things . <EOS> we want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions . <EOS> which are kind of hidden away in some way battery ? <EOS> do we need a long-life battery ? <EOS> we should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all . <EOS> but you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your ipod . <EOS> yeah , that 's that 's possible . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that might contribute to less people losing it too if it <laugh> it stays in one place . <EOS> that 's <other> that 's a good idea , <EOS>
um after the meeting we 're gon na each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries summary . <EOS>
after that we have thirty minutes of individual work . <EOS>
um i 'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these powerpoint slides . <EOS>
if everyone could do that as well , that 'd be great . <EOS>
i _ um i _ d _ industrial design you 've your components concept , <EOS>
user interface , the user interface concept , <EOS>
market trend wa watching . <EOS>
we did n't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far , but we 're not gon na work with teletext <EOS>
like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera . <EOS> just for television . <EOS> that 's what we 're focused on . <EOS>
um and finally there 's more marketing , i think , um , our corporate image has to be recognisable . <EOS> while we 're gon na make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design . <EOS>
si simplicity and fashion . <EOS>
si simplicity and fashion . <EOS> i think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages . <EOS> so it 's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , maybe we do n't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age , so maybe it 's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is <EOS>
um so we want something to keep it from getting lost . <EOS>
and <other> we want um we want large buttons for the essential things . <EOS>
we want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions . <EOS>
'cause then 's like people who do n't wan na ever look at them , never even have to see them and then you could like pull something out , that had like the main buttons like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , which are kind of hidden away in some way <EOS>
that 's <other> that 's a good idea , but you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your ipod . <EOS>
if we 're gon na say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically , i think , a sort of younger group that that 's who 's gon na be attracted to this . <EOS> i do think , who 's gon na have the money to buy that also , that one ? <EOS> the only break-down that i was given in terms of age was the voice activation so it 's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that 's a good idea . <EOS> that 's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , so our target group , we 're saying , fifteen to thirty five ? <EOS> i dunno how useful that number is if we 're not doing s voice recognition , but i th i think regardless we 're we 're aiming for the under sixty five or something . <EOS> can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families ? <EOS> it 's it 's hard to narrow it down . <EOS>
are we gon na use that as one of our functions ? <EOS> i i would say no , because it 's gon na add too much to the price . <EOS> and i wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many other compromises . <EOS> and if the whole idea is you 're using a remote then why would you have voice , like you know what i mean and then it 's like you would n't need a remote it 's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , <EOS>
which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , what can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , i think it 's a lot <other> to do with battery , so 's just the quality of the chip . <EOS>
battery ? <EOS> do we need a long-life battery ? <EOS> we should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all . <EOS> but you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your ipod . <EOS> yeah , that 's that 's possible . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that might contribute to less people losing it too if it <laugh> it stays in one place . <EOS>
um these are our minutes from r the functional design . <EOS> we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , and we said it 's for all age groups , different um functions of it . <EOS> our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . <EOS> specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece <other> and a long-life battery or a charging station . <EOS>
components design . <EOS> the main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . <EOS> uh the options that i 've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , um there 's there 's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . <EOS> i have n't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic . <EOS> for buttons we have um pushbuttons , but we also have scror scroll wheels , which can have integrated pushbuttons , and have an l _ l _ c _ d _ screen . <EOS> or we could go all high-tech <other> um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , and then battery i think is where things get most exciting . <EOS> um we can we can have your sort of basic double a _ batteries , but we also have these options of um <other> using a kinetic battery , um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . <EOS> or a solar battery , although there are slight um <other> complications with solar batteries as in we ca n't use a latex case if we have a solar battery . <EOS> or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . <EOS> um personal preferences that i was thinking through here 's what we 've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . <EOS> so if we 're going for fashion in our cases , i think that what we 're gon na wan na look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . <EOS> maybe titanium , maybe some wood . <EOS> we 're gon na have to investigate that better when i get specifics of the actual materials , and we wan na go for simplicity . <EOS> probably pushbuttons , but i 'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything and i 'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . <EOS> but i think we 'd also wan na go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down . <EOS> uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we 're gon na start using an l _ c _ d _ . <EOS> <other> solar i do n't think would be such a good idea , is double-curved like would be like two hands kind of thing ? <EOS> i 'm not sure . <EOS> but i 'll let you know as soon as i get any pictures . <EOS> i know if we do have a double-curved case , it ca n't have any titanium in it . <EOS> um the weight of these different elements , have you no idea , no idea . <EOS> um i 'm assuming that a kinetic battery is n't gon na take up that much weight , but if anyone has any specific questions , do n't hesitate to email me or something . <EOS>
i 'm gon na describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device . <EOS> so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are we have a number of different choices for a design concept um uh once we 've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , <laugh> m we do n't want lots of buttons , uh complicated features . <EOS> here 's a a fairly simple device . <EOS> this is an an ipod from apple . <EOS> uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small l _ c _ d _ screen . <EOS> so i think that 's that 's a good a good kind of model that we could have . <EOS> um <other> here 's a another example . <EOS> and i think i it looks pretty cool . <EOS> uh it 's nice and colourful , it 's nice and bright . <EOS> if you 're watching t _ v _ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button 's which i <other> i like i like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . <EOS>
we 'd either have a small l _ c _ d _ display on the device itself , or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television there 's no point having a television that you ca n't tune or that you ca n't set the contrast , so we need to find a way of including these somehow . <EOS> so you 'd be advocating an l _ c _ d _ then ? <EOS> i think that 's <other> that 's one way to go , um i mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an l _ c _ d _ display , an an l _ c _ d _ display would have to be quite small , um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , the alternative is to have a <other> an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . <EOS> uh but i think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it 's um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . <EOS> i think i think we 're talking menu like contrast and tuning the v _ c _ r _ or something if i 've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what 's on . <EOS>
we 're gon na look a little bit at trend watching . <EOS> that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in paris and milan commented on some things that are gon na be going on this year . <EOS> and right now i d they 're saying that currently there 's a functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it it that 's gon na be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , they 're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it 's fancy look and feel . <EOS> and as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , <other> the second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations . <EOS> and then ease of use was the third most important , <other> and then <laugh> the fashion watch talks about that this year 's top trend for clothes , shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there 's a preference for spongy , <other> tight material . <EOS> <laugh> and so that brings us to my personal preferences . <EOS> who wants a spongy remote or one with <laugh> fruit and vegetable padding . <EOS> personally , i do n't really think that i want one that 's gon na go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , um in a year , so and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . <EOS> also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by real reaction , i 'm a little hesitant as to <other> like , how these questions may have been worded , but if we 're working for this company then i guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most . <EOS>
um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? <EOS> um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ? <EOS> could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? <EOS> if it 's latex if it 's latexy my understanding of a latex case is that it 's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , there 's something to be said , i mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to r _ r _ repetitive stress injuries and things i 'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle , <other> could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? <EOS> um couple main ones being like , i dunno , lemons or strawberries or something . <EOS> <laugh> i is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? <EOS> uh like uh i dunno , like uh carrots or something . <EOS> or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . <EOS> what about the idea of like a round remote ? <EOS> instead of like a vertical up and down one . <EOS> like in terms of holding it . <EOS> like that 's a f shape of a fruit . <EOS> would you think you you do you think you 'd be able to hold it ? <EOS> could could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? <EOS> in different fruit and vegetable colours , <EOS>
i love the idea of the wheel like the ipod . <EOS> or is it li more like a scroll thing ? <EOS> and you press the centre button , that 's that 's your all-purpose select button right there . <EOS> i think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . <EOS> i think an <other> l _ c _ d _ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice . <EOS> um i 've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex components concept . <EOS> energy , chip on print . <EOS> can you just explain what that is real quick ? <EOS> what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? <EOS> <other> i think it 's awesome . <EOS> i think it 's really cool . <EOS> as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is , i got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . <EOS> which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . <EOS> al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , i think . <EOS> i do n't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . <EOS> i guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe . <EOS> if we 're gon na have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , do we want a scroll wheel , um i do n't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . <EOS> it would be nice for changing the volume , but i do n't know how useful it 'd be for changing the channel . <EOS> you really need buttons for changing a channel . <EOS> and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as i 'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . <EOS> when you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . <EOS> i think yeah , i think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it 's not necessary . <EOS> um uh i 'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . <EOS> could it be hard , and then something around it ? <EOS> i would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . <EOS> what i 've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that <other> there 's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it 's just covered with the latex . <EOS> um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours . <EOS> and we want a curved case , or a double-curved ? <EOS> um and i think if we wan na keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , for channel surfing i think a scroll an actual like an ipod 's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , i think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case i mean i 'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it 's more just to give it a different kind of look , we 're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through . <EOS> so we 're gon na have like a menu button , and then supplements , we 're gon na go with um type pushbuttons , uh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu . <EOS> pre-set channels i think maybe numbers seems is kind of old-fashioned . <EOS> let 's go with a simple chip ? <EOS> um did we decide on a chip ? <EOS> but if it 's gon na be in a latex type thing and that 's gon na look cool , then that 's probably gon na have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel . <EOS>
and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . <EOS>
um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , <EOS>
um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , <EOS>
um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , <EOS>
we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , <EOS>
what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? <EOS> <other> i think it 's awesome . <EOS> i think it 's really cool . <EOS> i think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case <EOS>
but if it 's gon na be in a latex type thing and that 's gon na look cool , then that 's probably gon na have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel . <EOS> uh i 'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . <EOS> what i 've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that <other> there 's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it 's just covered with the latex . <EOS>
um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours . <EOS>
um and i think if we wan na keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , we 're gon na go with um type pushbuttons , <EOS>
so we 're gon na have like a menu button , uh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu . <EOS> pre-set channels <EOS>
let 's go with a simple chip ? <EOS> um did we decide on a chip ? <EOS>
i think that 's <other> that 's one way to go , so you 'd be advocating an l _ c _ d _ then ? <EOS> we 'd either have a small l _ c _ d _ display on the device itself , or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television um i mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an l _ c _ d _ display , an an l _ c _ d _ display would have to be quite small , um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , the alternative is to have a <other> an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . <EOS> uh but i think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it 's um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . <EOS> i think i think we 're talking menu like contrast and tuning the v _ c _ r _ or something if i 've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what 's on . <EOS>
my understanding of a latex case is that it 's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , there 's something to be said , i mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to r _ r _ repetitive stress injuries and things and then like the the covers could be spongy latex uh i 'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . <EOS> could it be hard , and then something around it ? <EOS> i would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . <EOS> what i 've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that <other> there 's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it 's just covered with the latex . <EOS>
um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? <EOS> um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ? <EOS> <other> could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? <EOS> um couple main ones being like , i dunno , lemons or strawberries or something . <EOS> <laugh> i is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? <EOS> uh like uh i dunno , like uh carrots or something . <EOS> or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . <EOS> what about the idea of like a round remote ? <EOS> instead of like a vertical up and down one . <EOS> like in terms of holding it . <EOS> like that 's a f shape of a fruit . <EOS> would you think you you do you think you 'd be able to hold it ? <EOS> could could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? <EOS> in different fruit and vegetable colours , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours . <EOS>
my understanding of a latex case is that it 's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , i think . <EOS> i do n't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . <EOS>
i guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe . <EOS> if we 're gon na have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , <EOS>
or is it li more like a scroll thing ? <EOS> i love the idea of the wheel like the ipod . <EOS> and you press the centre button , that 's that 's your all-purpose select button right there . <EOS> i think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . <EOS> do we want a scroll wheel , um i do n't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . <EOS> it would be nice for changing the volume , but i do n't know how useful it 'd be for changing the channel . <EOS> you really need buttons for changing a channel . <EOS> and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as i 'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . <EOS> when you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . <EOS> i think yeah , i think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it 's not necessary . <EOS> um um and i think if we wan na keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , for channel surfing i think a scroll an actual like an ipod 's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , i think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case i mean i 'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it 's more just to give it a different kind of look , but if it 's gon na be in a latex type thing and that 's gon na look cool , then that 's probably gon na have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel . <EOS>
and we want a curved case , or a double-curved ? <EOS>
we 're gon na use a kinetic battery um , we want to use a simple chip , we 're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that 's curved and um we 're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu . <EOS> we made three different prototypes our colours not are not fixed , uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . <EOS> we have our up and down buttons , which are also gon na be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . <EOS> if you push if you 're just pushing these normally , they 're the menu buttons , if uh the volume buttons rather . <EOS> if you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . <EOS> that 's our number one prototype . <EOS> the little lightning bolt in it , very cute . <EOS> we call that one the rhombus , um this one is known as the potato , it 's an ergonomic shape , um i 've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . <EOS> um the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . <EOS> so you 've got volume up and volume down on the other side here . <EOS> uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ? <EOS> it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your t _ v _ off . <EOS> and then finally we have um the martian or the pear , either way . <EOS> um it 's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . <EOS> uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top . <EOS> <laugh> and then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , plus it 's an interesting talking point to have standing up . <EOS> we figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if i made the bot the bottom flat . <EOS> <laugh> in terms of making decisions , what we 'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons normally we 'd go for fruity colours , but maybe we 're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , i sort of like this one , it just it 's like small but still sort of like cute looking , but i dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ? <EOS>
but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost . <EOS> we were we were talking about that a little bit and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it it 's not just like another piece of technology around your house . <EOS> it 's gon na be somewhere that it can be seen . <EOS> so we 're we 're not thinking that it 's gon na be as critical to have the loss would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like i dunno , you tape to your to your t _ v _ um that when you press it a little light beep goes off ? <EOS> i think it would be difficult technologically , and then i wonder if it 's if it 's more just a gimmick then anything else . <EOS> there might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon . <EOS> um we so we do we 've decided not to worry about that for now . <EOS> 'cause well , the designs are very bright , so you 're right , they 're gon na stick out , it was inspired by the potato , <EOS>
um uh why do n't we do a product evaluation using your criteria , i think we 're supposed to have one that we do it for . <EOS> i was a little vague on what exactly i 'm supposed to do , i have to like write something on the whiteboard , so . <EOS> it 's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing , it makes look more fruity as well . <EOS> there it could have a stem like that , is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? <EOS> variety of colours are nice . <EOS> i think i 'm leaning towards the potato . <EOS> that 's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one . <EOS> potato . <EOS> some of the things that we 've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . <EOS> what we sort of wan na do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then i 'll tabulate an average and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all , or false , first we wan na know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective . <EOS> in my opinion the <other> for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so i 'm gon na say it 's like a three . <EOS> i i kind of think it 's it 's unique enough that i 'd give it a one or a two . <EOS> i dunno if fancy is the word i would use . <EOS> and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? <EOS> i think it 's extremely functional , i think it 'll get everything done , then i 'm gon na give it a two . <EOS> um is it technologically innovative ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> not really , i mean not so much , 'cause we we do n't have the l _ c _ d _ screen , the kinetic battery . <EOS> how many people would notice that , though ? <EOS> and if it 's made of like latex , that whole idea , that 's pretty cool . <EOS> think i 'm gon na go with the four as well . <EOS> um we next wan na see if it has a spongy quality and <laugh> if indeed it 's made of latex or rubber i it 's spongy all the way . <EOS> <laugh> give it a one . <EOS> and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables <laugh> ? <EOS> is it gon na be yellow ? <EOS> we might wan na keep it yellow . <EOS> i know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in and the outside in yellow , that 'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that 's more fruity . <EOS> um and can we have like an r _ r _ inscribed on the bottom or something ? <EOS> it was inspired by the potato , so i think it 's pretty fruity . <EOS> i think i it 's kind of mangoey too . <EOS> that 's a much more trendy than a potato <laugh> um , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? <EOS> remember earlier we discussed that people do n't use a lot of buttons , so i 'm gon na give it a one . <EOS> also we talked earlier about r _ s _ i _ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like carpal tunnely kind of thing . <EOS> do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ? <EOS> i think i 'll give it a two , and if it 's repetitive movement it is gon na be only four buttons that you 're constantly pushing , and the ease of learning it . <EOS> the menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but i think if it 's one it 's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you 'll have it afterwards . <EOS> so i 'd i think i 'd give it a two i guess . <EOS> because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take a bit of learning at first , so i 'd i 'd give it a four . <EOS> also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we 're not addressing that at all , i think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , i 'm gon na i 'm gon na give it a four , <other> how w how well does it address just being simple ? <EOS> um it like wants to be simple but it 's not like totally totally simple , i 'm give it a three i guess . <EOS> and fashionable ? <EOS> it 's totally fashionable . <EOS> i think it 's bringing technology and fashion together real really well . <EOS> and does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , that whole thing ? <EOS> if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements . <EOS> so i 'll give it a a two . <EOS> we did n't we did n't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , so let 's let 's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an r _ r _ on it . <EOS> i think all of them should have an r _ r _ . <EOS>
first we wan na know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective . <EOS> in my opinion the <other> for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so i 'm gon na say it 's like a three . <EOS> i i kind of think it 's it 's unique enough that i 'd give it a one or a two . <EOS> i dunno if fancy is the word i would use . <EOS> and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? <EOS> i think it 's extremely functional , i think it 'll get everything done , then i 'm gon na give it a two . <EOS> um is it technologically innovative ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> not really , i mean not so much , 'cause we we do n't have the l _ c _ d _ screen , the kinetic battery . <EOS> how many people would notice that , though ? <EOS> and if it 's made of like latex , that whole idea , that 's pretty cool . <EOS> think i 'm gon na go with the four as well . <EOS> um we next wan na see if it has a spongy quality and <laugh> if indeed it 's made of latex or rubber i it 's spongy all the way . <EOS> <laugh> give it a one . <EOS> and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables <laugh> ? <EOS> is it gon na be yellow ? <EOS> we might wan na keep it yellow . <EOS> i know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in and the outside in yellow , that 'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that 's more fruity . <EOS> um and can we have like an r _ r _ inscribed on the bottom or something ? <EOS> so i think it 's pretty fruity . <EOS> i think i it 's kind of mangoey too . <EOS> that 's a much more trendy than a potato <laugh> um , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? <EOS> remember earlier we discussed that people do n't use a lot of buttons , so i 'm gon na give it a one . <EOS> also we talked earlier about r _ s _ i _ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like carpal tunnely kind of thing . <EOS> do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ? <EOS> i think i 'll give it a two , and if it 's repetitive movement it is gon na be only four buttons that you 're constantly pushing , and the ease of learning it . <EOS> the menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but i think if it 's one it 's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you 'll have it afterwards . <EOS> so i 'd i think i 'd give it a two i guess . <EOS> because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take a bit of learning at first , so i 'd i 'd give it a four . <EOS> also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we 're not addressing that at all , i think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , i 'm gon na i 'm gon na give it a four , <other> how w how well does it address just being simple ? <EOS> um it like wants to be simple but it 's not like totally totally simple , i 'm give it a three i guess . <EOS> and fashionable ? <EOS> it 's totally fashionable . <EOS> i think it 's bringing technology and fashion together real really well . <EOS> and does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , that whole thing ? <EOS> if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements . <EOS> so i 'll give it a a two . <EOS> we did n't we did n't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , so let 's let 's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an r _ r _ on it . <EOS> i think all of them should have an r _ r _ . <EOS>
now we 're gon na look at finances . <EOS> um i have an excel sheet that we 're actually gon na calculate the cost um , we 're using kinetic battery , simple . <EOS> guess it 's double-curved . <EOS> do n't we need plastic , and it was rubber and special colour , we 're using we 're gon na need at least two special colours . <EOS> i do n't know what the se the basic colour is though . <EOS> like we 'll have yellow and black . <EOS> maybe the r _ r _ will be in colour as well , and how many buttons do we have ? <EOS> we have six . <EOS> the case material will just have one colour , but then the buttons will be in special colours ? <EOS> special form ? <EOS> i think they 're fine . <EOS> material , we want them rubber as well probably , yeah . <EOS> thirteen point seven . <EOS> what can we reduce ? <EOS> let 's have our buttons all be one colour . <EOS> maybe it 's single-curved , <laugh> it 's single curved . <EOS> case material is rubber and it 's a special colour , it was it was thirteen and now it 's fifteen . <EOS> now it 's twelve . <EOS> what was our target price again ? <EOS> twelve point five . <EOS> so we 're okay , i think . <EOS> um are the are the costs under twelve fifty euro ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> i thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally , <EOS>
let 's move on to the project evaluation . <EOS> project process . <EOS> satisfaction with for example the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found . <EOS> so i guess what we 're gon na talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project , the information we got on the news , how we used it , if we were able to um , you know , use our creativity with the information , um how how well i guess i led it , um the how well we worked together as a team , um the digital pens , the whiteboard . <EOS> i felt very creative . <EOS> <laugh> <laugh> i think we 've been successful i enjoyed making the prototypes . <EOS> i think we could 've done even better with a little bit more information , like what 's a single-curved case , but given given what we had i think that we did we did really well . <EOS> if i 'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables , maybe we could 've taken that into account . <EOS> i thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally , that was the last one , like i chose not to do a powerpoint i think we all made um very significant contributions , i do n't think anybody dominated it , mm . <EOS> what did we find for new ideas ? <EOS> people should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables . <EOS> i i am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them . <EOS> is the project evaluated ? <EOS> yes . <EOS>
i felt very creative . <EOS> <laugh> <laugh> i think we 've been successful i enjoyed making the prototypes . <EOS> i think we could 've done even better with a little bit more information , like what 's a single-curved case , but given given what we had i think that we did we did really well . <EOS> if i 'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables , maybe we could 've taken that into account . <EOS> that was the last one , like i chose not to do a powerpoint i think we all made um very significant contributions , i do n't think anybody dominated it , people should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables . <EOS> i i am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them . <EOS> is the project evaluated ? <EOS> yes . <EOS>
there 's the final questionnaire and meeting summary . <EOS> this is the great product kids , and that we have a market for it , um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the um the final results <laugh> i do like the martian remote . <EOS> if we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice . <EOS> although the tog toggle i would break it . <EOS> <other> i would break it . <EOS> <laugh> is it started as a pear , kind of looks like a penguin , like <laugh> with no eye <laugh> . <EOS> nothing will come up until after our meeting 's supposed to be over , <EOS>
otherwise the technology today was kinda cool . <EOS> i got more master classes , what did i get through the corporate website ? <EOS> it 's just inspiration about circuit boards . <EOS> the excel thing is pretty cool . <EOS> i learned a lot actually . <EOS> i could probably take apart a remote control now if i really needed to . <EOS> i wrote it all down , because i thought it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control , but then they 're like , you do n't actually need this i i thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing . <EOS> . <EOS> we did n't we did n't use the whiteboard that much although i do n't see how we could have very l at least for me and i think usually , like whiteboards are good , you know like crossing out ideas , or like if we had had like a brainstorming period . <EOS> we could 've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it , and with and with the powerpoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on powerpoint 'cause we all needed them separately , kind of on the whiteboards in this room . <EOS> when you were um creating your um prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ? <EOS> . <EOS> uh we we worked together like we sort of made different well done with the management , i felt well managed . <EOS> . <EOS> i think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time it 's kinda fun . <EOS> actually we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings <laugh> i know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided . <EOS> but i think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings i think the last time we had a lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough , like we we could n't answer every single question . <EOS> and i i felt the first two meetings , that i was coming in with no information , um . <EOS> i 'm a little i am a little disappointed that we did n't do a um something for losing the remote , just gon na make i 'm making full minutes , so that it 'll include all of the agenda and all that . <EOS> how much of your powerpoint was already done for you , most of it , i did n't even think about adding slides , 'cause i would just get slides with titles on them i think the r _ and r _ , especially if the yellow and black one . <EOS> i think we just need the um the r _ r _ , 'cause they did n't give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or . <EOS> i guess it is black , grey . <EOS> i just feel like if you 're really doing like a a really big market evaluation , you would n't just have like one set of source , <EOS>
is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? <EOS> variety of colours are nice . <EOS> i think i 'm leaning towards the potato . <EOS> that 's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one . <EOS> potato . <EOS>
um we so we do we 've decided not to worry about that for now . <EOS> 'cause well , the designs are very bright , so you 're right , they 're gon na stick out , <EOS>
um and can we have like an r _ r _ inscribed on the bottom or something ? <EOS> so let 's let 's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an r _ r _ on it . <EOS> i think all of them should have an r _ r _ . <EOS>
but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in and the outside in yellow , that 'd be our corporate one <EOS>
we have six . <EOS>
let 's have our buttons all be one colour . <EOS>
maybe it 's single-curved , <laugh> it 's single curved . <EOS>
case material is rubber <EOS>
and it 's a special colour , <EOS>
it 's gon na be somewhere that it can be seen . <EOS> and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it it 's not just like another piece of technology around your house . <EOS> we were we were talking about that a little bit but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost . <EOS> so we 're we 're not thinking that it 's gon na be as critical to have the loss would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like i dunno , you tape to your to your t _ v _ um that when you press it a little light beep goes off ? <EOS> i think it would be difficult technologically , and then i wonder if it 's if it 's more just a gimmick then anything else . <EOS> there might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon . <EOS> um we so we do we 've decided not to worry about that for now . <EOS> 'cause well , the designs are very bright , so you 're right , they 're gon na stick out , <EOS>
we 're making a remote control um we 've got to make something as fashionable as possible , and then finally we 'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me <other> tell us what 's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go and then ov obviously uh the u _ i _ d _ and the i _ d _ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible <EOS>
for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it , i 'm a excellent project manager . <EOS> um . <EOS> i 'm marty , i 'm sarah , and i 'm the marketing manager or something . <EOS> i 'm ron . <EOS> and i am the user interface designer . <EOS> i 'm nathan , <EOS>
uh project finance . <EOS> what we 're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five euros . <EOS> um . <EOS> <other> the profit aims to make fifty million euros on it . <EOS> eur internationally . <EOS> um but we wan na try to make it for twelve fifty . <EOS>
i need you to tell us what um <other> we what the user 's gon na want . <EOS> um <other> u _ i _ d _ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there um <other> and i 'd like the um industrial designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it . <EOS>
one of the things i i was gon na mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably . <EOS> we ca n't kind of build it into other uh products . <EOS> for instance like a mobile phone or something like that . <EOS> maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . <EOS> does anybody have any initial ideas ? <EOS> as soon as you said that i was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door but i 'm thinking i 'm thinking kind of p _ d _ a _ uh design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things . <EOS> maybe like an l _ like a touch screen type of remote ? <EOS> i think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , i think , it would n't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote . <EOS> cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that you could place something else and it makes the remote page . <EOS> so we 'll have to be careful of exactly who we 're marketing this to , <EOS>
i 'm gon na put these initial ideas that we 've got in the um <other> project documents , <EOS>
um <other> and i 'd like the um industrial designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it . <EOS>
i need you to tell us what um <other> we what the user 's gon na want . <EOS>
um <other> u _ i _ d _ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there <EOS>
i 'm gon na put these initial ideas that we 've got in the um <other> project documents , <EOS>
one of the things i i was gon na mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably . <EOS> we ca n't kind of build it into other uh products . <EOS> for instance like a mobile phone or something like that . <EOS> maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . <EOS>
i 'm just gon na go over real quickly um some news i 've just got from the board on how we 're supposed to do with this um <other> remote control . <EOS> and then i 'm gon na turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you 've found and then we 'll have a bit of discussion . <EOS> what i 've just found out from the board but it needs to be television only . <EOS> we 're not doing d _ v _ d _ , um it also needs to have the company colours included in it . <EOS> that 's red and black . <EOS> and it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it 's , we put fashion in electronics . <EOS> um and no teletext . <EOS> i 'm not sure what teletext is so we do n't wan na include that um in this particular design . <EOS> <other> for reasons that i do n't really know . <EOS> but it 's the board so there you go . <EOS> given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we 'll discuss it later <EOS>
i 'm gon na turn over to the industrial designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation we 're gon na have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . <EOS> um remote control works as follows . <EOS> um sends message to another system , there 's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there 's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . <EOS> a user interface controls the chip , basically that 's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . <EOS> and uh i found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . <EOS> and too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . <EOS> um too much metal is used sometimes and there 's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire just think of those lawsuits , that 'd be really bad . <EOS> therefore i suggest primarily plastic construction . <EOS> um , components . <EOS> just some ideas that i had , um , energy source , it 's kinda hip to be eco friendly so i thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . <EOS> um the user interface , since we ca n't use metal i was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic . <EOS> the chip , um , silicon based chip i do n't really see any way around that , um , the sender well i 'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , uh pal and n _ t _ s _ c _ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range . <EOS> um personal preferences , i really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , which adm admittedly is gon na come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value , <other> is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice , yeah that should n't be a problem . <EOS>
<other> um if next we can have the um user interface developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that 'd be great as well . <EOS> here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . <EOS> uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that 's no problem . <EOS> um basically wan na send messages uh to a television set . <EOS> um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , some of the other things i found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we ca n't quite see my red there very well but uh this remote control has many functions but it uh it is quite complicated and most users will find it uh find that they wo n't use most of the functions because they do n't know how to use them and do n't wan na take the time to learn how to do it . <EOS> um . <EOS> another remote control , slightly different , it 's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions , um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . <EOS> um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it 's also quite boring . <EOS> my personal preferences . <EOS> <laugh> revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control . <EOS> um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with . <EOS> um . <EOS> just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face <EOS>
i was looking through some marketing reports that we 've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people <other> use t _ v _ remotes and see what it is that they 're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they do n't about their general t _ v _ remote control practices . <EOS> um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody 's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , the majority of the time that 's all that 's going on , for some people they 're important , the other functions happen , but the primary uses are really really basic . <EOS> um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public 's use , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they do n't know what to do with . <EOS> <other> and um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . <EOS> and then they ca n't find it in the room . <EOS> so i think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . <EOS> <other> um there 's also a survey about what they liked about remotes , and pretty much they all think they 're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . <EOS> i do n't know if that 's something we 're ready to look into technically , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic 's obviously the one that 's gon na keep growing , um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are <EOS>
i think we 've covered most of these important questions through this um <other> through you guys 's presentations um <other> we 've got uh y the industrial designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . <EOS> <other> um sarah , she 's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , <other> um so do we wan na go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , if we 're gon na go for a sleek look i mean we are putting the fashion in electronics <cough> um . <EOS> <laugh> <other> we 're not catering to the pensioners of the world i do n't think so . <EOS> so maybe this we should look into this younger demographic . <EOS> <other> uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we 're constrained to plastics we 've got this idea , ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it 's looking um , this voice operation thing is i think is a good idea um assuming that it 's doable , um at least for the basic controls , you ca n't say record alias tonight at seven p _ m _ but we might be able to say um <other> volume up . <EOS> i think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology . <EOS> with a simple command like locate . <EOS> and then it could start to beep the difficulty wh would be in um i think like i you could n't speak into the remote that you 're trying to find . <EOS> but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that 's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too . <EOS> a little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television . <EOS> but yeah i like that , i like that , the voice recognition for the paging system . <EOS> <cough> the other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control . <EOS> so it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market . <EOS> and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not . <EOS> are we still thinking about this screen if we 're gon na do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that 's an option technically right now to that ? <EOS> i 've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not , they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point . <EOS> especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , 's definitely an option technically . <EOS> menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things got ta wonder though , if we 're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gon na be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty euro you know goal for selling these things . <EOS> it seems like , we 're not gon na be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . <EOS> i guess we 'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development i 'm seeing that we 're gon na just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but basically we 'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control . <EOS> um i think this voice recognition thing is a we 've got a market for it i guess we 've c we 've touched on most of this . <EOS> the idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates . <EOS> um . <EOS> we 'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ? <EOS> i think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable . <EOS> we could have the casing , the the face plates . <EOS> <other> we have to ask whether we 're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? <EOS> off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that would n't really go anywhere . <EOS> in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , whereas you 're just sit at home , we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth , um . <EOS> but yeah we will have to evaluate what 's most important . <EOS> have we confirmed that we 're gon na go ahead with a uh touch screen um yeah i think that would be best . <EOS> based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let 's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic with a touch screen for the basic functions . <EOS> <other> um let 's provisionally let 's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . <EOS> it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls . <EOS> <other> yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost . <EOS> 'cause it would have a docking base ? <EOS> but then again that costs as well . <EOS> these new lithium batteries they last twenty years <other> even with the touch screen ? <EOS> i ca n't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple um <other> it 's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um even if you ca n't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that 's just a i guess another infrared signal to the remote control to emit some kind of paging . <EOS> just a beep . <EOS> since we 're doing uh touch screen , do we wan na look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? <EOS> or is it just gon na be one touch screen for everybody . <EOS> what what would be on that touch screen ? <EOS> 'cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um logo or something or motto , it 's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you 'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control . <EOS> think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen . <EOS> it 'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it 's loading i 'm wondering how we 're gon na get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device . <EOS> comes on every time you turn it on and then that 's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something i think . <EOS> it seems like it would suffice to have just the r _ r _ on there . <EOS> people are n't gon na want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on . <EOS> they just want it to be on and ready to go . <EOS> but then again who wants to turn on a remote control . <EOS> all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on . <EOS> or go into like a dormant mode . <EOS>
i 'm gon na save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . <EOS> and the minutes that i 'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference . <EOS> i 've put my files in the shared folder as well . <EOS>
um <other> we 've got uh y the industrial designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . <EOS> <other> um think we 're constrained to plastics based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let 's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased <EOS>
so maybe this we should look into this younger demographic . <EOS> i 'm seeing that we 're gon na just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , <EOS>
have we confirmed that we 're gon na go ahead with a uh touch screen um yeah i think that would be best . <EOS> with a touch screen for the basic functions . <EOS> <other> um <EOS>
i think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology . <EOS> with a simple command like locate . <EOS> and then it could start to beep but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that 's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too . <EOS> a little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television . <EOS> even if you ca n't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that 's just a i guess another infrared signal to the remote control to emit some kind of paging . <EOS> just a beep . <EOS>
it 'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it 's loading i 'm wondering how we 're gon na get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device . <EOS> comes on every time you turn it on and then that 's it it seems like it would suffice to have just the r _ r _ on there . <EOS>
got ta wonder though , if we 're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gon na be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty euro you know goal for selling these things . <EOS> it seems like , we 're not gon na be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . <EOS> i guess we 'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development we 'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ? <EOS> but then again that costs as well . <EOS>
basically what i 'm gon na have to talk to you about today is um component design and it 's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do basically what i 'm gon na be doing is talking to you about that . <EOS> um , components of a remote control , okay . <EOS> we 've already kind of gone over this but we 're gon na have to get into more detail energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . <EOS> our manufacturer did n't say anything about lithium if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . <EOS> um , and also there 's a kinetic energy possibility . <EOS> basically , it 's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . <EOS> but i do n't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen . <EOS> um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . <EOS> um and then as far as the way it 's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably do n't wan na do , curved or very sexy double curved . <EOS> what kind of th thickness are we looking at ? <EOS> um , i imagine that we could specify . <EOS> um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we 'd have to use more chips , and if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we 'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons are n't compatible with that . <EOS> touch screen equals many chips which equals many euro . <EOS> um , one thing that i noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . <EOS> so you notice when you push a button on a remote you ca n't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote uh one thing that i thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . <EOS> so you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it . <EOS> is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like i am sure that we could do that . <EOS> just as a fun gimmick . <EOS> um , and then on to the circuit board that we 're gon na use , also known as the chip . <EOS> uh , we really do n't have any way around the t _ a _ one one eight three five . <EOS> we 're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ? <EOS> i 'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ? <EOS> um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we 'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . <EOS> my personal preference is uh i think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . <EOS> uh , i like the idea of the visible light signalling , and uh i was thinking about i was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . <EOS>
um , basically i was looking at what 's going on in the remote control market right now and what 's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what 's what 's trendy , what 's new , what 's happening . <EOS> um , remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting um that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . <EOS> um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing . <EOS> now i 'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but i think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , different skin options , and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , though if we can get around to getting piloting , i thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something as far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case , it has a consistency of those stress balls . <EOS> i think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . <EOS> but then if the touch screen thing is n't gon na work out for us that 's really a non-issue . <EOS>
like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , different skin options , though if we can get around to getting piloting , i thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something as far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case , it has a consistency of those stress balls . <EOS> i think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . <EOS> i like the idea of of rubber too i think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , <EOS>
interface concept by your faithful user interface designer . <EOS> so yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive . <EOS> uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . <EOS> here 's a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today . <EOS> the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . <EOS> uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . <EOS> our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses . <EOS> like you could say good morning uh remote control and it 'll say in a sexy female voice , good morning joe . <EOS> um . <EOS> um , another concept is what uh apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh l _ c _ display like on the uh ipod um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern a bit bulky , a bit crazy , i do n't think that 's we 're necessarily going for . <EOS> and uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh i again if we go with touch screen i do n't think that 's a big issue . <EOS> um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here . <EOS> uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose . <EOS> so i i mean my ideas here and kind of where i think we 're heading is something slightly larger than a regular ipod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those do n't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . <EOS> um , and of course our voice command system which i 've talked a little bit about already and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . <EOS> and uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea <EOS>
now we kind of have to come to some decisions , and all three of us can have a chat about it . <EOS> um . <EOS>
based on what nathan presented as far as the um <other> various costs and benefits um i think , i dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ? <EOS> i think it 's our most marketable feature but can we really afford it my estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it 's gon na cost us upwards of seventeen fifty euro per remote , that 's just an estimate though . <EOS> it 's just , it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we 're gon na have to increase the price to make money . <EOS> where do you guys come up with these numbers ? <EOS> that 's just off the top of my head , i mean if you 're gon na pay for an expensive high class remote , you 're gon na expect it to do something we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that 's something that we can have finance deal with . <EOS> um , i say that we provisionally go with the touch screen and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper . <EOS> let 's let 's say that okay so the touch screen will be our <other> um <other> our main selling point here . <EOS> i mean i think that we really have two main selling points , 'cause with voice recognition i think that our casing and the voice recognition i mean , <other> if if we 're looking at bottom line , now we 're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , i think we might have to drop the voice rec . <EOS> i think we 'd have to decide between 'em definitely . <EOS> to be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , i mean we 've we 've come up with this , with this new voice what do you think on it nathan ? <EOS> about the voice rec ? <EOS> i think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up i mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say . <EOS> and they said they wanted voice recognition . <EOS> course , maybe they had n't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition does having both really up our costs ? <EOS> <other> i ca n't see how it would n't , so we have to pick between one of the two . <EOS> um . <EOS> we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . <EOS> but uh i i i personally would tend to another direction but if that 's what 's gon na sell i think that 's what we need to go with i think the voice recognition is simpler , is it cheaper to do the v _ r _ or to do the uh touch screen ? <EOS> um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition we 're not gon na have to do as much design work more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . <EOS> we will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition . <EOS>
you discussed either a lithium or a solar power . <EOS> would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? <EOS> um , the solar power definitely would be but i think just to keep people from getting annoyed , we should install a small backup battery . <EOS> we ca n't guarantee sunlight everywhere it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , and you know how those those do n't really require that much light , i 'm willing to agree with everything that 's been said . <EOS>
if we 're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something . <EOS> why , why moving away from hand-held , why ? <EOS> if you do n't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point . <EOS> if it 's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . <EOS> do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always gon na wan na use the voice recognition i think we 're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , we have to have buttons on it too as well . <EOS> i mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing , it could still have the basic buttons on it . <EOS> and maybe a menu button and so forth , use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . <EOS> i 'm thinking of the airport portal , you know like that little pod looking thing ? <EOS> i 'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um terracotta bowl or something . <EOS> <laugh> <EOS>
and the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel , if you feel the the tip on this pen it 's a bit gives just a bit . <EOS> something where it 's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it . <EOS> just kind of the squishy feel . <EOS> let 's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control . <EOS>
although i 'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like maybe have menu things . <EOS> if , if we 're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things . <EOS> we could do a slide or a compartment , or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um like on a d _ v _ d _ player . <EOS> we need to figure out what kind of buttons we 're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? <EOS> rubber buttons ? <EOS> um it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber 'cause since we 're probably gon na be using some kind of um <other> rubber for the outside case i think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons have we decided that we are gon na go with different style cases for different people ? <EOS> because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but obviously having more cases also costs more you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , i do n't know , olive green or something . <EOS> that would n't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing . <EOS> let 's work on <other> uh multiple case colours . <EOS>
um i need you guys to work together on making a prototype , <other> um <laugh> using um <other> prototype building materials um <laugh> . <EOS>
nathan , i 'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . <EOS> <other> <EOS>
and um ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . <EOS>
um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . <EOS>
we will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition . <EOS>
let 's work on <other> uh multiple case colours . <EOS>
if we 're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control if it 's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . <EOS> stick with the same kind of kinda yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . <EOS>
and the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel , just kind of the squishy feel . <EOS>
um , the solar power definitely would be but i think just to keep people from getting annoyed , we should install a small backup battery . <EOS>
touch screen equals many chips which equals many euro . <EOS> but can we really afford it my estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it 's gon na cost us upwards of seventeen fifty euro per remote , that 's just an estimate though . <EOS> it 's just , it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we 're gon na have to increase the price to make money . <EOS> where do you guys come up with these numbers ? <EOS> that 's just off the top of my head , um , i say that we provisionally go with the touch screen i mean , <other> if if we 're looking at bottom line , now we 're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , i think we might have to drop the voice rec . <EOS> i think we 'd have to decide between 'em definitely . <EOS> i think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up does having both really up our costs ? <EOS> <other> i ca n't see how it would n't , so we have to pick between one of the two . <EOS> um . <EOS> we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . <EOS> um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , <EOS>
that 's just off the top of my head , where do you guys come up with these numbers ? <EOS> um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , sorry about the uh lack of information on cost , i just have n't been provided that information by our manufacturers <EOS>
here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype i finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my it means i 'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . <EOS> um <other> just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that <other> um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the industrial designer , uh or from nathan , and ron and from sarah about what we can do here and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , i _ e _ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you did n't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . <EOS> that would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . <EOS> the u _ i _ d _ and the i _ d _ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . <EOS>
we have assembled our prototype , um . <EOS> um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . <EOS> some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . <EOS> this is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . <EOS> and then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . <EOS> and provides a very nice aesthetic when it 's all put away , um . <EOS> as far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , of course , if that 's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . <EOS> um . <EOS> we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we 've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here um f we call it fruity of course that 's uh interchangeable and uh i think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there . <EOS> um . <EOS> so that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . <EOS> if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , clearly there 's gon na be some more colours and what not available . <EOS> um i worried about the materials , uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating it 's not gon na break like some types of plastic that 's dropped . <EOS> and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . <EOS> i dunno if you noticed , but i wrote the uh the company 's name on the telephone screen , um , but i think that 's i think that sums up the main features of our of the remote , um , did we come in under budget ? <EOS> to put this into um production , we 're looking at about it was twelve fifty euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . <EOS> um obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button so even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition , in a lot of ways it 's just a simple remote <other> did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ? <EOS> on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console and uh i think it 's nicely designed into the into the overall look . <EOS> um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with . <EOS> and um , i think that uh has given a proven um <other> ease of use and what not . <EOS> and uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so . <EOS> <other> do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? <EOS> covers ? <EOS> or are those ones gon na be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? <EOS> we did n't quite have enough material uh <laugh> . <EOS> as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it 'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that . <EOS> we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look um materials we also continued on with the ideas that f following uh apple 's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green . <EOS> it 's not it 's not quite a a face plate , it 's more like a pseudo-face plate it locks into place such that , you know , it 's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wan na go the other way it 's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way very cool , nice job . <EOS>
<other> um , <other> what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . <EOS> um the trouble is i was just given this by finance . <EOS> um , it 's a spreadsheet of the parts <cough> and i 've just tentatively put in what it 's going to look like um . <EOS> if we can just itemize what 's in here , it 's a solar cell thing with a back-up battery ? <EOS> the voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> <other> it 's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time um and the case , it 's more of a single-curved case , <other> um and we 've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . <EOS> um . <EOS> push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we 've got two push button interfaces and s i guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , 'cause it i it is very unconventional , m come in at sixteen ? <EOS> a bit over budget , um . <EOS> what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells <other> um or take out the back-up battery . <EOS> uh i think that uh if we 're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , i mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see but you 're gon na have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time and saying oh look my remote is n't working i think in the long-run it 's better to keep the battery , i mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we 're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we 're actually coming in under budget i mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing i mean that 's what sets us apart perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game and the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , i 'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , but i h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here and uh you know i think i think that i think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . <EOS> i think unfortunately that 's our best option . <EOS> 'cause we ca n't remove the push buttons um , nor would changing the case materials . <EOS> got ta do what you got ta do . <EOS> i think that was a good compromise you brought forward sarah . <EOS>
i guess now we just go to the project evaluation basically i was just evaluating um <other> from what we know of how our product 's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they 're important . <EOS> um so i was looking at basic design things , are technologies up to where we hoped they would be is the design what we wanted it to do ? <EOS> and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? <EOS> um . <EOS> does it respond to voice recognition ? <EOS> um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting and overall , in general , it looks like it 's coming up to par . <EOS> but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . <EOS> so i think overall we 're headed in the right direction . <EOS> they like that spongy feel . <EOS> i think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , i am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel <EOS>
i got this slide from the coach this one 's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . <EOS> um so i guess we are going to discuss um <laugh> our project process um and i 'm not sure what it 's connected to . <EOS> i guess this is the point where we go um <other> uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , i guess , um . <EOS> as in within the team or ? <EOS> i think so yeah . <EOS> are we considering these points here ? <EOS> i think they 're starting blocks i think in general , for a day 's worth of work we actually were <laugh> relatively productive , considering the little amount of input we had going in . <EOS> um , and the technology has definitely been a help , it 's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . <EOS> we did n't use the whiteboard at all . <EOS> no , no whiteboard . <EOS> <laugh> and i feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , does n't really matter . <EOS> um , also had i not been intrigued about the pen , i do n't think i woulda used it at all , i did n't write barely anything . <EOS> was pretty cool tack though . <EOS> i am disappointed i did n't get a note back from my personal coach . <EOS> <laugh> attempts to contact coach ineffective <laugh> . <EOS> n i think there was a lot of room for creativity , we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um . <EOS> and even then we did get a decent product turned out although it 's not everything we wanted it to be . <EOS> i think , yeah re i thought it was like really creative actually , i mean . <EOS> <laugh> i think the teamwork was good as well . <EOS> my one my one criticism is that we did n't have enough colours to work with , you could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours . <EOS> what did you guys think about the the the roles ? <EOS> i think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . <EOS> at the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , though i did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . <EOS> but i did n't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . <EOS> nothing , i did n't even get an email , i feel like that was slightly lacking when i was reporting about what each of us was doing i was often confused as to what you were doing <laugh> um and then i also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was and then in the end i think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , i think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the powerpoint slides already put together for you yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot . <EOS> 'cause if we did n't have that there 's no way we could have got all that done in time . <EOS> and i think your leadership was quite good . <EOS> it was really good yeah . <EOS> i did get i i felt like i got way too into it . <EOS> but you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ? <EOS> except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? <EOS> i think so . <EOS> no i , no i dunno , i d i i dunno , i mean other than minor discussion at meetings there was n't except for the actual building , but i feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board and this would have been six months ' worth of work , not like three hours ' worth of meetings . <EOS> is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? <EOS> i did n't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , i was afraid i was gon na break something actually . <EOS> and each time you get up it 's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . <EOS> i dunno what i woulda shown on that board . <EOS> it 's just like the paper i do n't know what i really needed the paper for . <EOS> usually i would do a lot more doodling too i felt like i needed to be professional i i 'm curious about what the de-briefing is gon na be like . <EOS> is this all we need to get through ? <EOS> i 'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . <EOS> it did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ? <EOS> that 's the thing i got i in the email i got this powerpoint file i did n't change this one at all . <EOS> any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? <EOS> <laugh> uh i think they still do their job . <EOS> how much can you do with a remote control ? <EOS> how long was our meeting supposed to be ? <EOS> i i i mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval , um . <EOS> i dunno about you guys but i felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing . <EOS> at the beginning it started out and i felt actually like under pressure and i was like had like all this brainstorming i was doing and then suddenly i was like well it 's just another two minute presentation that you guys do n't really care about anyway like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it definitely when <other> when i first filled out the questionnaire i was marking it probably higher in terms of how much i had to how much i stressed over it and then by the time i got to the last one i was like , you know , not very much . <EOS> think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what 's given to you into your presentation every single one i a all the presentations i either added slides or edited 'em . <EOS> my slides were all blank , they 'd have a title maybe with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class . <EOS> an interesting day all in all i would say . <EOS> it seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . <EOS> you know from the the the basics to the conce although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , i do n't think i really understood like the concept . <EOS>
we 've established that the costs were n't really within budget , we did the project evaluation based on um <other> sarah 's evaluation of on off switches though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general . <EOS> and it 's all recorded , i 'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so i 'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like uh i will save this into the project documents . <EOS> you guys ready to celebrate ? <EOS> that 's our last step . <EOS> celebration . <EOS> i guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . <EOS> i guess we 'll call that a a doner . <EOS> that 's the end of the meeting . <EOS>
i 'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so i 'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like <EOS>
what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells but honestly if we cut that one piece out we 're actually coming in under budget and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . <EOS> i think unfortunately that 's our best option . <EOS>
as far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , <EOS>
but we just went for a classic rubber button <EOS>
though i did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . <EOS> but i did n't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . <EOS> nothing , i did n't even get an email , i feel like that was slightly lacking when i was reporting about what each of us was doing i was often confused as to what you were doing <laugh> um and then i also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was and then in the end i think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , <EOS>
we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um . <EOS>
hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting um for our new product that we 're gon na be designing . <EOS> um i 'm mandy and i 'm the project manager . <EOS> and i know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . <EOS> okay , here is our agenda for this meeting . <EOS> um tool training , we 're going to , i guess , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . <EOS> um we 're gon na make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting . <EOS> we 're gon na make a new remote control that 's um original , trendy and also user-friendly . <EOS> we 're gon na have discuss the functional design first , <other> how is it gon na be used , what 's the actual goal here , it has to operate t _ v _ , blah blah blah . <EOS> and we 're going to do individual work on that and then meet . <EOS> same thing with conceptual design . <EOS> and then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . <EOS>
first we 're gon na start off by using our tools . <EOS> i think we should forgo the whiteboard since we ca n't actually see what we 're writing . <EOS> um right now so we 're all gon na draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal . <EOS>
